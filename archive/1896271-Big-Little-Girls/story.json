She poured the last remaining potato chips in the bag into her awaiting mouth and gobbled them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you see, Jennifer is rather big for her age. In fact she's <i>VERY</i> big for her age. Her big round belly rose up and down with each breath she took as she lay sprawled out on the sofa. Her pink shirt failed to cover it since any shirts made for a girl her age were much too small. She tugged down on it in another futile attempt to make it fit, but as always, to no avail. The shorts she was wearing were very snug on her plump thighs, sticking into them but not painfully so.<br>\r\nWhat baffled Jennifer was that these clothes fit perfectly about a week ago. She was rather oblivious that she was growing out quicker than she was up. Her doting parents are partly to blame for it, giving her lots of sweets and junk food as a toddler to make her happy. She soon developed a love for it, which became almost like an addiction. Now the likes of chocolate, ice cream, pizza and fries are the only things she would eat with glee. What didn't help the matter was Jennifer's appetite, which seemed to be nearly bottomless!<br>\r\nHer parents quickly noticed her growth and would swiftly add vegetables to her menu, which Jennifer would either leave on her plate or eat slowly and reluctantly. She didn't want those boring old greens, give her a nice big chocolate cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer rolled off the sofa and landed on her feet, like a very overfed kitten. She walked (well, more specifically, waddled) to the kitchen, putting the empty packet in the bin and opened up the pantry, instinctively taking out a box of chocolate-chip cookies for her next course.<br>\r\n\"Jennifer!\" A familiar voice made her jump. She turned around to see her mother, Anne, looking down at her, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\" She squeaked.<br>\r\n\"Were you going to take that whole box?\" She asked more softly.<br>\r\n\"...no?\" She lied.<br>\r\nAnne shook her head. \"No point in lying, we both know you were going to.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry!\" Jennifer cried in a vain attempt to defend herself.<br>\r\n\"Jenny, you're always hungry,\" her mother sighed, \"...fine, but that's your last snack until dinner.\"<br>\r\nA huge smile appeared on Jennifer's puffy face as she waddled triumphantly to the sofa with the box. Success!<br>\r\nPlopping her big butt back on the sofa, she opened the box and began greedily cramming cookies into her mouth, like she hadn't been fed in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne sighed softly, running a hand through her hair in thought as she watched her ballooning daughter. What was she going to do about that girl's eating?</span></div></div>",

Being who she was though, Jenny very quickly finished the entire box within just a few minutes. \u201cMmn...huh?\u201d she said as her thick fingers reached the bottom of the box. \u201cAww...no more...\u201d She held the box above her head and shook it to get the last few crumbs. Jenny looked down at her big belly. It looked like she had eaten a basketball, but is was all fat; it jiggled and wobbled if she poked it. She was about to get up for more when she remembered the talk she had with her Mom. She said that Jenny couldn't have any more snacks til after dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jennifer's belly was growling for more, and it wanted food *now.* \u201cUgh...\u201d she moaned, putting her hands on her fat tummy.\u201dI'm so hungry...oof...maybe she won't find me...what if she does, and then makes dinner smaller?\u201d Jenny sighed, rubbing her poor, empty tummy. She could already smell her Mom's cooking, but she wasn't sure what it was. But her stomach was growling for *anything* that could fill it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer, dinner is ready!\u201d called Anne. Jennifer didn't need to be asked twice; within seconds she was running to the kitchen as fast as she could, her gut bouncing and wobbling. \u201cGood girl, you managed to wait the whole time without snacking!\u201d Anna said. \u201cIt was tough though, but I did...\u201d said Jenny nervously. \u201cAhh, well sorry about that, I just don't want you getting *too* big...\u201d Anne's stomach let out a little \u201cRrrrgh...\u201d making her blush a little. \u201cWell, let's eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what are they eating?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna slid a plate onto the table before Jennifer, and the hungry young girl tucked in immediately into the roast chicken and bacon she'd spent so long preparing. As she poured out two glasses of soda, she wondered why she bothered spending long preparing meals; it often seemed like her daughter ate it too fast to notice the taste anyway. Maybe she should just order take-outs in future; it would make things easier, for sure. <br>\r\nAcross the table from her, Jennifer was eating at an impressive rate. The plate of food she had placed on the table would have been a large, filling meal for most 8 year olds; to Jenny, however, it didn't even come close to filling her gut, stretched as it was from years of constant snacks and oversized meals. Anna, despite her good intentions, didn't know much about nutrition, and wasn't very good at saying no. Whenever Jennifer had cried as a toddler, her first resort was always to try and feed her, and later on the expanding girl had discovered that, if she whined enough, she could get her mom to give her nearly anything. Anna had also enforced a rigid 'clean plates' policy for years, and several times had fed her daughter way past her capacity in order to never \"waste\" food.<br>\r\nAs a result, Jennifer was soon pushing away her plate away from her, everything eaten except the untouched pile of broccoli in the corner.<br>\r\n\"More please!\" She said, mouth still full. Anna glanced at the vegetables left on the plate.<br>\r\n\"Eat them first, then you can have seconds.\" <br>\r\n\"But mom, I don't like them.\" The chubby 8 year old complained.<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, you're too old now for this nonsense. Just eat the broccoli, then you can have some more.\" Anna tried to sound firm.<br>\r\n\"But I hate broccoli! Can't I have seconds anyway mommy, pleeeease?\" <br>\r\nAnna rubbed her temples; she was too tired for this.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She relented, and took Jennifer's plate. Over at the counter, she piled another large portion onto the cheap piece of crockery, then brought it back and put it on the table. The moment it was within reach, Jennifer began stuffing food into her mouth so fast it was as if she thought it would vanish if it wasn't finished that very minute. As she watched her daughter gorge, Anna suddenly remembered something.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jenny, you've got an appointment with the doctor tomorrow after school, okay?\" <br>\r\nJennifer looked quizzically at her mom, but couldn't speak due to her mouth being full of food.<br>\r\n\"It's only a checkup; the nice doctor will just look you over and make sure you aren't sick at all, and then we can come home.\"<br>\r\nWith an effort, Jennifer swallowed her mouthful of food and looked up.<br>\r\n\"Why do I need a checkup?\" She asked, frowning.</span></div></div>",

She tried to say something, but it came out muffled and unintelligible.<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" Anna gave her an expectant look, \"what've I told you about talking with your mouth full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer swallowed, again with some effort. \"You mean it?!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetheart,\" Anna chuckled, amused by her child's excitement, then added with a smirk, \"if you eat <i>one</i> piece of broccoli, you can even get ice cream.\"<br>\r\nJennifer's grin quickly inverted, noticing that the pile of broccoli was still there. \"But moooom-\"<br>\r\n\"Just <i>one</i> little piece, Jenny,\" her mother insisted, adding a little sternness to her voice, \"and you won't have to eat it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a long sigh of annoyance, the greedy girl dug through the pile with her plump little fingers, and picked up the tiniest piece of broccoli she could find. It looked just small enough to swallow without chewing, she thought.<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, she popped the vegetable in, struggling to swallow it whole but just managing.<br>\r\n\"Blech!\" She grunted, taking a sip of her drink to try and wash out the awful taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, Jenny!\" Anna smiled proudly, stroking her daughter's hair, \"see, I told you it wasn't so bad!\"<br>\r\nThe chubby girl just pouted cutely, puffing out her already quite round cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Now now, you're too old for tantrums,\" Anna chuckled, \"why don't you go change into your pyjamas now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small nod, followed by a tiny burp, Jennifer, slid off the kitchen chair and slowly waddled out of the kitchen. Anna listened as her ponderous footfalls thudded heavily further and further up the stairs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer stared belatedly at the neatly folded pile that was her gym kit. Of all her lessons, gym was the one she detested most by far, and it was in this uniform she'd spent dozens of miserable hours huffing and puffing around the hall with the rest of her classmates, trying fruitlessly to keep up. Although there were other chubby kids in her class, she was least fit by far so even they left her behind after a while.<br>\r\nStill, there was no way out of it; she'd tried skipping gym before, by pretending to be unwell or injured, but Ms Carroll always saw straight through her clumsy lies. There was to be no escape...<br>\r\nReluctantly, Jennifer began to change into the kit, stripping down into her underwear as all the other girls in her class did the same around her. As she squeezed out of her tight school skirt,  she glanced around at the other kids in the changing room. Although many of them weren't exactly skinny, none of them were as chubby as her. Jennifer didn't notice that of course; she was just checking she wasn't, as so often happened, getting left behind. Indeed, despite her corpulence Jennifer shared her mom's delusion that she was just a tad pudgy. Even when it was obvious she was the fattest in the room, like now, she was blessed with blissful ignorance.<br>\r\nIn any case, she had to put on her kit. She grabbed the top and pulled it on, then tried to adjust it so it was comfortable. That, however, was impossible; it was at several sizes too small, and though the fabric was quite stretchy it was strained to its limit over her swollen belly and developing chest. It was uncomfortably tight no matter how much she tugged or shifted, the thin fabric clinging to each roll and fold of her expansive midriff.<br>\r\nEventually giving up on trying to get the top comfy, Jennifer turned her attention to the shorts. She tugged them on with some difficulty, for although they were elasticated they were so undersized that the waistband was painfully tight anyway. Sighing, she rubbed at where they were already beginning to chafe, wishing that her kit would just fit for once; all the other kids' were fine, why was hers too small? The top wasn't even big enough to cover her belly, leaving a slice of pale fat visible between the two halves of her kit.<br>\r\nShe followed the rest of the girls out of the changing rooms and into the gym hall, feeling her top already beginning to ride up with the movement. She tugged it down again irritably, and looked around. There was a big pile of bright plastic ropes in the centre of the room, all tangled together in a rainbow coloured heap. <br>\r\n\"Looks like we're doing jump rope then.\" Said a glum voice in Jennifer's ear. She turned and saw her friend Katrina standing just behind her.<br>\r\n\"That's not too bad.\" Said Jennifer. \"I'm good at jump rope.\" <br>\r\nKatrina looked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought you hated all exercise.\"<br>\r\n\"I just hate getting out of breath.\" She said. \"I don't hate exercise on its own.\"<br>\r\n\"But won't jump rope make you out of breath?\" Pointed out Katrina, frowning.<br>\r\nJennifer was stumped.<br>\r\n\"I... maybe? I guess so.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like any exercise, tiring or not.\" Stated Katrina boldly.<br>\r\n\"I can see that, young lady.\" Without a sound, Ms Carroll had appeared directly behind the dark haired girl, eyes flashing menacingly. Katrina jumped half a foot into the air, then span around to face her teacher.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"S-sorry, Ms Carroll,\" Katrina stammered, \"I was just kidding!\" She managed a nervous grin; as brave as she was, she wasn't quite ready to take on a teacher. Especially since she, and her classmates, know full well that an angry Ms Carroll is <i>not</i> fun to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Ms Carroll's menacing expression softened as a smile formed. \"No need to apologise, so was I!\" The teacher chuckled as Katrina's plump cheeks reddened with embarrassment. Even Jennifer couldn't help but giggle; she always thought Ms Carroll was pretty funny. <br>\r\n\"Though, you may like today's exercise,\" she explained to the girls, \"get lined up with your friends and I'll explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched as their classmates were beginning to assemble along the gym wall, talking quietly amongst each other about this and that. They waddled over to join them, taking a space on the end. <br>\r\nThe other pudgy kids had their stomachs jutting out from the line in varying lengths, but Jennifer's stuck out the furthest by far. She attempted to tug her top down over her stomach again, but it simply just rolled back up in seconds. She huffed softly and pinched the side of her shorts' waistband, tugging it a bit to release some of the chafing. And while it did help temporarily, letting go simply caused the strain to return with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kids, quiet down now,\" Ms Carroll spoke up, the class slowly going silent and giving her their attention, \"Today's class will be nice and simple; I want you all to get into pairs, and take turns to count how many skips you can do in two minutes. One skips and the other counts.\" <br>\r\nThe kids nodded and muttered to each other, understanding so far. Katrina just kept a glum frown.<br>\r\n\"I'll be keeping time and telling you when to swap,\" Ms Carroll continued, \"so there won't be any cheating.\" She added with a joking smirk. \"You can pair up with whoever you like, so get into teams and one of you come get a rope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kids scrambled and decided on teams, Jennifer looked over to Katrina with an excited grin.</span></div></div>",

For a moment the other girl just frowned, but then she nodded her head, sighing.<br>\r\n\"Okay. At least with you I might not feel quite so bad.\" She gave a half smile.<br>\r\nJennifer didn't quite understand that comment, but she returned the smile anyway before trotting off to get a jump rope. Soon, the two friends had found an empty patch of floor near the middle of the room and Katrina was ready to take the first turn. Jennifer sat cross legged nearby, ready to start counting once Ms Carroll started the timer. Both girls looked expectantly at their teacher.<br>\r\nAt the side of the room, Ms Carroll stood looking at her watch, enjoying what few elementary school teachers ever achieved from a class; complete, anticipatory silence. She brushed an imaginary speck of dust off her collar,then looked up at the twelve girls in the gym hall.<br>\r\n\"Go!\" She shouted suddenly, and a moment later the room was filled with the excited shouting and counting of children as they all threw themselves enthusiastically into the activity with the careless energy only youth can bring.<br>\r\nWell- all of them but one. <br>\r\n\"Come on Katty! You're not even trying!\" Jennifer yelled over the noise in the room. Katrina glared at her, but the moment she looked up the rope tangled itself around her ankles, causing her to wobble unstably.<br>\r\n\"I am trying!\" She snapped, kicking her feet free and flicking it back behind her again. \"How many am I on?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, about four.\" Jennifer guessed; with all the excitement, she'd forgotten all about counting. <br>\r\nKatrina just groaned and began skipping again, jumping clumsily over the rope twice before tripping yet again. She was breathing hard already, half from unfitness, half from anger.<br>\r\n\"Six.\" Said Jenny, watching her friend close her eyes and breathe deeply, trying to keep her temper.<br>\r\n\"Half way,\" shouted Ms Carroll over the racket, \"Only thirty seconds left!\"<br>\r\nKatrina opened her eyes again and began skipping again, much better than before now. Impressed, Jennifer watched as her friend passed twenty, then thirty skips.<br>\r\n\"And that's time!\" Their teacher yelled from the side. \"Everyone, swap over.\" <br>\r\nImmediately, Katrina shoved the rope into Jennifer's hands and collapsed onto the floor in a heap, gasping and wheezing. Her friend looked down at her, worried.<br>\r\n\"You okay, Katty?\" She asked.<br>\r\nFrom the floor, Katrina nodded, round face red as a fire truck. Her parents owned a gym, but it was obvious their daughter had never visited.<br>\r\n\"Good. Remember to count my skips! You got thirty-two.\"<br>\r\nShe stepped away from the exhausted girl and got ready to begin skipping. She was actually looking forward to this; it had been ages since she'd last tried jump rope, but she remembered being rather good at it. Unbeknownst to her, when she'd last been skipping she'd been carrying about fifteen pounds less fat around her midsection, and had been a lot fitter.<br>\r\n\"Off you go!\" The call came, and they began again. Jennifer flicked the rope round and jumped over it, feeling her belly rise into the air with her, then come bouncing down on landing. Still, she kept going, her chubby body jiggling like jelly with the motion. After only a few skips, she was starting to feel sick; she'd eaten a large breakfast that morning, and her shorts were cutting painfully into her soft stomach. Worse, she was quickly out of breath, the air feeling arid in her lungs as her heart rate increased past resting for the first time that month. <br>\r\nShe began to lose time, and due to her large stomach she couldn't quite see her feet. Suddenly, the rope snagged on her toes and she tripped, almost falling. She sank to her hands and knees, the air rattling in her lungs, head pounding.<br>\r\n\"Thirty seconds!\" She needed to keep going!<br>\r\nHer shirt had ridden up to just below her flabby chest as she skipped, and now she pulled it back down again, wishing distractedly it would just stay in place. She pushed herself back to her feet, knees and ankles twinging with pain at the unaccustomed abuse they were being put through. She slid a finger beneath her waistband, tugging it and relieving the pain for a second, but then she let it snap back into place. She flicked the rope back behind her again, and began skipping again.<br>\r\nShe didn't even remember what happened. Presumably, the rope had caught around her ankles after a late jump. All she knew, however, was that one moment she was jumping rope, and the next minute the ground wasn't where it was meant to be and she was falling. She landed flat on her front, the impact forcing all the air in her lungs out in a great gasp. A millisecond later, her knee cracked down on the wooden tiling with a loud, solid clunk.<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" She heard Ms Carroll yell as she lay dazed on the floor. There was a buzzing in her ears, and everything looked a bit out of focus. It all looked a bit like ice cream, it occurred to her stunned mind. She watched as a vanilla ice cream in a dark chocolate cone hurried over to her. <br>\r\n\"Jennifer! Are you alright?\" Said the dairy product. She blinked twice, and suddenly the ice cream coalesced into the far less appetising form of Ms Carroll. And along with the recognition, like a scruffy guest who turned up uninvited to a dinner party, came the pain.</span></div></div>",

In truth, the fall hadn\u2019t been that bad; her knee hurt quite a lot, but what had been a sharp pain was fading away to an ache by now, and though she had winded herself that wore off quickly.<br>\r\nMore embarrassing was the state of her clothing. Apparently, the sudden strain of her falling had been too much for her overtaxed gym shorts, leaving them to split all the way down one side. She hadn\u2019t even noticed until Ms Carroll, with the help of a couple of other girls, had helped her onto the bench and she\u2019d glanced down. For half a second, she\u2019d thought that she was naked besides her gym top; from her point of view, her crotch was hidden beneath her bulging belly, and she couldn\u2019t see her shorts. It was only when sucked her stomach in and leaned forwards that she realised she was indeed still wearing her underwear, and spotted the tattered remains of her shorts around one ankle. Once she\u2019d checked that Jennifer was okay, Ms Carroll had rushed off to find the school nurse, draping her jacket over the injured girl\u2019s legs to preserve some of her modesty. The moment she had left the room, all the other girls had crowded around Jenny.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay Jen?\u201d Asked Katrina, concern written across her rounded face. \u201cHow\u2019s your knee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright now.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat was my score?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, eleven.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cEleven!\u201d The exclamation came from Kanya, one of the other girls. \u201cC\u2019mon, really?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI fell down.\u201d Jennifer defended herself. She didn\u2019t get on well with the Thai girl, often arguing over little things. Still, they were hardly enemies or anything.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I managed to do forty in that time. We all had to stop when you tripped up like an idiot, remember?\u201d <br>\r\nJennifer glared at the other girl, but then looked away. She was too tired to be arguing about this right now\u2026<br>\r\nSuddenly the hall doors burst open and Miss Villeneuve, the school nurse, hurried in. She glanced around, spotted Jennifer and came over to her, limping heavily. It was one of the funniest things in the world, at least according to the younger students, that the school nurse had a faulty leg. Occasionally, a student got up the courage to ask what had happened to it, but the answers they got back were always different. One week it had been broken in a car accident, the next she\u2019d had Polio, whatever that was. It was one of the school\u2019s greatest mysteries.<br>\r\nMiss Villeneuve came to a stop before Jennifer, and smiled crookedly.<br>\r\n\u201cJenny. Hurt yourself again?\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time the nurse had been called out to see to the chubby girl. She had, in the French woman\u2019s own words \u201cA talent for falling on face\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Miss Vill- Villen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVilleneuve,\u201d the nurse corrected her, unzipping her first aid bag. \u201cNow\u2026 what appears to be the problem?\u201d She asked, her tone making Jennifer shiver.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well I fell down and bumped my knee,\u201d she began, \u201cand then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which she did, and swiftly.<br>\r\n\"Jenny!\" She'd cried when she entered the nurse's office, and saw her daughter sitting there, eating a candy Miss Villeneuve offered her. Her leg was propped up on another chair. <br>\r\nAnna knelt down and gave her a tight hug. \"My poor baby, what happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n\"I-I just fell mom,\" Jennifer gasped, still a little winded from the fall and the squeeze not helping,  \"I-I'm alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a bit of a bad fall in class, and her gym shorts have been destroyed,\" Nurse Villeneuve explained, \"she may have pulled a muscle in her leg, but other than that she seems to be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" Anna sighed with relief, smiling as she stroked her daughter's hair, \"c'mon, let's get you home. Easy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jennifer lowered her leg from the chair and stood, wincing from the dull pain. Anna let her lean against her for support.<br>\r\n\"Thank you nurse,\" Anna smiled, \"Jenny has a check-up later on, so I'll make sure she's nice and rested.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Miss Villeneuve nodded, smiling down at the chubby girl, \"I hope it goes well.\"<br>\r\nThe two said their goodbyes to the nurse and made their way out to the car, Jennifer awkwardly waddling while leaning against her mother's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, Jennifer was back on the sofa, this time sitting upright to support her still sore leg. Anna had propped it up with a pillow, and even bought her something from her favourite fast-food place to cheer her up.<br>\r\nAs she gleefully tore into a messy burger, her mother walked in and knelt down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, you remember you have a check-up today, right?\" She asked. Jenny simply nodded, her chomping and chewing not slowing down. \"Now we can't really back out of it, so you think you can be a brave little soldier while we're there?\"<br>\r\nSwallowing with a loud gulp, Jennifer gave her mom another nod, her smile stained with sauce. \"Uh-huh!\"<br>\r\n\"That's my girl,\" Anna smiled, ruffling her daughter's hair and plopping a bowl of ice cream next to her, \"there you are, when you're finished with your burger and fries.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" The globular girl squealed, and Anna gave her a quick kiss on the forehead before departing upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer couldn't really complain; sure her leg was sore, and she had to go to another doctor later, but hey, burgers and ice cream!<br>\r\nMaybe she should hurt herself more often! ...wait no, that's dumb.</span></div></div>",

After Anna got her daughter buckled in, they set off. On the way there, every time the car would hit a bump, it would cause Jenny's belly to jiggle, which caused her to smile. She really loved her big belly. Mostly because she thought it looked cute. She wondered why everyone didn't have a big round ball of fat on them like hers. She also loved t see it get bigger. The bigger it got, the cuter it looked. She reached down and started to pet her belly. She felt the gurgling of her belly from the big meal she had for lunch and it felt like it was purring like a cat to Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like that, don't you?\" Jenny said quietly to her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Anna spoke and snapped her daughter back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jenny, we're here\" Anna said as she turned the car off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna unbuckled her daughter and  they both walked inside. They sat down and waited for their name to be called, which didn't take long. Jenny went back to the doctors office and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jenny, what brings you in today?\" The female doctor with brown hair in a ponytail asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom said that it was just a regular check up\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well let's get started then, shall we?\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor started by taking her weight, which she noticed was twenty five pounds heavier than last year. The she took her height, looked into her ears noes and mouth and tested her reflexes. The last procedure to do was an abdominal exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright Jenny, I'm going to need you to take off your shirt and lie on your back\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny obeyed and when she took her shirt off, her belly bounced free. She then lied down on the table. The doctor started to examine her belly, feeling around for anything out of the ordinary. This caused Jenny to suppress a giggle. She loved it when people played with her belly. Then the doctor started to push on different areas of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now tell me if this hurts\" the doctor said as she pushed on Jenny's belly, which caused her to burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Buurrp*, excuse me\" Jenny said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a big lunch?\" the doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded her head sheepishly. The doctor continued to push on her belly until she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay one last thing, I'm going to listen to your belly and make sure everything's alright in there\" the doctor said patting Jenny's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor took out her stethoscope and began listening to her belly. Jenny jumped a little at first by the cold sensation, but quickly relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can tell that you had a lot to eat, lots of gurgling going on in there\" the doctor said. She took the stethoscope of Jenny's round tummy and put it back around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jenny, it looks like you're perfectly healthy. Let's go to the waiting room with your mom. and here is a lolly pop for being such a good patient\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny took the lolly pop and followed the doctor to the waiting room, where Anna was. Anna looked up from the magazine she was reading and noticed the doctor and Jenny walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So doctor, how is she?\" Anna asked standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's perfectly healthy. Her weight is a little high, but it's nothing to worry about. Just keep her happy\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Anna said to the doctor before she went back to see another patient. \"Okay Jenny, let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny waddled over to her mother and walked back to the car and drove home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna, relieved that her daughter was perfectly healthy, was in a good enough mood that she decided to reward her little girl tonight for being so good at the doctor's. Once they got home, Jenny was given her favourite dinner; cheese pizza and garlic bread. However, with Anna not feeling worried about her daughter's size, she was treated to a larger sized pizza and a whole baguette! And of course, a larger glass of orange Fanta to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing her thanks, the greedy girl began to dig into her meal. One pudgy hand held a slice of pizza, the other a slice of garlic bread, and she alternated between the two by biting one after the other. Anna couldn't help but smile at how happy her daughter looked; her round puffy little face bore a wide smile as she chewed and swallowed her carb-heavy dinner. The way to this girl's heart was certainly through her stomach, and with the doctor declaring her healthy, Anna's internal conflicts about her growth and 'healthy' appetite were calmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had finished up her dinner, and followed it up with a dessert of as many slices of chocolate cake as she could manage (which was nearly the entire thing!), Jenny slumped back in her chair with a content grin. Her face was totally dirtied with pizza sauce, garlic butter and cake crumbs, with her hands covered in chocolatey goop and her shirt discoloured with food debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, somebody enjoyed their dinner tonight, hm?\" Anna teased, smiling warmly at her daughter, who just responded with a small burp and a hiccup, \"Pardon you. C'mon, let's run you a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna carefully hoisted her stuffed little girl onto her feet, and assisted her in waddling awkwardly up the stairs as Jenny cradled her full belly, as well as picking bits of food off herself to lick off her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Anna had the bath running, she helped Jenny to undress. Her shirt, tightened from her distended stomach, took a bit of effort to get off, and undoing her pants required Anna to lift her daughter's overhanging middle to reach the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the chubby child was inside the bath, and let out a soft sigh of comfort in the warm white suds. Knowing how sleepy she got after a big meal, Anna assisted in cleaning her up. The water began to recolour as the mishmash of food debris was scrubbed off Jenny's face and hands, and Anna had decided to wash her daughter's hair for good measure. She couldn't help but feel good at how comfortable Jenny looked, with a big grin on her puffy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was washed and dried, Jenny let out a yawn and rubbing her eyes with a pudgy hand as she put on her pyjamas in her room. Though she was too sleepy to notice, she would have to get new ones soon; her pink vest refused to cover her rounded stomach all the way, and her purple shorts seemed to dig into her a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was set, her mother came in with the last few slices of chocolate cake left behind from earlier, covered in a plastic see-through dome with a handle on the top.<br>\r\n\"If you get the urge to midnight snack, just have one of these, alright sweetie?\" She smiled setting the plate on her bedside table before helping her greedy little girl get snuggled into bed. \"And if your leg is still too sore I'll let you stay home tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" she yawned, receiving a kiss on her soft cheek, and the two said their goodnights before Anna quietly left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, Jenny's eyes shot open and glared right at the plate of cake. Right away, she reached over and lifted the dome, grabbing a slice and gobbling it up with a quick newfound hunger. The new tiny hole in her stomach filled, Jenny settled back down into bed with a grin, thinking of what she might have for breakfast. Or if she could stay home, what she could eat all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to seem that, unbeknownst to Jenny, her love for food was developing into an addiction, and it wouldn't be long before it evolved into an obsession...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer was wandering through her school, past the wooden doors and down the bland corridors. There was no-one else around, not even a janitor or cleaner, and everything was silent except for a distant, constant munching sound. <br>\r\nShe tried walking towards the sound but she was suddenly aware how strange she felt. Glancing down, she jumped in surprise as an unfamiliar body met her eyes; instead of her usual swollen belly and budding breasts, she could see all the way down to her bare feet and the carpeted floor. She marvelled for a second, wondering just whose body this was, before realising; it was hers, just considerably smaller.<br>\r\nShe began to run through the corridors, faster than she could ever have imagined. For the first time she could remember there was no uncomfortable bouncing sensation from her gut, no burning pain in her legs, no gasping rattle from her lungs. She was free as the birds she sometimes watched out the window, too fast and too agile for anything to catch or trap.<br>\r\nFinally, she stopped at a great set of double doors. These would usually lead into the main hall but instead of the chattering and screaming of countless children, the only sound was the munching she had heard earlier, noe louder than ever. Suddenly hesitant, she reached out with one skinny arm and cracked open the doors.<br>\r\nWithin, upon a great pile of junk food and sweets, was a huge girl. She looked about Jenny's age but she was far bigger, almost as wide as she was tall; her body was swollen and bulging, naked but for the discarded chocolate wrappers and fast food cartons that buried her up to her crotch. Jennifer couldn't tell if she was sitting or standing in the pile, but even as she watched the girl devoured a large container of French fries and dropped it to join the rest. She'd obviously been eating there a while.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she caught sight of the figure's face and she gasped; the face was hers, just a bit rounder! At the noise, the bloated girl turned, catching sight of Jenny peering through the door. However, she just smiled a familiar smile and wordlessly beckoned the smaller girl inside before returning to her food.<br>\r\nAlmost against her will, Jenny slipped inside and trotted over. Before she could say anything however, the other girl -the other Jennifer?- had shoved a burger into her hands. She wasn't particularly hungry but she began eating it anyway, habit taking over. Before she knew it the burger had gone and her hands were already grabbing some pizza from the pile, stuffing it into her mouth faster than she thought possible. Soon it had also vanished into her newly-slim stomach, though for how long it would remain that way was uncertain as she began gorging herself unreservedly on the vast mound of food. The other Jenny nodded appreciatively as the slimmer girl ate, chins wobbling furiously as her jaw worked to chew handfuls of shredded chicken.<br>\r\nAs she ate, Jennifer began to feel her body change. Her clothes started getting tighter, and she began to feel the familiar uncomfortable sensation around her waist as her shorts dug in. Glancing down, she saw that her belly had once more become round and soft, straining her shirt. Soon, her feet had disappeared from view, obscured both by the wrappers amassing around her feet and by her expanding belly. She tried to stop eating, tried to drop the fries, but her hands wouldn't respond. There was a sound of popping stitches as she continued to eat, and a moment later her shirt ripped down the front, exposing her pale midriff. A second later she felt the waistband of her shorts snap, though she had lost sight of it long ago. <br>\r\nAll too soon, the heap of discarded cardboard and foil had risen to nearly her waist, and she barely had to stand anymore as it began to support her weight. Her belly was huge, only matched by the rest of her body which was now grossly swollen. Her upper arms jiggled as she brought yet another handful of food to her voracious mouth, and her body was now little more than a mass of pale flesh.<br>\r\nGlancing over, she saw that the other girl had been engulfed entirely by the pile of wrappers. The idea of being buried alive like that finally jolted Jennifer out of her food-based paralysis. She dropped slice of cake she'd been about to eat and, with a great effort, burst free of the pile and ran - or rather, waddled - towards the double doors. Her bare body jiggled and shook as she moved, barely faster than a walk, but she eventually reached the doors, still slightly ajar from when she'd slipped inside. She grabbed the handles and tried to pull them open, but they were stuck in place! Giving up, she began slamming her considerable weight into the doors, trying to force them to move, but all that happened was she bruised her shoulder. Tears now running down her food-smeared face, she tried to squeeze through the gap she left. She managed to get one shoulder and her head back into the corridor, but her midsection jammed into the narrow space and wouldn't move. She sucked her belly as best she could and jiggled around as much as possible, but she was trapped between the frozen doors. Twisting her head round, she saw a great wave of cartons and containers and wrappers all rise up like a tsunami, before coming crashing down on top of her, filling her mouth and quashing her frantic screams.</span></div></div>",

Panting heavily, she wiped sweat off her forehead with her arm and looked around. She was in her darkened room, still in her comfy bed, still in her plump little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was just a dream,</i> the girl concluded internally, letting out a sigh of relief that caused her belly to jut out. It had shrunk a bit in her sleep, but it had certainly grown after all her binging just hours before. It had obtained another inch or so, two at the most. But of course Jenny would never notice such a thing; she wasn't worried the calories being put into her body, rather the food being put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of food, the nightmare began to replay itself in her mind. Her eyebrow cocked as she remembered how tiny and thin she looked, and then meeting her obese doppelg\u00e4nger. <i>I wonder what that was all about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mental images of that mountainous pile of junk food flashed, Jenny allowed a grin to creep onto her face. Her confusion about whatever her subconscious could have been telling her was slowly being replaced by a growing urge to snack. She could almost taste all that pizza, those burgers, those chocolates and cakes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Grrrrnnnn...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar sound arose from Jenny's massive middle, and she instinctively put a thick little hand on it for a rub. It was still dark out, probably a good few hours before sunrise, and she was creeping into her slowly-becoming-constant mood; the mood for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer desire for a midnight snack caused her mother's voice to speak up in her mind; <i>\"If you get the urge to midnight snack, just have one of these.\"</i><br>\r\nShe turned and saw she still had some cake left beneath the plastic dome, she somehow hadn't touched it during her dream. She adjusted herself on her bed, the frame and springs squeaking and creaking beneath her generous bulk, and lifted another slice of cake to gobble it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her fingers clean, she saw she had two slices left, and so she decided, in a mix of carefulness and greed, to eat up the rest of them just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning the crumbs and goop from her fingers and mouth, the gluttonous girl settled back down in her bed, wearing a grin of content as her eyes slowly closed.</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes and squinted up, her mom slowly coming into focus as her eyes grew accustomed to the light filtering in through her bedroom window.<br>\r\n\"Morning, Jenny. Time to get up.\" <br>\r\nShe yawned widely, and blinked up at the shape looming over her.<br>\r\n\"I'm still tired though.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n\"Come on Jennifer, get up. How's your leg?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Jenny grumbled, then froze. \"Uh, actually it still really hurts, mom. I'm not sure if I can walk on it.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Her mom frowned, pulling aside the covers to get a better look at her daughter's leg. She prodded it dubiously.<br>\r\n\"Uh- ow!\" said Jenny, half a second late. Luckily, her mom didn't seem to notice the error.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" She sighed. \"I suppose you'll have to stay home from school.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Jennifer agreed, trying to hide her grin.<br>\r\n\"Ah well, I suppose I'll phone you in sick. Do you want to stay in bed a while longer?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Jenny said happily; this was going better than she'd hoped.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, try to rest. Call me if you need help coming downstairs.\"<br>\r\n\"I will.\" She smiled at her mom, who ruffled her hair affectionately.<br>\r\n\"I'll even make you some breakfast if you like. What do you want? I think we've got pancakes.\"<br>\r\n\"Make them!\" Exclaimed the chubby girl, almost squealing with delight. Her mom laughed.<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll go make you some pancakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her mom had left the room, Jennifer slid out of bed without even a twinge from her leg. She was feeling rather pleased with herself; missing a day of school, and having pancakes made for her. Plus, the doctor had said she was perfectly healthy! All in all, things were looking good.<br>\r\nShe took a step, and for a moment her smile faded. She remembered her dream. It had been a lot of fun being able to run around without getting tired. Maybe... maybe she should-<br>\r\nThe smell of cooking pancakes interrupted her thoughts, and she forgot what she was thinking about. Shaking her head, she went to get dressed before it was time for breakfast. Pulling off her night clothes, she hurried to her wardrobe and looked for something nice to wear on her day off school. Hmm... Lots of shirts, skirts, shorts... Ah! Her favourite dress was tucked in at the back behind an unworn pair of sweatpants. She pulled it out and examined it; though she hadn't worn it for months it was as pretty as ever. She pulled it on, slipping it over her head and then squeezing the rest of her body into it. It was tight around her belly, which was round and large even though she hadn't eaten yet.<br>\r\nReaching behind her, she tried to zip up the back of the dress but her young arms were just too short. Growling irritably, she set off stumping down the stairs, the wood creaking with every one of her heavy steps. She soon trotted into the kitchen where her mom was cooking pancakes.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you got down the stairs all right?\" She said. \"Your breakfast's almost ready.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you help me with my dress?\" The plump girl asked. She turned around to display the zipper.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Said Anna. She left her cooking and came over, kneeling down behind her daughter and taking hold of the zipper to try to pull it up, but it wouldn't budge; the dress was too tight. \"Could you suck your tummy in for me, Jen? It's a little stiff.\"<br>\r\nJennifer obliged, making her prodigious middle as small as possible. There was a brief pause, then she heard her mother puff with effort and finally the zipper slid up, grinding slightly as it went. She gasped at the sudden pressure.<br>\r\n\"There you go.\" Said Anna. \"Now, I need to get those pancakes before they burn.\"<br>\r\nAs her mom moved back to the grill, Jenny let her belly swell back out to full size, hearing the fabric of her dress creak with the strain. With a slight frown, she tugged at the dress, trying to loosen the unyielding material that squeezed her chest and belly. She felt a bit like an overstuffed sausage, squeezed into a space too small for her. Breathing shallowly, she moved over to the table and sat down.<br>\r\nA minute later, her mom brought over a stack of pancakes and the golden syrup, the two of which Jenny soon combined in considerable amounts. Now, with a perfect breakfast in front of her and clothing trouble forgotten, she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her nearly twenty minutes to finish up the whole stack of pancakes but finish them she did, leaving just a smear of syrup on the plate. A moment later, that too was gone, scraped up by a thick finger and deposited into her mouth as she sat back contentedly in her chair, other hand on her swollen belly. She was breathing heavily, worn out by a combination of the restrictive dress and eating so fast she didn't have time to breath. She tugged again at the dress, trying to ease the pressure that had gotten even worse as she\u2019d eaten. She huffed irritably; it was obviously not going to get any looser.<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d She called. Anna looked up from where she was emptying the dishwasher.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it sweety?\u201d She was happy to see her daughter so relaxed and comfortable.<br>\r\n\u201cMy dress is really tight.\u201d She gestured to the straining fabric over her midsection, pouting.<br>\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Anna thought, trying to remember if it had shrunk in the wash. \u201cDid you put it on wrong or something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Jennifer looked down at the dress doubtfully.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a look.\u201d Anna left the dishes and hurried over to Jenny. \u201cCan you stand up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn't I be able to?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re leg still hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh yeah, it does. Ouch.\u201d She said unconvincingly, climbing laboriously to her feet. Anna didn\u2019t seem suspect anything though, as she knelt down to Jenny\u2019s level and had a look at the dress. She took a quick look at the zipper, then at the straining stitches down the side. Eventually, she stood back up.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Jen, it looks like you\u2019ve just outgrown it.\u201d She said sympathetically.<br>\r\n\u201cBut it fit me fine a few months ago.\u201d She said petulantly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just how it is. We can go shopping for a new dress soon, okay?\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Jennifer could answer, however, the phone rang.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m gonna have to get this.\u201d Her mom hurried off as Jenny looked mournfully at her outgrown dress. It wasn\u2019t <i>too</i> bad, she supposed. It wasn\u2019t as if she couldn\u2019t wear it or anything; it was just a bit tight around the middle. Well \u2013 a bit tight around everything, if she was being honest.<br>\r\nA raised voice in the hall made her perk up her ears. <br>\r\n\u201c- come on!\u201d She heard her mom say, then a pause. \u201cIs there absolutely no-one else? Okay\u2026 okay\u2026 Fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d She heard a sigh as the phone was returned to its mount, then her mom came back in.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Jenny, two other people are off sick at work and they\u2019ll have to close if I don\u2019t go in. Are you alright on your own?\u201d<br>\r\nJenny nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sweety.\u201d Anna gave her a quick kiss, before hurrying back into the hall to grab her bag. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few hours, be good!\u201d A moment later, she heard the door slam.<br>\r\nJenny bit her lip excitedly. She was almost never left alone in the house; she could have some fun. She could\u2026</span></div></div>",

Licking her lips in greedy anticipation, she waddled over to the pantry and opened it up, revealing the bounty of chocolate, cakes, candy and all kinds of sugary delights. Just the sight of this collection of calories made a sliver of drool slide out the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny glanced from shelf to shelf, trying to decide what she'd have first. Maybe some chocolate bars? Or some doughnuts? Maybe even a cake? She gave her belly a rub as it grumbled with impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then, a thought came to her. She'd be alone for a few hours, and the morning was the best time for cartoons. So what if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin emerging on her puffy face, Jenny grabbed a packaged chocolate cake and took it to the living room couch, leaving it on the seat. She then went back to the kitchen and returned with a box of jam-filled doughnuts. Then a box of chocolate bars. Then a large package of gummy candies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greedy girl huffed and puffed with exhaustion as she took a glance at the couch, which was stocked up with all she could fit out of the pantry, which was nearly the entire thing! Chocolates, cakes, chewy candies, pies, puddings, everything! And smack dab in the middle was a wide Jenny-sized space, right in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with herself, Jenny hoisted her heavy frame up onto the couch, the cushions' sudden depression causing a few of her snacks to collapse into her lap much to her glee. She grabbed the remote in a pudgy hand and flicked on the TV to the cartoon channel, and thus began her feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming lost in her greed, Jenny was subconsciously shoving doughnut after chocolate after gum into her mouth, leaving a decreasing pile of snacks on the sofa and an increasing mountain of empty wrappers and packages on the floor. She hadn't noticed, too busy eating and focusing on the TV. Her face and fingers were stained with chocolate, jelly and sugar, thanks to her neglecting to clean herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was so submerged that she hadn't heard the stitches from her dress. Her sides were being torn apart by her distending middle, and eventually decided they couldn't take anymore and popped open, allowing pale globs of flesh to bulge out of the spaces left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she hadn't noticed, and as time went by and snacks were devoured, she continued to be oblivious. She had food and TV, so nothing else was grabbing her attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sharp ringing of the doorbell roused Jenny from her sleep with a start, and before she knew it she'd slipped off the sofa to land heavily on the floor. She groaned in pain, belly aching from both the short fall and the truly incredible amount of food that had been stuffed into it a few hours before. There were so many wrappers on the couch it was difficult to tell what colour it had been originally.<br>\r\nThe doorbell sounded again and she hoisted herself upright, then hurriedly set off staggering towards the front door. Every step made her swollen gut jiggle uncomfortably, and as she waddled into the corridor she reflected mournfully that there were downsides to massive overeating. <br>\r\nShe eventually reached the door, shivering at the breeze that was chilling her sides for some reason, before looking through the peephole. On the other side, she saw Katrina waiting awkwardly, dark hair blowing wildly in the strong winds.<br>\r\nShe reached up high and unbolted the door, then pulled it open to greet her friend.<br>\r\n\"Hi Katty!\" She said, and was rather alarmed when the other girl jumped back, a look of shock on her round face. \"Jen! What the hell happened to you?\" She said loudly, staring at her chubby friend.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Asked Jenny, feeling rather scared.<br>\r\n\"Well your face for one, but also your dress...\"<br>\r\nJenny left her friend on the doorstep and ran - well, walked slightly faster than normal - back into the house, going to the nearest mirror she could find. Katrina followed her inside, shutting and bolting the door behind her as she followed the larger girl.<br>\r\nAs soon as Jennifer found a mirror, she began giggling; she could see why Kat had been shocked now; her face and chest were a multicoloured mess of food, from smeared chocolate to cake crumbs to bits of potato chip. She looked less like a person and more like a strange cross between a human and the trash bin outside McDonalds. She turned to Katrina, who had followed her into the room.<br>\r\n\"I forgot to clean myself up,\" she giggled, \"sorry for giving you a scare.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" The other girl said. \"Your dress is bust too.\" She said, gesturing to the great rips down the side that Jennifer had thus far failed to notice.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She said, voice suddenly quite small. \"Now I really can't wear it...\" She felt rather sad about the dresses death.<br>\r\n\"How did you even end up like this?\" Asked Katrina, eying Jenny's massively swollen stomach curiously.<br>\r\n\"I, uh, ate some food.\" She looked back at the mirror and sighed. \"I guess I'll need to change clothes and wash my face before mom gets back. Come on, let's go upstairs.\" <br>\r\nShe led Katrina up the stairs. Nowadays, she'd taken to staying on the ground floor whenever she could, and now she was remembering why; climbing stairs was exhausting! Her legs and feet ached, her belly bounced dreadfully, and by the time she reached the top she was puffing and panting like she'd run a marathon. She leant against the wall to get her breath back, watched by a slightly worried Kat.<br>\r\n\"Are you really that tired? I mean, I'm not very fit but I'm fine just climbing stairs...\"<br>\r\nJenny shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I dunno. My leg still hurts, do that's probably it.\" She'd told the lie so many times now she was starting to believe it herself. \"That's why I wasn't in school today.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Said Katrina, leading the way to the bathroom. \"Oh yeah, I needed to tell you something; it's why I came round. Our class is doing the nativity play for the end of term, and we need to know what part you're going to be playing. We didn't know if you'd be in school tomorrow either, so I came to check.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that sounds exciting!\" Jenny gushed. \"Can I be Mary?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kanya's gonna be Mary. Actually, the only parts left are a shepherd, a Roman soldier, animals and, uh, the angel.\"<br>\r\nWhat should Jenny be?</span></div></div>",

Kat sighed. \"Fine, I'll put you down as the angel.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Katty, you're the best!\" Jennifer grabbed her friend and pulled her into a tight hug.<br>\r\n\"H-hey! You're covered in crumbs.\" Kat shoved her away and stepped back, brushing off her top. Her attempt to look annoyed, however, was ruined by the slight blush in her cheeks.<br>\r\nJennifer grabbed a flannel from the cupboard and wetted it, then began washing the debris of her face. Soon her pale skin was visible once more, and the flannel was stained with food. She washed it off then reached back to undo her dress, growling in annoyance as she remembered she couldn't reach.<br>\r\n\"Katty, will you unzip me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh- sure.\" Katrina unzipped her friend's dress easily, the rips down the side making it far less tight than it had been a few hours ago, then together they pulled the ruined dress off over Jennifer's head. For a moment, she looked at the dress sadly, then she bunched it up and stuffed it into the bin. She turned to Katrina, who was awkwardly looking in the other direction.<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my room and grab some new clothes.\" She said, before frowning. She followed her friend's gaze, but saw nothing but the blank wall. \"Are you okay Katty?\" She asked, concerned.<br>\r\n\"You're not wearing anything.\" Mumbled the dark-haired girl, cheeks flushed bright red.<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Jenny looked down. \"I am wearing panties, I think.\" From her point of view, her crotch was hidden beneath rolls of flabby midsection. She lifted her gut out the way and leant forwards, briefly catching sight of the polka-dot fabric. \"Yeah, I am.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're not wearing anything else!\" Said Katrina, still looking resolutely at the tiled wall.<br>\r\nJenny giggled.<br>\r\n\"Come on, silly. We're both girls.\" She grabbed the other girl's arm and led her through to her own room, and sat her down on the bed. The pyjamas from that morning were still lying discarded on the floor, as were various candy wrappers and other clothes. Katrina eyed the plate on Jennifer's bedside table, cake crumbs revealing what had once been on it.<br>\r\n\"Your room's almost as messy as mine.\" She said, still feeling quite awkward. She glanced at her friend who was now bent over rummaging through a drawer, wide rear jiggling. She looked away again hurriedly, wishing she could stop herself blushing.<br>\r\n\"It's normally messier than this.\" Jenny said straightening up, shorts in hand. \"I think mom just cleaned it.\" She hurried over to the wardrobe  and began looking through that.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\"<br>\r\nA moment later the bigger girl walked back over to the bed, outfit in hand. <br>\r\n\"What d'you think?\" She asked, holding it up for Kat to see.<br>\r\n\"Looks, uh, good to me.\" She said. Jenny frowned.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\" She asked, leaning towards the girl on the bed. \"You're being a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm f-f-fine.\" She'd thought she'd got over the stuttering years ago - apparently it wasn't quite as gone as she'd hoped.<br>\r\n\"Hmmph. Okay.\" She stepped away and began getting dressed, pulling on a tight pair of shorts with some difficulty. Meanwhile Katrina breathed deeply, once, twice, three times. She was in control. Looking up, she saw Jenny putting on her top, an undersized thing that didn't quite cover her lowest flab roll.<br>\r\n\"Don't you wear a vest?\" Asked Katrina, expression resolutely calm, though her cheeks were still a bit red.<br>\r\n\"What? No. Why would I wear a vest?\" She'd never worn vests as far as she could remember.<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, most girls start wearing them around now. Especially girls like you.\" Kat gestured awkwardly at her friend's chest; although she was far from developed, her flabby chest was hardly flat.<br>\r\nJennifer looked down and shrugged.<br>\r\n\"No, my chest never seems to get cold.\" She said, missing the point so completely that Katrina would've suspected a joke, had she not known just how dim her friend could be about her body. She shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\"</span></div></div>",

She wanted to point out that her fatter friend had indeed been stuffing herself earlier, but she knew there would be no swaying her. Besides, being a big girl herself, she also had trouble denying food when it was offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's smile widened, squishing up her bloated cheeks, and she began waddling out of her room and down to the kitchen. Katrina followed, taking a mental note of how tight her friend's shorts looked on her; her thick thighs squished ever so slightly out of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair reached the kitchen, Jenny made a beeline for the pantry, the door still wide open and whatever there was left on display for her. She instinctively grabbed as much as she could carry, while Katrina grabbed the rest for herself. The shelves were totally bare now, thanks to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny led her friend into the living room, with the TV still on and the floor still littered with empty wrappers and packages.<br>\r\nKatrina's eyes widened. \"Woah, you ate all of this yourself?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Jenny giggled, sounding a bit too proud of herself, as she dumped her armfuls of treats on the far cushion and hoisted herself up next to them. Katrina followed suit on the opposite side, providing just enough space for the two of them, although it was a bit packed and the two were rather close together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, how can you eat all this and still be hun-\" The smaller girl started, but her friend was already stuffing chocolate into her face, so there was no point in trying to question her further. Shrugging, she flipped open a box of sugar-frosted doughnuts and began gobbling them up herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The couch that sat in Jennifer's sitting room had seen a lot of abuse in its eight years. Bought on the day of their first child's birth, the new mother and father had spared no expense on a piece of furniture that was to last as long as possible, and it was beautiful and sturdy to match what they'd paid.<br>\r\nIn its time it had seen the entire family squeezed together on its plush exterior, watching TV or just talking. Later it had been jumped on for games, tipped over as part of a fort, even flipped upsidedown at one point to provide a semi-convincing mountain ledge. After that, however, things had settled down for the most part; with the father's new job, the family rarely sat on it as one anymore, and a lone child, however heavy she might be becoming, was no strain on it. <br>\r\nToday, however, it was feeling its age. Today, not one but two oversized youngsters were resting upon its width, wide rears making it creak slightly with the strain. That in itself wouldn't have been a bother however; it was tougher than that. No, the problem only arose when they started <i>jumping</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting upon said couch, Katrina was beginning to feel rather sick. She'd just eaten a huge amount of candy and chocolate, more than she'd normally eat in a week, and now Jenny, normally slothful and lazy, was practically hyperactive. Perhaps it was the 8000 calories the young girl had eaten that day but she was buzzing with sugar-fuelled energy, and with that much energy came silly games. With only a giggle as warning, Jenny leapt on the smaller girl and begun an impromptu wrestling match, forgetting any discomfort from overeating in her childish glee. Katrina gasped as all the wind was knocked out of her at the unexpected attack, setting her scrabbling desperately beneath her friend's bulk, trying to dislodge the weight that had knocked her flat. Face trapped beneath a bulge of flab she struggled to breath, and for a few seconds the two floundered and fought, until with a final heave Katrina managed to throw the bigger girl off. <br>\r\nThe couch groaned as Jenny's weight came down hard on one end, but it survived. What it couldn't survive, however, was when Katrina leapt onto her friend in pursuit of revenge, putting both girls' considerable combined weight onto its dodgy right leg.<br>\r\nCrack! <br>\r\nFor the second time that day Jenny was deposited suddenly onto the carpet as the couch tipped unexpectedly. A moment later Katrina lost her balance and slipped, landing directly on her friend's packed belly. Jennifer cried out at the sudden pain, chubby face red, then all was completely quiet. For half a minute, both girls lay in a silent heap, then with a pained heave Kat climbed off her friend and stood up. Hands on wide hips, she surveyed the damage.<br>\r\nThe couches front-right leg had snapped halfway up its length, which is what had tipped them onto the floor. Now, with their weights gone, it stood fine on the other three. However, if anyone sat near the front it would tip them off. She shook her head in dismay, and turned to Jennifer.<br>\r\n\"Holy cow, Jen. We broke your couch pretty good.\" She turned to look at the other girl was still lying on the floor, clutching her midsection. There was a look of pained distress on her round face. \"Hey, you okay Jen?\" Asked Katrina nervously.<br>\r\nShe knelt down beside her friend, starting to feel worried at the expression on Jenny's face.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Shall I get help?\" She was panicking slightly, and she saw with alarm that the bigger girl's face was getting increasingly red. \"Jen! Come on, say something. Does your belly hurt?\"<br>\r\nJennifer's face was now the colour of a ripe tomato, and suddenly her eyes rolled back in her head, showing only the whites. For a second, Katrina honestly thought her friend had died, and her mind flashed forwards to an imaginary funeral where she was putting flowers by a grave while Anna sobbed nearby.<br>\r\nAnd then, Jennifer's lips parted wide, and she gave the longest, loudest belch Katrina had ever heard. The dark-haired girl jumped back in shock, falling over a box of chocolates and landing on her butt as the burp just kept going, on and on, until finally it petered out with a squeak. A moment later, Jenny sat up and looked around.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that felt good. What happened, did the couch fall over?\" She glanced over at the broken leg. \"Oh no!\"<br>\r\nKatrina swore, loudly, prompting to Jenny to look back at her in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mommy says don't say that word.\"<br>\r\nKat shook her head frustratedly, colour returning to her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Don't scare me like that, Jen! I mean... damn, I thought you were dead!\"<br>\r\nJenny shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Nah, the doctor said I'm good.\" She said, missing the point once again.<br>\r\n\"Well... never mind that now. We need to fix your couch before your mom gets home, Jen.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" She looked back at the couch. \"Maybe if we use duct tape?\" She suggested, having seen it advertised on TV one time.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it's your house! Look, I'll deal with the food mess, you try and fix the couch and maybe your mom won't kill us when she gets back, okay?\"<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes, the two girls worked hard at their tasks. Katrina trotted to and fro to the kitchen, stuffing cartons and wrappers into the bin, and Jennifer did her best to fix the couch leg using Pritt Stick and masking tape. Eventually, jobs done, the two stood in the centre of the room. All in all, they thought they'd done a decent job; The floor was clear, and the couch was reasonably stable, though it was basically just balancing on the broken leg. Still, to the two girls it seemed acceptable.</span></div></div>",

Katrina was feeling quite sick now; physical effort was uncommon for her, especially after eating, and she'd just spent 20 minutes running from room to room to clean. <br>\r\nShe lay flat out on the bed with a sigh; upsettingly, if she lay back like this it was her belly that thrust highest into the air, sticking up higher than her nose or toes. Katrina wasn't like Jennifer; she knew she was chubby, and she hated every pound of extra weight. Though she was quite small compared to Jenny, she was a big girl for her age with most of her weight around her hips and butt. Most pants for 8 year olds wouldn't even fit over her plump rear, and the ones that could only did so with at least ten minutes hard tugging and wiggling, leaving them straining at the seams.<br>\r\nIn fact, it was Katrina's size that had drawn her to Jenny in the first place. On her first day at school, her pants had ripped as she'd sat down for roll call and the whole class had laughed at her, all except Jennifer. She'd just looked a bit confused as to what was funny, and it was then that Kat realised; if she was always standing next to Jenny, she'd look veritably skinny on comparison. Thus had bloomed a lengthy friendship.<br>\r\nKatrina had gained over the years since then; enough flab had collected around her waist to form a small potbelly, her hips had gotten steadily wider, and her butt had grown even more round. Luckily for her, however, Jenny had gained too, and at a much faster rate. Despite the advantage, however, she was beginning to worry about her fatter friend; Jenny's size and diet were scarily excessive, and she wondered if she should say anything. She glanced sideways at where Jennifer lay beside her on the bed, eyes closed; she had dropped off into a peaceful sleep. She saw how Jenny's stomach rose up far higher than her own, revealed in its entirety by the shirt she was wearing, which had ridden up to just below her chest. It wasn't like her belly was the only oversized thing, either. Her upper arms were thick and flabby, devoid of muscle. Similarly, her thighs bulged within her straining shorts; Katrina had witnessed first-hand how weak they were, as each time they'd climbed the stairs they'd had to stop at the top for Jenny to get her breath back. <br>\r\nSpeaking of breathing, in the quiet of the house she could hear Jenny's quite clearly, loud and slightly uneven beneath the weight of that huge gut pressing down on her as she lay.<br>\r\nThe doctor had said she was alright, hadn't they? And doctors couldn't be wrong, that was fact. She pushed aside her worries for her friend, and instead thought about herself again. She really wished that she'd eaten less earlier, but she hadn't been able to stop once she'd started. Now she felt quite sick, and she had bellyache from eating so much. Although her clothes fit better than Jenny's did - knowing ones own size has its advantages - her binging had left her shirt tighter than normal, and a thin wedge of pasty flab was visible between it and her pants. She rubbed her achingly full stomach with one hand, wishing her fingers didn't sink in as much as they did. She imagined what it would be like to find a perfectly flat, toned waist there one day, and bit her lip sadly. Maybe when she was older she'd go on a diet or something.<br>\r\nSuddenly the doorbell rang, interrupting her thoughts. Was Anna back already?</span></div></div>",

Katrina forgot for a second how much of a heavy sleeper she was, especially after a meal, which she demonstrated at many a sleepover and slumber party. Katrina half-joked internally that she might wake up if she held some chocolate over her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the smaller girl heaved herself off the bed and stumbled out the door, cradling her overfilled stomach as she carefully plodded down the stairs. Once she'd reached the bottom, the sound of a key clicking into the door sounded, and she heard the door open. For a split second she felt relieved that she didn't have to reach for the lock herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, She watched Anna walk into the main hall, and be taken aback slightly by the girl's presence.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Katrina,\" she smiled warmly, being well acquainted with her daughter's friend, \"I didn't know you were here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, I just got here a little while ago,\" she explained, then swallowed a nervous lump in her throat before continuing, \"u-uh, your sofa broke a little bit, but me and Jenny fixed it...kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that old thing?\" The woman chuckled, thumbing in the direction of the living room, \"Don't worry about it, I've been meaning to get that thing patched up anyway.\" Her smile quickly dissolved. \"No one was hurt? Where's Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we're both fine,\" Katrina nodded, then pointed upward, \"Jenny's in her room, napping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good,\" Anna sighed with relief, her smile returning as she walked into the kitchen, \"...oh, I see you two were busy!\" she chuckled from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's round face burned bright red once again, this time out of embarrassment. \"U-um, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't apologise, I've been meaning to do shopping soon anyway,\" the older woman re-emerged, handbag missing from her shoulder, \"just means I'll have to do it sooner, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, alright then,\" Katrina nodded, grinning in relief. She liked coming over to Jenny's, her mother was always so nice. No wonder where her friend got it from.</span></div></div>",

They really hadn't left much food...<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're putting on a play?\" Asked Anna, interested. \"Is Jennifer taking part?\" Although unworried about her daughter's health, she would like the young girl to spend less time sprawled on the couch and more time doing something constructive.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's going to be an, uh, angel.\"<br>\r\nAnna turned, eyes sparkling with joy.<br>\r\n\"My little angel's going to be an actual angel!\" She cried. \"Oh, I can see in the outfit now.

You'd think it would be quickest to go.\" She said, as she finally found a solitary bag of cookies underneath some tins of fruit salad. She placed the packet carefully on the counter, then returned to her search.<br>\r\n\"Everyone was sort of afraid to go up on the crane.\" Admitted Katrina. \"But I'm not sure Jenny knows about that.\"<br>\r\nMost parent would have started worrying about now, especially considering Jenny's rather generous size. However, Anna was not most parents.<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me.\" She shrugged. \"When is the play?\"<br>\r\n\"A couple of weeks from now. We'll be rehearsing after school most days, if that's okay with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me.\" With that, Anna stood up with hands on hips. \"All we've got left is cans of fruit salad and powdered milk, and god knows you can't make a meal out of them. I guess I'll call a takeaway.\" She turned to Katrina. \"You can stay to eat if you want. I think I'll order pizza.\"</span></div></div>",

The junk food crammed into her gut had been digesting, rather quickly as well, leaving much more room and relieving her of her pains.<br>\r\nPlus, she did like pizza. And having a nice big one all to herself did not sound like a bad idea, despite still feeling a bit of fullness. She half-joked internally that her best friend's appetite might be rubbing off on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, okay, if you don't mind,\" she decided, managing a sheepish grin, \"I-I need to let my mom know...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll take care of that,\" Anna smiled, her eyes widening slightly as an idea popped into her head, \"in fact, you're more than welcome to sleep over, if you like!

Indeed, the chubby girl still lay sleeping on the bed, ample belly rising and falling with each breath. Katrina suddenly yawned; watching her friend sleep so heavily was making her tired now! She bit her lip, considering for a moment, then climbed into the bed to join her friend. Sliding under the covers, she felt the warm softness of the much larger girl next to her, like an terrifyingly oversized kitten, and she smiled in genuine happiness for the first time in days. Truth be told, she wasn't a very happy person; she was pessimistic to a fault, and her conflict with her parents and body issues rarely left her feeling anything but inadequate. It was only when she was with Jenny, a girl who was simultaneously too nice and too na\u00efve to judge others, that she felt properly happy.<br>\r\nOh yeah, and when she was eating. That was good too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, the pizza had arrived. Although there were only three of them, and two of them weren't even nine yet, Anna had bought two large pepperonis and some garlic bread, as well as a large Coke for Jennifer and a large Diet Coke for Katrina. She'd remembered from previous outings with the dark haired girl preferred to drink diet sodas, though Anna couldn't think why.<br>\r\nSoon, all three were sitting around the dining room table, the two girls eating at breakneck speed, the woman much more slowly. Jennifer especially was choking down slices like her life depended on it, soiling another shirt as tomato sauce and topping escaped her hungry maw and dropped onto her chest. Soon, the white fabric was stained blood red, and Jenny had eaten almost an entire large pizza in under ten minutes, as well as a large drink.<br>\r\nA moment later shepushed her chair away from the table and leant back in it, breathing heavily. Although her stomach was stretched far larger than most kids' her age, that day she'd eaten a truly vast amount, and now she was feeling the consequences as her stomach churned and growled its displeasure. Reaching down with pudgy fingers she scrabbled for the top button on her shorts, trying to ease their constricting embrace, but they were incredibly tight and her belly sagged over the waistband, confounding her clumsy effort.</span></div></div>",

The dark-haired girl hadn't eaten as much as Jenny, but she was still bloated from earlier and was equally stuffed.<br>\r\n\"Help me undo this button?\" She asked, gesturing at her shorts. Katrina coloured.<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" With a glance at Anna, who seemed to have zoned out entirely, the dark haired girl heaved herself to her feet and tottered around the table to her friend, cradling her bulging belly as she did so. She couldn't remember ever being this stuffed before, not even that time when she'd eaten twelve packets of Mars bars in a row and nearly thrown up.<br>\r\nShe knelt down in front of Jenny's chair, between the other girl's thick legs. She squinted at the shorts.<br>\r\n\"Can you, uh, lift your belly up please?\" She asked awkwardly. Jenny just nodded, lifting the flab roll out the way with both hands and letting Katrina's slightly more nimble fingers get to work on the button. <br>\r\nIt was a difficult job; the shorts were seam-strainingly tight, making the button almost impossible to slip free and denying Kat success. Her fingers were slippy with tomato sauce, leaving red fingerprints across the waistband as she tried fruitlessly to ease her friend's discomfort. <br>\r\nJust as she was about to give up, however, Jennifer shifted slightly in her seat and a bit more pressure was put on the button. Without warning, there was a slight popping sound and the little piece of metal span free, firing like a bullet straight into Katrina's nose. As Jennifer's belly bulged forwards into the new space, Kat fell backwards in shock and mild pain, disappearing under the table.<br>\r\nAnna blinked. <br>\r\n\"Katrina? Are you okay?\" She asked, frowning. A moment later, the chubby girl clambered back out from under the table, nose and cheeks both bright red, but for different reasons. She mumbled an affirmative, returning hurriedly to her seat. Anna still looked slightly concerned, but Jennifer interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I need some new clothes.\" She said, frowning down at the second item of clothing she'd ruined that day. \"Can we go shopping tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nAnna looked at her daughter.<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear. We can go right after school if you want.\" Her smile faltered as she remembered something. \"Oh, bother. I need to go food shopping as well.\" <br>\r\nSuddenly, Kat saw an opportunity.<br>\r\n\"Uh, why don't I come too? I need to buy some new clothes too, so you can drop me and Jen off at the clothing shop, go food shopping, then come back and pick us up once you're done.\" Seeing the uncertain look on Anna's face, she pressed on. \"It's a really safe shop too, cos only kids go there to buy things. We could pick the clothes ourselves, and I'll help Jenny choose sensible things. It'll be much quicker, as well.\"<br>\r\nShe looked hopefully at her best friend's mom.</span></div></div>",

Jenny took even longer getting up each step, feeling rather drowsy from her huge dinner, but Katrina wasn't faring much better with her stomach ache returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katrina watched her friend wash up her face and hands in the bathroom sink, she had to wonder just why she was so casual about needing new clothes like this. Was it because her mother was so lax about her size? Did she not care how big she was, or was she just totally oblivious to it? Though, knowing how...well, ditzy she can be, it was probably the latter.<br>\r\nNot that Katrina minded, after all Jenny was her best friend and one of the sweetest people she'd ever met, and her moments of naivety were rather amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two girls had cleaned up and brushed their teeth, they headed into Jenny's bedroom. The larger girl discarded her ruined clothes, dumping them carelessly on the floor. Once again, Katrina felt obliged to look away as her friend changed into her night clothes. Though she managed to get a glance of her polka-dot panties, and she could swear they were smaller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's nightshirt fit even worse on her, not even bothering to cover her stuffed middle and just deciding on the chest. Her pants were quite snug on the thighs and backside, but she managed to pull them up with some effort. The exertion caused her face to redden and she panted a bit, but she succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katrina decided it was safe to turn back around, a realisation slammed right into her thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I don't have any pyjamas with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's alright,\" Jenny grinned, plodding over to her drawer and bending into it. The dark-haired girl had to look away as her friend's shirt slid up, revealing some bare back. She re-emerged with a nightshirt and pants and held them out to her friend. \"Use mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, um, thanks,\" Katrina managed a smile, taking the pyjamas and turning herself around to change. She had a feeling Jenny might be looking, causing her own face to turn red, but figured that she probably thought nothing of it.<br>\r\nThese night clothes had probably been in Jenny's possession for a long time, they really didn't seem like they'd fit the growing girl. But Katrina seemed to fit into them fine, minus a bit of tightness in the pants and a sliver of her stuffed stomach on show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all better,\" Jenny chirped, her cheeks dimpling from her smile. Katrina couldn't help but return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Anna emerged from the hallway, a sleeping bag and pillow in her hands. \"Here we are, Katrina!\" She had to clear some space on the messy bedroom floor, but there was plenty of room for it.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Katrina smiled gratefully, settling herself down into the covers as Anna helped Jenny get all comfortable in her own bed.<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you need?\" She asked with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Um, no thanks,\" the dark-haired girl shook her head. Jenny simply let out a long yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, don't stay up too late now,\" Anna grinned, exiting back out, \"night girls!\"</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes, squinting against the brightness, and sat up, checking the time with bleary eyes. The pink clock on the wall showed half six, far too early for any respectable person to be getting up. Still, she was awake now, and she wouldn't be able to fall asleep again now.<br>\r\nReluctantly, she slipped out of the sleeping bag and got to her feet, swaying slightly as her body woke up. Jennifer was still deep in slumber, her loud snores making it obvious without even turning to check. Rubbing her eyes, Katrina plodded through to the bathroom to go splash water on her face and get cleaned up, leaving Jenny to sleep a while longer. Once she was done, she headed back into her friend's room.<br>\r\nThere was nothing to eat around, so she couldn't go have breakfast; maybe they'd get something on the way to school or something. Her rounded stomach was growling hungrily, already forgetting how much it had eaten yesterday, earning it and angry glare; if it wasn't for her tummy's constant complaints, she could be as skinny as the other girls at school. It was smaller than it had been last night, and no longer peeked out from under her borrowed pyjamas, but was still noticeably round and soft. It bulged gently outwards like she'd hidden a cushion under her shirt, slightly stretching the fabric with its abundant girth.<br>\r\nIrritably, she tore the top off and flung it to the floor, annoyed by its selfishly modest size. She should just get dressed now, while Jenny was still asleep; it'd save her doing it later. She pulled off the pyjama bottoms and grabbed her clothes from yesterday, quickly starting to dress for school. The shirt slipped on fine, but as always the pants were a struggle as they got stuck first on her thick thighs, then beneath her butt. It was at times like now, as she hopped up and down in the middle of the room, dragging pants over her plump cheeks, that she half-wished to have a shape more like Jenny's. The vast majority of the bigger girl's weight was around her waist, forming flabby rolls and love handles. By comparison, Kat looked like an exaggerated pear; her hips were wider than her shoulders, her butt was round and soft, and her thighs rubbed together with every step. Then again, she'd hate to have a belly with fat rolls all the time; it was bad enough getting them when she sat down!<br>\r\nFinally, with a great burst of effort, she managed to get the pants on and buttoned. It had taken nearly ten minutes, but that was better than some mornings she'd had. Once or twice, she'd even been late for school because she was busy trying to squeeze into an especially stubborn pair of jeans.<br>\r\nShe turned to check on Jenny, and felt her heart skip a beat or five as she suddenly spotted two wide eyes staring right at her. Slowly, the apparently-awake Jennifer heaved herself into a sitting position.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" She said simply, and Katrina blushed yet again as she wondered how long the bigger girl been watching. However, a second later her question was answered as Jenny pointed at her pants with one chunky finger. \"You're meant to put your panties on first, you know.\" She said, and giggled.</span></div></div>",

She was honestly worried about <i>Jennifer</i>?<br>\r\n\"W-well, we'd better get dressed,\" she explained, tugging her clothes to adjust them, \"we've got school soon, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm,\" Jenny nodded, then put a plump hand to her belly as a rather loud growl emerged from it, \"breakfast too!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that too,\" the smaller girl nodded, looking down at her own modest middle. She heard Jenny's bed creak with relief as its large occupant slid off it onto her feet and slowly toddled toward the door. Then something clicked. \"Hey Jenny, you're not limping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The larger girl grunted, then Katrina assumed she was trying to look down at her feet but she could see nothing but her own jutting tummy, \"Oh, yeah, my leg's all better.\"<br>\r\n\"Good, that's great,\" the dark-haired girl smiled, watching her friend return to her journey to the bathroom. Truth be told, she missed Jenny at school yesterday, and was actually happy to see she'd be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jenny eventually returned, face cleaned and more awake looking, she began slowly tugging off her night clothes. Katrina, once again, politely turned and waited.<br>\r\nJenny had also shrunk since last night, but it wasn't exactly noticeable, especially not by herself. She grabbed a large looking shirt and some sweatpants out of her drawer, assuming they'd hold her until the two girls went shopping later. The shirt, looking more like a nightgown on a smaller girl, managed to just barely fit over her large tummy, and the sweatpants just about fit around her waist, despite a bit of a tight squeeze. She'd let her mom help with her shoes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ready,\" Jenny announced brightly, another impatient grumble emerging from her tummy.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" her friend nodded, turning back around to face her, \"time for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Jenny rubbed a thick hand on her middle, \"I hope mom made pancakes again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katrina followed her big lumbering best friend out to the stairs, she had to wonder if she remembered she cleaned out the kitchen almost entirely yesterday...</span></div></div>",

Presently, Anna led the two girls out the house and locked the door behind them, and Katrina set off down the road to school.<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Asked Jenny curiously. Katrina turned.<br>\r\n\"To school, where else?\" She said, confused.<br>\r\n\"But why are you going down the road?\" She queried. \"The car's right here.\"<br>\r\nKat looked bemused.<br>\r\n\"Haha, very funny. Come on, or we won't have time to get breakfast.\" She said impatiently.<br>\r\nAnna walked over to the car and unlocked it, opening the door for Jenny then turning to her daughter's friend.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you coming in the car, Katrina?\" She asked.<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl was stunned; she'd heard of laziness, and often practised its arts herself, but never had she seen it on this scale.<br>\r\n\"But the school's right there!\" She said, glancing down the road. Indeed, their school was just at the end, only a few hundred metres away. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Jenny doesn't much like walking.\" Anna said mildly. \"You may as well get in.\"<br>\r\nAlmost reluctantly, the eight year old walked over and got into the car, strapping herself into the backseat next to Jenny. The bigger girl smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"Cars are much better than legs, you know Katty.\" She said as if it was obvious. The slimmer girl just nodded, stunned at just how lazy her best friend was. Although they'd been on loads of sleepovers together, she'd never come on a school night before and thus hadn't realised how far the fat girl would go to avoid exercise.<br>\r\nShortly, they pulled into the drive-thru of McDonald's, and Anna ordered them a large egg roll each. She then pulled up outside the school so they could finish before they went in. A few minutes later, once they'd finished their unhealthy breakfasts, both girls climbed from the car.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Miss Wattson. I had a lot of fun.\" Katrina said honestly.<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure.\" Said Anna, equally genuinely. \"Remember, you can come over any day, we're always happy to have you.\"<br>\r\nShe went to put up the window, then slid it down again, remembering something important.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'll pick you both up here after school to go shopping, okay?

Since they were dark ones no one would tell there were any stains. Katrina simply kept to her side, feeling a sense of security next to her larger companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few girls from their class spotted them and flocked over, wearing looks of concern as they greeted the two. Of course most, if not all of them, were on various levels of fatness.<br>\r\n\"How're you feeling, Jenny?\" One asked.<br>\r\n\"Is your leg all better?\" Another enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, it's all fine now,\" Jenny grinned, slightly lifting up the large leg in question. In all honesty, amongst her binging and Katrina staying over, she'd totally forgotten about faking her healed injury until it was brought up earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the first smiled, then turned her attention to the dark-haired girl, \"did you tell her about the play?\"<br>\r\nKatrina nodded. \"Yup, she knows. She wants to be an angel.\"<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Jenny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandable looks of concern spread amongst the group of girls. All aside from Jenny, who kept her trademark cheek-dimpling grin. They weren't worried about Jenny screwing up the play; she was quite a dedicated worker when she had motivation, and she seemed pretty pumped to do this. Their concern was directed toward the use of cables and ropes, and the possibility of her breaking a leg. And a few more things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, they kept their worries secret. Jenny was incredibly nice and they all considered her a friend.<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds good,\" The girl managed a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later the bell sounded, and the girls marched off toward the school building, and inside to their classroom. Jenny and Katrina took their seats next to each other, the larger girl letting out a sigh of relief as she relaxed into the too-small chair, her backside spilling over the sides and squishing out from under the backrest, and her stomach sticking into the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and their teacher, a young woman named Miss Johnson, walked in with a smile on her face. She really enjoyed working with the kids.<br>\r\n\"Good morning class,\" she greeted the class, who returned the favour in mostly bright voices, \"now before we start, if you haven't chosen what you want to do for the nativity play yet you'll have till the end of the day to decide. Before you leave for home, I'll be giving out forms for your parents to sign, with information about rehearsals and such. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids all nodded, some mumbling a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Johnson nodded back, smile unwavering. \"Good, now then...\"</span></div></div>",

She looked down at it with mild surprise before giving it a quick rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you still be hungry, you just ate!\" Jenny thought before an even louder growl escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny began to blush as every few minutes a growl would be released, each one louder than the last. Eventually, the desperate pleas for nourishment was picked up by Katrina's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina leaned over towards Jenny as another hungry growl was released from the depths of her large pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, is that your belly?\" Katrina whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm super hungry and I don't know why. I just ate and look how big my belly is\" Jenny said. To emphasis her point, she gave her belly a quick bounce before it growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny thought that her belly was this big because she stuffed it with food. In reality, her belly was bigger than she was used to because of her binging over the weekend. She got fatter and her stomach stretched out. Now with the little bit of food she had for breakfast, her belly wasn't happy. Her belly gave another growl as if to confirm this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Jenny, you need to calm that belly of yours down\" Katrina commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I think food is the only way, and Miss Johnson doesn't let us eat in class\" Jenny said as a very loud drawn out growl was released from her fleshy insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny reapplied her hands to her growling belly and began to rub it in futile attempts to calm it down. As the lesson continued the growls turned to roars and became much longer and louder. The students began to glance at her every time her stomach growled and Jenny was sure the teacher was able to hear it too, but continued to ignore her hunger. Jenny just continued to blush and rub her belly as it became louder and louder. By now, Jenny could see and feel her belly quake as the powerful growls twisted through her insides and into the outside world. She sat there and listened to the monotonous roaring of her belly until the bell finally rang, signaling the end of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class, don't forget to sign up for the play before the end of the day\" Miss Johnson reminded as the students filed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny held her belly as a very powerful growl ripped through her belly and sighed.</span></div></div>",

She hurried toward the playground with as much speed as she could muster, which wasn't exactly saying much due to being slowed by her immense size and weakened by her ravenous hunger.<br>\r\nTwo long classes had passed, and although a chocolate bar (or a few) from the vending machine had satiated her during the quick between-class break, it merely delayed the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina followed after her friend, keeping a steady pace behind her. Although she was much smaller than Jenny, the previous day's activities had done quite a number on her as well, and she found herself huffing and puffing along with the larger girl once they'd found a spot outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sat with one another on a bench, usually large enough to hold three people, four in a pinch, but the combined rears of the greedy girls filled it up completely.<br>\r\n\"Phew,\" Katrina sighed in relief, happy she could take a rest, \"why were you, huff, in such a hurry, Jen?\"<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Jenny wheezed, her much rounder face pink from the taxing effort, \"I'm so, hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her large stomach, barely contained in her shirt, let out another demanding snarl, leading its owner to affectionately rub it before reaching into her backpack. Katrina followed suit, and the two girls fished out matching brown paper bags. Jenny's mother cleverly purchased some extra McDonalds meals for the girls' lunches, though she wasn't sure what Katrina would like so hers contained a standard quarter pounder and fries, as well as a cup of cola. Jenny's, however, had a few quarter pounders, a couple of tubs of fries, and a litre bottle of Fanta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tore into the unhealthy lunch, Jenny giggled with greedy delight, unaware that her friend was staring with total shock at how huge her meal was. She was used to her best friend being such a huge eater, but sometimes the sheer amount she would stuff into her at once totally amazed her. How could she have such an immense appetite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nonetheless, as she reminded herself, that's who Jenny was, and she was her best friend and one of the sweetest, and possibly the dimmest, girls she's ever met. So she paid it no more mind and dug into her own lunch.</span></div></div>",

And, truth be told, the meal didn't taste <i>that</i> bad. It was, at the very least, better than eating carrot sticks. At the rate Jenny was eating, though, she doubted that her larger friend could even taste the food. She was very nearly inhaling it. Katrina was a bit more of a methodical eater, trying to savor what flavors there were in a McDonalds hamburger. All around her, the playground sprung to life as kids tossed their lunchboxes aside and sprang into action, tossing balls, running around, and generally screaming their heads off. She looked, swallowed a bite of burger, then glanced at Jenny- and she suddenly wondered, <i>Is that who I'm going to be?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina knew how much trouble her best friend had with a lot of things. She couldn't tie her shoes, she got tired from walking, well, anywhere- and that was all because of food. And Katrina was no stranger to food. She pulled the Quarter Pounder away from her face and eyed it suspiciously. <i>Are you gonna make me like that?</i> And she thought further. <i>What if Jenny gets even bigger? What if <b>I</b> get even bigger?</i> A cartoonish image of her and Jenny as huge round blobs floated through her mind. And she was gripped, for a moment, with a strong desire to leave Jenny behind, to run and dance and scream with the other kids. To cast away her friend for the group, to become assimilated. And she nearly did, too. She shifted her ponderous weight forward, bent forward to put her feet on the ground-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and the seam at one side of her jeans split. It was a small split, nothing anybody else would notice, but it brought her back to reality. If she went and ran now, it would only get worse. And then she thought about it again. She looked again at the other kids, and realized that, though they went through the motions of having fun, none of them looked really <i>happy</i>. Most of them actually looked angry- shouting, pushing, shoving the smaller children out of the way in their haste to get the basketball. And then she glanced again at Jenny- and she was struck by something amazing. Jenny radiated contentment. She was on her last hamburger, her face and shirt were stained with ketchup and soda, and she looked like the happiest girl in the world. The cartoonish blobs floated through her head again. Katrina smiled, leaned back, kicked her chubby legs, and decided that if that was to be her future, she wouldn't especially mind. </span></div></div>",

I'm still starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's eyes nearly bulged out of her head at that. <i>Four burgers, three extra large fries, a bottle of soda... and she's <b>still</b> hungry?</i> To be fair, Katrina could also go for a little more food- her own stomach, though tiny in comparison to Jenny's, was still large- but she wasn't about to tell herself that.

Thanks to the former's careless snacking during class and the latter's sneaking out to encourage said snacking, the two chubby girls had landed themselves in detention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir teacher was at her desk checking classwork, and Katrina had decided to make a start on her homework. Jennifer, on the other hand, was occupying herself with doodles of chocolate bars, cakes, pizzas, burgers, ice cream... all the things occupying her thoughts. Her belly, not pleased with being deprived of said treats, voiced its displeasure with yet another grumble. One that shook the wobbly dome of flab that was squished against the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Jenny,\" Katrina whispered, trying to sound encouraging, \"do some work, it'll take your mind off food.\"<br>\r\nThe larger girl sighed and drummed her plump fingers on top of her empty middle. \"But I'm too hungry to work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina rolled her eyes, silently wondering why she expected any different. Jennifer was always rather dim, but she wasn't an idiot - she could work really well when her mind was set on it. The problem was that her mind was almost always set on food, and her being hungry all throughout the school day didn't make that much better.<br>\r\nThough, that's not to say she was immune to such plights. Being a rather chubby girl herself, Katrina just managed to catch her train of thought before it drove into Candyland. An impatient growl sounded from her own belly, not nearly as bad as Jennifer's but enough to remind her that this was the time of day she'd stop in the candy store for a snack on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls felt hunger gnawing at them, and needed a way out fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes into detention, both girls perked up as a knock came at the classroom door.<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" the teacher called, and who should walk in but Jennifer's mother! Both plump girls' faces lit up with a mix of surprise and relief.<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" the woman smiled, which turned into a quizzical frown to see her daughter and her friend still sitting at their desks, \"I just came to pick up Jennifer and Katrina, and noticed they weren't outside.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" the teacher said, and got up to approach her. The girls watched curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught Jennifer snacking in class, again,\" the teacher continued in a hushed voice, \"and Katrina had sneaked out of class to encourage it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mother shook her head a bit, knowing this had to be either the fourth or fifth time her daughter was caught snacking during classtime. Though, this time she had an excuse, she thought.<br>\r\n\"That's more my fault,\" she admitted, \"I meant to do some grocery shopping after picking them up, since there's almost nothing in the house. So I had to send Jenny in rather... underfed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher blinked. 'Underfed' wasn't exactly a word she'd use to describe the overweight girl, not that she'd admit that out loud.<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said after a moment, \"well, it has been a while since the last time, and she has been working hard in class lately... I suppose I can let it slide this one time.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she smiled warmly, \"it won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n\"You're picking up Katrina as well?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, her parents won't be out of work till later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher nodded and turned to address the girls. \"I've decided to cut you girls' detentions short... provided this doesn't happen again.\"<br>\r\nBoth girls' chubby faces lit up even more, and they nodded vigorously. \"We promise!\" They chirped, though as much as they meant it, there was no guaranteeing their bellies were in agreement.<br>\r\nTheir teacher looked satisfied. \"Okay, off you go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny got up and followed her mother, with Katrina right behind her.<br>\r\n\"Are you girls okay?\" The older woman asked, voice laced with concern.<br>\r\n\"We're <i>starving</i>, mom!\" Jenny complained, her belly proving it with yet another flab-shaking grumble that made her tug her shirt down again. Katrina just nodded, sharing her best friend's suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we stop for a little something before we go shopping?\" Her mother suggested, smirking as she knew what their answer would be.<br>\r\nThe girls, knowing full well what 'a little something' meant, grinned widely. \"Yes please!\"</span></div></div>",

When they arrived at the drive-in, Jenny requested five hamburgers, eight McNuggets, and a large fries, all to be washed down with a large Fanta. Katrina, wishing to be slightly more prudent, ordered only two hamburgers, a Filet O'Fish, but gave in to a large fries and a large Sprite. The girls recieved their food- plus a medium fries for Mom- and dug in eagerly, getting salt and sauce everywhere in their haste to consume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boy,</i> thought Jenny's mother, <i>I hope that's enough food to hold them until we reach Taco Bell.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it was, and the order at Taco Bell was somewhat less extravagent- a plate of nachos and two burritos for Jenny, and just two tacos for Katrina, who was feeling rather full.

She took another glance at the girls in the back - Katrina was already unbuckled, and decided to help Jenny out of her seatbelt since the larger girl was lazily fumbling with the latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was inside, the first thing on Jenny's mind was what she was having for dinner. Even after all that fast food, she still had eating on the brain. Her next thought, hinted by a small yawn, was having a nice nap to rest off her snack until dinnertime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you girls go play outside?\" Her mother suggested, nodding to the sliding screen door in the kitchen leading to the back yard. \"I'll let you know when dinner's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside...?\" Jenny mumbled, not exactly looking fond of the idea.<br>\r\nKatrina, however, looked much more enthused. It'd be good to work off all that food, and remembering her concerns about Jenny from yesterday, a bit of exercise might do her fatter friend some good. Though she'd never admit it out loud.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Jenny,\" she insisted, taking her friend's plump hand and walking toward the door, \"it'll pass the time!\"<br>\r\nJenny, too sleepy to work up a counterargument, just waddled outside after her best friend. \"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was starting to set outside, but it was still a nice climate. Warm enough to play, but cool enough so the large Jenny wouldn't break into a heavy sweat just from being exposed to natural light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna play?\" Katrina asked, deciding to let her friend choose. It <i>was</i> her house, after all.<br>\r\nJenny smacked her lips as she tried to think of a game that didn't require food or a controller. And considering how gluttonous and lazy she was, this was a challenge in itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hide and seek?\" She decided.<br>\r\nKatrina nodded, satisfied with that. It was a proper game, at least. \"Okay, you can hide first, if you like.\"<br>\r\nJenny nodded, and looked around for a place to hide while Katrina turned around and started counting out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, Jenny decided on the tree in the corner of the yard, by the fence. She waddled over to it and pressed her back up to it, facing the fence and away from Katrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\" She heard Katrina call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she had some time to relax, Jenny slid onto her backside, leaning against the tree and getting nice and comfortable. Her full belly, the warm sun and the gentle breeze made for a heavenly combination. So much so that her eyes began to flutter shut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrrrrrrgle...</i><br>\r\nHer belly let out a gurgle, signalling its beginning to digest, now that its owner was all relaxed.<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" A burrito-smelling burp erupted from her mouth, lessening the pressure inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\" Katrina's cheerful voice jolted Jenny back awake, emitting a startled burp.<br>\r\n\"How'd you...find me...?\" Jenny mumbled, rubbing her eyes with her plump fists.<br>\r\n\"Your tummy gave you away,\" her friend giggled, \"I could hear it from way over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving Jenny a hand to stand up, which took plenty of effort, Katrina inhaled to catch her breath.</span></div></div>",

The beastly rumble was so strong that large visible vibrations shook her belly hard enough to raise her shirt all the way up it's vast expanse.

And as for my shirt...\" Jenny started before an even more powerful growl emerged from the depths of her gut. One so powerful, it popped the button clear off her pants and sent it into the neighbor's yard. \"That's why\" she finished as she held her tummy trying to keep it from wobbling too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristina just stood in awe at the display she had just witnessed.

By the time the Talent Show arrived, a month and a half later, Jenny had managed to balloon up to an even larger size than anybody had ever though possible, and now was having real trouble fitting into anything other than stretchy pants and very large shirts, desks, and even, in some cases, doors. She was now getting winded with even simple exertions like walking to class, and in some cases after especially strenuous exercise (e.g. gym class, where she would sometimes be forced to walk around the gymnasium upwards of twice) would need Katrina's help to waddle around. That was the other new thing- Jenny's enormous size had caused her to develop a very pronounced waddle. Of course, she had always waddled to some extent, but now she was so large that it was very difficult to do anything like walking normally. Luckily for her, though, she always had her faithful friend Katrina by her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina, though, had blimped up quite a bit herself. Though nowhere near the extent of Jenny, her large friend's extensive eating habits had rubbed off on her somewhat. Her clothes, which she stubbornly refused to replace, had grown quite tight on her- though she refused to acknowledge it, all of her shirts left quite a bit of her pudgy belly on display for all to see, and her pants were not much better. Still, though, next to Jenny an elephant would look skinny, so her fattened frame went largely unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, it was the day before the talent show, and Jenny and Katrina were weathering their way through the final class of said day. Jenny was, surprisingly, faring somewhat better than Katrina was- after a few more incidents involving food in class, Jenny's mother had had words with the principal and any administrator she could find, the result of which being that Jenny could eat snacks wherever and whenever she wanted. This was very good for her, as she could at least attempt to sate her cavernous stomach throughout the day, but it also meant that she couldn't focus very well- the opening and consumption of packets of food used up a large portion of her already dim brain. Katrina, however, was not so lucky, having been granted no exemption from the rules. Her smaller-yet-still-large belly was grumbling quietly at her, demanding more to eat. The fact that Jenny was rather messily eating Cheetohs was not helping matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher droned on, and on, and on, and soon Katrina found her mind wandering to the talent show tomorrow. To tell the truth, her suggestion to Jenny to use her belly as talent had been nothing more than a joke. However, her friend, with characteristic dimness, had latched onto the idea, and had treated all the food she had inhaled as \"training\" for the show. At first, Katrina had cheered her on, a little amused at her friend's antics, but as the date of the show drew closer and Jenny showed no signs of slowing down she began to get a bit worried. <i>Is she actually going to it?</i> she wondered, imagining the ridiculousness of the scene. She could feel her insides turning over themselves as she imagined Jenny on the stage, belly rumbling away, and the crowd of students laughing wildly. As the seconds ticked by, this image seemed more and more likely, and more and more terrifying. <i>Could it really happen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina was rather suddenly startled out of her reverie by the rustle of fingers on plastic. She looked over at her fat friend to see that Jenny had polished off yet another huge mound of snack food- usually enough to hold her through one class. However, a quick glance at the clock revealed that the class was not even halfway over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina,\" whispered Jenny extremely loudly, \"I'm out of snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina sighed, and prepared to heave her sizeable body out of the seat to get more, but Jenny interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, Jenny's belly interrupted her, letting out an extremely loud, desk-rattling growl that sent a tremor through the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if it couldn't get any worse, her chair finally succumbed to the eight-year-old bulk sitting upon it, collapsing to the floor with a mighty screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, rather than being embarrassed, simply patted her massive belly, so large that it was sticking out between a shirt and pants that together contained enough fabric to make a parachute, looked at Katrina, smiled, and said, \"I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina cringed. </span></div></div>",

By sheer luck she was put down as one of the last students to go. That meant poor Jenny had to wait with a terribly hungry tummy. But for her that wasn't a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GRRROOOOWWWRR* went her belly as the dome of flab shook uncontrollably. She smiled and patted the large dome of flab. This was the one time she didn't mind being hungry. In fact, it was better this way. The hungrier she was, the better her act would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the audience meanwhile, Katrina was in a state of dread.

She just slumped back in her seat and waited for her act to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack behind stage, Jenny's belly's growls continued to increase in volume and frequency until her name was finally called. Walking out onto the stage she waved at the applauding students and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Jenny\" she started as the applause died down. \"And as most of you know, I get really hungry a lot. So for my act, I thought I would use that. When I get hungry, my belly growls really loudly. And thanks to Katrina,\" she said as she looked at her. Katrina just slumped in her chair more. \"I was made aware that it was a talent I possessed. So without further a do, the act shall begin\" She said as she placed the mic right by her belly button. She began to think of all sorts of delicious food. That's when her belly began it's mega growls of insatiable hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ru...Ru...RU...RUUURRRGGGRRRRLLLLL* her belly screamed and writhed ferociously and rippled the entire surface visibly. The sound echoed throughout the entire room at an almost deafening level. The growls continued to poor out from her before her belly settled down enough for her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she said to a stunned crowd.</span></div></div>",

She would have to talk Jenny out of participating and embarrassing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she wondered if her best friend's dim head could even comprehend embarrassment, considering she almost looked proud of herself for crushing a chair with her weight.<br>\r\nThen she shook the thought away. That was her friend she was thinking about, she couldn't be that way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another rumble emanated from Jenny's enormous middle, Katrina blinked and raised her eyebrows as an idea came to her. She could save her best friend's already shaky reputation in school for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, after class had ended, Katrina helped Jenny out from the classroom and into the hallway. As she saw her best friend's great bulk wobble and bounce from waddling along, she swallowed and put her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" she spoke up, \"maybe entering the talent show isn't such a good idea...?\"<br>\r\nJenny paused and turned her head to face her, blinking curiously. \"How come? It was your idea.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she sighed, regretting making such a joke to her rather literal friend, \"but...you know why your belly rumbles, right?\"<br>\r\nJenny blinked again, and nodded. \"It means it's empty.\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Katrina nodded, \"and there's probably gonna be a lot of kids participating. What if you get put lower down on the list?\"<br>\r\nJenny tilted her head, obviously not following. Katrina managed to suppress a frustrated sigh, and put her hands on the fatter girl's shoulders.<br>\r\n\"It means you'd have to keep your tummy rumbling for a long time!\" She suddenly yelped, voice full of distress. \"You'd go so long without food! Not even the tiniest snack! They'll keep you hungry for ages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of staring into her eyes, Katrina could almost hear the cogs starting to turn in Jenny's head as realisation dawned on her. A gasp escaped her, and even her tummy's next rumble sounded rather surprised.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're right!\" She agreed, putting her pudgy hands over her tummy. \"Gosh, I never thought about that. Thanks, Katrina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat friends exchanged a tight hug - as tight as their bellies squishing together would allow - and Katrina had a smile on her plump face. Not only because her plan had worked, but because she had saved her innocent best friend from potential humiliation and starvation. Besides, what would her mother think, hearing about her daughter in such a way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two broke the hug after a while, and Jenny rubbed her hands on her massive belly with an innocent grin on her face. Katrina knew that look - the thought of training for the talent show was totally pushed out of her head. All she wanted was to get home, relax, and have a nice snack. Or two. Or three.<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Katrina smiled and nodded to the front door, \"let's find your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and happily waddled toward the doors, albeit slowly and with her friend's help.</span></div></div>",

For one thing, her daughter seemed to be taking longer and longer to get out of school every day, for some reason, and for another her and Katrina's first round of after-school snacks were getting cold, and she didn't want forty dollar's worth of McDonald's to go to waste. And, on top of that, she had left dinner cooking on the stove so it would be done sooner- she knew Jenny didn't like to wait for dinner, after all. All the same, though, it was really inexplicable why she was taking so long to get out of school. And, as any proper mother would do, she started to worry a little bit. <i>Perhaps she's feeling lethargic...She's always asking for food, could it be...</i> A sudden, very worrisome thought struck her. <i>Could it be that I'm not giving her enough food?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Jenny had inherited her incredible dimness from somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like quite a wait, the door to the school swung open and Jenny and Katrina, the former leaning heavily on the latter for support down the stairs, making their ponderous way to the car. A wave of relief flooded over Anne as she saw that they were alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, the two girls heaved their way into the car, panting and wheezing heavily, and almost immediately tore into the bags of fast food sitting in the backseat. \"How was your day?\" asked Anne over the sounds of chewing. <br>\r\n<i>\"Grrf,\"</i> said Jenny, mouth full of hamburger. <br>\r\n<i>\"Mmm,\"</i> agreed Katrina, mouth similarly full of fries. <br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Anne, and they drove off for home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when they arrived home, the girls wasted no time in extracting themselves from the confines of Anne's minivan and hurrying as fast as two fat girls could into the house to watch some television. Anne watched them head in, noting a few small tears in Jenny's pants as she did so- clearly, they needed to go shopping again. Katrina's clothes seemed equally ill-fitting, although that wasn't exactly her place to determine- Katrina, as much time as she spent at her house with Jenny, wasn't her daughter. Even so, as she set about cleaning up the detrius of the girl's first of many afternoon snacks, the only feeling in her head was pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little girl was growing up!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the afternoon went rather normal. Jenny and Katrina helped themselves to some more snacks while watching TV, and Katrina's parents came to pick her up in the evening. Just after dinner, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the kitchen table the next morning, Jenny was sat enjoying her regular breakfast; two bowls of chocolate cereal, four sausages, two scrambled eggs, poptarts - three of each flavour - and a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\nAnne, sitting across from her. simply had a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was about to chomp into her fourth poptart, when a thought occurred to her. She was sure this wasn't Saturday, but her mom didn't get her up for school so she had a nice sleep-in. She was even still in her PJs!<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom?\" She spoke up. \"Don't I have school today?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm going to take you clothes shopping today,\" Anne smiled and stroked her daughter's soft hair, \"so no school for you today, honey.\"<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Jenny chirped, taking a large bite of her poptart. \"Is Katrina coming?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, sweetie,\" Anne admitted with a shake of her head, \"but you can show her your new outfit tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay!\" Jenny grinned, and returned to gobbling up her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, just past noon, Anne and Jenny were travelling through the mall. The store Anne got her daughter's clothes had a branch here, and they specialised in clothes for...fluffier kids. And by some sort of irony, it was situated just across from the food court, where Jenny always got a nice snack after getting her new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, Jenny's huge belly, which peeked out from beneath her top, grumbled and shook her shirt higher up, revealing her belly button.<br>\r\n\"Mom, can we get something to eat?\" She asked, using her free hand to tug her shirt back down. \"Tummy says it's lunchtime!\"<br>\r\n\"I know, cupcake,\" Anne smiled, and led Jenny on to the store, \"you can have whatever you want as soon as we're done, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jenny sighed quietly, her appetite not wanting to wait for later. This was a conversation that transpired every time they came to get Jenny new clothes, and the outcome was always the same. Her mom putting cupcakes into her head didn't help the matter at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's tummy let out another unhappy growl, and all its owner could think was how grateful she was for Katrina talking her out of entering the talent show. She could never take being so hungry for so long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the store, Anne led Jenny through to the girls' section, which was full of cute, brightly coloured outfits. T-shirts, jeans, shorts, coats and all other types, made to fit more husky children. Big&amp;Tall stores were already quite successful, and providing one for kids proved to be no different, with other kids differing in age and chubbiness picking out clothes with their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny waddled ponderously behind her mom, getting rather red in the face from tiredness, and halted as she spotted something - a pink t-shirt with a cute blue dinosaur on it was hanging on a rack, with a pair of flower-styled shorts beneath it. Her round face lit up with approval.<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" She panted, and pointed a sausage-like finger to the outfit. \"Can I have that shirt and those shorts?\"<br>\r\nAnne smiled and led her over. \"Of course you can, sweetheart. Just need to try them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne reached deep and pulled out the largest sizes of shirt and shorts. She had no worries about the clothes being too big for her daughter - her own mother always said that it's always best to have clothes too loose than too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes draped over her arm, she led her gluttonous daughter over to the changing rooms and got into a booth with her. She was always happy to help her dress, knowing Jenny always had a little trouble getting it done herself.</span></div></div>",

Lift those arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sad wheeze and a similarly depressed-sounding grumble from her cavernous belly, Jenny did so, slowly raising her fat-laden arms into a position somewhat above her head. Anne cheerfully plopped the god-knows-how-many-X's on over them and pulled it down. \"Alright, now on with the shorts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, groaning disappointingly, put her hands on the wall for support, squishing her great stomach up against it as she did, and slowly leaned to one side, lifting one foot off the ground. Her mother quickly put one leg of the vast-seeming shorts around Jenny's fat leg, and, when she leaned the other way, did the same to the other foot. She pulled the shorts up as high as they would go, then stepped back to survey her daughter's new look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" said Jenny, shifting uncomfortably from the effort of standing up unsupported, \"I think it might be too small.\" For little Jenny, this was something of a record- not only had she outgrown the largest size in the largest-people-serving store in town, she had also come to this realization very quickly- under a minute, so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne clucked sadly. \"Seems so, Jen-Jen- looks like we'll need to look somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, any person with more processing power than a Chiclet could have seen that these clothes were woefully unequipped to handle the enormous quantities of flab that comprised most of Jenny. The shirt pinched her quite noticeably under the arms and left quite a lot of pale belly on display for all to see. The shorts, meanwhile, hadn't even made it halfway up Jenny's colossal thighs- although, in reality, Anne could barely tell the shorts were even on, so massive was Jenny's big belly. She had to check about three times to make certain she did. \"Well, these clothes certainly won't fit- better take them off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking clothes off of somebody as large as Jenny was just as much of a process as putting them on, just in reverse, Soon, though, Jenny was re-clothed in what she arrived in, though none the worse for wear- all the walking she had done to get to the store and all the standing she was doing in the dressing room was taking quite a lot out of her. \"Can we go get lunch <i>now?</i>\" she whined, another gurgle signalling that she was quite hungry indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear,\" said Anne, ushering her forward, but stopped short of actually leaving the room, so struck was she by an incredible realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, noticing her mother stopping, stopped as well. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Anne didn't notice, so deep in thought was she. The clothes she had just tried on Jenny were the largest the store had, and they didn't fit at all. But the clothes Jenny was wearing now <i>did</i> fit- at least somewhat- and they were a size or two smaller! Clearly, the store was cheating her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the actual explanation was most likely that Jenny's having worn the clothes for a while stretched them out to better fit her size, even though she had most certainly outgrown the number printed on them, but logic was a bit too complicated for either of them. So, steaming with rage, Anne just pushed her excessively large daughter onwards. </span></div></div>",

Though they both were rather dim compared to the general public, this dimness manifested itself in rather different ways-  Jenny was actually a reasonably creative and intelligent thinker, just very, very slow. Anne, on the other hand, was fairly fast, but generally misinterpreted the world around her and preferred to have orders given to her rather than think of something alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, when, mid-burger, she had a good idea on her own, it was much like watching a cruise ship crash into a small island- slow, and with great drama. So deep in thought was she that her greasy hamburger slipped through her fingers and landed on the tray with a mushy <i>platch</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked up, confused, mouth still full of her third burrito, and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne took a minute to answer, still processing her brilliant plan, but finally managed to say, \"Jen-Jen, we can still get you clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, by now on to her fifth hamburger, asked, \"Really? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, somewhat flustered, reached for her own hamburger and said, \"Don't worry about it, sweetie-pie. When you finish up I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n___________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Jenny, huffing slightly from the walk from the food court, \"I've never been in here before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local Kohl's was really nothing to be impressed with- it was merely a clothing store, after that, and even then not a terribly outstanding one. Still, it was the first time Jenny had ever had occasion to visit it- and, to her rather dim brain, it was most certainly something to be in awe of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne led her onward, passing the jewelry, the men's clothing, the changing rooms and, to her surprise, the kid's section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, don't I need to get clothes there?\" she asked, raising her arm with some effort and pointing a fat finger at the kid's section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne smiled. \"No, dear, you've become much too...<i>grown-up</i> for things like that! Just come on, we'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to the very lardy Jenny, going just that little bit farther to the women's section felt like ages. As soon as she saw a bench she heaved herself upon it, wheezing heavily, ignoring the rather ominous creak from the wood below her. Anne patted her lightly on her sweaty head and went off in search of clothes. </span></div></div>",

She wasn't worried about leaving Jenny sitting on the bench - her poor little girl was exhausted, and needed a nice long sit after all that lunch and walking.<br>\r\nShe kept her eye out for more bright, kid-like clothes. This may have been the adult area, but Jenny didn't need to dress like one just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as luck would have it, something caught her eye. A pink shirt with a blue, cartoon horse on it. Just across from that were bottoms - most notably, a pair of flowery, aqua-blue shorts. Eerily similar to the outfit from the other store, but since that was the outfit Jenny wanted, no doubt she'd be happy with her mother's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne grabbed the larger sizes of each from near the back of the rails, the shirt stopping short of looking like a dress on the slightly tubby woman. She headed back to her daughter, who had gotten most of her breath back, and held up the outfit.<br>\r\n\"How does this look, dear?\" She asked with a smile.<br>\r\nJenny's sweaty, reddened face lit up with wonder as she beheld the clothes. \"Wow, I like them! But, do I have to try them on?\" She added, a hint of reluctance in her voice.<br>\r\nHer mother nodded sadly. \"It's the only way to know we've got the right size, honeybun. C'mon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraping the clothes over her shoulder, she held out her hand for Jenny to take. Her daughter lifted a plump hand and grabbed it as she, with some help, hoisted her heavyset frame off the bench and waddled toward the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jen-Jen, arms up again!\" Anne smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another tired wheeze, Jenny hauled her flabby arms up again, just barely over her head. Anne slipped her old shirt off, allowing her titanic belly to bounce free once more, and slipped the new one on, tugging it down over her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now for the shorts.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny practically flopped against the wall, hands pushed and stomach squished up against it, and just barely tilted to lift a fat-laden leg. Anne slipped one leg of the shorts past her daughter's plump foot, and did the same when she tilted the other way before pulling them up. Luckily, the waistband was stretchy elastic, so no button required!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne took a step back. \"Okay, sweetie-pie, let me see how you look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, Jenny pushed herself off the wall to stand upright, and turned herself to let her mother have a look. Her new shirt fit perfectly, albeit a little snug around the tummy. There was a bit of pinch around her flabby upper arms, but not nearly as much as the shirt from earlier.<br>\r\nThe shorts were also faring much better. They made it up past her thunderthighs, and despite being a little tight around the rear, the waistband wrapped neatly and comfortably around her. Her legs were a little squished by the shorts legs, but she didn't seem bothered by it, judging by the lack of adjusting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks much better,\" Anne chirped, grinning happily, \"how does it feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Comfier,\" Jenny huffed, totally honest despite her exhaustion and hint of frustration, \"can we get them, mommy?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course we can, cupcake,\" Anne nodded, and gently lifted her daughter's flabby arms, \"now, let's get these off so we can pay for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny just heaved another tired sigh. This shopping trip was the most exercise she had gotten all week!</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for Jenny, and unfortunately for Anne's wallet, the route back led them past the food court. Upon smelling the somewhat delectable scent of a pizza, Jenny's enormous belly was gripped with pangs of hunger, despite having eaten not half an hour before. \"Mommy,\" she said, tugging desparately on Anne's shirt, \"can we stop and get some more to eat?\" Anne looked at her with some incredulity, so she quickly follwed up with \"And I've really been doing a <i>lot</i> of exercise today, and Nurse Hatchinson says it's very important to balance out your exercise and your eating!\" Of course, Nurse Hatchinson was not referring to three-to-four-hundred-pound children when she said that, nor was she implying that to balance out walking a few hundred feet one must consume several thousand calories of fast food, but to Anne this made perfect sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sweetie, we'll stop and have a little snack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny would have jumped for joy, had she been able to jump. As it was, she settled for a light pump of one fattened fist and sat her fat butt down at a table, vastly overtaxing and overflowing the single chair she had chosen.

She'd have to do another tour of the food court. <br>\r\nNot that it bothered her at all.

She wolfed down every burger, poured every box and baggie of fries into her mouth, emptied every cup of soda, demolished every burrito, inhaled every sandwich, and even drank the remains of her KFC gravy straight from the tub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how much could one little girl eat?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>How much could one little girl eat?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question was on every mind in the food court- servers, customers, even Anne to some extent. It manifested in those who stared, rapt, at Jenny's glutting, and those who tried their hardest to look politely away. Some posted it on Snapchat or Twitter, others simply filed it for later, but it was a room-wide wonder- some even sure that the girl herself would end up room-wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForkful after forkful, fry after fry, calorie upon calorie upon incredibly fattening calorie all disappeared down Jenny's throat into her ravenous belly. She ate like she had not eaten in days despite it only having been minutes, frantically stuffing herself fuller and fuller to try to appease the yawning pit of her stomach. Tray after tray were entirely cleaned of all sustenance, only to be quickly replaced by a terrifically hurried Anne. More and more she ate, testing the mettle of her newly-purchased clothes both by size and sauce. But, as with all things, it eventually ended. After running (figuratively) the gamut of all eight restaurants, Jenny delicately plucked the final french fry from the final tray, stuffed it in her mouth, said \"Thank you,\" belched the loudest belch anyone watching had ever heard, and fell right to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, out several hundreds of dollars in food and having to deal with an impossibly fat, very asleep daughter, was somewhat at a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere appeared to be no way to move Jenny from her chair- she was far too fat for the fairly small Anne to lift, much less move, and several light prods to her swollen belly yielded nothing more than a shift in weight and an alarming creak from the chair. She was all to aware of the eyes on her, eyes filled with judgement and malice, yet she had no way to remove herself or her fat, bloated daughter, who was even now bulging out of her new clothes, leaving several inches of vast belly on display for the judging eyes to judge further. In an attempt to remain composed, she cleaned up the detritus of her daughter's second lunch, tossing fourteen trays' worth of trash into the bins, but even then the others still watched, wondering, hating. Desparate for some absolution, Anne faced the crowd, trying to speak, to explain, to apologize. But, in the face of all those eyes, she could say nothing. She sunk down into a chair, defeated, and hid her face. Jenny, oblivious, slept on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis scene remained, unchanging, for nearly half an hour. Jenny slept, dreaming lightly of food and food by-products, sauce stains drying on her massive new shirt. Anne sat next to her, hunched over the greasy table, head buried in her hands. She was mortified- so rarely in her life had she been noticed for anything, but then all eyes were on her- and in the worst way possible. She didn't know what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, quiet self-reflection, even under the worst of circumstances, often yields good thoughts, and this was no exception. Anne sat bolt upright, fully stricken with her second idea of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a wheelchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, luckily for her, there was a station for them just a few hundred feet from the table where Jenny slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging eyes forgotten, Anne leaped to her feet and headed for the mobility scooter parking area, and soon found one suitable for the task at hand. She drove it, rapidly, back to Jenny, parked it next to her overly-fattened daughter, and stood up, earning even more irate glares from the judgmental ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not be able to lift anything over 80 pounds, but, when it was in this form, she could rather easily push much more than that. So she did, and with a bit of good shoving she was able to situate her large daughter somewhat well on the seat of the scooter. Then, leaning over the controls, she drove her big little girl to the exit of the mall, and, with more shoving, was able to seat her in the sedan. She left the scooter there- somebody else could deal with it- and, finally, drove home. She wondered, and not for the last time, if she was doing the right thing. If all the judgmental looks in the mall were right, and she was wrong. Then, in the rear-view mirror, she caught a glimpse of Jenny's sleeping face. Stained though it was with food, and red though it was from exertion and sweat, she was still just the cutest thing Anne had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne smiled, and drove on. </span></div></div>",

While the shirt fit, barely, it was strained to the max by Jenny's incredible belly. Said belly was the increase in size Katrina noticed earlier. The weight gained from Jenny's binge manifested itself soly on her tummy. The behemoth was a perfectly round ball that managed to defy gravity as it bulged out obscenely far from her with relatively little sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Jenny, you look...different\" Katrina said. \"Did you do something with your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggled. \"No, but I did get new clothes. What do you think?\" she asked as she spun around. She tried to stop after one turn but the incredible mass called her belly forced her to turn once more before she was able to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look good!\" Katrina replied. Truthfully, it was just nice to see that tummy covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought that, Jenny went pale and gripped her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh\" Jenny mumbled as she continued to rub her huge orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny are you okay?\" Katrina asked. She was genuinely concerned for her friend. Was she having a heart attack? Was she going to throw up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head no as a powerful growl tore through her belly and visibly rippled the orb and caused the shirt to ride all the way up it's vast expanse. Jenny held her tummy as the growl continued at a very loud level, before quieting down to a series of gurgles before silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\" Jenny said as she continued to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina was just in awe. She had never heard a belly growl that loud before. And that was before class even started! Who knows how loud her belly could get by lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You packed snacks and a lunch right?\" Katrina asked her starving friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did but...I ate them all already\" Jenny replied sadly as another growl visibly rippled her gut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the teacher walked in and began the lesson. Class seemed to drag on and on . The entire time Jenny's belly was getting louder and louder. The rippling of her belly started to cause her desk to scoot away from her and push her chair backwards. All poor Jenny could do was rub her belly and hope that she could at least make it to the end of class so she could think of something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Anne had pulled into the driveway, as if on miraculous cue, Jenny had begun to stir from her deep sleep. She grunted quietly, smacking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, honey,\" Anne said softly, knowing how sensitive her daughter was when just waking up, \"we're home.\"<br>\r\nAnother grunt sounded from the overfed girl, who rubbed her plump fists on her tired eyes. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\nThe leaner woman got out and got to the side door, unbuckling Jenny's belt and letting her adjust herself so her thick legs dangled out. The girl's overindulged tummy, just barely fitting under her new shirt again, took up a good amount of her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jen-Jen,\" Anne muttered, wrapping her arms around the girl's globular middle and feeling them squish into her love handles, \"ready?\"<br>\r\nJenny simply flopped her flabby arms onto her mother's shoulders and lazily leaned against her. \"Uh-huh...\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, one, two, three!\" With as much care as she could muster, Anne heaved the (at least) three-hundred pounder off the seat and onto the ground. Both let out an exerted grunt when it was over; Anne from the sharp but temporary pain in her arms and back, and Jenny from being squished up and having to stand again. \"Phew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy,\" Jenny muttered sleepily, still groggy from her nap, and sluggishly waddled toward the house with her mother's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, honeybun,\" Anne cooed, crouching down and setting a tall glass of orange soda on the little table next to Jenny, who was nestled comfortably into the side of the couch, in perfect view of the TV. The seat next to her was occupied by a large bag of BBQ chips and and a pair of sharing-size chocolate bars.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy,\" Jenny giggled, a lot more awake and happy now that she was back in her comfort zone. In fact, she actually mustered the energy to lean forward and give her mother a hug around her shoulders. \"I love you so much!\"<br>\r\nAnne's heart melted at the display of affection, and returned the hug before adding a loving kiss on her clean, chubby cheek. \"I love you too, sweetie-pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anne got up and walked out of the living room, taking one last look at her daughter before going to the kitchen.<br>\r\nShe sat at the table, and began to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about back at the food court, most notably what Jenny had done there. Fourteen trays of food, all emptied into her daughter's mouth in one sitting. That was all just a second lunch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes she had bought just minutes before her daughter ate were already threatening to be outgrown. Though they looked more or less the same now, albeit with some dried stains, how long would it be until she outgrew that outfit?<br>\r\nAnd the looks she got... goodness, the people there were not impressed. All those scathing stares at her and her daughter for eating so much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as Anne leaned over to look through the doorways toward the couch, another thought came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from there, she could see the brightness in Jenny's eyes. The gleam of innocent happiness in every child. Jenny seemed totally clueless about how big she was or how much she was eating; she was happy with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne began to rationalise. There was nothing wrong with Jenny at all, or her upbringing. She was happy, and she just had a healthier appetite and bulkier build than most kids.<br>\r\nWhat did she care what strangers thought of her? How she raised her daughter was none of their business. Jenny was leading a happy, comfortable life, and she felt no need to take it away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Jenny <i>did</i> have a lot of exercise today, so of course she was going to eat more than usual to balance it out. It made total sense, now that she thought about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at the clock hanging on the kitchen wall, and she straightened up as she saw that it was nearly six in the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of eating,</i> Anne thought as she got up and went to the oven, <i>better start on dinner!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so the pampering continued. Anne hustled and bustled in the kitchen, racing from cabinet to stove to countertop to fridge, preparing a casserole, a stew, and a stir-fry all at once. Spices flew, pots bubbled, and pans sizzled, all reminders that Anne needed to stir this, add that, and most certainly clean the kitchen later. She worked and worked and worked, tiring herself further after an already tiring day- but to her, it was all worth it. Anything was worth it to see Jenny happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jenny simply sat on the couch, idly eating her way through barbecue chips and watching a show on Nickelodeon. She was doing nothing to help, of course- she'd worked far too hard today for something like that- yet she was going to reap all the rewards, all the benefits, and simply go on getting larger. Even now, her massive second lunch was digesting, turning itself into more pounds for her already overburdened frame. Being dim, Jenny was not at all aware of the future consequences of how she ate, but if she kept up this pace she'd certainly see them before too long. But, as it was, these thoughts didn't bother her in the least, so she went on sitting and noshing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a fairly long amount of time during which Jenny successfully ate three family-sized bags of chips, Anne wearily called \"Dinner is served!\" and, when her bulgy daughter failed to make an appearance, went out in to the living room to help Jenny stand up. Anne strode quickly back to set the table, and Jenny, after a luxurious stretch, set off on the long waddle in the same direction. She made it, luckily for her grumbling stomach, and, with her mother's help, settled herself in a vastly overtaxed and overflowed chair. Jenny looked at her large dinner, forehead damp with sweat from her trek from couch to chair, and smiled. Anne smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was quite a lot of food- Anne had broken out the industrial cookware she had bought on a whim some years ago. Nearly two gallons of stew, a casserole dish four inches deep, and a pan as wide as Jenny's fat arm was long graced the table with their presence. Jenny, sniffing the air, was in heaven. And, with a great ladleful of stew, she began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done, Mommy,\" said Jenny, letting her fork clatter to her plate. Somewhat surprisingly, she had not actually eaten everything, but she'd certainly eaten well over half of every dish. Anne, however, was pleased, because not only did it mean, to her slow brain, that her daughter was actually <i>not</i> fat (her not finishing, to Anne, looked like self-control, rather than fullness after eating four meals and countless snacks), it also meant that she could serve the leftovers as breakfast the next morning before school- she was, after all, <i>so</i> tired. So, without much further ado, she helped Jenny off the chair, up the stairs, and into her very undersized pajamas, and, leaving her to brush her teeth alone, went back downstairs to clean the kitchen and put the food away. After what seemed like forever, Anne finished that, turned off the lights, and, pausing briefly to help her flabby daughter into her bed, went into her own room, undressed, and crashed. Sleep, then, seemed like the best idea in the entire world. </span></div></div>",

Since Jenny hadn't shown up at school yesterday, and she had collapsed after crushing a chair the day before that, she was worried her poor friend had hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to her side - as much rushing as a rather portly girl like Katrina could do, at least - she exchanged a hug with her larger friend and dutifully helped her lumber toward the doors. She could see Jenny's round, pink face slowly turning red from tiredness at all the walking, so she'd have to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the two made it to the classroom alright, and Jenny sat herself down at her desk, the new chair creaking ominously beneath her. It seemed her little fiasco the other day was just a fluke - the chair was particularly old, so of course the heavyset girl demolished it beneath her bulk.<br>\r\nThough, a thought in the back of Katrina's mind told her that it wouldn't be long before she crushed this chair too. She pushed the thought away, feeling bad for thinking that of her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got sat down, and Jenny had regained her breath, she was more than happy to recount how she'd spent her 'sick day' to Katrina. She talked about her new clothes, the adult clothes store, her two trips to the food court, and her great nap before dinner. Katrina stayed quiet, listening intently to her friend's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Jenny really outgrow the plus-size kids' store clothes? She really ate fourteen whole trays of food? And she really fell asleep right there in the food court?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Jenny didn't seem ashamed of it - she didn't seem to comprehend humiliation. She was just happy that she found some new clothes and got to eat some great food. Katrina had to admit, that was a really sweet outlook on the whole thing. Plus, it was refreshing to see her large friend had finally found a shirt that properly covered that massive tummy of hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was the fattest, dimmest and most innocent person Katrina had ever seen in her life. And she wouldn't have her any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that rationalisation, Katrina smiled at her best friend, glad that she had such a fun day. Except for all that walking around and trying on clothes - she felt bad about that mental image of her being so exhausted, and wished she could be there to help her get around.

Now, to warm up, who can tell me what 15 times 32 is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's head lolled slightly, bored already with only thirty seconds of instruction. Her chins squished together as she looked around, eyes lazily flitting from one object to the next. She drummed her chubby fingers on her very chubby belly, anxious for any sort of distraction. The class turned their pages, so she, rather startled, did too, anxious to not be noticed as distracted. A quick look at the book yielded nothing of interest except a picture of ice cream in one corner. <i>Ice cream...mmm...I haven't had any in quite a while...</i> she mused to herself, glancing around the room again. The clock told her only that ten minutes had passed. Disappointed, she resumed thinking about ice cream, but, in doing so, she realized that she was somewhat peckish. No, hungry. No, RAVENOUS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly, always helpful in these endeavors, growled quite loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina looked in shock at her best friend. Usually she started to crave snacks at about 11, then again at 1, but NEVER at 8:45 in the morning! Jenny looked, mildly surprised, at her belly, but then turned her gaze to Katrina and nodded slightly, setting her face jiggling. Katrina looked at her, then at the teacher, then at Jenny again, and raced off to find snack foods. Katrina suspected this would not be the last snack run of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right. Katrina had been rather put to work- not a good state for the very pudgy girl. She had been forced to make a snack run every hour, and sometimes twice in one! Miss Forsythe looked more and more irritated every time she left the room, so it was a lucky thing for both Jenny and Katrina that lunch had finally arrived. The two girls had learned from their previous lunch troubles, and this time spent both lunch and recess firmly planted in the cafeteria, consuming large homemade lunches and then several platters of school food- Jenny, of course, more so, but Katrina had herself eaten quite a bit. Even so, Katrina was somewhat worried- Jenny always seemed to get hungry in the afternoon, despite lunch, and she was sure today would be no exception. Would the vending machine even be enough for the ravenous Jenny?</span></div></div>",

Anne couldn't figure it out, and worried somewhat that the normal quantity of after-school snacks wouldn't be enough for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the two girls tore into their snacks as per usual, Anne relaxed slightly. Jenny didn't seem to be the mindless food machine she had been yesterday, taking time in between burgers to engage in conversation, and Anne arrived at the same conclusion Katrina had, hours earlier- that Jenny's monumental belly had just been thrown off by the strenuous excercise of the previous day. But, now that Anne knew that, she resolved that Jenny should never again have to experience such an upset to her daily diet again. <i>But how?</i> she wondered, driving onwards. <i>How?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She resolved that her cute little daughter would no more have to burden herself with long walks, nor worry that there was any place she could not go. For, whatever the place, her all-new, battery-powered transport would get her there. She could see it now- her Jen-Jen, no longer encumbered with walking, happy as a clam and free as a bird. Everywhere would be open to her, everything would be-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on, it cost <b><i>fifteen hundred dollars?</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, incredulous, refreshed the page.

And that was just the <i>starter</i> model- a few clicks more revealed that the higher-end and larger-load-bearing models only climbed in price. <i>And,</i> on top of that, Anne slowly began to realize that she would have to make some rather extreme modifications to her minivan in order to fit the scooter inside, which would undoubtedly raise the price still further.

It seemed that Jenny had run out of chips and was trying, desparately, to stand, huffing and puffing and pushing herself forward, all to no avail. Katrina stood up and tried to assist her, but even then could not pull her massive friend off the sagging couch. Finally, with a sigh of mild exasperation, Katrina stalked away into the kitchen, and Jenny, sheepishly, licked the crumbs off her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe,</i> thought Anne sadly, watching her daughter's struggles to move, <i>maybe we can find the money somewhere.</i></span></div></div>",

We'll be there shortly!\" Anne said cheerily, stepping on the gas slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" said Jenny, somewhat disconsolately. Her belly, similarly disconsolate, let out a small groan. Jenny pressed her hands to it. \"I'm hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, dear!\" Anne said, exasparatedly. \"You just ate breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but that was an <i>hour</i> ago... and I did have to walk <i>all</i> the way to the car...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine,\" groaned Anne, \"but we'll have to be fast, okay honey? I don't want to be too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" said Jenny happily, setting her entire body into motion. \"I want six hamburgers- no, seven- and twenty nuggets, and a chicken sandwich, and four large fries, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne could almost hear her wallet crying out in pain as her daughter's order grew longer and longer. She just hoped that this second breakfast would be enough to hold Jenny through the next few hours- and, more worryingly, whether the mobility scooter they were going to get would be enough to hold Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jenny had done nothing in the previous few months but grow, and grow, and <i>grow</i>. She had gone from at least three hundred pounds to most definitely four hundred, and it showed. Jenny was outgrowing clothes nearly as fast as her mother could get more, which meant that most of the time at least some portion of her belly, if not the whole thing, was left on display by her tentlike-yet-undersized clothes. Her belly, in particular, was really quite something- it had reached past her knees and slapped against her legs whenever she walked, and when she sat in low seats, as she did now, it nearly touched the floor. The rest of her had not neglected to gain, either- her butt had grown to such a size that she now needed two chairs whenever she sat so as to evenly spread the weight. Up above, her chest had blossomed early, growing so that Anne was seriously considering buying her a bra. She was now well on her way, as well, to developing a third chin. Anne, looking at her daughter's vast belly swinging gently just above the floor, thought that this scooter could not have been better timed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's mobility had, naturally, also taken a hit. Now, even with Katrina's help, she could barely make it to her next classes, let alone outside- they would sometimes have to take three breaks for Jenny to be able to make it all the way. Anne was not even sure if she could walk on her own now- she figured, with all the pampering she was getting, that it was unlikely. In fact, she was sure she couldn't- she could hear her daughter wheezing slightly from the effort of just sitting. As she listened, and watched her daughter's huge body jiggle, she felt nothing but love. She would make sure her daughter would never have to worry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed a short drive to Anne and interminable to Jenny, the van pulled into the parking lot of EasyGo Mobility Scooters. As was usual, Anne hopped out of the car and proceeded to help Jenny get out- a task, she soon realized, that would soon enough be over. Jenny, however, took no notice of the sign, so tired was she from the effort of standing up. Anne, curious to see whether her daughter was even the slightest bit capable, walked on ahead. Jenny, after a few minutes rest, realized she had been left behind, and so, mustering all of her strength, swung her enormous body entirely to one side, thereby moving one fat foot forwards. Then, she did it again, and a third time, then a fourth- then, leaned up against the car again, wheezing loudly in distress. Anne, realizing the ordeal she had put her daughter through, ran back, wiped her sweaty forehead, apologized profusely, and helped her onward. <br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jenny and Anne were standing inside the air-conditioned lobby of the scooter store, one wheezing. the other greeting the rather baffled salesman. \"I trust you have my purchase ready?\" Anne asked the man somewhat frostily. He, anxious to avoid the weird mother and her freakily fat kid, hurried off to retrieve it. Anne helped Jenny to a bench, and when the young girl recovered her breath, she asked, \"Mommy, why are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\" started Anne, but the rearrival of the salesman interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chairman Deluxe, just like you requested, ma'am!\" he said perkily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stared, wide-eyed, at what was to become her new seat. Anne kissed her lightly on one fat cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will,\" Jenny replied. </span></div></div>",

A large pond of clean water, which on a bright and sunny day like this, was perfect for swimming in.

Be careful now!\"<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Jenny sighed at her mom's worrying, and simply relaxed as she felt the cool water on her flabby body.

Gotcha!\" cried Sandra, clambering up onto the rock where he stood and tagging him firmly with one hand. \"Told ya I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel, distracted by something in the lake, said nothing. \"Daniel?\" Sandra asked again, looking at him with some confusion. \"Hey, Emily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said their glasses-wearing older sister exasparatedly, pushing plants out of her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Daniel's gone stupid.\" said Sandra with some concern, waving one hand in front of Daniel's blank face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Become</i> stupid, Sandra...and besides, I knew that already,\" groaned Emily, finally catching up the pair. \"Now, what-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, look,\" Daniel said slowly, emerging from his trance and pointing one finger at the lake. \"Is that...a new raft?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra and Emily both followed his pointing finger to the spot in the lake, where a new raft did appear to be sitting. Emily sighed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but what does that have to do with anythi-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm checking it out!\" said Daniel gleefully, taking off his shirt. \"Last one there is a rotten egg!\" And with that, he jumped off the rock into the lake a few feet below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is ON!\" shouted Sandra, doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Mom said never to jump into unfamiliar waters! Guys...oh, come on!\" groaned Emily, finally following after them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Daniel, the town had not invested in a new raft- it was only Jenny's vast, pale belly, bobbing along the surface of the water. Its owner bobbed along similarly, enjoying the sun and the weightless feeling the water gave her- despite weighing well over four hundred pounds, she was still quite capable of floating, especially with the vast quantity of soda she had just drunk. The day was great, the weather was fine, all was going extremely well-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-until, that is, she felt somebody else's hand on her soft and malleable belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww!\" cried a boy just next to her. \"It's all soft!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A soft raft? I knew Daniel was stupid,\" said another voice, this one a girl's. Jenny felt another hand touch her and recoil in surprise. \"Gross, you're right! What kind of raft is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl one,\" said Jenny proudly, righting herself so as to stand up on the lake floor (she had, naturally, only gone a few feet away.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree lithe faces stared back into her round one. \"Wow,\" said the boy, after a moment. \"You're really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel!\" cried a girl in the back, round glasses covered with water from the lake. \"Say you're sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, of course, didn't notice the insult in this, and cut the boy off before he could. \"I know! Isn't it awesome?\" Oblivious to their slack-jawed stares, she offered one flabby hand to shake. \"My name's Jenny, who are you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Daniel,\" said the boy finally, shaking her hand back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra,\" said the girl next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily,\" said the girl in the back, reaching over her brother to do so. \"We're all siblings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's face lit up. \"You guys are all <i>siblings?</i> Wow! I've never had any siblings! I'm kinda jealous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have the other two!\" said all three siblings at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, again, missed the point completely. She smiled even wider. \"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siblings looked at each other, then back at her. \"No...sadly my mom likes them,\" said Daniel, looking at his two sisters with no small disgust. Emily glared back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Jenny, a little sadly. \"Well...can we still be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three siblings looked at each other again, and finally said...</span></div></div>",

All three siblings stared in awe at how absolutely <i>massive</i> she was out of the water!<br>\r\nEmily and Daniel led the way, while Sandra and Jenny followed a little distance behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see how huge she is?!\" Daniel whispered to his sister.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be rude,\" Emily whispered back, \"Mom said never to judge on appearances, and Jenny seems really nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" the younger boy admitted, \"Mrs. Francis next door is a big lady, and she's really nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Emily said matter-of-factly, pushing her glasses further up her face. Daniel stuck his tongue out at her, but said no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three siblings worked together to get Jenny up the rock. The poor girl was huffing and puffing, sweat dribbling down the side of her red face, but she wasn't unhappy. She had made some new friends, after all!<br>\r\nOnce all four were at the top, they walked - waddled, in Jenny's case - to the edge of the rock. They were right - the rock was covered in some kind of substance that made it not slippery despite the kids' wet feet.<br>\r\nThey leered over the edge and saw it was a clear drop to the water below, no sign of anything to hurt them. The water seemed deep enough to even catch Jenny if she tumbled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Daniel smirked at the girls, \"who's goin' first?\"</span></div></div>",

Jenny was still trying to catch her breath, five minutes later, from the arduous journey up to this rock- even though she was supported the entire way. She promised herself she would never do anything so difficult again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\" asked Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu?\" Jenny said, turning her head rapidly in Emily's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"saynosaynosaynosayno\" chanted Daniel under his breath. Jenny, as usual, didn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'll give it a try!\" she said, beaming. Her knee-length belly growled lightly. She was definitely going to need something to eat after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with great effort, she, all by herself, waddled the single step necessary to get to the edge of the rock, and allowed herself to tip forward into the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe splash was like nothing any of the three children had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater shot up from the lake like a fountain, splashing all three of the siblings. Waves rippled out from the crash site and swept along the lake, buffeting small children and swimming couples further away in their wake. Once the three children had gathered their senses again, they peeked over the edge to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be no way to keep her daughter safe from the perils of exercising, no way to be sure she was fed all the time, especially not since she was out of the house for seven hours a day anyway.

Everything could be ordered online now anyways- why bother going shopping? And, for that matter, if Jenny was going to be at home all the time anyway, why even bother with clothes? In a way, this could <i>save</i> money- no more gasoline in going to stores, even food could be ordered online these days. Not once did the negative ramifications of being a hermit ever cross Anne's mind, naturally. In her frantic state there could <i>be</i> no negative ramifications. So she read, and read, and read, absorbing useful tidbit after useful tidbit as the afternoon creeped by. So engrossed was she that she nearly missed preparing dinner- only a distressed cry from Jenny and a similarly angry noise from Katrina bought her back to the present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" said Anne carefully, after Katrina had left, \"school has been pretty hard for you lately, hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Jenny looked away from the television for a moment. \"No, not really, I don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, moving around and all- hasn't that gotten to be a pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny considered this. \"Well, yeah, I guess, but why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnne pounced. \"Jenny, what do you say to being homeschooled? You wouldn't have to burden yourself with anything- we can order everything here, and just have a lot of fun together, you and I. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" said Jenny, filled with confusion, \"can...can I think about it? I really don't want to miss this episode, it's a very important one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" clucked Anne disappointedly, \"but let me know, ok? It's a very important question!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, I will,\" huffed Jenny, waving one fat hand dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sweetie,\" said Anne, smiling despite herself. \"Tell me tomorrow, alright?\" And, with a light kiss on the forehead, Anne left, leaving Jenny to her cartoons. As she ascended the stairs to her bedroom, she hoped it would work out for the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast the next morning...</span></div></div>",

Anne frowned and reluctantly pulled away, feeling helpless. She wanted nothing more than to rescue Jenny from all that difficulty- but how could she rescue someone who doesn't want to be rescued?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question stuck with her all day- through her drive to work, through every email sent, phone call received, and associate met, and still she had nothing. There appeared to be no solution to her problem, only a circle which could not be broken. The problem could be simply put as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Jenny is far too large to go to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Jenny cannot be without Katrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Katrina goes to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, 4) Jenny must go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...see number 1.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnne could see no way around this. The only ways seemed to be if Jenny either lost weight- an involuntary shudder passed through her as she thought this- or if Katrina were somehow able to spend all day with Jenny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne's eyes widened. <i>Of course, how haven't I realized already!</i> she thought to herself, smacking her steering wheel in annoyance-tinged triumph. <i>Summer is coming!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was- and, since summer was the school holiday, Katrina could probably sleep over ever day! Jenny would be in heaven, and Katrina would probably enjoy herself too! And, best of all, Anne wouldn't have to pose the question of homeschooling again until next school year, at which time Jenny would probably be too large to protest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, mustn't think that way,</i> Anne chided herself, pushing those thoughts out of her mind. For now, she needed to focus on her new plan- getting Katrina to spend the summer with them. </span></div></div>",

Not long after Jenny and Katrina met, their parents decided to meet up and get to know one another. The moms really hit it off, and they often met up to chat and gossip about goings on. It helped that Suzie absolutely adored Jenny, and treated her like a second daughter whenever she saw her. The feeling was mutual for Anne and Katrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, summer vacation for the girls is coming up, so I was just wondering earlier if Katrina would like to spend it here with Jenny?

Oh, Mom, you're the BEST!\" And, stuffing one final bit of chicken in her mouth, she went over to envelop her mother in a- for Suzie, anyway- rather squishy hug. <i>Clearly, Jenny's rubbing off on her...</i><br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few streets away, a similar scene was taking place, save that both the meal and the consumer of said meal were quite a bit larger. Jenny, having consumed her dinner roughly three hours ago, at 5, was now busily engaged in eating her supper. Anne rationalized giving her this meal as being better than waking up for a midnight snack, which Jenny had had to do a few times before. Of course, eating twice in one evening would certainly add pounds to Jenny's already pound-laden frame, but Anne would prefer not to consider that thought, preferring to pay attention to the present and little else. At present, though, was the issue of summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" Anne said, sipping from a mug of tea as her daughter devoured some potatoes, \"you don't have any plans in particular for the summer, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jenny grunted, her mouth full, \"nothing really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll be pleased to know that I've invited Katrina to come stay with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stopped eating- a rarity for the large girl- and looked at her mother, very surprised. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne sipped her tea again. \"Why, yes- I figured it would be more fun than sitting around here all by our lonesomes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mom, you're AMAZING!\" Jenny's chubby face broke out into a wide grin, and she stood to give her mother a hug. Or tried, anyway- her fattened frame was rather too large for her to hoist off her two chairs by herself. Anne got the message, though, and was soon enveloped in an incredibly flabby hug. <i>Hopefully, Katrina will be able to help out a little...or a lot...</i></span></div></div>",

Her enormous, nearly-on-the-floor swell of belly growled in concert with the thoughts from her food-addled brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina's own smallish belly, rather out of character, growled too. She clutched at it nervously. \"Um...where are our snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, reminded of her forgetfulness, smacked herself in the forehead. \"Oh my goodness, I completely forgot! I'll get you two something as soon as possible, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, swearing under her breath, she kicked the van into a much higher gear. Jenny's belly, displeased with this change in its rather set eating schedule, growled again. Anne swore lightly under her breath and hit the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no oh no oh NO! Damn!\" Anne shouted, not bothering to keep her swear words under her breath any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Jenny said, sitting her fat self up with difficulty. Katrina, too, sat up and stared out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne slammed her hands on the steering wheel in disgust. \"They're doing construction! We're stuck in traffic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's fat face took on a look of sheer panic. \"W-What? Does that mean I won't get food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, fed up with the traffic and unhappy with her daughter's rather stupid question, nearly blew up, but luckily Katrina stepped in just in time. \"Don't worry, Katrina! I saved some of my lunch, do you want to have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in front of Jenny's hungry eyes, Katrina rummaged around in her bag and produced a largeish tin lunchbox, from which emerged a sandwich, a small bag of chips, an apple, and a few assorted chocolate bars. \"I know it isn't much, but I hope it'll help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Katrina! You're the best friend ever!\" Jenny cried, tucking into the sandwich. Katrina smiled broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, thank you Katrina,</i> Anne thought, staring at the construction ahead. Katrina had single-handedly saved the situation, both staving off Jenny's hunger and keeping Anne from losing it. She marveled at the girl's incredible self-control- she was certainly large enough to have eaten that rather meager lunch, but had held off for Jenny's sake. It was truly a marvel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the cars before her barely budged, Anne wasn't sure if, even with the lunch, they could make it there. She could only hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SERIOUSLY? What the HELL is going on today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's distressed belly growled again, causing the fat girl attached to it no small measure of discomfort. \"What is it now, Mom? Are we here yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but look! The place is closed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked out the window again. A large CLOSED BY ORDER OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT sign looked back, denying her all hope of eating. Jenny leaned back, setting her enormous belly flopping, and closed her eyes. \"Mom, what are we gonna <i>do</i>? I'm starving to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Anne was on the verge of blowing up, but again, Katrina saved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, look! Have you ever seen an Alaska license plate before?\" Katrina asked, pointing eagerly out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith difficulty, Jenny leaned her fat self over to look. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look! There's one from Alabama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Hey! I see one from New Jersey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big silly, those are everywhere! Look for something interesting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Connecticut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina sighed. \"I suppose...Whoa, California! That's pretty far away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as the two girls managed to distract themselves from food, Anne thanked her lucky stars that Jenny had a friend like Katrina. She certainly wouldn't mind having her for the summer. Not one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, finally,\" grunted Jenny through a mouthful of greasy hamburger. \"I was so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Katrina replied, mouth similarly full. \"But we made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Jenny said, swallowing. \"Together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together!\" replied Katrina cheerfully. The two girls were silent for a moment as they stuffed themselves further. Finally, Jenny broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a great friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you too, Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne smiled. </span></div></div>",

Jenny found herself eating more than her usual supply of snacks in the morning and afternoon, her appetite seeming to have gotten bigger from being excited for the carnival food. <br>\r\nEven Katrina had gotten in on snacking.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, after what seemed like eons, epochs, and millennia all rolled into a few weeks, the last day of school reared its ugly-yet-welcoming head on every schoolchild's calendar. Every classroom was humming with excitement, buzzing with idle chatter, and grumbling with hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, perhaps that last one was just Jenny's classroom. For, as expected, Jenny was hungry. Although, in truth, Jenny was never <i>not</i> hungry these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thought of greasy carnival food weighing heavily on her mind, Jenny had been tearing her way through everything edible she could find, and it most certainly showed on her very encumbered frame. Her enormous belly had, naturally, gained the bulk of this weight, now actually touching the floor of Anne's minivan and growing inexorably closer to touching the floor from standard chair height. As such, whatever pants she wore were nearly always incapable of holding her, and, without fail, rode down constantly, even as her shirt rode up. For that reason, Jenny's belly was often let free from its pant-based prison, free to jiggle its pale mass in the open whenever possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without her great belly to deal with, her pants were still often rather strained by her enormous butt, now well overflowing two chairs and, if not checked, most likely soon needing a third. (Of course, her growth, considering her present size, was very unlikely to ever <i>be</i> checked.) Her chest, too, was growing quite a bit, and, as she was still rather too young for a bra, could often be very clearly seen beneath her enormous-yet-tight shirts. Above all that, her multiple-chinned face had grown somewhat as well, her cheeks only growing fatter in her body's search for places to store fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this fat came significantly decreased mobility-yes, even farther than it already was. It sometimes took Katrina upwards of half an hour to help Jenny to the van after school. Katrina had not tested this, as she didn't wish to strain Jenny unduly, but she was rather sure that her big friend couldn't walk a single step without her. This was worrying, especially considering Katrina's own rapid outward expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really had taken after Jenny, in more ways than she would like to think. Katrina had done her best to ignore her own gain, but when ever single pair of pants she owned ripped open after being pulled over her sizable rear she was forced to confront it and upgrade her sizes. Still, her own doughy belly jiggled significantly with the slightest movement, a constant reminder of its existence. It sat heavily in her lap, and hung quite a ways over her waistband when she stood. Her rear hung similarly over the sides of her single chair, jiggling often as well. Luckily for her, though, she always had Jenny to make her look the picture of thinness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina looked at Jenny now, unable to focus on the teacher's final drone of the year. Her fat friend was sweating, panting somewhat with the exertion of sitting still. She honestly wondered whether Jenny could make it to the carnival. She was, after all, so very large...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> Katrina thought to herself. <i>I can't give up on her.</i> They were, after all, best friends, and Katrina intended to make sure her friend was happy. They <i>would</i> make it to the carnival. That was indisputable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool next year, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...alright, boys and girls, that's it for you. Have a great summer!\" said Miss Forsythe cheerfully, and the final bell of the year rung in tandem with the student's cheers. Katrina grabbed Jenny's fat-bloated hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet.\"</span></div></div>",

Jenny and Katrina were nothing less than excited the whole morning, wiggling in their seats and gushing over the things they would do and see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina squealed about the different rides they'd go on, like the roller coaster and bumper cars. Jenny practically drooled over the thought of how many hamburgers, fries and corndogs she could get herself. But both of them agreed that the petting zoo would be the best part, given their shared love for animals.<br>\r\nAnne just watched with a loving smile from the front seat as she drove her daughter and her best friend to the huge field outside the city, where the carnival took place every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Anne and Katrina shared a similar worry about Jenny, specifically about her mobility. She had become a lot more lethargic lately, and a lot more dependant on help to move around. Would she be okay spending an entire day outside...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, the noise of the carnival penetrating the car filled the girls with new excitement, and they just grinned widely at each other while Jenny's mom looked for a parking space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn't take long for Anne to get parked, and it was a pleasantly sunny day with a cool breeze meaning it wasn't too hot or cold. She and Katrina got out of the car and flocked over to Jenny's side, and she wrapped her arms around her daughter's immense middle. Her fingertips barely touched from how wide she had gotten. Katrina had her hands up, ready to support her large friend's descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, girls?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Katrina said. Jenny simply gave a slow nod.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Anne whispered, and steeled herself, \"one, two, three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a combined effort, Anne and Katrina safely lowered Jenny to the ground, leaving all three of them huffing and panting from the effort. Jenny just adjusting herself and being lifted down tuckered her out for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of everyone (mainly Jenny) getting their breath back, Anne led the girls over to the entrance to pay for the admission. Katrina, of course, helped her friend slowly lumber every heavy step of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the fairgrounds, both girls' faces lit up as they looked around the loud, bustling carnival. What ever could they do first!</span></div></div>",

See,\" Katrina pointed at the height indicator, \"you're not tall enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny could only wheeze. The walk across the fairground had tuckered her out even more than the walk from the car, especially since she hadn't eaten in over half an hour. Anne was, unfortunately, not around to provide anything for her; in the interest of being a \"cool mom,\" she had left the two girls to their own devices. Which, it seemed, were for Katrina to ride the roller coaster while Jenny sat on a far-overburdened bench and starve- and that with gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench creaked beneath Jenny's great weight. She looked wistfully at a taco stand a few feet away- it was so, so close, yet there was no way for her to reach it alone. Her belly flopped out of the vast, sweat-drenched dress her mother had placed her in today and brushed gently against the grassy ground below. Yet, despite all of that, Jenny was content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a friend, a loyal, excellent friend who helped her with every single task she needed to do. She had a mother, a loving, doting mother who provided her with all the food she could possibly eat. She had everything she could ever need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, as her growling belly was keen to remind her, she could use a little more. </span></div></div>",

The stand was so far away, at least for such a barely mobile mass of ten year-old girl, and it was just taunting her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, this caused her to lay her gaze on an intriguing sight.

Katrina turned to Jenny in mild astonishment. \"Wow, really? That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, just keep going!\" Jenny said, rubbing her ravenous belly uncomfortably. It was encroaching on 45 minutes since she last ate, and she was really starting to feel it.

Be at Firth Field by 11:30 sharp for all you can eat hamburgers, pizzas, fries and pies! Whoever consumes the most of all three categories will take home our GRAND PRIZE! A $500 check...\" Katrina turned to Jenny again, mouth opened wide with shock. \"and a lifetime supply of Burton's Brand Doughnuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the girls noticed the irony in a hospital-sponsored eating contest, but both of them noticed the riches promised them. Both girls squealed with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many doughnuts! I can't...I can't wait!\" Jenny said, face filled with joy. \"What time is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina looked at a nearby wall clock and swore rather loudly. \"Jenny, it's almost 11! We've got to get a move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Katrina prepared to hoist her meatier friend to her flabby feet, Jenny cried out \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Katrina asked, standing back a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get some tacos before we go? I'm hungry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- But we're about to go to an eating contest! Why would you want to eat more?\" Katrina asked her friend in exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I need energy to walk all the way over there...\" Jenny frowned, ruefully eyeing the distance from her bench to the field in question. Katrina sighed deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you'll have to eat it while walking. We only have half an hour to get there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, it should only take ten, but with Jenny's slow waddle they needed the time. So, as Jenny slurped taco into her mouth and Katrina moved her fat friend forward, they set off, into a new world of competitive eating. Into all the doughnuts they could ever eat...or just a nasty stomachache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both hoped for the former. </span></div></div>",

What would have been an easy jog for a smaller ten year-old girl was a sluggish, almost slow-motion waddle that took about twenty five minutes to get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Jenny, it was a nightmare. Her thunder thighs gave her a wide, awkward gait, and her sheer four-hundred-plus pound frame weighing her down meant she was nearly drenched in sweat and beet red in the cheeks by the time Katrina had helped her there. The sheer effort of hauling her best friend underneath the hot sun meant Katrina wasn't faring much better either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, the sight that laid before them made it all worth it. Two enormous tables were set up across the field, all hosting platters of fries, pizzas, burgers and pies, just as the poster had promised. And there were a <b>lot</b> of each! Kids sat at one table, adults on the other, all either talking amongst themselves or mentally preparing for the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as sweat, another liquid dripped down Jenny's chubby face - drool.

Despite the fact that food was everywhere in front of her, the thought of even more never failed to stimulate her flab-choked brain. She kicked her tubby legs anxiously against her rumbling, ground-length belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For our first round,\" the announcer continued, \"we will be serving locally-sourced, homemade, free-range French Fries, generously provided by Fannie's Diner!

She knew that her large friend had very little in the way of self-control, and, as she was slowly discovering, she didn't have much for herself either; her own thigh-spreading belly was growling angrily for her to take a handful for herself. She attempted to distract herself by looking at the other contestants. At first glance, there were quite a few big kids, many significantly larger than her- however, none of them even came close to approaching the ludicrous size of Jenny. Satisfied, Katrina leaned back, sure that they would win. Nothing could possibly stop Jenny when confronted with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kids, on your marks! Three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina sat forward again, ready to grab whatever fries came within her grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny attempted to wipe the drool from her mouth, without much success, and readied herself for what might be an actually satisfying meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne, who had found her way into the crowd, stared excitedly at her enormous daughter. Winning seemed a sure thing for her and her massive stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO! DIG IN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with that, the contest was begun. Fry after fry disappeared to hungry maw after hungry maw. Thousands of potatoes sacrificed, millions of calories collectively consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina was actually keeping up rather well with the hectic pace of eating. Before too long had passed, she had cleared her first plate, and, licking her fingers of the salt, was on to the second. All told, she racked up three-and-three-quarters platefuls of fries by the time the buzzer rsng out. She leaned back, salty hands on her bloated tummy, to find, with great satisfaction, that a whole lot of people had dropped out of the contest already. And, to boot, she wasn't doing half bad- she seemed to be about in the middle for consumption. Though Jenny was certainly messing with the average. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jenny, within the three minutes given, had eaten an absolutely ridiculous nine plates of fries, and was begging for more, licking the grease of each and every plate as she waited for the results to be tallied. Her dress, clean and fresh that morning, was now hopelessly stained with salt and grease. Her enormous belly looked quite a bit fuller, but Katrina was sure her friend wasn't even close to satisfied.

She hadn't considered that Jenny would have to face any adults; she was most definitely the largest kid in a wide radius, but could probably-near-or-over-500 pounds of girl stack up to adults that may weigh even more than that? For the sake of the prize, Katrina certainly hoped so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, on the other hand, merely hoped to eat the pizza.

Unfortunately, though, the other divisions also needed to compete at Firth Field, so Jenny was forced- for the third time that day- to move her enormous bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, considering the fact that she had just eaten about 25 pounds of food, was very, very difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll told, it took Anne and Katrina, working together, fifteen minutes to move Jenny the few feet necessary to make it to the bleachers, then a further seven to get her up the single step necessary to make it to a seat. Naturally, as soon as Jenny's monumental butt touched the bench, she, exhausted from her slight movement and reasonably full, fell asleep almost immediately, dropl dripping onto her chins which in turn flopped onto her chest. Katrina, after a few minutes rest, did the same, pressing her own chubby body deep into Jenny's fat side. Anne looked at the two of them, then at her daughter's belly, pooling on the ground well past her fat feet, and figured her homeschool plan couldn't be very far off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Certainly,</i> she thought, somewhat guiltily, <i>she won't be able to go back to school after all of this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or even out of her bed.</i><br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, Jenny, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...huh?\" Jenny groaned, raising one impossibly fat hand to rub her eyes. She was not accustomed, especially not in the summertime, to being so rudely prodded awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, we've got to go! It's time for the championship!\" Katrina shouted in one sleepy ear. At that, Jenny shot awake. The promise of more food was always enough to stimulate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, darling, up you get!\" Anne said, placing both hands underneath one of Jenny's incredibly soft arms. Katrina did the same on the other side. \"Ready? One...two...THREE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, Jenny was lifted to her fat feet, and the three began the long trek back to her triple-chaired seat. Sweat dripped down her whole form as she was resettled back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!\" an announcer cried out, a different one this time. \"It is my honor to welcome you to the Burton's Brand 33rd Annual Eating Contest's CHAMPIONSHIP ROUND!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, much larger this time, erupted in a series of loud cheers, which Katrina and Anne heartily joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare yourself for the highest-stakes eating action you'll see yet! This is a clash of titans, a battle of bulges, a meeting of minds-and mouths-sort of-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case! These contestants have proven themselves in each of our four divisional contests! They have demonstrated great eating ability, great stamina, and great effort throughout! First up, a surprise challenger yet landslide winner of the Children's Division, we have Jennifer Bradley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered. Anne and Katrina screamed with delight. Jenny weakly raised one fat fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, from the Teenaged Division, your friendly neighborhood Rasta girl, Felicia Kinsey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina watched, confused, as a fairly chubby yet not oversized girl smiled very widely and took a bite of what seemed to be a normal brownie. Anne cursed to herself and muttered something about weeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third, from the Young Adult division, three-time winner and professional eater extraordinaire, Michael Bornesly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large man with a very round belly waved lightly at the crowd. Anne cursed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, from the Slightly Older Adult Division, we have the largest person in the state if not the country, Dennis Dupin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man so fat he had to sit on a truck trailer attempted to wave. Katrina cursed this time, unsure if her admittedly extremely fat friend could stand up to someone larger than her- even if it was probably only a few hundred pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This round,\" continued the announcer, \"will be special! There is no time limit, no food limit...only YOUR limits! That's right: ELIMINATION!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd stared as several burly deliverymen wherled out stack after stack of cardboard boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside those boxes are stack upon stack of delicious, delectable cupcakes! Whoever can eat cupcakes for the longest amount of time will be declared the winner! Now, everybody get ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contestants leaned forward as best they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne and Katrina tensed up, holding their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\"</span></div></div>",

They cheered in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was most certainly going to be a tough contest. Unlike the teenaged girl who had just left, the three remaining contestants were all extremely good at the process of consumption. For several minutes, nothing changed but the number of cupcakes on the field- which were dwindling very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, something had to give. And a rather surprising something it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis, the largest person in a very wide radius, was, to the great surprise of the crowd, the next contestant to give. Ironically, it was his few-hundred-pound lead over Jenny that did him in. He had more than enough room for the contest, but his heavy arms couldn't keep up with the pace of unwrapping and eating needed to win. So, after trying, and failing, to lift yet another cupcake all the way to his mouth, he dropped his arm, gasping, and declared himself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Dennis Dupin drops out! Ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing something unprecedented!\" the announcer screamed into his microphone. \"Give him a big round of applause! And, not only to him, but to our two remaining contestants! In all my years as announcer of every event under the sun, I have never seen such a spectacle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a spectacle it was. Both Jenny and her older rival were entirely surrounded by wrappers and coated in crumbs. So many cupcakes, on top of so much other food from that day, were forcing Jenny's massive belly into a shape it had not been for some time- round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she did not stop eating, and neither did Michael. It was now a battle of skill against capacity, experience in contests versus experiences in gorging. And it looked, at least to Anne and Katrina, like capacity may be winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to be a tough fight, that's for sure. Jenny may not have realized that, dim and focused on eating as she was, but her competitor certainly knew it. Michael Bornesly had won eating contests throughout the land. He knew every trick in the book, on pacing, on training, on timing. In a regular, timed contest, there was no match for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in elimination, against a girl so fat she could barely move, a girl who lived solely to consume, he was flagging. And he knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he pressed on, hoping against hope that the fat girl would get full, would give up, would somehow be stopped. <i>Maybe,</i> he thought to himself, watching her stomach distend further and further between cupcakes, <i>maybe she is getting full.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was in fact getting full; in fact, she was the closest she'd been to actually full for a long time. She knew, even in her impossibly dim brain, that soon she would reach her limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as her nearly immobilizing belly would attest to, she had eaten herself well beyond her limits before. She wasn't worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't just her that had a limit. Her three wooden chairs, over capacity and weakened with age, creaked ominously.</span></div></div>",

She herself needed help to stand up now, so round had her belly become. Hers was not wide and flabby, like Jenny's ridiculous blanket of fat, but rather quite round and doughy- she could almost be mistaken for pregnant, if one looked quickly. As always, though, she always had Jenny to make her look skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenny could make a blue whale look skinny. If two weeks of constant glutting had damaged Katrina's figure, it had absolutely ruined Jenny's. Her floor-length sheet of flab now was big enough to actually start spreading out across the floor, rather than merely touching it. Her butt was also wide enough to take up two-and-a-half of the couch's three cushions, ensuring that Katrina's own rapidly widening butt was always touching some part of her friend- not that she minded. Jenny was incredibly soft and always made something nice to lean on, even if she was a bit sweaty. Which, with the temperature and the effort required to keep such a large body running, was to be expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the kitchen, Anne watched the two girls watch television with a wide, weary smile on her face. She spent most of her time here nowadays, busy as she was with ensuring the two growing girls had plenty to eat. The doughnuts helped, of course, but nobody could just eat one thing forever. So Anne would cook chicken, cakes and cutlets, not that she minded. Rather, she enjoyed it. Jenny needed to be homeschooled, after all, and the less resistant she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne shook her head. <i>No, I can't think like that!</i> she thought angrily to herself, stirring the soup she was working on. <i>Jenny needs to make her own decisions!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as she stole another glance into the living room, at her daughter's enormous body threatening to overwhelm a couch, she was sure her decision would be the right one. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Katrina and Jenny suggested the idea to Anne over dinner. Or, rather, Katrina suggested it. Jenny merely shoveled food into her always-hungry mouth and nodded a few times when it seemed appropriate. Nevertheless, Anne was pleased with the idea, and suggested a date of next Wednesday for the girl's final excursion of the summer. And, most likely, Jenny's final excursion of all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week in between was spent much like the others for the girls- namely, eating, watching television, eating, sleeping, eating and, of course, eating. Anne, naturally, was kept as busy as a bee, only this week was slightly busier as she, in addition to food shopping, had to purchase some bathing suits and a few sundry beach items. For Katrina, she picked out the largest size the children's section had to offer; for Jenny, the largest the plus-size store had in stock. As an afterthought, she also picked up a sewing kit for alterations- she had no idea, after all, whether her daughter would fit or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, Wednesday rolled around, and Anne was up early loading the car. Chairs, bags, and, of course, pounds and pounds of en-route snacks had to be loaded, stored, and secured before she could even think of waking the girls for first breakfast- especially since it was so early. Anne couldn't remember the last time either of them were awake earlier then eleven, and it was only just turning eight. Nevertheless, they would need that time to reach the beach, so she trudged back inside and started cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina woke up first, the sounds and smells of sizzling bacon drawing her out of her sleepy-time stupor. She yawned, stretched, rubbed her eyes with two chubby hands, and idly scratched at her fully-exposed doughball of belly before realizing that Jenny was still asleep and giving her a light poke, which only succeeded in rippling a few of the vastly bigger girl's innumerable folds. With a sigh, Katrina instead delivered a light kick to the side of her flabby friend's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it. Jenny slowly blinked awake with a confused groan of \"Hwah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast, silly,\" Katrina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! I'm-\" an enormous growl from her big belly interrupted the moment \"-hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina giggled lightly. \"Me too. But aren't you the least bit excited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About- About the beach, you big silly!\" Katrina responded indignantly. \"You remember? Sand? Swimming? Ice lollies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the final words, Jenny's many-chinned face lit up. \"Oh yeah! I can't wait! Mom, when are we leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as you two eat your breakfast!\" Anne replied, whisking into the living room with two food-filled plates. \"Now go on, dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several plates of messily-eaten breakfast, the girls were finally ready to get going. Katrina, after a few moments' digestion, managed to scoot herself to the edge of the couch and heave her chubby body into a standing position. Unfortunately for her sense of balance, her time on the couch had resulted in quite a few unwanted pounds getting added to her frame, and she was pulled right back down. Soon, though, she was back on, and she could truly appreciate how much her size had changed. Her rather round belly now stuck out almost a foot in front of her, and it would have most certainly pulled her forwards had she not had a very significant rear to balance her out. Her new weight pressed heavily on her chubby feet. For a moment, she felt rather self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina! I need your help with Jenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, of course, she didn't feel self-conscious in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina took her place on Jenny's left arm, and, with all their might, Anne and Katrina heaved and hove at Jenny's massively fattened frame. Unfortunately, though, they were barely able to budge her an inch, and, soon enough, they gave up, gasping and panting with the unexpected effort. Anne, seeing that this was exactly what she wanted, nearly called it quits, but Katrina called out, \"Wait! I've got an idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne and Jenny turned towards her, intrigued. \"If we tip the couch forwards, Jenny should be able to slide off and get her footing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter exchanged glances, and Katrina took up a position on the right corner. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" sighed Anne, and started pushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, they were able to raise the couch a few inches off the ground, and, even more miraculously, Jenny began to slide. Then, with a great <i>thump,</i> many, many hundreds of pounds of girl touched the floor. Katrina's plan had worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo an extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jenny! You're belly's touching the ground!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was. Jenny had grown so fat that her enormous swell of belly now rested firmly on the floor, engulfing her feet even more than her enormous ankles already did. The big girl huffed in surprise and looked down curiously. Unfortunately, her chest and chins prevented her from seeing anything of her massive stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Anne said somewhat disappointedly, \"let's get going, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" said Katrina eagerly, and took her place under Jenny's arm. \"Let's go, Jenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's answer was hard to hear through her wheezing, but eventually she was able to burst out, \"Can't...walk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Katrina said, looking at Jenny in surprise. Anne cheered silently to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't...move...feet...\" Jenny wheezed, sweat streaming down her enormous face. \"Too...tired...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sit down then! Can't have you using up all your energy!\" Anne said, a bit too quickly, and together she and Katrina lowered Jenny back onto the couch. After a moment, Katrina, too, sat back down, a frown crossing her chubby features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait right here! I'll bring lunch!\" Anne said, again, very quickly, and raced out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny wheezed. Katrina's frown deepened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anne wandered around the house, wracking her brain for any idea that might help her get her immobile daughter into her van. She hadn\u2019t accounted for this. How had Jenny become immobile so fast? Not that Anne minded; she was ecstatic, in fact. But she had promised the girls this trip, and at the rate Jenny was growing, it would only get harder to move her from now on. Maybe she could find her a mobility scooter, but it would take weeks for it to get here, and there was a strong chance she\u2019d outgrow it before it came.<br>\r\nAnne looked back at the two girls. The simple effort of standing for just a few seconds had driven Jenny\u2019s appetite wild: she now had a fried chicken sandwich in each hand and was scarfing them both down almost faster than she could chew. Katrina also had two sandwiches in each hand: one which she was cramming as quickly as possible into her own mouth, the other she was shoving into Jenny\u2019s mouth in between bites of her other two sandwiches. The poor girl was so hungry she didn\u2019t have enough hands to hold all the food she needed.<br>\r\nIt took all her willpower to keep from joining in and helping the two girls gorge to their satisfaction. There would be time for that later, but for now, she had a problem to solve, and the longer it took her to solve it, the heavier Jenny\u2019s stomach would be when it was time to move her.<br>\r\nAs she thought about it, she realized that was exactly what the problem was. Jenny was heavy everywhere, but nowhere more than her stomach. It hung all the way to the floor, after all, and not by a little bit, either. Jenny hadn\u2019t been weighed in a while, but considering how much of the couch and the floor her fat was taking up, she must be close to half a ton by now, if not past it. Her belly alone was probably about 600 pounds; there was no way her tiny eight-year-old body could possibly heave a belly around that weighed as much as a small horse. Not without help\u2026<br>\r\nAs Anne\u2019s mind wandered, her eye caught an ad on the tv. It was some non-descript ad for weedkiller or something of the like, but as she watched a short clip of someone hauling dead weeds around the lawn in a wheelbarrow, it gave her a flash of inspiration. A wheelbarrow!<br>\r\n\u201cYou two keep eating. I\u2019ve got an idea!\u201d The two girls merely nodded, moaning in gluttonous hunger as they started on another round of sandwiches. Anne hurried outside the house, opened up the toolshed, and tossed a few heavy bags of fertilizer out of the large wheelbarrow that sat there. Dusting it clear of dirt and cobwebs, she pushed it out of the shed and into the back door of her house. Wheeling it into her living room, she spread out her arms and grinned. \u201cTa-daa! This is how we\u2019ll get you into the car, honey. Katrina, will you help me get her belly into the wheelbarrow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea!\u201d Katrina said, barely discernable around her huge mouthful of food. She stuffed the rest of her sandwich into her mouth and got down on her knees, her own belly now pressing against the floor from her new position. She pushed both her arms underneath Jenny\u2019s huge belly as far as they could go, while Anne did the same from the other side. Their fingers couldn\u2019t even touch beneath the huge mound of fat. With all their strength, they managed to heave the enormous gut off the floor, over the edge of the wheelbarrow, and let it fall in with a heavy plop and a series of dramatic ripples.<br>\r\nWith many grunts and groans and false starts, they finally managed to drag Jenny to her feet. Her belly pooled into the wheelbarrow and overflowed the sides, hanging over the edges so much her lovehandles nearly covered the handles. Fortunately, there was just enough room for her to reach the handles with her tubby fingers, and with a slow trudging gate, she was able to begin walking.<br>\r\nHer belly surged and rolled with every ponderous step. Anne was afraid a couple of times the wheelbarrow might break underneath her, but it managed to stand strong atop its one creaking wheel. It took almost fifteen minutes to get to the van, and probably would have taken even longer if Katrina hadn\u2019t fed her five more fast-food meals along the way to encourage her. But finally, they made it.<br>\r\nJenny could only fit in the cargo section of the van with the back seats down. Her butt and side rolls pressed on both walls of the van, and it took a great deal of pushing to get the back door closed. As Anne walked around to the driver\u2019s side door to get in, she noticed with surprise that the front two wheels of the van where a couple of inches off the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026maybe we really did overdo it?\u201d She noticed Katrina standing off to the side, rapidly consuming her third 20-piece box of chicken nuggets, her beachball-sized belly jutting out proudly ahead of her. \u201cKatrina, why don\u2019t you sit next to me, okay?\u201d<br>\r\nKatrina smiled. \u201cOkay!\u201d She climbed into the front passenger seat and the van\u2019s front end thumped back down to the ground. She had to adjust her seat a little to keep her own swollen belly from pushing against the dashboard.<br>\r\nAnne hopped into the drivers\u2019 seat, buckled in, and put her key in the ignition. \u201cAlright girls. We\u2019re on our way!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The van groaned and chugged as it limped along the highway, engine screaming almost as loudly as the suspension as the overloaded vehicle struggled along. Much like Jenny herself, it was carrying far, far more than it was ever built to handle \u2013 and, also like Jenny, it was wheezing, puffing and struggling to move as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the colossal young girl occupying the back seats and the cargo section, the vehicle\u2019s balance was thrown way backwards. Katrina in the front seat was doing her unwitting best to counterbalance her colossal friend \u2013 she was now far heavier than Jenny had been at the start of all this, so she was no small burden herself \u2013 but in comparison to Jenny now she might as well have been made out of fluff and feathers. It was incredible; when viewed on her own, Katrina was clearly hugely overweight, every part of her body bulging and wobbling with thick, heavy pads of fat. Her gut stuck out in front of her, sagging shapelessly over her jeans to brush against thighs that were each easily thicker than an average girl\u2019s waist, and her hips and backside were astonishingly plump for a girl her age. However, next to the mountain of flab that Jenny had become, even Katrina appeared almost emaciated. What was a belly that brushed against her thighs compared to a belly that spilled down to the floor? A rump that overflowed jeans designed for an overweight teenager didn\u2019t seem so bad compared to one that had outgrown the largest jeans in the adult plus-size store, that filled up the entire back half of the van with its bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne glanced anxiously in the rear view mirror, taking in the shapeless mountain of flushed flab that had buried her daughter this past year. She hoped the journey wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable for Jenny \u2013 she\u2019d grown a lot since she last got out of the house, and certainly since she\u2019d last ridden in the van. It was hard to believe that not so long ago she\u2019d been an active, mostly normal girl. She\u2019d been chunky, sure, a little plumper and lazier than most of her classmates, but ultimately fairly normal. There were girls like that in every school in the country at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no girls like Jenny was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina had twisted around in her seat to pass Jenny another sandwich, and so she missed the first sight of the beach emerging on the horizon. Jenny, for her part, was too distracted by the sight of said sandwich, and, more importantly, the very pleasant idea of getting it inside her achingly empty stomach as soon as possible. Or perhaps her stomach was achingly full; she couldn\u2019t really tell the difference anymore.<br>\r\nAnd so, it was Anne that first saw the beach. <br>\r\n\u201cThere it is, girls! We\u2019ve made it!\u201d<br>\r\nKatrina turned back around hastily, gasping with excited, childish glee at the sight of the shining blue waters. Even Jenny managed to look up from her food a moment, letting out a cheer through a mouth full of food.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s very pretty,\u201d she managed to huff after a moment, struggling to catch her breath after the cheer, \u201cIt\u2019s been ages since\u2026 since we\u2019ve been to the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been in years either!\u201d Katrina chimed in, \u201cThis is going to be really cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne pulled the chugging van into a parking space, and quickly jumped out to help her mountainous daughter from the van. Katrina followed her lead a little more slowly, heaving her own overgrown rump from the tight confines of the front seat and trotting around to lend a hand with her friend. <br>\r\nGetting Jenny out of the van again was just as difficult as wedging her in in the first place. Getting any firm hold on her sweaty, slippery folds of flab was almost impossible, and the sedentary, out-of-shape Katrina wasn\u2019t much help, quickly becoming out of breath and exhausted as they levered the enormous mass of Jenny from the van. However tired Katrina was, however, it was nothing compared to how Jenny felt; the poor girl was trying her best to help, but at her size she was little better than a prisoner buried in the sheer bulk of her own body. Before long she was wheezing and puffing like she was going to burst, child-size heart and lungs ailing as they were expected to somehow supply the impossible demands of her hugely overgrown body. Sweat poured from her in rivulets, trickling through the ravines and caverns of her obesity and dripping onto the tarmac of the parking space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, somehow, Anne and Katrina managed to get Jenny out of the back of the van. She stood there wheezing in the sun, vision blurry with the strain of standing, looking around vaguely at the sand and the sea. For a moment she tried to step forwards, to trot out into the sand dunes and have an explore, but immediately her immense weight bore down on her again and she wobbled, suddenly remembering that she couldn\u2019t walk any more. She could feel the sun-warmed tarmac against her underbelly, and could even feel her toes buried somewhere beneath that monolithic gut, tickling the sensitive skin their slightly as they flexed with her instinctive attempt at a step forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, looking around at her massive friend, Katrina blinked.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just realised; we didn\u2019t bring the wheelbarrow. There wasn\u2019t room in the van for it. How are we going to get Jenny down onto the sand?\u201d<br>\r\nAnne cocked her head. She hadn\u2019t thought about that\u2026</span></div></div>",

Thinking about it now, it probably wouldn't have even fit in the van anyway: her daughter was so immensely fat now that she'd filled more than half of it with her body. It probably wouldn't have worked on the sand anyway; that wheel would have sunk in all the way under the impossible bulk of Jenny's belly, and would have been impossible to steer even if it hadn't.

What could she do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" Jenny mumbled around her mouthful of four entire chicken tenders. \"My tummy's getting hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn's brow knit together in an expression of concern. Her poor baby...the asphalt of the parking lot was indeed very hot under the summer sun. It had to be getting very painful on the bare skin of Jenny's blubbery underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, honey, I'll help you stay cool. Katrina, can you help me with this towel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly struggled to slide a large beach blanket beneath Jenny's gut, giving it a slight protective barrier against the hot asphalt. It was hard to heft Jenny's huge belly off the ground even for just the handful of seconds it took to get the towel beneath it, not only because of its weight, but because of the countless rivulets of sweat rolling down her body. The hot sun and the extreme effort of standing were both taking a heavy toll on Jenny's overtaxed body. She could not keep this up much longer, and if she sat down, they'd have even bigger problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina, I've got an idea. Grab your side of the towel and I'll grab mine, and we'll lift her belly up with it together, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina crammed the rest of the triple bacon cheeseburger she'd been eating into her mouth to free up both hands, and nodded at Ann. The two <br>\r\ndid as Ann instructed, grabbing the corners of the beach blanket beneath Jenny's gut and attempting to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey may as well have been trying to lift a boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn had begun to build up some surprising upper body strength lately, just from having to assist the girls in carrying their own weight around the past few weeks (and for the several dozen bags of groceries she had to haul into the house from her car every day), but she was still barely able to budge Jenny's belly before losing her grip on the towel. Katrina had far less luck than that, as she was starting to have a genuinely difficult time standing up from a kneeling position due to her own weight alone. The two tried as they might, but Jenny couldn't be moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the spectacle of this half-ton child and her mother's desparate attempts to move her had gathered quite a bit of attention. Beachgoers stopped in their tracks on the way to and from their cars, keeping a distance and trying not to be too obvious as the gawked at the display. Most if not all of them had never seen or even heard of a human being anywhere near Jenny's size, much less one of her age. They muttered among themselves almost as if they were critiquing a museum exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, they had to put the seats down just to get her into that van!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she still be eating? She's had four burgers in the past five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or does it look like that bathing suit is made out of shower curtains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina and Ann tried again and again to try and heave Jenny's belly off the ground, but to no avail. After a good ten minutes, they stopped trying. Katrina plopped onto her ample rear, beads of sweat glistening all over her own flabby body. She stripped down to her own bathing suit to stay cool; a maternity bikini Anne had found to replace the bathing suit she'd outgrown on Wednesday. Stomach growling from ten whole minutes without eating, Katrina tore into another family cheeseburger meal, noticing with fear that only a few unopened takeout bags remained in the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's elephantine legs trembled, causing her entire bulk to jiggle from the strain of supporting itself. Tears welled in her eyes as she looked up at her mother. \"Mommy, I need to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, sweetheart. Please hold on a little longer. I won't be able to get you back up if you sit down now.\" Tears were beginning to form in Ann's eyes as well. Her poor daughter was suffering right now. This trip to the beach had been such a mistake. They should have all stayed home so the girls could eat and be happy. Now they were just getting sore, hungry, and miserable, and she couldn't do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn looked up at the crowd of onlookers at the edge of the parking lot, lip trembling. \"Please...can someone please help me? I promised to take my daughter to the beach today, but we just can't move her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the bystanders averted their gazes in shame. They'd been watching the spectacle out of pure morbid curiosity. Most of them had been looking at the corpulent mass of flesh with a mixture of shock and disgust. But this desparate plea from Ann forced them to see past the enormous mass of blubber before them. In spite of appearances, this was not just a bag of fat. This was a little girl, and here was a loving mother trying to help her see the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muscled teen with bleached blonde hair rested his surfboard on the ground and stepped forward. \"I'll help you out, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shapely lifeguard in a red one-piece bathing suit stepped forward as well \"Let me help too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree teens that looked like they'd just come from the beach vollyball court stepped forward as well. A 30 year-old mother handed her infant son to her daughter and stepped forward to help as well. The six of them went up to the massive, blubbery form of Jenny and lined up three on each side, each of them grabbing a firm hold on the beach blanket and hoisting up Jenny's massive belly with all their strength. Her tears turned to ones of joy, Ann moved to her daughter's side, placing a supporting arm around as much of her back as she could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina heaved herself off the ground and followed on Jenny's other side, giving her friend encouragement and feeding her the rest of the food to keep up her strength as they continued their ponderous journey to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly a half hour to get Jenny from the parking lot to the beach, and there were quite a few close calls along the way as her gut-bearers struggled to control the massive ungainly bulk of her belly. But at last, at long last, they made it. They brought Jenny all the way down to the water's edge, lowering her gently into it and allowing the water to lift the enormous weight of her body off her tiny frame for the first time in as long as she could remember. She sat there in the water, bouyant and free; an absurd raft of pure fat, rolling and rippling in time with every wave that supported her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anne profusely thanked everyone who helped drag her daughter all the way to the daughter, and they awkwardly accepted her thanks before returning to what they'd been doing. It certainly felt like they'd done a good deed just then, but it was still undeniably the strangest thing any of them had ever had to do, and they were all eager for their lives to regain some kind of normalcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggled as she felt her mass of blubber roll and surge with every wave beneath her. It felt nice to have the weight off her lower body for a change. She could actually walk pretty well under the water. Her belly floated, so the only resistance came from the simple bulk of the fat on her legs. She felt much less fat in the water than she was, which was ironic, because she <i>looked </i>even fatter now. With all her fat spread out across the surface of the water, she truly resembled a blob more than a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's enjoyment of her buoyancy was interrupted after only a few minutes by a rumble from her belly. Predictably, she was hungry again. The amount of food she'd eaten already today was pretty excessive even by her own standards, but so was the number of calories she'd burned. She hadn't exerted herself like that in months, and now she was utterly ravenous again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to say something about it, but Katrina beat her to it. \"Ms. Bradley, can we get some more food? I'm still really hungry.\" Her own belly was getting quite distended: it stuck out almost as far ahead of her as her arms could reach. Addled by hunger though her mind was, Jenny still couldn't help but be surprised that her friend was still so hungry. Katrina hadn't eaten half what Jenny had, but she'd still eaten quite a bit more than was normal for her. Of course, she had also spent most of the past few weeks effectively as immobilized on the couch as Jenny had been, so she'd also exerted herself much more than usual today, especially with all those attempts to lift and move Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You two stay right there and play. I'll go bring you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did. Katrina played in the water with Jenny for a while, laughing and enjoying herself. They both had fun, yet the second Ann came back with several heavy backs of food from the concessions stand, Katrina heaved herself out of the water and started eating without a second of hesitation. Jenny stayed right where she was (not that she had much choice), but dove into her food just as ravenously as soon as Anne brought it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn wasn't sure how she expected this day to go. She knew eating would be involved, but she assumed the girls would do at least a little playing. That was not to be the case, however. The novelty of being at the beach seemed to wear off immediately. After the initial excitement of arrival, both girls lost interest in everything but food. Ann was particularly surprised at Katrina; this whole trip had been her idea after all, and she'd generally been at least a little bit less food-focused than her daughter. Yet now she was nearly keeping pace with Jenny's consumption, and wasn't showing much of any interest in doing anything but eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well...I guess we won't have to do this again,</i> then, Ann thought, with a fair bit of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls lay there, Jenny in the water and Katrina on the beach, for hours. Ann made a total of thirteen trips to the food stand, only stopping when the man told her he was closing down for the day. Both girls gorged themselves into a stupor, eating all but nonstop until the sun began to set. Ann had a hard time finding enough people willing to help get Jenny back to the van at the end of the day, not only because fewer people were left at the beach, but because six people didn't seem to be enough to support the weight of her incredibly full belly by the end of the day. It took eight people to get her back to the van and stuffed back into it, the back door barely closing over its overstuffed payload. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was surprised to find that Katrina couldn't even stand on her own by the end of the day; she simply lay in the sand, her bloated belly rising almost three feet above her in an almost perfect sphere. She had to help support the growing bulk of her daughter's friend all the way back to the car, and had to set the passenger seat all the way back just to fit her hugely swollen belly into the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls quickly dozed off as soon as their fat bodies had been stuffed into the agonized van. Hopping into the driver's seat, Ann began the van's slow and arduous crawl back home, avoiding every crack and pothole for fear of a total structural collapse. There was no doubt about it: this had been the girl's last outing. Ann wasn't sure how the two would take that, but there was just no other way around it that she could see.</span></div></div>",

Anna had given her daughter half a normal size pizza, a few slices of garlic baguette and a small glass of Fanta; a suitable meal for a normal girl Jenny's age.<br>\r\nBut Jenny isn't a normal girl. She's a black hole for food.<br>\r\n\"Thanks mum!\" Jenny cried. Licking her little lips, she grabbed a slice in each of her pudgy hands and greedily stuffed them into her awaiting mouth, gobbling them up with gusto.<br>\r\nAnna sighed, her daughter had no patience at all when it comes to food. Of course she was polite and grateful and always asked nicely for food like she was raised to do, but it seemed like she almost never had enough. She'd gobble up a day's worth of food for a girl her age in an hour or two, then take a nap to sleep it off, and wake up hungry as ever. A never-ending cycle.<br>\r\nWhat also bugged her is how Jennifer was growing <i>out</i> faster than she was growing <i>up</i>. She needed new clothes nearly every month (or every few weeks if she'd been growing exceptionally quickly), and she was nearly too heavy to lift.<br>\r\n\"<i>Berp!</i> 'Scuze me.\" Jennifer giggled, wiping the ring of pizza sauce off her lips with the back of her hand and licking it off like a kitten. A very fat kitten.<br>\r\n\"All finished, Jenny?\" Anna asked, hopeful that it was enough to fill her up.<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Jenny nodded with a grin, \"...still hungry though.\"<br>\r\nAnna sighed. So much for that. She got up and brought the other half of the cooked pizza to her daughter, the rest of the garlic baguette, and refilling her glass with more Fanta. Jenny giggled happily and dug in once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Jennifer was finished. Her plate littered with sauce and bread-crumbs, her mouth ringed with tomato and garlic sauce and the litre bottle of Fanta emptied. Not to mention a slight bloating in her middle section.<br>\r\n\"<i>Now</i> are you full?\" Anna asked hopefully.<br>\r\nJenny went to nod, then stopped, thinking. \"Well...\"<br>\r\nAnna swore in her head. What now?!<br>\r\nJennifer stared hopefully at the freezer above the fridge. \"Ice cream?\"<br>\r\nAnna sighed softly, lifting herself back to her feet and opening the freezer, getting a tub of chocolate ice cream and plopping a few scoops into a bowl, squirting some chocolate sauce over the top of them.<br>\r\nA little strange, chocolate sauce on chocolate ice cream, but it was Jenny's favourite dessert. She was a bit of a chocolate addict.<br>\r\nJenny gleefully squeaked a 'thank-you' to her mother before stuffing spoonful after spoonful of ice cream into her greedy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Jenny had finished her bowl of ice cream, and gave a quiet high-pitched yawn.<br>\r\nAnna smiled gently. Jennifer always got sleepy when she was nice and full.<br>\r\nTaking her hand, Anna led her tubby toddler up the stairs and to her bedroom, helping her out of her food-stained clothes and into her already-too-small pyjamas. The waist on the pants was tight, and the shirt didn't want to cover Jennifer's greedy tummy the whole way, so her little bellybutton was on show. With some help, Jennifer got herself into bed and tucked in.<br>\r\n\"Night-night sweetheart,\" Anna said softly, giving her daughter a gentle kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n\"Night-night mummy,\" Jenny yawned sweetly, snuggling into her bed to sleep.<br>\r\nAnna smiled and quietly made her leave.</span></div></div>",

It tasted like chocolate heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe the began rapidly devouring the rest of the cake shoveling handful after handful into her mouth.

She simply layed there and stared at it. She was lying on her front but not on her belly. Her belly started at her abdomen and continued on between her legs until it reached the massive moutain of fleshy fat behind her. Her belly has become so large and maleably that it was now more like an attatchement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the chunk. It was about the size of her head and comprised of delicious gooey chocolate.  She licked her lips having savored the moment and shoved the entire chunk into her mouth. She liked her lips once more in satisfaction and then rolled over to look at her mountainous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the size of a small building, and it was part of her.

She gave a long squeaky yawn as she stretched her arms up, making her already too small shirt ride up her round tummy some more. She rolled off her bed and got on the floor slowly, slowly waddling her way towards her mirror. Thanks to her still being a bit groggy, she failed to notice that she had grown. Well, outwards, of course. Her big dinner the night before had allowed her already round tummy to grow even rounder, and since she was so young it caused her to get a bit wider as well, her sides starting to show with her protruding paunch. But Jenny didn't notice, she was too busy rubbing her eyes and thinking about what she'd have for breakfast. Food was always on her mind, all day long. She pretty much always thought with her stomach, which was always grumbling and growling, telling her to feed it. And thanks to her love of food, she was always happy to obey its command<br>\r\nWithout even brushing her hair, Jenny waddled her way downstairs to the kitchen, where Anne was already awake and making *some* kind of food. She looked down at her daughter and smiled softly at her. \"Morning, sweetie!\"<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Jenny mumbled, waddling to the table and climbing onto a chair, rubbing her grumbling tummy, \"what's for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd make you some pancakes this morning,\" her mother replied, bringing over a little stack of pancakes and setting them in front of her daughter. Jenny took a whiff of them; delicious! Perfectly cooked, with lots of syrup and a little block of butter on the top. Jenny didn't hesitate for a second as she dug into the stack with gusto, getting syrup all over the face and pajamas.<br>\r\nWithin minutes, she had finished, plate completely empty, since Jenny had greedily licked up any remaining puddles of syrup.

Jenny was always hungry when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the long haired brunette fluttered her green eyes open and smiled cutely at her mother. This was mostly from the nice dream she was having before she woke up. She was in the nice, cool, land of chocolate ice cream treats. Needless to say, by the time her tummy rumbled her awake there wasn't a drop of ice cream left in the whole land and Jenny had nice big tummy far larger than she was. A thought she was beginning to like more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry sweetheart?\" Her mom asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna did plan to take her clothes shopping, since her shirt didn't cover any of her belly at this point. As well, her shorts were starting to look uncomfortably tight on the poor little fat girl. However, she knew if she had any chance of these new clothes fitting her little girl's growing frame for longer than a week that Jenny had to be as stuffed as she could before they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her mother could have guessed what her reply would be well before the tubby youngster replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom. Is there any more ice cream left?\" She asked eagerly licking her lips at the thought of continuing her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother just sighed as she got up and led her waddling little girl into the kitchen. She looked a bit worried as she noticed Jenny's belly slosh and jiggle with each heavy step she took. She had to do something to get her daughter to lose some weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also took a look outside the kitchen window, seeing that it was a nice bright sunny day.<br>\r\n\"Well, it <i>is</i> a hot day,\" she muttered, then looked down at Jenny with a smile, \"I suppose you'll need a lot of ice cream to cool you down.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" Jenny squealed, clapping her pudgy little hands causing ripples to jiggle over her grumbling belly.<br>\r\nAnna sighed as she opened the fridge freezer door, pulling out a tub of ice cream. She didn't want to do this, but it seemed to be the only way. She set down the tub in front of Jenny, who squealed in thanks before grabbing a spoon and digging into the frozen treat like the little piglet she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna watched with more concern as Jenny finished up her post-nap snack, lowering the empty tub to the table after holding it to her mouth and guzzling down the near-melted treat. Her belly was pushing out a bit further, distended from her unhealthy binging. Letting out a cute little burp, the overweight girl giggled and licked her pudgy fingers of any ice cream residue, then wiped a thick arm across her mouth and licked off any left there.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" she purred, resting her chubby arms on her rounded belly, \"my tummy says it's happy!\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's good,\" Anna smiled softly, sounding possibly a bit too relieved but her daughter didn't catch on.<br>\r\nJenny's tummy let out a small gurgle. \"Oh, it also says it has room for a bit more!\" She giggled, grinning hopefully at her mother.<br>\r\nAnna sighed softly, cursing in her head. She knew it was too good to be true. Well she needed to get her clothes quickly, as her shirt had no hope of covering her belly and her shorts looked ready to pop. \"Maybe we could go get you some nice pretty summer clothes, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n\"Can we go later mommy?\" Jenny squeaked, eyes widened, \"Pretty please? I want some more!\"<br>\r\nAnna decided it was time to compromise. \"Tell you what; if you're a good girl while we're out getting clothes, I'll buy you your favourite cookies on the way home!\"<br>\r\nJenny squeaked, licking her lips at this. If there was one snack she loved more in the world than anything, it was her favourite cookies. She nodded frantically in response.</span></div></div>",

She new that Jenny would be exited...the fact that her own stomach was growling at the smell wasn't a good sign either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells yummy, Mommy!\" Jenny grinned, rubbing her rounded belly. Anne tugged her along. \"I know, Jenny, but remember what I said, we need to get you some new clothes first.\" Jenny nodded and followed along, looking around at all the various shops within the building. Up the escalator they went, heading to one of the many clothes shops, except that this particular shop was intended for bigger girls such as Jenny. They began to browse the selection...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this one, Jenny?\" asked Anna, handing the shirt and pants to her. She nodded happily to show she liked it. \"Well, go in the booth and try em on then...\" Giggling, Jenny went to do just that. A few minutes later, she came out, but the clothes did not fit as well as expected. \"I think they're too small, Mommy...\" As if on cue, several buttons popped off her clothes, letter her tummy bounce free. \"Oh my...\" gawked Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes and dozens of popped buttons and busted seams later, the two had finally found some nicely fitting clothes, Jenny giggling happily as they exited the shop. \"Better?\" asked Anna. \"Mmn!\" Jenny's stomach then let out a loud grumble, making her blush.</span></div></div>",

Heck, the fat little girl actually popped buttons and ripped seams on most of the clothes she tried on! Thankfully, the store didn't charge for that. However, it showed her that Jenny was getting way too fat. She REALLY had to do something to curb her daughter's endless appetite and get her to work off a few of those extra pounds she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny saw things from a different perspective. She was so happy she had found this new outfit. It was a dark pink dress that was looked like a tent when it was first brought out. However, the outfit fit her perfectly and, despite being a dress, really showed off her big, round, tummy. Besides, she had fun trying on all those nice clothes even if all that \"exercise\" had caused her to work up quite an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, as she waddled behind her mother her tummy rumbled loudly. So loudly in fact that a few people looked down at her as she went by. Jenny didn't care, even when a few inaudible comments were made about what a porker she was could be heard by her and Anna. She did however care about getting her hungry tummy filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we go get some cookies now? I'm STARVING.\" Jenny asked rubbing her well rounded belly to emphasize her point as well as calm the grumbles from within the great dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother thought for a moment, considering both her behavior and how big she was getting, before she replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, she wanted her daughter to be happy, but looking on as her daughter waddled out of the room and her big, round, little girl tummy sloshed and bounced with each movement she made, the adult knew things had gone too far. She knew she had to curb the 8 year old's out of control appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course as Anna was having this dilemma, Jenny couldn't have been happier. She loved how large she had grown and meant every word that she had said to her mom in the kitchen. She grinned in delight as she ate down the chips she grabbed from before. She was only half watching her cartoon. Most of her attention was split between stuffing mouthfuls of salty chips into her face, or looking over her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dome was worthy of her attention too. As big as it had been yesterday in the mall, it was far larger now. Thanks to Jenny's \"midnight snack\" she had added a good 2 inches to her girth and the dome was now taunt again from all she had eaten today. It was no wonder it had grabbed the little gainer's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that same massive, creamy-white, dome of little girl fat also caught Anna's attention. She knew, now having checked, that she was out of groceries and would have to take Jenny out for lunch, mostly likely to the McDonalds near the local grocery story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jenny's heaven. The one part of the store she showed any particular interest in whenever her mother took her there.<br>\r\nShe smacked her lips together and her tummy loudly growled a command; \"Eat.\" The girl was more than happy to agree to the request, and had began to waddle towards the aisle.

Try not to look at that aisle okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jenny sighed, deciding to look down at her feet instead...or technically the top of her round hungry tummy, wincing as it let out one more angry grumble. All she could do was rub it and hope either it would calm down, her mother would move on quick, she'd have mercy and let her grab some treats, or she could sneak away to grab some.</span></div></div>",

She had actually being doing a fairly good job of that so far, considering how she usually was when her gluttonous little fat girl gut wasn't filled with something to keep it happy. However, 20 minutes of this was getting to be more than the child could handle and it was beginning to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor child looked down at her big ball belly and rubbed the dome to keep it quite. However, this only seemed to make things worse. Her hungry young tummy was growling almost every 2 or 3 seconds. It was desperate and was trying to convey just how bad things had gotten. Jenny was all ears as she could almost hear her tummy begging for her to go to the candy isle and stuff herself with treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her chance. Her mother had let her hand go when she had whined to her before. Untethered and with little will power left, the portly 8 year old soon found that she had wondered right into the forbidden candy. She was able to have a clear thought for a moment to consider what she was doing before the sight of cookies, cupcakes and other yummy snacks filled her mind again. Oh, everything looked so good! She was starving and here was a wall of goodies only inches from her grumbling little fat girl tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were all but lost for the gainer child. Yes, the fact that little Jennifer wanted to put on pudge was the deciding factor to her. Well one of them. It was hard to tell which thought had won her over. Her desire to be fatter or the fact she wandered in front of her favorite cookies: the double stuffed, double chocolate chip ones her mother would always buy her. The 8 year old poker was indeed a chocoholic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger besieged mind was made up she wanted those cookies inside her big kid tummy as fast as she could mange. She reached for the box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jenny groaned and tried to rub her gut, but as before, that did nothing to silence it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, grabbing Jenny's hand once more, and proceeded to continue shopping, almost all healthy stuff, the kinda food Jenny's belly didn't like. It was agonizing, the girl's big round belly growling and grumbling nonstop, demanding to be stuffed to bursting with all kinds of sweets. There was food she liked everywhere, on various aisles, doughnuts, frozen pizzas, and all sort s of other things. <i><b>Grrrroooooaaaaannn...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minutes, they had finally reached checkout. There was hardly a moment when Jenny's poor, empty tummy wasn't rumbling, begging for food. But, at last, she got a break, however small: Anna, starting to pity Jenny's painful hunger,  threw a candy bar, but only a single one, into the cart. Jenny doubted that it would hold her through, but it would be all she had to go on.</span></div></div>",

It was only made worse from the sight of so many tasty treats as they had walked, or in Jenny's case waddled, down each isle. Now the child was starving for food and hoped her mom would have some mercy on her. She needed to eat and eat now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, or perhaps not so fortunately for Jenny, Anna had taken notice of the fat little girl's hunger. It was hard not to the way her tummy was rumbling. The embarrassed mother tried to hurry up the transaction as she got a strange, and slightly worried, look from the cashier. The poor woman behind the counter hadn't quite seen a spectacle like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her shopping done, and few fatty snacks bought, the poor lithe mother walked as quickly as she could out of the store. Despite the extra effort caused by this, Jenny was very happy about the more impressive pace. It meant she'd get to go to lunch sooner. Just the thought of lunch made the little girl lick her lips as her mother put the groceries in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth soon go into the car and closed their respective doors. Anna reached over to help Jenny get her seatbelt on. True, not an exercise most 8 years old needed from their mothers but with such a big, round, little tummy it was hard for the gainer kid to get the belt on over the dome. Her mom quickly began to place the seatbelt over her daughter's fat tummy when it rumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please mom! I was a good girl in the story and didn't complain too much. Can we PLEEEEASE go get some lunch now?\" the tubby little girl asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anna took occasional glances to her daughter during the trip; she knew this wasn't the best idea for Jenny's weight, but she did promise her. Then again, maybe she might be sensible about it. On the other hand, it <i>was</i> Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, wake up sweetie. We're here.\"<br>\r\n\"M-mm...?\" Jenny stirred awake, feeling something nudging gently against her. She must've nodded off on the ride over. Riding in the car tends to make her fall asleep; a fact that Anna was most of the time thankful for.<br>\r\nThe chubby girl looked out the window, getting a look at the place. The building was brightly coloured, with delicious looking pictures of different pizzas in the windows and even a playground outside.<br>\r\n\"What's this place mommy...?\" Jenny mumbled, still a bit dozy from her nap but this new site woke her up a bit.<br>\r\n\"You'll like it Jenny,\" Anna grinned to her girl, \"they let you order humongous sized pizzas, with as many toppings as you want!\"<br>\r\nJenny's eyes bugged out at this; she had no idea such a place existed!<br>\r\n\"And kids get a free dessert too.\" Anna added.<br>\r\nThat did it. Jenny was bought. She quickly removed her seat-belt, which left a slight imprint on her stomach from being rather tight, and opened the door, ready to actually <i>run</i> inside!<br>\r\n\"Hang on sweetheart!\" Anna chuckled, getting out of her door and jogging around the car to grab her daughter's thick little hand. \"Wait for me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked through the doors, the strong warm smell of fresh cheese and baking pizza smacking Jenny right in the face. This place was rather popular with families, since that's who were mostly inside today. As they joined the queue, Anna took quick glances around at the families, sitting around enjoying their meals. A lot of the other kids, from toddlers to preteens, were rather big as well. Granted not near Jenny's level, but still rather round for their ages. She noticed some kids and parents taking quick glances at her and Jenny, then returning to their meals.<br>\r\n...and that was it. No muttering beneath their breaths, no stares, no condescending looks. Just a mother and her daughter getting lunch together.<br>\r\nAnna forced herself not to smile; no one thought anything of her daughter. They had big kids too, so what's the big deal, right?<br>\r\n\"This line's so looooong,\" Jenny whined, rubbing her grumbling tummy, \"I'm hungryyy!\"<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie, I know,\" Anna shushed her softly, \"hey, why not think about what kind of pizza you want, and how big you want it? Then when it's our turn I'll let you order it.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh,\" Jenny muttered, tilting her head in thought. She liked this idea. \"Okay mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from occasional desperate pleas from her stomach to be filled, Jenny was completely quiet in thought till it was their turn to order.<br>\r\n\"Alright sweetie, have you decided what you want?\"<br>\r\nThe round little girl nodded, grinning brightly. \"Uh-huh!\"<br>\r\nAnna smiled encouragingly and gently ushered her forward. \"Go ahead then, I'll be right here.\"<br>\r\nFeeling confident with her order, Jenny waddled up to the counter.</span></div></div>",

She was no fan of fat, but with a location with such cheep, kid-friendly, food she had seen more than her fair share of fat children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to the Chubby-Cubby Pizza Parlor. Can I take your order?\" The teen asked in her friendly, kid, voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, who was not phased at all by the fact that this teenager had been looking over her well fed frame, excitedly replied to the teen saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please get a jumbo pizza with pepperoni an' bacon an' and extra cheese an'...\" Jenny continued her order with fattening item after fattening item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor teen girl behind the counter could barely keep up with the gaining 8 year old's requests. However, she got it all down and replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, got it. Just find a table and we'll bring the pizza out to you when you're ready.\" She said, again in her friendly kid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and waddled back to her mother happily. She was so glad they got to come here. However, Anna wasn't so sure given the massive order her daughter just placed. She had been good at the store, but the woman though this might be a bit too much as they headed for a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More cookies would mean her round little princess would be that little bit fatter. Knowing her eating habits, she'd start tearing that new dress within a week or two at least! She had to find a way to stop her constant growth, without disappointing her little girl.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm not sure Jenny,\" she admitted, looking down at her daughter softly.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jenny muttered, looking mortified, \"B-but you said...\"<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Anna sighed, kneeling down to Jenny's eye level and stroking her hair, \"but you're getting a bit...big for your age. You really like that dress don't you?\"<br>\r\nJenny looked down at her outfit, grinning a bit. \"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Well if you grow too much too quickly,\" Anna explained as softly as she could, \"you'll get too small for it in no time!\"<br>\r\nJenny frowned again, staring at her big round tummy that grumbled even louder, making her wince a bit. She stared up at her mother, eyes widened and watery. \"B-but...\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll get you them this time, because I promised,\" Anna sighed, defeated, \"but I want you to promise you'll at least try to cut down on your snacking, okay?\"<br>\r\nJenny beamed, giving a big nod. \"Okay mommy!\"<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" Anna smiled, giving her daughter a big hug and a kiss on her puffy cheek, then led her by her pudgy hand to the convenience store in the mall, where she picked up a few boxes of her daughter's favourite cookies; double chocolate rainbow chip. Jenny squeaked and smiled as widely as she could as she watched her mother buy the cookies, and spent the walk to the car rubbing her grumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny climbed into the back seat of the car, panting a bit but happy to finally get off her tired feet. Trips to the mall were becoming increasingly difficult for her but she could never imagine why. It was more than obvious for her mother though.<br>\r\nAt this point her tummy had stopped grumbling; with the thought that her precious chocolate rainbow chip cookies were in the car with her, her tummy was outright roaring. She winced and moaned softly as she tried rubbing it to calm it down, but the hunger pains didn't move a bit. \"Mooommyyyy...!\" The poor girl cried pathetically, on the verge of tears. <br>\r\nAnna nearly panicked and reached for a box of cookies, shoving it into her daughter's pudgy hands. Jenny sniffled and managed to smile at her mother.<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you mommy,\" she squeaked, opening up the box and greedily tucking in to her treats like she hadn't eaten in weeks. Although she felt like she hadn't.<br>\r\nAnna sighed in relief and stroked her daughter's hair, then got into the car and began to drive home.<br>\r\nOn the way, Anna looked through the mirror and saw her daughter shovelling cookie after cookie into her greedy little mouth. She let out a small sigh, thinking it was time to crack down on her plan; lower Jenny's amount at dinner more and more, so she'd start to get smaller. Maybe try and get her outside and playing at some point, join a sports club or something. But she'd worry about that part later.<br>\r\nBy the time Anna'd pulled the car into the driveway, Jenny had discarded the empty box of cookies to the seat beside her, using her thick arm to wipe off any crumbs on her chubby face.<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yummy in my tummy,\" Jenny giggled, rubbing her slightly-filled belly in satisfaction, \"can I have another box please mommy?\"<br>\r\nAnna rolled her eyes to herself as she got out of the car and opened the back passenger door, hoisting her heavy daughter to the ground. \"I'm gonna make you something special tonight sweetie. Think you can be a brave little girl and wait for dinnertime?\"<br>\r\nJenny's eyes widened. She always got excited when her mommy said she was having 'something special' for dinner. It was always delicious!<br>\r\nShe gave a big nod, beaming. \"Okay mommy!\"</span></div></div>",

Her gut was telling her something delicious was hidden amongst all that icky healthy stuff. Her gut was also telling her to gobble up the lot, but she'd cross that bridge when she waddled to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little gasp passed her lips as Jenny found her sugary prize. Right in the back sat a rather large chocolate fudge cake, in a clear plastic casing. Just the sight of it was causing the greedy girl to work up a drool. She reached her thick little arms into the fridge and pulled out the delicious dessert, gently setting it on the kitchen table and carefully removing the plastic cover. She then opened a drawer and pulled out the biggest spoon she could find that wasn't wooden, then heaved her heavy frame onto a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a tiny giggle of naughty glee, Jenny dunked the spoon into the cake and pulled out the biggest piece she could manage, which was a rather large chunk already. Her greedy mouth took the piece, leaving a chocolate mark behind on the spoon. The gooey fudge and luscious chocolate batter caused an enormous smile to break onto her round little face as she slowly chewed and savoured the sweet taste before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking her dangling legs happily, the greedy little girl began to get lost in her sugary euphoria and shovelled spoonful after spoonful of cake into her awaiting mouth, eventually abandoning the spoon and using her own thick little hands to gobble up her succulent midnight snack.<br>\r\nHer already-tight pyjamas were getting even tighter; she didn't even notice one of her buttons popping off and tapping across the kitchen tiles. They also got even messier; their wearer's carefree eating causing globs of batter and fudge goo to spill onto her top, not to mention cover her entire mouth and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all that was left of the cake were some crumbs on the plastic plate it came on; crumbs that the always-greedy Jenny was plucking off with her dirty chocolate-covered hands.<br>\r\n\"Aaahhh,\" she sighed happily, sucking cake and fudge off her fingers and drumming her fingers on her larger middle. \"All better...\"</span></div></div>",

Pretty pretty please?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, two more.\"<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie sighed softly, smiling warmly at her daughter Kathy, who was happily nibbling on the contents of a bag of milk-chocolate cookies. The adorable little six-year-old was rather chubby; her rounded belly stuck out quite a bit, her thick little thighs squished out on the sofa, rounded arms, and her pudgy hands holding onto the cookie she crunched into her chubby little cheeks. Her long ginger hair reached down her back, with a little fringe on her forehead, showing her full round freckly face. Her wide blue eyes were fixed on her cookie as she nibbled it up with a little grin. Kathy loved cookies, but she'd never tried these ones before. They were really <i>really</i> yummy!<br>\r\nJulie, a slim young woman whom Kathy had adopted her hair and features from, was sat next to her daughter, stroking her hair slowly and softly as she ate. She'd noticed Kathy had put on a few pounds in the last year or so, which wasn't helped by her rapidly developing sweet tooth and fondness for pizza loaded with cheese, her favourite dinner. She was also getting into a habit of snacking between meals, and all this was showing. Julie had bought Kathy those pink cotton pyjamas about two or three months ago, and they fit on her nice and loosely, but now, albeit still rather loose, little gaps were forming between the buttons and letting her daughter's growing tummy peek out. Julie was starting to get concerned about Kathy's growth, and needed to find a way to make her lose weight without forcing her onto a diet or to do a lot of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Kathy, that's two,\" Julie said gently, lifting the cookie bag from Kathy's lap, \"Don't want the witch to get you, do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh!\" Kathy giggled, shaking her head and sliding off the sofa onto the floor, making her tummy bounce a tiny bit, \"I didn't have too much! She won't notice!\"<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl,\" Julie smiled, brushing crumbs off her daughter's top, \"c'mon, time for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and Kathy lived in a nice house on a small neighbourhood in the country, and their house was situated next to the entrance of a large forest. Julie used this to her advantage and, a month ago, finally thought of a way to suppress her daughter's growing habit of overeating. She'd made up a story that a witch lived deep in the forest, who would lure greedy little children to her home in the night, with a lovely smell of food guiding them to her house. Once there, the witch would serve the child an enormous meal of delicious sweets and junk food for them to gobble up. If the child refused to eat, the witch would hypnotise them into eating. Once the child was stuffed full, the witch would return them home. If the child continued to be greedy, the witch would continue to lure them to her home. What the child doesn't know is, the witch's favourite meal is greedy little children, and so she wants to bloat them up like a Christmas turkey. Once the child is fattened up to the witch's satisfaction, she would gobble the child right up!<br>\r\nWith this idea planted in her over-imaginative mind, Kathy promised to stop eating whenever her mother told her to. And although she'd only lost a pound or two since hearing the story, it was still progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie took her daughter's pudgy hand and led her upstairs to the bathroom to brush her teeth, then to her bedroom to help her into bed and tuck her in.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight honey,\" Julie whispered, giving Kathy a gentle kiss on her chubby cheek.<br>\r\n\"Nightnight mommy,\" Kathy whispered back with a little smile. She watched as her mother turned on her softly lit nightlight and left the door open a crack, and listened as she heard her footsteps go down the hall, then the click of a door. She'd recognised this as mommy going to bed too.<br>\r\nKathy snuggled down and closed her eyes...but didn't feel sleepy at all. For some reason, her mind was racing about the milk-chocolate cookies. They were just, so yummy!<br>\r\nShe rolled over as she pulled her kitten plushy close and cuddled it tight. She started engaging her strong imagination...yes, she's having a tea party with her kitten, and the tea is warm and sweet. The kitten pulls a basket close to it, saying it brought some food to eat. Kathy wondered what it could be. Sandwiches, maybe?<br>\r\nThe kitten pulls out a milk-chocolate cookie. Kathy politely refuses, but the kitten keeps insisting, and the cookie gets yummier...<br>\r\nKathy's eyes opened back up. She still hadn't slept, and all she was thinking about was cookies.<br>\r\nShe removed her duvet and sneaked to her door, opening it up for her to sneak out and tiptoe downstairs to the kitchen. She flicked on the kitchen light and there it was, on the table. The bag with the remaining milk-chocolate cookies she'd been craving. She grinned and climbed onto the chair, pulling the bag close and opening it. She counted only one cookie left. She lifted it out and opened her mouth.<br>\r\nThen suddenly, she hesitated. <i>What about the witch? She might catch me!</i><br>\r\nKathy pondered this for about a minute or so, then eventually came to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<i>It's only one cookie, I'm sure she won't notice.</i><br>\r\nWith that, Kathy gleefully nibbled up the cookie, then sneaked to the pantry. She opened it up and reached into another open bag of cookies; regular chocolate chip. She cleverly lifted one out and placed it into the empty bag, putting it back on the table. That way mommy won't notice!<br>\r\n...she couldn't help but take another chocolate chip cookie just for herself, nibbling it quietly as she tiptoed to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into bed and snuggling up with her kitten plushy, Kathy, mind at ease, settled down to sleep...</span></div></div>",

A rather big dwelling in the well-off side of the suburbs, belonging to a family of two parents, and their daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica, or Angie to her friends, was one of those daughters. At seven years old, she was considered the middle daughter. Being rather shy, she was a bit of a shut-in, but she still enjoyed going outside, whether it be for family days out or just to explore the neighbourhood. She also enjoyed playing with her friends, and was an avid live-action roleplayer. Larping, as she called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was inside, however, what she did was all but social. Video games, anime, comic books and the internet had free reign of her indoor time. She would spend hours on end in her room, partaking in her library of games, manga or dvds that would make many a nerd jealous, or browsing the internet to relieve boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't <i>all</i> she'd do of course; she also snacked! Having, what her mother would playfully tease her for, a row of sweet teeth, she had an affinity for sweets and junk food. And of course, she got as much as she wanted; the pantry was almost always stuffed to the brim with greasy, sugary treats just for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was a regular girl for her age, with long brunette hair and amber eyes. All except for one obvious detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet of course had its tolls on her. She was incredibly overweight, often considered obese! Her attire for this particular day consisted of a pink t-shirt of her favourite anime at the moment, with the pale love handles and overhang of her round tummy peeking out of it and covering the buttons of her jean-shorts. She already had the beginnings of flabby, saggy breasts pushing against her shirt, and her face sported a pair of pink, round cheeks and a prominent double-chin. In the house, she wore nothing on her feet so her tubby toes were free, albeit invisible to her thanks to her protruding abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, every doctor visit she had was met with the same result; \"She's incredibly overweight, but her physical health is in peak condition!\" Everyone who was told was completely baffled.<br>\r\nShe was a round butterball of a girl, and was the complete opposite of fit, but she got good grades in school and was always sweet and friendly, if a little naive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this one day, a weekend, she was slumped in her computer chair, browsing the internet for something amusing to do, while she sipped a litre bottle of cola and dunked her hand into a family-sized bag of chips.</span></div></div>",

He was not a professional cook, nor even an amateur- actually, he worked in the upper echelon of a large claims department- but, in his free time, he researched recipes and crafted items of food that made everyone who tasted them glad to be alive. It was with a spinach-artichoke dip at an office party that he had met Annette; it was over spaghetti bolognese that he had proposed to her; it was over an expertly frosted wedding cake that he had married her; and it was after eleven years of bland, limp salads that he had, at long last, divorced her. He had saved himself and his 9-year-old daughter Susan from the machinations of a bitchy, self-obsessed mother who cared little about anything outside of her figure. The courts, seeing this, had granted him full custody, and he was planning to make the most of it. Annette had denied Susan a lot of things; Randall planned to give those back in spades. Starting, of course, with some quality food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Coombs was not expecting the smell emanating from the kitchen. Her dad was cooking something- what, he wouldn't say- and she at first had remained uninterested, preferring to lounge her lithe body on the couch and watch cartoons. For the past week since moving in, just like usual, she had eaten nothing but bland, dressingless salad; her father hadn't wanted to shock her, and she, being a generally agreeable girl, hadn't complained. As such, the smell came as a complete and utter surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her father, mixing sauce and crushing garlic, it smelled like a perfectly ordinary bowl of pasta. To Susan, who, due to her controlling mother, had never had anything like it, it smelled like Heaven itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntranced, she got off the couch and wandered to the kitchen, rapt with wonder. With every step, it only smelled better. The rich tomato sauce, the parmesan cheese, the garlic...all of it blended together into a marvelous tapestry of pure scent. Still entranced, Susan sat down numbly at the counter, gazing wistfully into the kitchen. Her father must have noticed her entrance, because he turned around then, holding aloft a large bowl filled with penne pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Susan\" he said, laying the bowl in front of her. \"I haven't had a chance to flex my cooking muscles in a while, so I hope you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan didn't answer. She merely grabbed the fork, eyes locked on the food, and slowly, ever so slowly, speared a noodle, lifted it up to her mouth, and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall smiled. </span></div></div>",

Why had he never done this before? She'd had to eat nothing but awful, plain salads all her life. This, a normal bowl of everyday pasta to her father, was like reaching nirvana. She had to enjoy as much of it as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall had to be thinking the same thing, because he wasn't that surprised when he saw his daughter smiling ear to ear and nearly moaning with delight at the pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it didn't take long for her to make quick work of the food, and she let her fork clang in the empty bowl and she rested a hand on her distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like it, sweetie?\" Randall asked quietly. His daughter could only respond with a cute little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never felt like this before. So much good food, all for her. What had she been missing all her short life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never felt so full before, or so happy.

You'll be getting much better meals from now on, I can promise you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat put Susan into an even better mood for the rest of the night, spending it resting her stuffed, rounded belly until bedtime.</span></div></div>",

That was very strange to her. She'd never woken up this early before, unless she had a bad dream or was sick. But she felt fine and couldn't remember any bad dream she had.

She sighed happily and licked her lips as she thought back to that dream, before a sound broke her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*grrrrllll*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the room for the source of the sound, but for some reason she was unable to pinpoint its location. She waited to see if it would happen again, but after a few minutes without hearing anything, she decided to try to fall back asleep. Just as her head hit the pillow, the sound was heard again, this time much louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gurrllll*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a deep hollow growl from some sort of monster. This time the sound was accompanied by a very hollow feeling in her tummy. She pulled the covers off of her and looked down at her stomach. It was still fairly round from the stuffing she did, but it seemed to have a bit of softness to it now. She gave it a little rub to see if that would help ease the hollow feeling away. As she was doing this, the growling was heard a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GNAAARRRLLL*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also felt a vibration in her tummy that accompanied the noise. She finally put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so it's you!

For her, life was looking up. Her father had booked her a years worth of sessions with the school councilor, who was to help her with the 'emotional stresses of experiencing a familial break-up' - but she barely felt she needed them. She loved her mom, of course, but she'd always been much closer to her dad, and if the usual meals of salad were going to be broken up by food as divine as that she'd eaten yesterday; well, she felt she could probably forget about her mom sooner rather than later. That night, she slept with a wide smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning was a school day, a Monday, and with her previous night's expedition completely forgotten, she jumped out of bed at 6:30 sharp and began to get ready for school. It was strange though - for once she felt energetic, rejuvenated. She was almost bouncing as she hurried around her room, grabbing the components of her school uniform from their neatly pressed and folded piles and then tugging them onto her body.<br>\r\nShe was a small for her age, a tad shorter than most of her peers and almost dangerously slight; a particularly assertive breeze could shove straight past her, and would probably knock her over as it passed. Still, today she felt enthusiastic and lively, so with a hop and a skip she ran down the stairs in a rush and headed into the kitchen - where she was stopped as dead as if she'd run into a wall by a truly heavenly smell - that of a full fry-up breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teetered further into the room, licking her lips excitedly, to see her father cooking at the stove. He looked around as she approached.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up early. I made us breakfast.\"<br>\r\nHer eyes widened at the sight - and smell - of all the cooking food.<br>\r\n\"H-how come I never knew you're such a good cook, daddy?\" Susan asked, stammering slightly in amazement. <br>\r\nHe shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Well, your mother never really let me cook anything since we got married. But now she's, uh, gone, I can cook as much as I like,\" he grinned down at her and ruffled her hair with his hand, \"We're gonna be eating a lot more good food from now on, Susie. A lot more good food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie couldn't believe how much breakfast she managed to eat - indeed, she only stopped because she checked her watch, and realised with a start that if she wasn't careful she was going to be late for school for the first time in her nine years. After finishing her mouthful - and thanking her dad extensively - she hurried off to brush her teeth and pack her bag.<br>\r\nBefore long she was back, hugging her dad goodbye at the front door. She was just about to leave when he slipped a Tupperware container into her bag.<br>\r\n\"For your lunch!\" he winked, \"Now go, or you'll miss the bus!\"<br>\r\nAnd she trotted off down the road, deeply curious as to what her father had prepared for her.</span></div></div>",

Now that she knew her father was actually a talented chef, there seemed to be no limits as to what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpaghetti? Stew?

Randall, her father, was just happy to see her enjoying food for the first time he could remember - any thoughts of limitation were far from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo inevitably, Susan fell quickly into new habits. Over the next few weeks she was more than happy to eat a proper cooked breakfast every morning, the lunch her father sent her to school with, then regular snacks once she got home followed by a big dinner to round out the day - and of course, soon the day wasn't the only thing being rounded out by large meals. The effects of such a radical increase in consumption should have been obvious, but Randall never even considered the idea that all this rich, fatty foods he was making (and, more relevantly, feeding to his daughter in fairly large quantities) would cause weight gain. As per usual though, it is the ideas that one never considers that are the most dangerous, and before long Susan was visibly not the slight, waifish creature she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around two months for the changes to become truly apparent. By the time her school uniforms were starting to be visibly ill-fitting, however, that was exactly what they were. She was still a way away from what one might call 'fat'; however, 'chubby' now seemed fairly appropriate - and for a girl who had been called 'underweight' by her doctor only half a year ago, that was no small change. Her belly had crept secretly forwards beneath her shirts, slowly swamping her ribs and hiding them beneath a layer of chub for the first time in half a decade - and it wasn't about to stop there, sneaking stealthily further outwards every day.<br>\r\nElsewhere her butt was growing wider, rounder and softer, becoming actually noticeable in a way it never had before, filling out her school uniform skirt in a way that was becoming quite immodest. Higher up, the very faintest of precursors to a double chin slipped into existence, and her facial features, following the lead set by the rest of her body, softened slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with her newfound chunkiness came an appetite; an appetite that demanded more, <i>more</i>! Eventually, things came to a head on an overcast Wednesday afternoon, just after lunch. She'd eaten the sandwiches her father had prepared, but today they'd been nowhere near enough, and so she sat in Math, belly grumbling loudly, desperate to get something else to eat...</span></div></div>",

And the vending machines in the hall were always ripe with the yummiest chocolate bars and chips of all flavours.<br>\r\nAnd the best part was, since she had been left nicely full for the longest time thanks to her dad's lovingly prepared lunches, her purse was getting as plump as she was with how much money she had saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue quickly slid across her lips at the thought. Her emergency funds were right there for her to use...but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand shot up. \"Miss, can I use the bathroom?\"<br>\r\nHer teacher nodded. \"Go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grinned and tried not to make too much of a hurry leaving the classroom, keeping her purse hidden in her fist. Luckily the vending machines were just past the girls' bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got there, she eyed up the many snacks in the machine's window. She could almost hear them speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eat us, Susie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was happy to oblige. She popped a coin into the machine and pushed the button for a chocolate bar, which she happily enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tossed the wrapper in the bin, she eyed up the machine again, and figured she could go for some barbeque chips. And so she did, and then decided on a different brand of chocolate bar...</span></div></div>",

After several chocolate bars and a couple of packets of chips she felt distinctly over-full - her belly looked more rounded than ever, all the food she'd just eaten combined with the thickening layer of flab clinging to her midsection making her look almost pregnant. Shaking her head in surprise at how easily she'd lost track of time, she grabbed her lightened purse and set off to collect her bag from her math class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd only taken a few steps, however, before she bumped into someone - a large, dark-skinned girl carrying two school bags.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Manyara,\" Susan greeted her friend. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I brought you your bag,\" Manyara said, handing it over, \"Are you alright? Miss Tender was worried you were ill or something, you never came back to math class.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, thanks\" Susie said, cheeks going slightly red. She didn't really want to admit she'd just been stuffing her face this whole time... \"I was just, uh, feeling a bit queasy. I'm better now though.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's alright then, I guess,\" Manyara shrugged, then she spotted the vending machines just behind Susan and her eyes lit up, \"Y'know, my mom always used to say that nothing heals sickness better than a Mars bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh?\" Susan mumbled, following reluctantly as her friend lead her back over to the machines. Manyara stood in front of the glass-faced box, gazing in at the arrayed snacks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said the sugar killed germs,\" Manyara continued, \"She always made me eat one a day when I was younger, to keep the doctor away.\"<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Susan nodded cautiously. She wasn't entirely sure where Manyara's mom had acquired her medical knowledge - even with her own limited understanding, that idea seemed more than a little dubious. She did, however, now understand why her friend had been overweight since before she'd even started kindergarten.<br>\r\n\"They're seriously great,\" Manyara was dropping money into the machine, and a moment later two Mars bars dropped down. She bent down to pick them up, leaving Susan to stare at her rather enormous backside - and wonder precisely how much of it was due to her apparent candy-bar diet when she was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara straightened up again with a little puff of exertion, and thrust one of the bars unexpectedly into Susan's hands, keeping the other for herself.<br>\r\n\"Huh? I'm alright, thanks,\" Susan said, trying to pass the Mars bar back to her friend. She was already feeling kinda stuffed; right then, another candy bar seemed less than appealing. Manyara was having none of it though.<br>\r\n\"Nah, eat it. It'll fix you up, guarun... garren... well, it'll fix you up for sure,\" she said with a generous smile.<br>\r\nSusan went to object, but gave it up. She knew her friend well enough to know she wasn't going to take no for an answer.<br>\r\nShe peeled the wrapper off as the bigger girl lead the way to the school exit, and began nibbling on her Mars bar once they got outside into the cool air. Before they'd reached the bus stop it was gone, and she was brushing the chocolate crumbs from the corners of her mouth.<br>\r\n\"There you are, told you you'd feel better,\" Manyara said, self-satisfied. She'd long since finished her own snack.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... much better,\" Susan tried not to grimace. Ironically enough, her lie about being ill had now left her feeling actually sick.<br>\r\nThe bus pulled up before them, and the two girls climbed aboard.</span></div></div>",

She felt like she'd burst if she ate one more bite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then, something occurred to her.

She knew he'd offer her some delicious, fragrant treat, and she wasn't at all sure she trusted herself to turn him down no matter how much her stomach ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling vaguely sick, she dropped her bag by the door and wandered into the living room, where she promptly collapsed onto the couch. She'd been doing that a lot recently - the surge of energy that had come when she'd started eating her dad's food for the first time had been quickly diminished, soon vanishing into nothing as her body became heavier and put more strain on her muscles. If anything she was lazier than ever nowadays, spending most of her spare time sprawled over the couch or her bed, whiling away time on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an indeterminate period of time, Susan heard her father arrive home. She felt a little better now, or at least well enough to roll off the couch to go and greet him.<br>\r\n\"Hello, daddy. Did you have a good day?\" they hugged briefly, then Susan remembered what she'd gotten up off the couch to say. \"Oh yeah, I told Manyara she could come for dinner, is that alright?\"<br>\r\nRandall nodded, more than happy for the excuse to cook for more people.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Sue. Who's Manyara, again? The little blonde girl?\" he asked, trying to remember. He'd seen a lot of Susan's friends over the years, and he had never been very good with names.<br>\r\n\"No, that's Jasmine. Manyara's black and she's got lots of dark hair. You must remember her, she used to come over all the time!\" Susan said, pouting slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do remember her!\" his memory sparked at last,  \"Very, uh, large girl, I recall. Annette always used to insist she only got half a serving of salad, said it'd be good for her,\" he looked vaguely disturbed that he'd allowed such a thing in the past, resolving quickly to make up for his past sins this evening, \"She's not a vegetarian or anything, is she?\"<br>\r\nSusan shook her head.<br>\r\n\"No. And she's coming at half six - and she said she was expecting dessert, too.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that can be arranged!\" Randall chuckled lightly, \"Well then, if you'll excuse me, it seems I need to get started cooking right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan returned to the couch. She could barely concentrate on what she was doing though, as ever more delicious smells wafted through from the kitchen as the hour grew later. Eventually, after at least a dozen hours of waiting, it was half past six and the doorbell's shrill ring echoed through the house.<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" Susan called through to the kitchen, jumping off the couch once again and hurrying through the house to the front door. Pulling it open, she smiled happily to see Manyara waiting just outside.<br>\r\n\"Hi! Come in, come in,\" she stood aside and let her friend make her way into the house. Manyara looked a little out of breath from the walk over, but she seemed to immediately forget about that as she caught her first whiff of Randall's cooking.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that smells great!\" she exclaimed, more than a little excited, \"When are we eating?\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon, I think,\" Susan said, taking her friend's coat and hanging it up, \"We can just go wait in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Susan, Manyara had actually gotten around to changing out of her school uniform since they parted. The other girl was now wearing a slightly cheap-looking blue dress, the material of which seemed to be acting rather more clingy (and the design more immodest) than had been originally intended due to the body which had been stuffed inside it. Now, Susan wasn't an expert in fashion by any means - however, she was fairly sure that one's dress wasn't suppose to be so short that it didn't even make it all the way past the buttocks. <br>\r\nAs a result, as the other girl bent only slightly to take off her shoes, Susan was met by an amusing and very obvious observation - Manyara still wore Hello Kitty panties.</span></div></div>",

As Susan started the climb up the stairs, she heard a <i>fwumph</i> of the couch and a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, the trek upstairs was starting to leave Susan with a bit of an ache in her legs, due to the weight she was carrying around and not having the right amount of strength to carry it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged into the living room, panting a tiny bit, and started to undress. She seemed oblivious to how her tummy had started protruding, her thighs were meatier, and her backside was more rounded out. Her face was also chubbier as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasted no time in putting on a pair of comfy track pants and a My Little Pony t-shirt which, once very loose on her, was starting to feel a little snug around the middle.

Eventually, after an excruciatingly long wait, Randall called through from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Girls! Come and eat, it's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two leaped to their feet faster than one would believe possible and all but sprinted through to the dining room. By the time they got to their seats they were both a little out of breath - though Manyara noticeably more so than her slimmer (if rapidly growing) friend. They both settled into their seats, Manyara's oversized butt spreading out impressively as she did so to cover her entire chair and a little more besides. There was a big decanter of cola in the middle of the table, and Susan politely poured them each a big glass.<br>\r\nOnce they were both settled, Randall stepped to the head of the table carrying a large dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters,\" he declared, \"Spicy pork skewers!\" he placed it down on the table and barely had enough time to withdraw his arm before the two girls attacked the platter like wild dogs, grabbing a skewer in each hand and alternating bites. He smiled happily at the sight of food he'd cooked being enjoyed - he'd missed this feeling, he'd missed it a lot.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before all the skewers had been picked clean and the girls were sitting back, appetites not at all quenched by the first course - if anything they burned brighter than ever. Fortunately, Randall had more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the main course! Deep fried beef with fries, roast vegetables, homemade onion rings and salad.\"<br>\r\nWith an exaggerated gesture he placed an oversized plate of food in front of each of them, and then stepped away to let them help themselves. He himself would eat later - for now, he just wanted to savour the sight of the two girls adoring his lovingly crafted food.<br>\r\nAnd adore it they did. They both ate like starved children, stuffing fatty food into their faces so fast that he was astonished they could even taste it. Sauce spattered their chins (3.5 in total - two for Manyara, one and a half for Susan) and their clothes, forcing down the food without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, Susan began to slow before Manyara did. She had, after all, only been truly eating and overeating for the last couple of months - Manyara had been at it her entire life, and her gut had stretched to compensate. So, as Susan was struggling to finish her first portion, Manyara was already half way through her second, and even managed to finish it just as the smaller girl was finishing up her first and only plate.<br>\r\nThey both leaned back in their chairs, wiping their mouths - Susan with a napkin, Manyara with the back of her hand - and licking clean their fingers. Both were blatantly bloated, stomachs protruding and more rounded than ever. Neither had a belt, but if they had, they certainly would have been loosening it a notch or three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that was good,\" Manyara said with a belch, \"You've gotta let me come back here again some time, Susan. I wanna come over as much as I can, this food is, like, the best <i>ever</i>!\" <br>\r\nManyara was less obviously bloated than Susan, the extra pounds of fat that buried her gut disguising the effect a little. Still, even she looked like she'd swallowed a basketball, the seams of her dress barely holding together down her flabby sides as she tried to settle more comfortable in her chair.<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great,\" Susan said, massaging her stomach to try and ease the pressing discomfort as she spoke, \"I think dad'd be really happy to have you pretty much any time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were shortly cut off, however, by something they had both somehow forgotten - the promised dessert! A great chocolate fudge cake, complete with ice cream, whipped cream, double cream and clotted cream, all topped off with a cherry. Both girls eyes widened as it was unveiled before them, simultaneously awed and somewhat afraid.</span></div></div>",

Almost at once they both fell into sleep, bellies grumbling loudly as their bodies melted down their massive meals. Randall stood in the doorway, looking at the two happily. He'd been afraid to divorce Annette for so long, but now he'd done it he felt better than ever - and from the looks of it, Susan and her friend were more than happy as well. Treading lightly, he crept over and pulled a blanket over the two sleepers, then left the two overfed girls to their digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, over the next few months a new routine was formed. Once a week at first, then two or three times a week later, Manyara would come over for dinner and Randall would happily serve enough food to stuff them into unconsciousness - and neither girl was anywhere near strong enough to resist their gluttony. Before long, Susan was managing two servings of everything, and Manyara sometimes three. <br>\r\nSusan had talked to her dad about often feeling hungry at school after lunch, and he had been more than happy to oblige her; she now had a large container of pasta to dig into every midday, boosting her daily consumption higher than ever. She didn't know it of course, but before long she was eating easily twice what a girl her age should be - and it was showing more and more on her body each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once skinny girl could now accurately be described as fat; her every aspect now was softened, expanded or weakened by her rocketing weight, making her almost unrecognisable. Her midsection now bulged forwards from her body, a rolling, rounded belly that stretched out her clothes and sagged into her lap whenever she sat down. Where once one could count her every rib, now one could only count the single oversized thickness that was her stomach. <br>\r\nHer butt had expanded too, widening again and becoming softer than ever. Completely devoid of muscle, it spread out beneath her to fill any chair when she sat, and jiggled slightly with every step as she walked (though that was an activity that was becoming more and more rare). Her thighs too were thicker now, their chunky girth tending to rub together in a way that got quite uncomfortable - just another factor that put her off the slightest hint of exercise.<br>\r\nThey weren't the only things to have changed though - her face had softened even further, becoming more rounded as she put on more and more pounds, and her cheeks took on a perpetual rosiness. The slight promise of chub at her throat had quickly bloomed into a full-on double chin, her once-sharp jawline thoroughly obliterated.<br>\r\nEven her upper arms were meatier, thick with flab despite her complete lack of muscle. The sleeves of her tops now pinched uncomfortably around the armpit, but she would just shrug and presume she was growing - which indeed she was, just in the thoroughly wrong direction.<br>\r\nFinally, her chest had also seen changes - in part due to her age, mostly due to her gain. It had become chunky and swollen, flabby mounds pressing against the thin fabric of her shirts in away that became quickly immodest - and still her obliviousness was impenetrable, ignoring the every sign of how rapidly her body was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now some three months after the first time Manyara had come for dinner and Susan was at school eating her lunch in the canteen, feeling irritable. Their gym teacher had been away from school the entire year due to a freak bullfighting accident, but now he was back - and the layabout replacement gym teacher who'd never made them do any actual gym was gone again. They hadn't done any <i>real</i> gym all year, and Susan was not at all looking forward to that afternoon when she'd have to actually do exercise for the first time in ages...</span></div></div>",

She and Manyara looked at each other with dread - the larger girl, who had actually grown even bigger thanks to a lot of Randall's dinners and desserts, had never been good at gym, and she was enjoying the break away from it just as much as Susan was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it won't be so bad...?\" Susan muttered as the two girls waddled to the changing room.<br>\r\n\"Susie, it's <i>gym</i>,\" Manyara reminded her, \"<i>nothing</i> good comes from gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two girls were in the changing room, they started getting ready. Susan was oblivious to how her larger belly bounced free once she had removed the top of her uniform, and how she had to wriggle her plump backside into her shorts, which squeezed her thighs almost uncomfortably. She had to keep tugging her shirt over her belly to keep it hidden, and after a few times of it riding back up, she managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were in a line next to the fitter girls, standing in front of the old gym teacher.<br>\r\n\"Okay girls,\" he began, clapping his hands to get their attention, \"I don't know how the substitute teacher was doing while I was gone, but we'll be getting back to the regular system now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was teaching us far better actually,</i> Susan thought grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we'll start with some warmups,\" he continued, \"some stretches to begin. Okay, ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan bit her lip, but complied and followed the instructions. Stretching was much harder after a year of slacking off - raising her arms took significantly more effort, but that was due to the flab accumulating on them and the muscles being underused for so long.<br>\r\nTrying to touch her toes was also a failure, since she couldn't even <i>see</i> them anymore, let alone <i>touch</i> them. Her every attempt caused her tummy to bunch up and press against her, getting her plump fingers nowhere close to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted and puffed, already red in the face. Though, taking a look to Manyara and seeing how she was faring no better - in fact, she was doing marginally <i>worse</i> - Susan couldn't help but be grateful she at least wasn't alone.</span></div></div>",

Apparently his bullfighting accident had not diminished his enthusiasm for the class. \"Now for some pushups! Everybody ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara desperately shook her head <i>no</i>, sending her second chin jiggling. Susan was inclined to agree- she was already breaking out into a sweat, and she didn't think that either her or her larger friend could handle 45 more minutes of this torture. So, in a bid to escape, she called out, \"Mr. Mantequilla, can me and Manyara please go to the nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their teacher, who had been busy calibrating his stopwatch, turned to the two girls in confusion. \"Hm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tried again. \"Mr. Mantequilla, Manyara and I aren't feeling very well. Can we please go to the nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" He jogged over to them nervously, bending over to inspect Susan once he arrived. \"What's bothering you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan hadn't actually planned that far ahead. \"Well, sir, we- uh- well, you see-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara, sensing her difficulty, interjected with \"We're too tired to do this, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan loved Manyara more than anyone else in the world, but at that moment she could have strangled her. Mr. Mantequilla, heretofore understanding, grinned sadistically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know why you girls are so tired! It's because you've turned into two little <i>gorditas</i>! And that's precisely the problem <i>this</i> class is supposed to combat, <i>si</i>? Unless you can get me a proper medical exemption, you're not going anywhere! Now let's get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Susan, dripping with sweat, strained mightily to hold up her fattened form on weakened limbs. Thus far, she'd only managed one pushup, and already she was absolutely exhausted. On the teacher's command, she dropped, only to fall ungraciously all the way down, belly squishing beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Manyara whispered from her left side. Susan's sole consolation was that her bigger friend had fallen before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Susan whispered back, struggling to regain her breath. \"If only we actually had that exemption...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like that, a lightbulb went off in her little brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then they'd both be free of this uncomfortable, sweaty work forever!<br>\r\nThen her heart sank again as she realised that she'd still have to struggle through the whole rest of the gym class first - and even though they'd only been at it less than a quarter of an hour, she was already thoroughly exhausted. Her weak, flabby muscles were burning with the unaccustomed use, all the bouncing up and down and stretching was making her overfed stomach ache, and she was completely drenched in sweat. With a distinctly unladylike grunt she rolled over onto her back to take some pressure off her middle, the wooden flooring of the gym hall hard against her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really used to discomfort nowadays - she'd become rather pampered in the last few months as her dad doted excessively over her, delighted just to be allowed to parent as he'd always wanted. All that, however, just meant that the few times that she did have to do something uncomfortable she felt all the worse.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you lazy cows! Get it together!\" Mr. Mantequilla was shouting from the front, evidently very much frustrated by what had happened to his class while he was absent, \"Now, sit-ups! I want at least twenty out of each of you or you're staying here after school tomorrow so I can beat you into shape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Susan and Manyara complied. Hands behind their heads, they struggled agonisingly to pull themselves into a sitting position using only their horribly neglected abdominal muscles. Susan's shirt had long since ridden up exposing her plump, pale belly, the excess flesh bunching up into flabby rolls as she dragged herself painfully upright.<br>\r\nOnce she was there, a grand one-twentieth of the way towards her goal, she looked over at Manyara beside her. The other girl was somehow being even less successful than Susan, barely able to even lift her upper body off the floor. With a great effort, the other girl made it to perhaps a fifty degree angle - then her body failed her and she collapsed backwards, soft back fat cushioning the landing. She looked over at Susan, despair in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I'm never gonna manage even one!\" she whined, clutching her aching belly and looking close to tears. Although the difference between them had narrowed radically in the last few months, Manyara was still a fair bit bigger than Susan - due in no small part to her own weight gain since she'd starting eating masses of Randall's food every week. <br>\r\nSusan let herself fall back into a lying position, equally despairing. She wasn't at all sure she could manage more than one or two more sit-ups either, but having to come back after school to do extra exercise sounded like her worst nightmares come true.<br>\r\n\"C'mon Manyara, we can do it. See if you can use your arms to help out without Mr M. noticing,\" she said, trying not to acknowledge just how hopeless the situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting and wheezing, the two turned all their efforts towards making it closer to twenty. Sweat dripped from their bodies, soaking their clothes and making the floor slick as they each levered themselves upright, using their arms to help whenever Mr. Mantequilla looked away. After what felt like hours, Manyara was at two and Susan at nine - and both were utterly, completely exhausted. They lay uselessly on the floor, gaping and shuddering like stranded fish - or perhaps more appropriately, beached whales. Their chubby chests rose and fell as they desperately tried to suck in enough air to carry on, but they were both far too unfit to even hope to succeed, even cheating as they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing they knew, Mr. Mantequilla was standing over them, shaking his head despairingly.<br>\r\n\"Looks like you two are coming back here tomorrow after school; that was a shameful display,\" he looked down at the two of them, looking genuinely disappointed in the overweight girls, \"I expected better from you especially,\" he said to Susan, a grim expression on his face as he looked upon her heaving form. <br>\r\nThe two girls were two exhausted to speak - they could just gasp and wheeze and look up at him apologetically, hearts beating so fast their pulses were just a continuous roar echoing in their heads, almost drowning out the gym teacher's comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away and addressed the class once again.<br>\r\n\"Alright! Seeing as most of you seem to have completely forgotten what exercise even <i>is</i> while I was gone, it's time for something a little less arduous. Pair up and practice throwing and catching. I think all of you can manage that!\"</span></div></div>",

On the way back, she saw that a lot of the other girls weren't faring that much better than her or Manyara.

The girls all filed back into the changing rooms where Manyara and Susan just collapsed onto benches, too exhausted to even bother changing back into their school uniforms. Both of them felt like hell, their muscles burning from the unaccustomed use and their heads pounding. Before they could rest too much though it was time to follow the rest of their class to math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, math didn't feel anywhere near as long as gym had. Neither of them actually contributed to the lesson in any meaningful way, but at least the sit down let their abused bodies recover somewhat. By the time they were heading outside towards the school bus, they had both mostly recovered from their ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey settled into their regular seats on the bus, sides pressed closely together due to their newfound bulk - the school bus had always been a little squashed, but with both girls now heavily overweight there was even less space than ever, leaving their chunky bodies squashed up tightly against one another.<br>\r\nAfter a while, Susan's mind kicked into gear.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you coming over this evening? We can get my dad to write us an exemption from gym after school tomorrow,\" she asked, twisting awkwardly to address the girl pressed up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan felt Manyara shrug.<br>\r\n\"I dunno... I feel kinda actually ill. All that gym stuff was horrible...\" Manyara admitted, rubbing her stomach miserably, \"I might just go home.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Manya,\" Susan protested, \"Dad said he was cooking lasagna again and you love that!\"<br>\r\nThe other girl looked undecided, biting her lip.<br>\r\n\"Maybe... I just don't wanna have to go home then walk all the way to your house as soon as I've started relaxing...\" she confessed.<br>\r\n\"Well, just come straight to mine then,\" Susan suggested, \"C'mon Manyara, you love dad's food. Plus we even have a big family pack of Mars Bars if you still feel ill when we get there.\"<br>\r\nThat made up Manyara's mind.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll come,\" she said, pleased by Susan's enthusiasm, \"I guess your dad's food is a lot better than takeaway anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the bus drew to a stop, and Manyara and Susan walked the short distance along the road to Susan's house. Susan pulled the door handle and found it open - her dad must already been home. They headed inside, dropping their bags carelessly by the doorway, and wandered through to the kitchen, where they found Randall already at work cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad. We're home,\" Susan announced them, and he turned from where he was chopping garlic on the counter.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello girls,\" he smiled. After quickly rinsing his hands clean he stepped forwards to hug Susan - and his nose wrinkled at the distinct smell of sweat that surrounded her, \"I, uh, think you need to change your clothes, Susie,\" he suggested politely.<br>\r\nShe looked down, the sight of her gym kit reminding her of what she'd been meaning to ask.<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I'll do that later, I need to ask you something though - can you write me and Manyara medical exemption letters for gym?\" <br>\r\nRandall's brow furrowed.<br>\r\n\"Why is that? Are you both ill?\" he asked, bemused.<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Susan laughed, \"It's just really tiring and we don't wanna do it. Today was <i>awful</i>; the gym teacher made us do twenty sit-ups or we'd have to go back tomorrow for extra gym, and neither me or Manyara got close so we both have to go back after school. Like, what kind of crazy sports-person can just go and do twenty sit-ups in a row?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall's frown deepened. He was not a particularly aware person, tending to drift through life until something prompted him to pay attention. That was how he'd let his daughter grow from medically underweight to obese in less than a year, after all. However, even he couldn't ignore everything.<br>\r\n\"Ah, a lot of people can do twenty sit-ups, Susan. It's not that much at all,\" he pointed out, vaguely alarmed. He looked down upon his daughter\u2019s rounded form, wondering for the first time if all the massive, unhealthy meals he\u2019d been feeding her the last few months weren\u2019t having some sort of effect. She- she did look a lot heavier than he remembered, now that he thought about it - especially with her soft body bursting out of her gym kit in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pouted. This wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d expected him to react at all! <br>\r\n\u201cNo they can\u2019t. Me and Manyara couldn\u2019t anyway, and we\u2019re as fit as anybody,\u201d she whined, stomping her foot like a brat. Randall watched her thick thigh jiggle from the impact, biting his lip. Maybe he had gotten a little carried away with feeding her all his cooking\u2026 even the other girl, Manyara, looked bigger than he remembered \u2013 and that was saying something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Susie\u2026 maybe all this food isn\u2019t doing you much good,\u201d he said, the words catching in his throat, \u201cYou\u2019re at a delicate age. Maybe laying off on some of my cooking would be for the best if twenty sit-ups are too much for you.\u201d<br>\r\nSusan\u2019s looked devastated and angry in equal measure.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d she demanded, \u201cI\u2019m fine! You- you sound just like mom!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last comment broke Randall\u2019s resolve. What had been the point of tearing his family apart if he was just going to behave like Annette anyway? Susie was at that age when a lot of girls put on a little weight for their growth spurts \u2013 he was definitely just making mountains out of molehills.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m sorry, Susie. I just overreacted for a moment there. It\u2019s been a long day at work, sorry,\u201d he went to hug her apologetically but she stepped away, scowling.<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You were being silly there,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cJust finish making dinner. Come with me Manyara, I\u2019m going to go and get changed.\u201d<br>\r\nShe marched from the room with Manyara in tow and Randall watched her plump buttocks jiggle away, soft flab barely contained by her straining shorts. <br>\r\nSighing, he shook his head and returned reluctantly to cooking.</span></div></div>",

The effort of climbing stairs, already difficult for young ladies of their size, was made even more difficult by the trials of the day that had passed before, so it was with great relief that the two of them, huffing and puffing, collapsed onto Susan's bed, box springs screaming out in protest of their weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huff...</i> I can't <i>wait</i> to get out of these clothes!\" Susan cried disdainfully, clutching a corner of her sopping shirt in one chunky fist. \"I'm going to live in my pajamas <i>all</i> weekend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara was a bit quieter than Susan, as the larger girl was still trying to catch her breath, but no less enthusiastic. \"I...<i>hff</i>...agree...\" she wheezed, trying to smooth her too-small gym shirt over a wide band of exposed brown flesh. \"I wish I had...<i>hff</i>...something to wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan waved her hands exasperatedly. \"Oh, don't be silly! You can wear something of mine! Just hang on a minute, I need to have a look first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the smaller of the two large girls stood up, with some difficulty, and began lumbering around the room looking for clothes. Drawers were opened, shelves examined, closets checked, but, to her chagrin, nothing of hers could be made to fit Manyara. With a mild expletive, she stepped into the bathroom to put on her own pajamas- which, in and of themselves, could only be said to \"fit\" with a very generous definition of the word- and set off to find something to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as the only girl remaining in the house, clothing options were limited. Her father's shirts, despite being large in their own way, were made to fit his lanky figure, not Manyara's plush one, so they couldn't work. The few boxes remaining of her mother's were also, very obviously, out of the question. With palpable frustration, Susan combed through a few more boxes sitting in the basement until, finally, she came across something of use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n\"Manyara! Check this out!\" Susan said triumphantly, returning, red-faced, up the stairs with a largish suitcase in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what is it?\" answered the larger girl, who had remained sitting so as not to tire herself unduly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes! And in your size, too!\" Susan replied, opening the case with the air of a sideshow barker. \"Shirts, pants, dresses...there's even a bit of jewelry in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" Manyara exclaimed, eyes wide. \"These are really nice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a little jealous! Here, try this on,\" Susan agreed, passing over a black silk dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara wasted no time, disrobing unabashedly and pulling the dress over her head. \"This is awesome, Susie, thank you! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"You look adorable! It goes with your hair and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara smiled back. \"Aww, thank you! I wish I could keep it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course you can! Take the rest of them too, I probably won't need them anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insult, even if accidental, didn't miss Manyara. <i>At that rate...</i> she thought to herself spitefully, before dismissing it. <i>No, she's your friend! Take the clothes!</i> <br>\r\nTo distract herself, she asked \"Where did these come from, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they were my Aunt Bertha's,\" Susan answered distractedly. \"Mom didn't fit into them, of course, but she said they were good motivation. Apparently Aunt Bertha was a real whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara, even with her forgiving nature, couldn't ignore that one. <i>A whale, huh? Says <b>you</b>...</i> \"Oh, how about that,\" she answered aloud, through gritted teeth. Luckily, she was saved from more anger by Randall's impassioned shout of \"Dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the anger returned in force when Susan, hurrying towards food, took the stairs two at a time, reaching the table well before Manyara's waddle- necessary, as she couldn't see the stairs beyond her gut- took her down even halfway. <i>I'll show you who's a whale,</i> she thought, a ghastly smile creasing her flabby face. </span></div></div>",

And in those weeks, Susan and Manyara continued to eat and eat and <i>eat</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Susan was fat would be an understatement - by now, she was practically the size Manyara was at the start of this whole deal. She had to wiggle her prodigious hips to get her comfy sweatpants past her massive rear. Though, the only sweating she'd do was if she had to take one too many trips up and down the stairs.<br>\r\nShe was convinced that the only reason her shirts stopped covering her belly was because they were shrinking in the wash, and as much as Randall knew that wasn't the case, he decided to go along with his daughter's delusion and get her some new, bigger clothes. He even made sure to swap the brand of washing detergent he used, at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was slowly starting to match Manyara in size, but her best friend was still noticeably larger thanks to frequent dinners at her house. Her belly sagged down quite a bit, and any skirts or dresses clung close to her wide form. Her larger rump made her panties rather snug, and easy to see if she ever had to bend over.<br>\r\nShe had quickly forgiven Susan's accidental insults from weeks prior, knowing her best friend would never mean to hurt her. Plus, she let her finish her dessert when she was too full, which helped improve her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">                   </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Susan waddled herself into the kitchen, and grinned as she saw her loving father was cooking at the oven.<br>\r\n\"Morning, daddy,\" she chirped, giving him a hug.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sweetie,\" Randall smiled and put his arm around her, using his other hand to keep cooking...what smelled like sausages to Susan, \"breakfast's nearly ready.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" The large daughter giggled and sat herself at the table, her chair creaking ever so slightly. Her being spoiled and stuffed stupid for a matter of months had made her into a bit of a daddy's girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall set down a plate in front of Susan, holding a generous helping of sausages, scrambled egg, poptarts and toast topped with chocolate spread. He smiled lovingly as she thanked him before digging in, savouring every huge bite of her big breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the sight of his daughter enjoying her food so much gave him an idea...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Randall had always been the one cooking for his daughter these past several months, and had never given himself a proper break. Seeing the joy and satisfaction on Susan's face when she ate his meals was always enough motivation for him to not slack off in cooking them. It was also enough motivation for him to put his brief revelation about Susan's unfitness into the past and forget about it almost completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe deserved a break. \"Hey, Susie,\" he said to her while he sat down in front of the much smaller, leaner breakfast he prepared for himself. \"It's Friday, so how about we go to the Texas for dinner tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's jaw dropped at the mention of the famous restaurant, hurriedly closing it to keep her breakfast from falling out of her full mouth. She swallowed without finishing her chewing. \"For real!?\" she exclaimed. She had never been there, since her late mother absolutely forbid it and and after her food revolution began her father had cooked every one of her meals. She heard the praises sang by her classmates about it and had dreamed of going since her new love of food emerged. A surprise like this was only one step below being told that Father Christmas himself was coming to bring presents to her tonight in addition to Christmas morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big Texas Ranch was a locally-owned restaurant specializing in American and Mexican-American cuisine. It was renowned for the food being as delicious as the portions were large. \"Texas-sized\" was the buzzword commonly used by the wait staff and the multitude of impressed customers. \"American-sized\" was large enough, but it's a common saying that \"everything's bigger in Texas,\" and the owners of the establishment certainly took those words to heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I invite Manyara?\" she was quick to add. An opportunity like this needed to be shared with her best friend who had now solidly become an eating buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father chuckled a bit at her response. He should have expected this reaction. This would be even more of a treat for her than it was for him. \"Go ahead.\" He paused his fork in its track as an idea struck him. \"Ask her if her mother wants to come too. We live so close but I haven't seen her in a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Susan said, and returned to eating with newfound excitement. She wolfed down her rich breakfast in record time, all without choking. She wriggled her cushioned butt from the seat and stood up. The thick, meaty ball of her belly always expanded farther after every meal, and while she was sitting, pushed her pajama tee up so that it no longer covered any of its expanse and bunched up below the pair of slowly-growing fat bulges on her chest. Now standing, she tugged on the hem of the tee and forced it to the level of her navel. It's inflexible fabric cut into her plush flesh, but that tension held it in place, as long as it wasn't jarred with any exertion from the tubby girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking upstairs to her room was more of a chore than ever, and her top found its way back to its previous position. The strength of her muscles had no significant increase since the start of eating filling meals, and they protested when tasked to lift the new and increasing layers of fat. Her stance was forced to be wider as she stepped upon the stairs so that her thick pillow thighs wouldn't squeeze and rub together so much. Every part of her body jiggled as she landed each step, from the aforementioned thighs to her ponderous belly, love handles that could never be covered by any shirt she owned at the same time as her gut, buttocks that threatened to tear the weak pink fabric of her pajama pants, arms that looked like sausages but felt like marshmallows, thick chipmunk cheeks that already looked stuffed with treats, and even her extra chin. Although her skin and outfit was covered with a thin sheen of sweat by the time she got there, she made it to the top of the stairs without stopping once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, Susan fussed her body and its rolls out of her pajamas and dressed into her school uniform. The skirt had long ago refused to fit around her waist and barely fit around her hips. The shirt no longer tucked in neatly to the waistband and only buttoned when Susan sucked in her belly fat (as best as she could with her weak muscles) and squeezed it with her hands. It did not cover her middle completely and left covered less than half of each love handle, as well as left a triangle of pale flesh visible below the last button, as framed by the two front shirttails. Both articles were the largest size offered by the school, and Randall's new fabric softener had the rare property of stretching out most materials instead of shrinking them. It did not, however, loosen any part of the skirt except for the waistband, and anyone Susan's height or shorter would be able to see flashes of strained panties if they walked behind her lumbering form. Socks and shoes were a challenge, as they required the obese girl to squish a meaty thigh into a round doughy middle. Ordeals such as dressing herself required her to wake up significantly earlier than what used to be usual, but this did not bother Susan as she usually went straight to bed after her post-dinner snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe verified with a glance in the mirror that she was dressed mostly-appropriately for school. The sweat she accumulated from her trial with the stairs had evaporated from the time each inch of her skin spent nude during the extended dressing session. She wiped her face clean with a wet cloth and proceeded to walk back downstairs. Her legs were relieved that they did not have to lift her body up so far this time, and therefore she did not sweat on her descent, but she could still feel every pound and ounce wobble and jiggle just as it had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered up her backpack, waved goodbye to her father, and walked onto the street to the waiting bus. She and Manyara had (through constant badgering) persuaded the school bus driver to stop in front of each of their houses to pick them up and drop them off, instead of the traditional method of waiting for both girls by the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of the bus was much narrower than any in her house, and Susan could feel her hips brushing against the sides of it as she climbed the last four steps she would need to that morning. She plopped herself down in the front seat, near the window, and a minute later watched as Manyara worked and struggled to positively squeeze her enormous, skirted rear through the door and onto the bus. Unlike Susan's father, Manyara's mother had spent the money to get her daughter clothes not offered by the school catalog. They were manufactured by a different brand and therefore technically did not meet the dress code, but except for size there was very little difference. Susan could see that not all of Manyara's sweat had evaporated like hers had and glistened gently on her face when she heaved herself onto the seat next to her. Now that both of their buttocks and thighs were fully spread from the weight of their bodies pressing down on them, Susan felt squished against the wall of the bus on one side and her friend on the other, and only about half of Manyara was truly on the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her friend was settled, Susan burst into speech. \"Hey, my dad said you and your mom should come with us to the Texas for dinner tonight!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to go,\" Manyara answered, her eyes suddenly brightening at the news. \"I'm sure my mom would too. I'll tell her as soon as we get back home. Have you ever been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Susan answered, \"but I've heard so much about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara's response began with a grin. \"You'll love it, I'm sure. It's not much like how your dad cooks, but I still know you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tried to wiggle in her seat from excess excitement and ended up shaking Manyara's body just as much as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day passed as usual, with the two tubby grade-schoolers doing their best to stay focused on the teacher despite their anticipation, and of course, their recurring hunger. Mr. Mantequilla had quit his job in frustration at the incompetence of not just Manyara and Susan, but the softening of the student body as a whole that took place under the substitute teacher. The school administration was doing their best to get him back, but for now the substitute was back in charge, and his laziness was beaten only by that of the two fattest girls in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls loaded themselves back onto the bus at day's end and unloaded themselves in front of their respective houses. Susan waddled in through the door, calling out, \"Hi Dad!\" to announce her arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Susie,\" he called back. He was in the kitchen, as usual, just about to start baking some sweets and treats for his ever-hungry daughter who consumed a surprising amount of them between every meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's stomach growled with an accompanying ache the moment she set her backpack down. This was normally the time when she ate her post-school snack, which filled her up and would tide her over until dinner came. She trotted slowly over to her father. \"Dad, can we go to the Texas soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" he asked, confused. The clock on the wall showed that it was not even three-thirty yet. Susan opened her mouth to speak but was interrupted by an even louder groan and moan from her belly. Randall heard it and made a sound that combined a giggle and a sigh. \"Alright, I'll call Lou Anne and Manyara. You go get yourself ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susan wasted no time in getting herself ready. After another arduous trek up the stairs and building up a new sweat, she lumbered into her room and started changing. She pulled off her shoes with her feet and kicked them neatly next to the wall, electing to keep her socks on to avoid anymore effort. <br>\r\nHer shirt and skirt were more than happy to come off, her rounded form bouncing out the moment it was released from the strain of waistbands and buttons. And Susan was more than happy to discard them onto her bed before deciding what to wear for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided on a pair of jean-shorts first, needing to wiggle her bulbous backside to get the waistband past it. She sucked in, which took quite a bit of effort, and quickly fastened the button before exhaling. The fabric stuck into her, giving her some strain on the rear, and her thick thighs were a little squeezed in the legs.<br>\r\nNext was to find a top. She decided on a t-shirt with a logo with one of her favourite video games on it. With her great ball of belly sticking out and overhanging her waist, the shirt was quite a tight fit. Her thick lovehandles made the fabric really snug on her wide form, causing her to have to tug it down over her flabby front. If she didn't have to go through any tough physical strain later, she should be okay.<br>\r\nHer shoes, a pair of sneakers, were the easiest. With the laces already tied, all she had to do was slip them on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything else, the smell of fresh baking from downstairs hit her nose. Her tongue quickly slid across her lips as her belly let out another aching grumble. Wasting no more time, she lumbered downstairs and into the kitchen to see a pile of chocolate chip cookies on a plate at the table.<br>\r\n\"I just thought you could use a little snack to tide you over till we get to the Texas,\" Randall said with a smile, and ruffled his daughter's hair, \"Lou Anne and Manyara will meet us there, so we'll leave in about half an hour, okay?\"<br>\r\nSusan grinned from the petting, and nodded. \"Thanks dad!\" She chirped before digging into the cookies. With the amount there were on the plate, and how big Susan's appetite had grown along with her body, she shouldn't be hungry again until they get to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just as Randall pulled the car into a parking spot near the Big Texas Ranch, a hungry growl sounded from next to him. He smiled at his daughter sitting in the passenger seat, who was staring longingly at the restaurant.<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" he chuckled, \"ready?\"<br>\r\n\"You know I am,\" Susan giggled, quickly undoing her seatbelt and sliding out of the passenger car door, landing on the ground with a heavy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked toward the front doors, where a familiar duo were waiting anxiously. Not out of meeting their contacts, but excitement to get inside and devour.<br>\r\nManyara spotted her best friend, and waddled up to greet her. She was wearing one of the dresses Susan gave her from her Aunt Bertha, and even it was looking rather strained on her spherical form. <br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She chirped.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Susan smiled, \"this place <i>is</i> big, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Manyara grinned, causing her huge plump cheeks to squint her eyes even more than normal, \"So you've never been here, huh?\" Susan shook her head in response. \"You're gonna <i>love</i> it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two adults greeted each other with a hug. Lou Ann was clear evidence where Manyara got her size and appetite from - the woman was rather massive in her own right, sporting a figure not unlike her daughter's. Her jeans and shirt looked almost skin-tight on her round form, her prodigious backside straining the rear of her pants.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being so nice to Manyara, Randy,\" she said, then added with a smirk, \"<i>Really</i> nice, huh?\"<br>\r\nRandall blushed with a shy smile, knowing she was obviously referring to how her daughter was ballooning lately. \"What can I say, she has a healthy appetite.\"<br>\r\nLou Ann let out a belly-wobbling chuckle. \"Don't I know it. Girl just <i>loves</i> stuffing her face, but hey, it's good for her right?\"<br>\r\nThe father nodded. \"Agreed. I'm really glad I could start giving Susan some <i>real</i> food.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought she looked different,\" Lou Ann said, craning her neck to see the formerly skinny girl, \"she used to be such a twig, didn't look healthy at all.\"<br>\r\nRandall could just nod in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Pillars stretched to the ceiling made of bare wood with the rough texture approximately that of railroad ties. The walls were covered in horse whips, wagon wheels, pieces of saddles, and other iconic artifacts from the Old West. The air inside was cozily warm and country music bounced through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hostess showed the two families to their seats. Many restaurants would be closed at this time of the afternoon but the Texas understood its own popularity. Even now about a half-dozen tables were occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of the new arrivals looked through the menu, which was thick enough to better resemble a catalog. Burgers, sandwiches, seafood, steak, pasta dishes, tacos and burritos- Randal and Susan looked at the impressive selection with eyes like orbs. There were even American specialties having nothing to do with Texas at all, such as Chicago dish pizza and Louisiana Cajun crawfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress came by just a few minutes later, when Randall and Susan hadn't even finished exploring the expansive, diverse menu. She looked to be in her late teens, with round, blush cheeks, a cute button nose, well-trimmed eyebrows, and a thick body ripe with generous curves. She giggled at the sight of the three female bodies that her own sympathized with. \"Hey, y'all, my names Christina and I'll be your server today. What can I get'cha for your first order?\" Randall was the only one to notice that she said \"first\" order to imply that making a second or perhaps third order was standard. He was also the only one to notice that her accent fit better in a bad cowboy movie than any place in Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you want, Susie?\" he asked his daughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure thing, honey!\" Christina scribbled on her pad, then turned towards Manyara. \"And for you, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the same thing as her!\" Manyara beamed, her smile creasing her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All-righty! Y'all are a nice easy table,\" Christina giggled. \"And for you in the back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll have a...uh...just a salad?\" Randall asked, feeling slightly self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina cocked an eyebrow. \"A salad? At the Big Texas Ranch? Whatever you say, pardner.\" She scribbled something on her pad. Randall couldn't help but notice that the accent slipped just a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about you, ma'am?\" she asked, turning towards Lou Ann. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Ann smiled politely. \"I guess I'll just have a salad too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall was rather surprised at that, considering the roundness of both her and her ever-growing daughter, but was even more surprised when the waitress' face switched into an outright scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, I'll have your orders out soon.\" Christina hissed, all traces of Texas gone. In its place was a very clear Cockney accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't appear to notice, though- they were too busy enjoying each other's company, laughing and giggling about school and such. Randall wished he could be so carefree; alas, everything in life seemed to be weighing on him lately. Work seemed endless, his coworkers were catty and rude, and, to top it off, he wasn't sure he was doing such a good job as a parent. Susie had absolutely blown up over the past couple of months, and showed no signs of stopping in the future. That was probably a bad thing...right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Lou Ann happily gazing into the distance. <i>She must not have a worry in the world,</i> he thought sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the contrary, Lou Ann was very much worried about her little Manyara. <i>Only one meal? Gosh, I hope she's feeling alright! Oh god, what if...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>what if she has anorexia?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked around the restaurant, idly scratching at an exposed portion of her chubby belly. It had seemed like hours since she had put her order in, and she was really starting to get hungry. <i>I should have ordered an appetizer,</i> she grumbled to herself. <i>Then again, it's probably a good thing I didn't.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't want to get fat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Manyara, ignoring her own hunger pangs, glared across at her distracted friend. Truthfully, though she had forgiven Susie for the unintentional slight, she had not forgotten it. Now, though, she was regretting ever entertaining forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid Susie, going out like that... she's so skinny she thinks it's okay to have her belly out all over the place? I wear these uncomfortable dresses all the time, and <b>she</b> gets to wear <b>shorts?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara sighed out loud by accident, and Susie turned slightly, distracted. The larger Thai girl plastered a fake grin on her face and Susie turned away once more. Once Susie was safely occupied, the glare returned stronger than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I'm tired of being the fat one...</i><br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All-right, everybody! Y'all's dinners're out and piping hot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall's head snapped towards the waitress, startled into paying attention. He had inadvertently been staring at Lou Anne, and he hoped she hadn't noticed. \"Uh, salad here, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's eyes narrowed. \"Ah know, Mister. No need to tell <i>me</i> how to do my job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall received his salad in silence, thoroughly chastised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Ann took her own and smiled comfortingly across the table. To tell the truth, she didn't really want this salad; she just didn't want to look fat in front of Randall. Unfortunately, she was sure to go hungry later- in her family, it was usually Manyara finishing <i>her</i> dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for you girls...two Super Deluxe Texas Platters, just as you ordered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, we ordered the...\" Susie started, but trailed off quickly after the chubby waitress plonked two absolutely enormous plates in front of the two moderately enormous girls. They both stared, wide-eyed, as Christina absent-mindedly rattled off the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese fries, onion rings, hamburgers, hot dogs, cole slaw, corn fritters, mashed potatoes...yep, all there! You girls enjoy now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before anyone could protest, she was off, moving at a rather fast clip for someone pushing 250 pounds. The girls, on the other hand, were more distracted by the food in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall cleared his throat. \"Well, uh...dig in, I guess.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susie was nearly overwhelmed by the unexpectedly-expansive platter set before her, and started by taking only a bit of each thing. In her mind it was to sample everything and decide which was her favorite, but her father took it as a different kind of hesitation. \"Uh, Susie,\" Randall commented, \"we can ask the waitress to take it back and bring you what you ordered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara interrupted before Susie could give her answer. \"No, this is great! This looks much better than just the burgers!\" Like Susie, she took bites of everything before coming to a decision. \"Here, Susie, you can have my fries, I don't really like that kind of cheese,\" she said as she passed the paper tray to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Lou Anne asked her daughter. \"You had no problem with the cheese fries the last time we came here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... they're... different this time?\" Manyara didn't mean to make it a question, but she wasn't used to lying to her mother. Fortunately for her, her mother wasn't used to being lied to and for the most part accepted that answer albeit with a staccato hum of disapproval. It was another irregularity for Lou Anne to add to the list of things she noticed in her daughter tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan accepted the gift from her friend. \"Oh, thanks,\" she said modestly. The cheese fries weren't her favorite on the platter, but she did still feel guilty about hurting her best friend and wanted to be as agreeable as possible to help make amends. If Manyara was kind enough to give her an offer, she would be kind enough to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this too,\" Manyara added, passing her Coney Island hot dog over. The sausage itself was completely obscured by all of the meaty sauce, mustard, and onions piled on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you become such a fussy eater?\" Lou Anne remarked with a scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom, it's fine,\" Manyara protested. \"I can have seconds here, remember?\" Even if Susan hadn't noticed until just now when her friend pointed it out, Manyara knew through personal experience that the waitress would come back around and ask if she would like to order something else too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she said, maintaining her scowl. \"Just make sure you won't get hungry before bed.\" Lou Anne knew her daughter and her daughter's stomach well, and knew precisely how much food she needed to avoid being hungry too soon. She also knew (but wouldn't admit) that if Manyara did say she was hungry tonight that Lou Anne would feed her whatever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything of mine that you want?\" Susan asked Manyara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara looked over her friend's expanded platter. \"Nope,\" she lied. While extra fried onion rings sounded delicious, she knew that they could wait until her second order. Susie needed them more than she did, after all, if she was going to fatten up like Manyara wanted her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Anne leaned over to Randall and talked to him in a half-whisper. \"Does your daughter do this yet?\" she asked pointing at Manyara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he answered with a small shake of his head. \"She eats whatever I put down, and sometimes asks for more. I think she's just happy to be free of her mother's cooking.\" Lou Anne took a glum bite of her salad. \"Maybe though,\" he continued as an idea came to him, \"she's so used to your own cooking that coming here isn't good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Anne stared at her salad for a moment as she thought, \"Maybe,\" she said finally, \"but she seems more than happy eating dinner at your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... don't know what to say.\" He was a bit embarrassed. This emotion fled from his face when he noticed that under the first layer of greens in his salad there lay an abundance of chicken in an oily dressing. The girls seemed to be happy trading their food, so... \"Hey, want some of my chicken?\" he asked the woman across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-yes-please!\" Lou Anne responded all too fast. She had only ordered the salad because having the same thing as Randall seemed like an attractive idea at the time, but she soon realized that just a salad was a mistake to her pampered stomach that no amount of grilled chicken or dressing could fix on its own. A bit of a relaxed smile touched the corners of her mouth as the man used his fork to scrape more than half of his meat onto her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Susie had her hands full with eating both her own food and what Manyara had given her. As much as she knew she didn't want to get fat (in her own mind she was merely \"chubby\" or \"plump\" although nearly anyone would disagree), eating quickly sent her mind into a daze and she lost all self-control. Before she knew it, almost twenty minutes had passed which left her platter empty and her belly full. Being distracted by gleefully watching her friend-she-was-jealous-of stuffing her face, Manyara finished her smaller platter at about the same time. Lou Anne had finished her salad with extra chicken a long time ago and spent the time not spent conversing with Randall looking forlornly at her empty plate. Her and her daughter's faces both brightened up when Christina came back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, y'all, anything else I can get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara piped up, \"Yeah, we didn't get our Triple Texan Burgers or our Rodeo Fries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina's hand flew to her open mouth. \"Oh dearie me! I must have given you the wrong order. I'll go get those right away for you. Randall was suspicious of the waitress and wondered if the \"mistake\" was made on purpose. Her reaction now certainly seemed like it might be an act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought, however, was interrupted by Lou Anne. \" Actually,\" she said to Christina, \"I'd like an order of those too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talkin'!\" she said with some good humor returning as she scribbled on her pad. After she was done, she turned to Randall and said with a wave of her hand that ended on her breast, \"Oh, don't worry about the extra platters. It was my mistake: it's on the house.\" She correctly assumed that Randall didn't want to order anything else and promptly left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than three minutes later, Christina returned with two Triple Texan Burgers and matching Rodeo Fries, almost as if they had been waiting in the kitchen the whole time. \"Yours will be just another few minutes,\" she reassured Lou Anne as she set the new plates before the two girls and took back the empty platters. The burgers had no less than three quarter-pound beef patties with thick slices of American cheese between them as well as caramelized onions, tomato slices, and sweet sauce. Similarly, the fries were coated in yellow cheese, barbecue sauce, and who knows what else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara grasped her burger without a second thought and took huge bites from it. She had practically starved herself before with the amount of food she had given to Susie. Susie, however, was already full, but still ate her burger and fries so as to appease her friend and not make her gifts go to waste, as rationalized in her own childish logic. It was a struggle to finish this second course and by the end of it her tee shirt tugged itself upwards at the slightest provocation and the button of her jean shorts dug tightly into her soft waist. Lou Anne soon got her own burger and fries and just as quickly as her daughter found them gone from her plate. Randall merely sipped his glass of water while watching the other three scarf down their greasy seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina found herself back at the table almost as soon as all three females were done and asked, \"How 'bout some dessert?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really don't think-\" Randall began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" interrupted Manyara and Lou Anne simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate mousse cake for us,\" Manyara ordered as she pointed to herself and Susie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same for us too,\" Lou Anne ordered, obviously referring to Randall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a cold dessert and one prepared beforehand, the twin cakes were deftly brought to the table by Christina's hands and pleased face. Randall and Susan had expected a <i>slice</i> of cake, not a whole one, and so stared wide-eyed at the spectacle before them. Manyara took the provided knife and cut her cake cleanly in half to share between herself and Susie. Randall cut only a single slice for himself and left the rest to be devoured by Lou Anne, whose two-course meal was rather meager in her own opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was thoroughly panting at this point as she pushed each forkful of rich cake into her mouth. She was full to the point of hurting, but this was truly delicious- even more than her dad's usual desserts. At this point, anything less than making the effort to push her belly outwards caused near-unbearable tightness in her stomach. She popped the button open on her jean shorts to relieve their pressure on her body and hoped in vain that her shirt would cover it. After this, she realized that all of the cake was gone. Susan didn't know whether to be disappointed that she couldn't taste more of it, or relieved that her tummy didn't have to hold anything else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina came back to the table with the bill. \"Here y'all go,\" she said with a grin. She appeared to be in better spirits now after seeing three of her four guests stuffed to her satisfaction as opposed to when she was taking their first orders. Randall looked over the bill with Lou Anne and was surprised to see it was less than he expected. Primarily this was due to the two Deluxe Texas Platters not being present (as Christina promised) but also because apparently the Big Texas Ranch didn't think too much of salads. After a minute of polite arguing with Lou Anne the two decided to split the bill evenly; each parent-daughter pair ordered the exact same thing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bill was paid, the parents and children each said their goodbyes and returned to their cars. From the moment she stood up from the table until even after she sat down in the rear car seat, Susie pulled the front side of her shirt down over her bloated middle to cover it. Not realizing how much she had eaten until after the fact was a bad habit of hers. \"<i>I hope I don't get too fat from this,</i>\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Randall, despite his doubts, continued to cook delicious rich meals for his daughter, who happily and gratefully gobbled each and every one up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara wasn't exactly helping when it came to healthy eating. Despite her anger at the restaurant subsiding and her desired change of wardrobe coming when she just asked her mother about it, she continued to encourage her best friend's snacking habits. Not out of malice, but out of sharing her love of (or addiction to) junk food with her BFF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant Susie was gobbling up fried breakfasts, full lunches, rich dinners and sweet desserts every day, combined with constant snacking between meals. And it really began to show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Saturday morning, the girl huffed and grunted as she tried to pull one of her favourite t-shirts over her belly, but it just kept riding back up in the mirror. Unlike at the restaurant when she was stuffed to the point of almost bursting, Susie hadn't eaten a thing yet that day - in fact, she could hear the sizzling of eggs and sausages on the grill downstairs. No doubt dad was cooking up another yummy breakfast.<br>\r\nHer belly was a sagging dome of pale flab, hanging over her waistband and covering the front of her panties, which felt rather tight around her bulbous backside. Her thighs were like small tree trunks that jiggled with each step, and had forced her to recently start developing a waddle to her walk. Her underdeveloped chest pushed against the top of her t-shirt, Her upper arms were squeezed in the sleeves of her shirt, bulging out at the ends, and her hands were getting rather pudgy with some cutely fat little fingers. Her cheeks were shaped like tennis balls with a perpetual blush, giving her the tiniest squint in her eyes, and her once-small double chin was now fully visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she wiggled her shorts up past her large rump, and settled rather snugly around her widened waist, she continued to look at herself in the mirror. The sound of breakfast cooking downstairs made her think of all she had been eating recently - specifically, was it too much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she getting too fat?</span></div></div>",

Susan had only gone on one serious clothes shopping trip since her mother left; the majority of her clothes were from far slimmer days. The only reason she could still fit into her shirts, shorts, and underwear at all was because her body had permanently stretched them out. As they stood now, the limits of their elasticity had been reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer school skirt and buttoned shirt were giving her different problems. She was already wearing the largest size the school offered, and her growth over the past few weeks gave her issues. Both articles of clothing severely constricted her belly and waist now and as the school day progressed, uncomfortable, red pressure marks appeared on her soft skin. Susan spent every short break between classes hidden in a bathroom stall where she could unbutton everything and enjoy some relief. If she were to grow any wider, she would have to order a special uniform like Manyara did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's time for shopping,</i>\" she thought as she planted her fists on her squishy hips. This pose accentuated just how little of her belly her current shirt covered. She pressed her palms to her chest and gave a squeeze. \"<i>I should also probably get a training bra.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jiggled her way downstairs before her stomach could growl in protest of being empty and sat down at the table. Her father soon placed her plate of breakfast before her. She scooped up a fried egg and put it between two slices of toast and added some jelly. The eggs were fried in some of the grease from the sausage for added flavor. There were also some apple and cinnamon pancakes being cooked over the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, can I have some money to go clothes shopping?\" she asked her busy father between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall looked over his shoulder at Susie. Her belly was in full view even though breakfast had just begun. He agreed that she could get some better-fitting clothes. \"Sure,\" he said nonchalantly. He didn't really want his daughter to get fat, but now that she was he would have to make the best of it. \"You're going with Manyara, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll call her after breakfast.\" Manyara had decent fashion sense most of the time, and as much as Susie hated to admit it, would be the local expert on what looks good on a fat schoolgirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily I'm pretty free today,\" Randall commented. \"I can drive you if you want, or Manyara's mom might be able to.\" \"<i>If you want some girl time</i>,\" he added mentally.</span></div></div>",

As chance would have it, she and her mom were planning to do just that, and she was promptly invited along. Naturally, she could never turn down such an offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall had mixed feelings about learning about it. On one hand, he loved spending time with his girl and he'd be left alone in the house, but Susie pointed out that he could have some time to himself while she was gone. He couldn't help but think he could use some time to relax after doing so much cooking lately, and he knew Lou Anne would look after her. Plus, it was sweet of her to think of his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning herself up and receiving a healthy wad of cash from Randall for clothes (among other things, the greedy girl thought slyly) she waddled her way down the street to her friend's house. What was normally a minute-long walk was now a five minute waddle that left Susie at Manyara's door with a light bead of sweat on her forehead.<br>\r\nShe was allowed a minute to catch her breath before the door opened, and she easily managed a smile as she and her best friend greeted each other with a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Susie the Thai girl had been ballooning quite a lot herself, still noticeably much fatter than her. She had been keeping up her snacking as always, and she still kept coming over to Susie's for a delicious dinner and dessert night. Despite how much more effort it was taking to make the walk over, how could she not try to spend time with her bestie?<br>\r\nRecently, Manyara had decided she wanted a change from wearing dresses all the time - like Susie, she was wearing a pair of shorts that looked rather snug, slightly cutting into her thick thunderthighs and being tight around the backside. She was wearing a rather large video game t-shirt, which was tight around her spherical middle section but loose in the sleeves. It was clearly an adult size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool shirt!\" Susie grinned.<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Her larger friend chirped, looking down at the graphic that actually wasn't badly stretched for once, \"Mom got it for me last week, it's so awesome!\"<br>\r\n\"Where'd she find it?\" Susie asked, \"I wanna get one too.\"<br>\r\n\"In town, I think,\" Manyara shrugged, \"she'll probably take us there today. Wanna get a snack before we go? We got some Doritos and Hershey's!\"<br>\r\nThat alone was enough to make Susie's tongue slide across her lips and forget about her concerns that morning. \"Sure!\"</span></div></div>",

The TV had gone to ads, momentarily freeing her from the dull spell of late-morning television.<br>\r\n\"Oh, pretty much everything,\" Susan admitted, \"I've been growing out of a lot of my clothes recently. I guess I'm going through a growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" Manyara agreed, \"Mom says most girls our age get growth spurts, it's natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls certainly were going through a growth spurt - just not the kind doctors would consider 'natural'. Theirs was a definitively man-made disaster, a product of poor decisions and poor self-control - the two girls' drastically expanded girths was one thing for which Mother Nature really couldn't be blamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Susan agreed, trying her best to ignore the niggling thought that perhaps the changes her body had been experiencing weren't just the standard rigours of puberty, \"It sucks though. I gotta get new tops, new skirts, a nice dress to wear for parties and stuff, a swimsuit, underwear - everything!\"<br>\r\nManyara blinked.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really do need to get a lot of stuff. Mom's got me a couple of things recently and those clothes you gave me a while ago still fit, kinda, so I don't have quite as much. I still need to buy all sorts of stuff, though - I'd love to get a dress that fits, I'm too big for all of my old ones.\" <br>\r\nShe stared into the middle-distance with a look of remorse on her bloated face, remembering just last weekend when her favourite dress had split all the way down one side as she'd bent over to grab a dropped candy. That had been... embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded glumly.<br>\r\n\"I hate having to wear clothes that don't fit,\" she complained, \"It just gets sooo uncomfortable after a while, and you have to spend all your time making sure they're on properly.\" As though to illustrate the point she chose that moment to tug at her shirt again, trying and failing to persuade it into covering her expansive stomach. Sitting as she was it sat heavily in her lap, pouring over the waistband of her shorts to warm her thighs like a blanket, and decidedly too large in every dimension to be covered by her undersized top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Manyara could reply, however, Lou Ann appeared in the doorway.<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, y'ready to head out?\" she asked, and the two nodded, \"Great. Just before we go, though - Manyara, d'you remember if this fits you?\"<br>\r\nShe was holding out what looked like a one-piece swimsuit made of rather garish red fabric.<br>\r\nManyara shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I haven't worn it for months. I think it was too big for me - Aunty Ceris got it me for Christmas or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, try it on. If it don't fit we'll have to get you a new swimming costume as well while we're out,\" Lou Ann chucked the swimsuit over to her daughter, who sighed.<br>\r\n\"Fiiine,\" she grumbled, \"One sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to strip off, not seeming to care in the slightest that Susan and her mom were still there, so the other girl watched as her friend pulled off her top and shorts - apparently with some difficulty. She was now so fat that just the simple act of undressing was a chore; rolls of flab jostled and nudged and caught on fabric as she slowly disrobed, shifting from foot to foot as she wriggled thick thighs out of her shorts. By the time she was down to her underwear - white polka-dot panties and a straining vest - she even seemed to be slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly laboured aspect she now had to her breathing betraying just how unfit the bigger girl had become, Manyara kicked aside her top and shorts and began to peel off her underwear - and peel truly was the word that came to mind. Her panties had all but disappeared beneath her belly, the fabric that wasn't buried plastered across her buttocks like it had been painted on. She rolled them off with difficulty, working blind as the sheer bloated mass of her stomach obscured her view of her crotch entirely. Once she'd kicked them too off her feet, it was time for the vest. <br>\r\nThat poor garment was perhaps the most abused and overworked of all. Manyara was now quite thoroughly developed for her age, even the painfully tight material of her vest squeezing her flabby breasts as flat as it could failing to disguise the evidence of obesity-fueled development. For a moment she wrestled with the poor thing, struggling as it caught on a roll of back fat, then it was off over her head and Manyara stood naked but for her socks.<br>\r\nAfter a couple of moments to get her breath back, she grabbed the red one-piece swimsuit from the floor and stepped into it. With a considerable effort (accompanied by a decidedly unladlylike grunt) she pulled the straps up and over her shoulders, then tried to get it comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fools errand; the swimsuit was far, far too small in every dimension. The straps cut into her shoulders, the material between her legs was far too tight (not to mention alarmingly immodest), the seams were straining, and worst of all brown flesh was bulging out every which way. No matter how much she tugged and shifted and strained, Susan could tell the swimsuit wasn't going to look remotely acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Ann shrugged. \"Hey, it looks pretty good. I can see you wearing that on the beach,\" she said. <br>\r\nThe two girls stared at her, nonplussed. After a moment of dubious silence, Manyara shook her head.<br>\r\n\"No way mom, it's really uncomfortable,\" the obese girl complained, \"It digs in, like, everywhere. Can't I get a new one, pleease?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, money doesn't grow on trees y'know,\" Lou Ann scolded, \"It's a lovely suit - and I'm sure it doesn't dig in that badly.\" <br>\r\n\"It really does, mom, seriously,\" Manyara whined, tugging at the fabric in a vain attempt to loosen it somehow, \"I can barely move in this thing, how am I supposed to swim?\"<br>\r\nLou Ann looked scandalised. \"Why would you want to swim in it? Swimsuits are for sunbathing! I just think that the red really sets off your eyes, y'know.\" Without warning, she turned to Susan, \"How do you think Manyara looks, Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather taken aback, Susan collected herself as they both looked at her inquiringly. On one hand, she didn't want to hurt Manyara's feelings by saying she didn't look good - on the other, well... she really didn't look good.</span></div></div>",

The swimsuit did indeed look uncomfortably tight on Manyara, but she didn't really want to say <i>why</i>. But on the other hand, the colour did compliment her eyes, and almost her chubby cheeks too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks great,\" she half-lied, \"but it does look pretty uncomfortable...maybe there'll be another size one?\"<br>\r\nLou Anne nodded, but didn't look too convinced. \"I don't know, like I said, I'm not made of money.\"<br>\r\n\"Aren't there still sales going on right now?\" Susan pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Lou Anne's attention. She blinked, and tapped her thick finger on her chin. Her proper one, not the large mound of blubber beneath it.<br>\r\n\"That's a good point,\" she agreed, \"Okay, we'll see if we can find another one then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Manyara wasted no time in getting the suffocating swimsuit off of her. Her flabby form sprang and bounced out in every direction as soon as it was released from the snug fabric.<br>\r\nSusan didn't really mind, or think anything of her getting so...revealed in front of her - she had been doing it since they met as toddlers, so it was just a thing she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou Anne retrieved the swimsuit as Manyara struggled to pull her tight panties and vest back on, and was practically wheezing for air by the time she had to get her shorts and top on. Susan, feeling bad for her friend, decided to lend a plump hand in getting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for convincing mom,\" the tubby Thai girl sighed, \"I never really liked that swimsuit - it's so...<i>red</i>.\"<br>\r\nSusan nodded agreement, puffing as she helped slide the waistband of Manyara's shorts over her protruding backside. \"Maybe we can find you a nice purple one?\"<br>\r\nManyara smiled, looking over her broad shoulder. \"That'd be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Manyara was dressed, both girls were panting, sweating and red hot from all the exertion of putting on clothes.<br>\r\n\"Phew, I need a drink,\" Manyara grunted, taking a pause to gasp for air, \"c'mon, I got some soda in the fridge.\"<br>\r\nSusie didn't need to be told twice. Both girls waddled out to the kitchen, where Manyara opened the fridge and pulled out a couple of regular bottles of orange soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls guzzled the carbonated orange-flavoured drink like they'd hadn't had a drop of water in weeks, when it had really just been since breakfast time. Within minutes, both girls had polished off their soda. Susan let out a cute little burp out of nowhere, causing her already pink cheeks to flush pinker as she covered her mouth with her free hand. Manyara snorted a laugh, before letting out a long belch of her own. Both girls stared at each other for a moment before bursting into a fit of giggles.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once they'd finished their drinks, they trotted out to the car and Lou Ann drove them into town. The two girls giggled and gossiped together in the back seat as they discussed precisely what they were each planning to buy - provided, of course, they could find such items in a size that actually fit, which would be a challenge given that they were now closer to the weights of full grown adults than children their own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they had parked and the two girls hopped out of the car, blinking around at their surroundings. Neither girl got out much nowadays, leaving the house for school and very little else; the bustle and noise of the city centre at the weekend surprised them both. <br>\r\n\"There's a Target just nearby,\" Lou Ann said, locking the car with one hand and gesturing vaguely with the other, \"Let's start there.\" The two girls nodded, and let Lou Ann lead them through the crowded street and into the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were inside, Susan turned to Manyara. \"Hey, I remember coming here with mom all the time,\" she said, looking around at the colourful displays, \"They used to sell some really nice stuff, this should be good!\"<br>\r\n\"Good. I hope they sell dresses in my size!\" the bigger said, tugging at the waistband of her shorts absentmindedly. It was digging rather uncomfortably into her soft flesh, despite being fastened beneath the bulk of her belly, and she wouldn't at all mind changing into something more comfortable as soon as possible. At least Manyara's shirt fit though, which was more than could be said for Susan - the other girl's top barely reached past her navel, much of her potbelly bulging free over the waistband of her own shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'm going to go do some shopping of my own in the ladies section,\" Lou Ann announced, \"You two go ahead and pick out some clothes, then come and find me there. Make sure they fit in the changing rooms first though!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that she headed off, leaving Manyara and Susan to wander over to the junior's section to browse on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey, how about this?\"<br>\r\nManyara broke the silence after a few minutes of unbroken rifling through clothes rails, picking out a bright floral dress. She held it to her body, and Susan couldn't help but notice it just looked much too, well, narrow, for the big girl. It didn't even look half as wide as Manyara's body, her hips and flabby sides bulging out drastically on either side.<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it looks a little small for you. Is there a bigger size maybe?\"<br>\r\nManyara looked slightly upset at the comment. \"This is the size for my height from the husky range. I don't think they do anything bigger.\"<br>\r\nSusan frowned. \"Really? That's stupid of them. Well, can't you just wear the sizes for older girls or something?\" <br>\r\n\"Then it'd just be way too long,\" Manyara complained, \"I'd trip over the hem all the time.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, bring it along anyway,\" Susan said with a shrug, \"I'm much smaller than you, so even if it doesn't fit you it'll fit me.\"<br>\r\nShe didn't see Manyara scowl at her behind her back. <i>'Not that much smaller...'</i> Manyara thought, looking the other girl up and down, <i>'Not anymore...</i><br>\r\nWith an effort, she bit back the irritation. She was much more upset at the clothing store than she was with Susan, anyway. The other girl didn't mean to hurt her feelings, she knew that. Shaking her head, she went back to picking out clothes alongside her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the girls had an armful of clothes each and headed towards the changing booths. Susan, in an act of wild na\u00efvet\u00e9, had picked almost exclusively from the standard range of sizes, thoroughly unaware that she had left those behind months ago. Even her current clothes, shamefully outgrown as they were, had been picked mostly from the husky range by her realistic father the one time they'd been clothes shopping together since the divorce. The idea that she would still fit into the standard range was at best ignorant, at worst absurd - but Susan wasn't exactly known for her self-awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara headed into a changing booth and Susan moved to go into another, but the bigger girl just rolled her eyes. She reached out and pulled Susan into the same booth.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't be silly. We can both fit in just this one,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n\"Um, I dunno. Why don't we just use two?\" Susan asked, feeling a little shy. Manyara may be comfortable being naked in front of her, but Susan was quite a bit more shy - especially more recently as she began to feel the first faint stirrings of insecurity about her weight.<br>\r\n\"Nah, then we'll have to keep passing clothes over the top and stuff,\" Manyara pointed out. Susan bit her lip.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess.\" She stepped fully into the booth and let Manyara pull the door closed - which took some doing. Despite what Manyara had said, there was barely room in the booth for both oversized girls, and with the door closed there wasn't even room for them both to stand without brushing hips and elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Manyara began stripping off, and Susan reluctantly followed her lead - with more than a little difficulty. Undressing was already more effort than it should have been for the pair at the best of times, but cramped together like this it was a genuine challenge. They seemed to bump into each other with every movement, nudging each other into the walls or just generally getting in each other's way. At one point they bent over at the same time to grab something from the floor and their rears collided, knocking them both into a tangled heap of thick limbs and thicker bodies on the floor. <br>\r\nBy the time Susan had finished undressing she was overheated, sweaty, and more than a little embarrassed. Manyara just seemed to find every accidental contact amusing, and as such had spent most of the previous few minutes giggling - behaviour that didn't exactly help with Susan's self-consciousness. She had deigned not to remove her panties, though it was a token gesture. They were so tight and undersized on her corpulent body that at a glance one couldn't even tell she was wearing them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger girl still hadn't quite finished stripping off yet, so Susan took the chance to grab one of the skirts she'd picked out earlier and begin trying it on. It was a lovely little striped thing, but she'd barely even got it past her knees before the truth that she should have know all along became undeniable - this was <i>not</i> going to fit her. Even unbuttoned she was struggling to get it up her thighs, and when it eventually encountered her flabby, overgrown buttocks it was obvious there wasn't a chance she could even get it to her waist, never mind fasten it once it got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara glanced sidelong at her, eyes flashing. \"Too small, huh?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"I guess I must have put on a little weight, heh...\" Susan laughed nervously, wriggling out of the skirt and checking the label. She was sure she could remember this exact size being too big on her not even a year earlier.<br>\r\n\"Maybe all your dad's cooking is a little much,\" Manyara suggested, smiling rather smugly for a second before remembering in a shower of mournfulness that she hadn't exactly been losing weight herself recently. She wiped the expression off her face.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I have, yeah...\" Susan dropped the skirt on the floor, trying not to be upset. It was just a little weight, that was all. A lot of girls put on weight at this age, for puberty or some reason like that. She'd just have to lay off some of the snacks for a little while, that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try some of the clothes I picked out, they're all in husky sizes, they might fit you better,\" Manyara suggested, gesturing awkwardly in the confined space at her own pile of clothes.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\nAnd so, Susan took a pair of shorts from the pile and Manyara the floral dress from earlier, and with much brushing of hips and and arms and legs, they both began trying to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, they were both more frustrated and sweaty than ever. The husky size shorts did technically fit, but to Susan's dismay they were as uncomfortably tight as any of the others she owned, and tearing them off she threw them to the floor with a growl of irritation. The undeniable fact that even the clothes designed for heavy kids were too small for her was rather shaking - for once, she couldn't just pretend to herself that they had shrunk in the wash.<br>\r\nWhile Susan was having a slight mental crisis, Manyara had managed to squeeze her overgrown body into the floral dress - but was inevitably struggling to zip it up at the back.<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you're done trying those shorts could you give me a hand with this zipper?\" she asked over her shoulder, giving up on doing it herself and letting her fat arms fall back to her sides.<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Susan said, snapped out of her introspection. She reached out with one plump hand and grabbed a hold of the zipper, and tried to pull it upwards - with no results. Manyara's black flab bulged out from the back of the dress, at once soft and pliable yet thoroughly obstructionary to the progress of the zip. \"Hey, could you, like suck in your tummy for a moment? It's really difficult,\" she asked.<br>\r\nManyara sucked in, allowing the fabric just a little leeway, and Susan seized the moment - and the zipper - with both hands, pulling upwards with all her meagre strength. There was an audible creak of grinding metal, a grunt of exertion, a short squeak of pain, and then the zipper slid up like a shot and the dress was fastened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Manyara said, reaching around to rub tenderly at her back, \"You pinched me with the zip there a bit,\" she said reproachfully, seams groaning as she stopped sucking in her gut.<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I think that dress is a bit small for you,\" Susan shrugged. Manyara shook her head.<br>\r\n\"No way, this is from the husky range for teenagers, it can't possibly be too small. I think it's just supposed to fit this way.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Susan agreed, too concerned with her own increased size to want to labour the point.</span></div></div>",

And, seeing as the sizes they found pinched terribly, they were most certainly hoping to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the universe was against them that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter browsing up and down the dismally tiny section of the store set aside for large girls of their ilk- that is to say, one single rack of shirts and pants that could best be described in terms of style with an emphatic \"eh\"- Susan and Manyara were forced to conclude that, even though they had really only gained a <i>terribly</i> small amount of puberty weight, there was not one single item of clothing to be found that would fit them in any way that could be described as \"comfortable\". Sure, the 4XLs fit <i>okay</i> on Susan, and didn't leave <i>all</i> of Manyara hanging out for the world to see- but it was plain to see that nothing proper could be found in the children's store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with severe huffs of disappointment and the effort of moving their bloated forms, they waddled out, pausing only for breath once they made it out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you...<i>hff</i>...<i>believe</i> that? Those sizes were <i>ridiculous!</i>\" Susan panted, wiping her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara didn't answer right away, as she desperately needed to catch her breath, but when she did it was with an extremely breathy and almost inaudible re-expression of that sentiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do then?\" Susan asked, somewhat rhetorically. \"If we can't shop here, we'll have to shop at the adult stores...but those'll be too big for us, won't they? <i>Surely.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara, after several more deep gulps of air, responded \"Well...it's <i>huff</i> worth a try...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked uncomfortably at the ground. \"I guess...I'll go find out where it is, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with a mighty heave, she pulled her bloated form to her chubby feet, and wobbled her way over to the nearest map board to find her way to the children's shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>other side?</i>\" Manyara gasped, flab jiggling in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Susan confirmed, looking dismally down the- to them- impossibly long mall hallway. \"God, it'll take us <i>years</i> to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years\" may have been hyperbole, but, at their size, \"hours\" might not be. The mall was roughly the length of two football fields; considering the fact that the girls had not seen a football field in years, they were very unlikely to make the journey quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara let out a great huff of annoyance. \"Well, I guess we'd better get going...help me up?\" she asked, extending her flabby arms for assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan rolled her eyes, but gave in and helped her larger friend to her feet. \"Yeah, we'd better...\"<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huff</i> Susie...I <i>huff</i> need a rest...\" Manyara gasped, sweat streaming down her flabby face and disappearing into her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...<i>hff</i> that's fine, we can take a break here,\" Susan agreed, unwilling to admit how much she needed one as well. The two girls leaned up against the wall, taking great gulps of air into their overworked lungs. Finally, after a bit of well-deserved rest, Manyara wheezed out \"How...much farther?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, with another eyeroll, leaned off the wall and took a look both ways down the hall. The distance from them to the store seemed no smaller; the distance from them to their starting point, however, seemed greatly different. In reality, the girls had moved only about fifty feet or so, but to Susan's young, fat-addled brain it seemed like a great distance. \"Really far...are you sure you want to keep going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food court's right here, after all...\"</span></div></div>",

Or three. \"Okay, let's have a snack stop, then keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor portly girls waddled up to one of the counters, where a teenage girl in a uniform stood on the other side. The girls made an order of two large meals, which meant a large burger, a large box of fries and a huge soda. Of course, that was two large meals for each of them, by Manyara's insistence.<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn't take long for the girls to receive their oversized orders, and they had even gotten a dozen free cookies from the nice girl, who had taken pity on the poor little fatties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls wasted no time in finding a seat, and dug in to their meals. They split the cookies evenly between them, then started cramming the food into themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauce, dressing and crumbs dropped onto their clothes as they ate with wild abandon, pausing only to either catch their breath or to take a hearty gulp of soda.

Levering themselves up from their chairs, they left their rubbish on the table and made their waddling way back out in the main hallway. When they were there though, they could only stand among the bustling crowd, looking left and right down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Sue. D'you remember which way we were going?\" Manyara asked after a moment's silence.<br>\r\nSusan shrugged, looking lost. <br>\r\n\"I dunno. I could've sworn we went to the town centre anyway, I don't even remember when we came to the mall,\" she confessed, scratching her head, \"Let's just check the map.\"<br>\r\nShe headed towards the nearest map board, but before she could reach it Manyara grabbed her by the arm.<br>\r\n\"Wait, how about that!\" she exclaimed, pointing. Susan followed her finger, and her eyes came to rest on a small shop sandwiched between a toy shop and a keymakers. The sign above the door proudly announced the shop as 'Madam Pudsie's Shop for Larger Children'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that...  actually looks perfect. How lucky!\" Susan could only exclaim, staring in amazement, \"I didn't even know this was here.\"<br>\r\n\"Neither did I, but I bet they sell proper-sized clothes,\" said Manyara, hurrying towards with all the speed her flabby, overworked legs could muster, \"Come on!\"<br>\r\nSusan followed her friend inside, pausing only to read the poster in the window. It read, <i>Madam Pudsie's - the fastest growing clothing chain in America! We believe that children have the right to fashionable, high-quality clothing, no matter their size or shape. Find us online or at a mall near you!</i><br>\r\nFeeling optimistic once again, she proceeded into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she was confronted by a fairly small, cramped, yet thoroughly vibrant interior. Posters of smiling children, all varying levels of chubby, were plastered on every wall, and everything seemed designed to be as colourful as possible - even the enthusiastic-looking serving girl behind the counter. It was a little overwhelming, but Susan wasn't about to complain; if this shop stocked comfortable clothes, she couldn't care less what the decor was like.<br>\r\nBy the time Susan had finished taking in her first impressions, Manyara was already in one of the isles rifling through the clothes rails. Susan trotted over.<br>\r\n\"Found anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Manyara said, squinting at a label, \"I can't tell what size anything is. Maybe they're using the European system or something - it's all just numbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Susan could respond, however, a shop assistant appeared right beside them.<br>\r\n\"Anything I can help you with?\" she asked, looking down upon the two girls with a wide smile. She knew promising customers when she saw them, and a pair of obese girls in undersized clothes was an almost guaranteed sale.<br>\r\nManyara jumped at the assistant's sudden appearance. \"Oh! Um, well, I don't really understand the sizing here. How does it work?\"<br>\r\n\"We use our own system,\" the assistant explained, her smile widening further as she realised that the two were completely new to the store, \"If you want, I can measure you right now and save you some time trying on different sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Manyara exchanged glances. It wasn't like they had other options.<br>\r\n\"Sure, that'd be great,\" Susan said after the cursory deliberation.<br>\r\n\"Excellent! If you'll just follow me into the fitting room, then,\" the shop assistant lead the two girls through the aisles of clothes and into a back room, then turned to Susan, \"I'll do you first, dear. Could you strip down to your underwear, please? You'll want an accurate measurement.\"<br>\r\nSusan coloured slightly, but obeyed. For the second time that day she pulled her shirt off over her head, then wriggled out of her shorts. She threw both garments over to Manyara for safekeeping, then stood shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot in front of the assistant, naked but for her socks and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Let's get you measured up,\" the shop assistant produced a large tape measure from her pocket like a magician summoning a comically long ribbon from his sleeve, then knelt down in front of Susan, \"Now, do you prefer to fasten your pants over or under your tummy?\" she asked, smiling reassuringly at the obese girl.<br>\r\n\"I, um... I guess under?\" Susan said, uncertainly, \"Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly all right, dear,\" the shop assistant cooed, \"If you would just raise your arms out to your sides, I can get the measurement.\"<br>\r\nSusan did so, and with deft hands the shop assistant looped the tape around the fat girl's waist, slipping it under her bloated belly and around her flabby sides then pulling it snug to check the number. The feeling of cool plastic against her warm skin made Susan shiver, but it was only a moment before the assistant had got the measurement and was letting the tape drop down to Susan's heavily padded hips. Once again she pulled the tape close and checked the value, nodding happily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly there, dear,\" she said to Susan, then turned briefly to Manyara, \"Would you mind stripping down to your underwear now? It'll save a little time in a minute.\"<br>\r\nManyara nodded, and began for the third time that day the arduous process of pulling off her top and shorts, while the assistant turned back to Susan.<br>\r\n\"Just once more now, then we're done,\" Once again she wrapped the measure around Susan's excessive body, this time around her bust, and the developing girl had to suppress a little squeak of surprise as the cool tape was pulled tight against her sensitive chest.<br>\r\nThe assistant nodded, as though in reply to Susan's little noise.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, a little growing room would be sensible at your age...\" she muttered to herself, loosening the tape somewhat before taking the measure. Then she moved back and got to her feet, \"Well done, dear. I'll measure your friend, then I can tell you both about our sizing scheme at the same time. Oh, and you can get dressed again now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan did as she was told, pulling back on her poorly fitting shorts and top once again, while the assistant measured Manyara. By the time she had finished redressing, the assistant was done with Manyara, and after punching a few numbers into a calculator she turned to the pair and launched into a plainly memorised speech.<br>\r\n\"Now, here at Madam Pudsie's we believe that sizes like Large, Extra Large, 2X and so on only serve to make people feel insecure in their own bodies,\" she began, \"So we do things just a little differently. We use our own numbers-only sizing guide that will never disappoint, upset or confuse any child! Our sizes range from 2 to 20, and are suitable for children of any age!\"<br>\r\nShe turned to Susan.<br>\r\n\"You're a size 4. We stock the most of those sizes, so I'm sure you'll find something you'll love!\" her attention turned to Manyara, \"And you, dear, are a size 8. We also stock plenty of size 8 clothes, so have fun! Remember, any order exceeding $40 comes with a voucher for two free meals at the mall food court, and loyal customers stand to benefit from a host of other incredible deals as well! Have fun shopping at Madam Pudsie's, and remember that here there's no such thing as a wrong-sized child, only wrong-sized clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Manyara said, voice muffled by fabric as she struggled to pull her top back on over her head, \"This all sounds fantastic!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank you!\" Susan agreed, delighted to finally find a place that would sell comfortable clothes, \"Come on Manyara, let's go find some stuff to buy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop assistant watched the two girls leave the fitting room and head back into the shop, feeling thoroughly pleased with herself. Two new customers! And judging by  their stretch marks and the ill-fitting clothes they'd come in with, she felt there was a good chance they'd turn out to be loyal, long term customers as that. It was the ones that continued to gain weight that were the most profitable, and even in just the few minutes she'd seen them she could tell that those two were <i>not</i> the kind of girl that stayed the same size for long...</span></div></div>",

They went to the counter and paid for their choices together, which came up to $45. Their chubby faces lit up as they split the payment, and were given the food court voucher along with their receipt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we put on some of our clothes now?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\nThe woman nodded with a warm smile as she pointed to the changing rooms. \"Just head in there, dears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled over with their bags, and after about five minutes were changed into their new outfits.

It was quite a long time since she had seen her in fitting clothes, but this outfit was actually quite flattering! And it was refreshing to not see her in a dress for once.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too!\" Manyara grinned, looking at how the smaller girl actually fit a t-shirt loosely around her wide frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming, girls!\" The woman smiled as she watched the girls waddle out the door. \"Come back soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not that you'll have much choice,</i> she thought mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ran into Lou Anne not too far outside, holding a few bags herself.<br>\r\n\"Hey, nice clothes girls,\" she smirked at them, \"where'd you find those?\"<br>\r\n\"In there!\" Manyara pointed a plump finger at the Madam Pudsie's, \"It's so cool!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls dined well at the food court that day. The fact that it was the second time in as many hours neither deterred nor hindered them in their efforts to consume. And, since the final obstacle in the way of unrestricted gluttony- namely, tight clothes- had been handily removed, nothing remained to deter or hinder them for the foreseeable future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo nothing did. The girls ate their way through the Christmas holidays, out of winter, and up Madam Pudsie's size chart with a vigor rarely seen in any field. Pounds flocked to the girls' waists just as quickly as they did out of Parliament, helped immensely by a complex combination of Randall's increased cooking output, a general lowering in the price of school lunch, and an extensive rewards program in Madam Pudsie's. The girls became regulars at the mall, frequenting the clothing store almost as much as the food court. The increases in weight were bound to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, though practically everyone had remained entirely blind to the problem, it couldn't be hidden forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was it always this far?</i> Susan thought to herself, a concerned frown creasing her fat face. <i>I mean, it's always been far, but...<b>this</b> far?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, Manyara, wheezing deeply, planted herself on the wall yet again. Susan sighed, but did the same, glad of rest. \"Not...<i>haff</i>...too much farther...<i>hfff</i>...now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara nodded, chins creasing with the effort of agreement. They stayed there for a further three minutes, regaining their limited breath, before once more heaving themselves into the crowd and waddling the final few steps into the inviting storefront of Madam Pudsie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan! Manyara! Good to see you again!\" the shop assistant greeted them, a warm smile stretching across her face. \"How are things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan let out a burst of air that sounded vaguely like <i>Good.</i> Manyara, with surprising speed for a girl of her girth, lunged towards the closest chair and sat her wide butt on it gratefully. The chair, for its part, squeaked painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness me, you two must be exhausted! Take as much time as you need, I'll get everything ready for your new outfits!\" And, with a <i>swish</i> of fabric, the attendant disappeared to grab her measuring tape and sizing notepad. Lord knows the girls would need it- Susan's belly was 90% out of her shirt, and Manyara's leggings were so stretched as to be absolutely transparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And to think,</i> the assistant though with some pride, <i>that they just bought those clothes two weeks ago!</i><br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are you two ready now?\" the assistant said, bustling back around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" said Susan cheerily, her breath entirely recovered. \"D'you wanna go first, Manyara, or should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hff</i>...might as well....\" agreed Manyara, still not entirely rested from the walk. \"Um...could you give me...<i>hff</i>...a hand up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the assistant agreed, heart swelling with pride. \"Ready...one-two-THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with no small effort, Manyara, panting and sweaty once more, was back on her feet. The assistant, unwilling to force Manyara to remain standing for any longer than necessary, set instantly to work, measuring up legs, along arms, and around Manyara's astronomical middle. After what seemed like forever to Manyara, or five minutes real time, she was finished, and Manyara was free to wobble back to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you're a size 12 now! And, as you know, every multiple of 4 gets a special treat!\" The assistant, smiling broadly, reached behind the counter and tossed Manyara a large bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. \"Congratulations!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" wheezed Manyara, before eagerly digging into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for you, Susan! Do you need a hand up, or do you have it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan did have it, but she was never one to turn down a kind offer. The assistant's strong hands grabbed her soft ones, and soon she, too, was wobbling uncomfortably about, ready for the tape. The process seemed to tickle more than usual- especially along the very lowest part of her belly, where it was softest- but soon enough that, too, was done. The assistant scribbled furiously on her pad for a moment, then looked up at Susie with no small surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, guess what! You're a Size 9 now! This is actually the fastest increase we've seen at this location, which qualifies you for...\" she squinted at the pad for a moment, then back up at the large girl in front of her, \"...Madam Pudsie's Celebratory Extravaganza! All you can eat at the food court, for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara's jaw dropped, letting half a chocolate drop with it. \"Holy cow, Susan! That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...amazing...\" Susan muttered, looking shamefully at the ground. For all her aloofness, she couldn't ignore the plain facts before her- she was now larger than Manyara had been when they first shopped at Madam Pudsie's. She hadn't noticed, but the numbers couldn't lie- it was definitely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, what was more, she had put on weight even faster than Manyara had. She had gained 5 sizes, while Manyara had gained only 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god...what if I get fatter than her?</i> Susan thought to herself, panic seizing in her throat. <i>That's it, I have to lose weight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls,\" the assistant butted in, returning with an armful of new outfits, \"here you go! I know you girls worked very hard getting here, so I decided to make the process a little easier. I hope you don't mind!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much!\" Manyara beamed, accepting her clothes gratefully. Susan nodded dumbly along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant turned to leave, but stopped short. \"Oh, of course! Here's your coupon, Susan. I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, pressing the coupon into Susan's sweaty palm, the assistant took Manyara's money and left to ring them up. Susan stared at the coupon with glassy eyes. On the one hand, she couldn't possibly eat any more- she'd inflate like a blimp. On the other hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it <i>was</i> food...</span></div></div>",

Her brain had become just too addled with a love (read: addiction) for food to argue against the opportunity to stuff herself silly with greasy and sugary treats.<br>\r\nOnce she got her bag of Madam Pudsie's outfits, she waddled for the door, knowing exactly where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go make the best out of this coupon!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd make the best of it, they did.

Burgers, fries, pizzas, ice cream, pies, buckets of fried chicken, and all other kinds of unhealthy delights had been claimed by the gluttonous girls.<br>\r\nShoppers looked with awe and concern at their table as the large little ladies had a table stacked with various brands of boxes, wrappers and buckets.<br>\r\nThe girls didn't care, or even notice - they were in heaven. Mouths were ringed with sauce and crumbs, fingers were glistening with grease and cream, shirts were stained with dressing and droplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo ate and ate and ate and <b><i>ate</i></b>, until they both were forced back in their chairs, burping and hiccuping from trapped gas.

She had resolved it with all the willpower a 10-year-old could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, however, was not very much- especially when much more important things arrived to keep her occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, and best, piece of news that reached Susan was a letter from her school, informing the parents that, while performing maintenence on the billboard, the janitors had discovered a large and very elaborate roach infestation; therefore it was regrettable, although necessary, that the school be closed for two to three weeks for fumigation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, and less desirable, news came in the form of a worried phone call from Manyara. Apparently her father, a stockbroker by trade, had, due to a minor kerfuffle involving an enormous bomb and a failed coup, found himself in the odd position of, via his great-grandmother, being the nearest person to assume the position of Rama XI, King of Thailand; as a result, he wanted Manyara to attend his coronation. She would have to be gone for two to three weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Susan rather in the lurch. Aside from Manyara, she didn't really have any friends; therefore, there was little for her to do except plant her rapidly-softening rear on the couch and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eat, of course. One mustn't forget the eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, for two-and-a-half weeks, Susan did just that. She stayed on that couch, watching TV, playing games, and grazing constantly on snacks, for every waking moment. She only ever got up to use the bathroom, get more snacks, eat dinner, or go to bed- a task which, given its rapidly increasing difficulty, she often forewent, choosing instead to simply sleep on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall didn't mind very much. Susan was clearly happy, so he simply devoted himself to making her happier. He brought her snacks when he was around, cooked her meals- sometimes four a day- and generally was the best dad he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there was Lou Ann to think about. Manyara's mother was becoming a somewhat regular presence around the house. Susan didn't mind- in fact, she didn't really notice- but Randall certainly noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, too, did his bed. The poor thing's likely to break one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went on. Susan spread out. All was well.</span></div></div>",

As happy as Randall was that Susan could return to her education, his daughter...wasn't so happy to hear the news. She had been enjoying a relaxing few weeks of snacking and gaming, and it all passed by so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was nothing she could do about it. The coming Monday, she was back to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, there was one small thing she and her father had overlooked - they had neglected shopping for clothes, including a new uniform. The one from weeks before was all Susan had, and so she would have to make do.<br>\r\nPulling up her skirt was easy enough, but fastening it was the challenge. She took in a deep breath, her face turning pink and forming a beat of sweat as her plump fingers fidgeted to adjust the clasp. Thankfully it fastened after not too long, allowing her to exhale. Somehow, even with an ominous creak, the clasp held.<br>\r\nThe shirt was a much harder trial. In the last few weeks, her tummy had ballooned even bigger, and the already-tight buttons were now almost impossible without sucking in that big round gut of hers. Another puff of air, her face turning from pink to a sweaty red as she quickly buttoned up each one, and a gentle exhale the moment she was done. Another ominous creak escaped her shirt, and from her mirror, she could see multiple gaps between the buttons showing off bits of pink flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to Susan as she pulled her sweater on, tugging it down over her great dome of a tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, these fit a few weeks ago...a lot better anyway.

The result was the same too: she could hardly bear to do more more than laze around on the sofa for the rest of the morning while relaxing her overstuffed tummy. But this was a school day and she couldn't do that now, as much as she wanted. Her skirt had slipped down from her waist to her hips during the course of her huge breakfast, and she knew that it was futile to try to bring it back up, so she shifted the tight garment as well as she could to make it the most comfortable where it sat now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her shoes tied for school was even more of a struggle than usual, as her belly swelled out further than ever, and Susan had to squeeze her arms into the sides of it in order to reach her feet. Even when she did so, she still could not see them due to the soft, massive dome, and had to tie her shoes blind while she sat down. The feeling of her soft thighs squishing into the bottom of her softer belly when she brought her feet close was not something she could ignore anymore. She was already fat, and probably still getting fatter, and those thought elicited the same, confused reaction as they usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father didn't care, as long as she was happy, and she didn't care, as long as her family was happy... or at least that's how it should be. The bigger she got, the more friendship she felt with Manyara, but also the more alien she felt to her classmates, and Susan could not yet decide whether this was an overall positive or negative, or if this was even an important question compared to the first one. She shook her head, and forced herself not to think about it for now. The school bus should be arriving soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that last thought crossed her mind, her familiar school bus appeared in her front window. She forced herself to her feet with a grunt, and waddled with great effort to the door. \"Bye, Dad,\" she called to Randall, while on the verge of being out of breath even after a trek of less than twenty meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day at school,\" he called back. \"I'll have first dinner ready for you when you're home.\" \"First dinner\" had become a tradition for Susie during the last three weeks she spent out of school. She had become accustomed to eating four meals a day during her break, and this one in the afternoon was where the usual extra one took place. A calm, satisfied feeling flooded her nervous system when she thought about coming home from school to first dinner. She did not yet notice that this was a sign of just how far she had fallen into gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat of her father, though? There once was a time where he was worried about his daughter's rapidly-expanding weight, but for one reason or another that seemed to be gone or forgotten. Had he become ignorant and oblivious to it once again, or did he decide that he'd give his precious girl what she wanted, regardless of the long-term consequences? These questions touched only the edges of Susan's mind and didn't ask themselves directly to her. \"Could she walk to the bus?\" was a more important question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon found out that she could. A month or so ago she witnessed Manyara's hips squeezing against the sides of the doorway of the vehicle, and now Susan felt the same thing and had some sympathy for her. It took some childish, high-pitched grunting to squeeze herself through the door and up the three steps, and once she got there, she no longer had the strength to walk any further. Susan practically crashed her bottom down on the first seat of the bus, too exhausted to walk any further. A part of her wished that Manyara wouldn't come, so that she wouldn't have to share the too-small seat with her friend's enormous castle of a bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out her halfhearted wish came true; when the bus pulled ahead less than half of a street block to stand in front of Manyara's house, it waited there three whole minutes. She did not stumble or waddle out of the door, and so the bus driver drove off without her. Manyara had hardly missed a school day since Susan had met her years ago, and her absence worried her. She found herself distracted by her missing friend all day and hardly noticed when one of the buttons on her shirt popped after finishing her lunch. Thankfully nobody else noticed either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tromped her way from the bus to her house with heavy footsteps after class had ended. Her stomach felt ravenous even though it was less than three hours since her last meal. Her body knew it was time for first dinner and was not in the least bit afraid to tell her so. It was too hard for her to shout, \"Hi Dad, I'm home,\" or something of the like these days after making the walk from the street to the door, but from the noise of her footsteps it should be impossible for Randall to miss it. \"Hey, Susie,\" he called from the kitchen after hearing the front door shut. \"Come sit down for dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger for food gave her the strength to walk to the dining room with her shoes still on and to plop her oversized bottom down on the wooden chair. These chairs were a bit tall for her, and were becoming harder to hoist her heavy body on to, but once she was there, her soft cushion of a bottom made them more comfortable than ever to sit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandall brought a freshly-prepared tray of lasagna and set it at Susan's place at the table. There was only one plate and set of silverware: hers. All of this was hers. Susan's sense of smell had become more acute the more she gorged herself, and the scent of the mixed meats and cheeses under the flat, starchy noodles made her feel a bit giddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug her fork and knife into the tray, for the most part ignoring her dinner plate. Randall fussed around in the kitchen for a few minutes- Susan didn't pay much attention to what he was doing when there was food to be eaten. After her belly was no longer groaning at her, she thought to mention to him, \"Manyara wasn't in school today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" he said with a touch of realization. \"Lou Ann told me yesterday, but I forgot to tell you: She wants to stay with her father in Thailand for at least a little bit longer. I guess I shouldn't be surprised: she hasn't seen him in years, and now he's a king and she's a princess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Susan grunted in acknowledgement through a forkful of rich lasagna. In fifteen more minutes the entire tray was gone, and her belly felt stretched and sore as usual. She forced herself to take deep breaths to alleviate the discomfort while she sat in the dining chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the phone rang. Randall answered. \"Oh, it's Manyara,\" he said to Susan, and passed the phone to his stuffed, bloated daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Susie,\" a familiar voice said into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Manyara,\" Susan said. She panted, but not from exhaustion, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't call you before,\" the girl on the phone said. \"It's just been really busy here with... meals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" Susan reassured her friend. \"I had fun here during the break.\" It would have been more fun to be lazy together with Manyara, but it wasn't a lie: she did enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are amazing here!\" Manyara went on. \"I can have anything I want, as long as my dad says it's okay.  He was like, tenth in line to be king and no one had ever heard of him before, but now that he's the king now, everyone seems to love him instantly. I even have a tutor now and don't have to really go to school. He studied in England and he's really nice to me. And- oh there's so much I could show you! I really wish you were here!\" Manyara sounded ecstatic. No wonder she wasn't eager to return to her old school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Manyara said purposefully, breaking out of her euphoria. \"My dad could buy tickets for you and your dad to come visit me in the palace. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Aloud, she said \"Yeah, that should be fine. Let me just ask Dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, awesome!

Once she slowly plodded down the stairs out of the aircraft, 2 feelings were obvious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotness and hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl's belly rumbled, the meagre in-flight meal barely making a dent in the gluttonous girl's voracious appetite. Even with her dad sneaking snacks onto the plane for her, heads turned her way as other passengers got quite an eyeful of the blushing butterball rubbing her titanic tummy with both pudgy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Thailand was incredibly hot! The poor girl was bright red in her fat round face and her skin shone and her clothes dampened with sweat. She had far too much padding for this climate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the airport building was air-conditioned, and once her dad got their luggage he led his poor, overheated and starving daughter toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once they were outside, they noticed a rather fancy car parked near the door, and an incredibly obese, and very familiar looking girl was holding a little card with Susan's last name on it. Behind her was a sharply dressed older man<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both girls recognised each other right away. Even if they had both gained a good hundred pounds or so between them, there was no mistaken two best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Susan was rather shocked, because Manyara was...well, she was enormous! She had always felt like Manyara was living it up in her new royalty, but...she girl had to be wider than she was tall! The fancy dress she was wearing looked rather snug around her belly that had to be sticking out a couple of feet, and the only thing shinier than her sweaty forehead was the cute, jewel-coated tiara on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls embraced in a literally big hug, their massive bellies squishing together in their embrace that, despite the shared body heat and sweat, lasted for at least a minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to see you again!\" The princess squealed like the piglet she was.<br>\r\n\"You too!\" Susan huffed, her belly rumbling a little louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManyara giggled and began a slow, awkward waddle to the car, with the help of the well dressed man. Likely her helper.<br>\r\n\"Let's get in the car,\" she puffed, \"with the air conditioning. We can talk in there, I brought snacks too! Wait till you try Taiwanese chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan needed little more encouragement, and she and her dad piled into the car while the chauffeur got their bags into the trunk.</span></div></div>",

What's kanom dok jok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thai flower cookie. Try some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure!\" Susan said, accepting the proffered cookie. Warily, she nibbled at one corner; then, as the flavor hit her, she stuffed the rest of it in her mouth, chewing noisily and happily. \"Dish ish <i>great!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's plenty more!\" cut in Rama XI, sitting on the side of the car and smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan stopped chewing in surprise. In her haste to see Manyara she had totally forgotten to acknowledge Manyara's dad. No compliments on his accession, no friendly wave, not even so much as a hello. Now, he was looking at her, clad in a dress uniform so sharp one could cut their fingers on the creases, while she was wearing only a sweatshirt stained with airline food and blotted with cookie crumbs and a pair of leggings so tight as to allow all of her thighs to be displayed to the world. This was, in two words, horrifically embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort, Susan swallowed her cookie, lurched forwards - no small task with a belly as enormous as hers - and performed a little half-bow, squishing a fair bit of said belly out of the bottom of her straining sweatshirt. \"Th-Thank you for your hospitality, O Most Great High...uh...King Of Thailand. May the sun...er...shine ever on the house of Rama!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment, nothing stirred, swaddled in the humid air of Bangkok. Manyara even stopped chewing. Susan wondered, in terror, if she had somehow offended everyone and would be summarily kicked out of the car and the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Manyara snorted, and the whole car devolved into laughter. Susan sat up, greatly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Most...Great High...\" the King said, between chuckles, before knocking on the front window. \"Hey, Aat...you're not gonna believe this. \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e01\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \"\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e29\u0e31\u0e15\u0e23\u0e34\u0e22\u0e4c!\" \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e32\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver, presumably Aat, laughed so hard he nearly swerved the royal limousine into a sunglasses stand. Manyara wiped a tear from her eye and wheezed happily into Susan's squishy shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie, that's my <i>dad!</i> He used to push you on the swings, remember? You don't need to go crazy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked away, still mildly peeved. \"Well, how was <i>I</i> supposed to know? I've never met a King before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't....don't worry, Susan. I appreciate the honor, I really do,\" Manyara's dad answered, straightening his jacket, \"but you needn't stand on formality while you're here. I run a very open court, ask anyone. Just enjoy yourself! While you're here, you'll be treated like a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, as Princess, I'll make sure of it!\" Manyara proclaimed, attempting to look intimidating. Unfortunately, a girl of her size - rapidly bearing down on 500 pounds, to be vaguely precise -  very rarely looks anything other than very, very soft. It was now Manyara's turn to be the subject of the car's laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to see you again, Manyara,\" Susan said, wiping her eyes and letting forth a final chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're here,\" the Princess replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she did, her introspection continued.<br>\r\nHad she truly outgrown clothes built for larger kids her age? Was she...<i>that</i> big? Despite the startling realisation, her head still kept searching for excuses to say that she wasn't too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she remembered something from school. One of the science books in the library explained how everyone grew differently in size; height and weight. No one was built the same shape.<br>\r\nMaybe that was the case with her? Maybe she was just...a little bigger than most girls? Something completely natural, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought seemed to relax her. She wasn't too fat, she was just built differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a t-shirt from the pile - a blue one with some cats on it. Taking a breath, she attempted to slip it on. It felt a little snug on her plump arms, and she had to tug it down over her belly, but despite how closely it clung to her...it covered her belly. It fit!<br>\r\n\"Hey, that looks good,\" Manyara complimented with a smile, then awkwardly gestured to some darker blue shorts, \"try those with it.\"<br>\r\nSusan nodded and reached for the shorts, slowly sliding them up her thick thighs and protruding backside. The fabric clung tightly to her frame, and she had to suck in her poor belly to button it up properly, but it fit too! She actually found some fitting clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Manyara grinned, \"Looks awesome, right?\"<br>\r\nSusan nodded, but tugged at the shirt. \"They're kinda tight though...\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, they're probably made for those super skinny teenagers,\" the darker girl pointed out, \"y'know, the <i>reeeeally</i> thin ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blinked slowly. After all her doubting, she had never thought of that. \"That makes sense...but we managed to get them on, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah we did,\" Manyara smirked, \"man, I hope I don't turn out like that. They look like they just gave up eating. I could never give up candy!\"<br>\r\nSusan giggled at the thought of Manyara trying in vain to fight the urge to snack on a Mars bar, and couldn't help but agree with her. \"I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the girls gathered up some clothes in similar sizes and waddled out of the changing room, pleased with their choices. Susan was feeling much better in her new frame of mind. She was just differently built, and these clothes were made for really skinny teens. That's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep growl filled the air, and Susan watched Manyara put a plump hand to her tummy, which was clinging tight to the fabric of her dress.<br>\r\n\"All that trying on clothes makes you hungry, huh?\" She grinned, \"Let's get some snacks, mom'll be cool with it.\"<br>\r\nSusan responded with a hungry gurgle from her own tummy. She had no idea trying on clothes could work up such an appetite. \"Sure!\"</span></div></div>",

She rubbed the sleep out of her brown eyes and threw the covers off of her body. When she became fully awake, she looked down at her body and smiled. Her body was unusual. Her arms and legs were fairly thin as was the rest of her body with one exception, her belly. The mound of fat rested on her thighs, grown throughout her nine years of life to it's current size. If she was older, she would have been mistaken for being pregnant. Almost all of her weight gathered on her belly with very little going anywhere else. Her pajama top strained as it tried to contain her massive orb of a tummy. The fabric between the buttons showed off diamonds of tummy flesh. She gave her tummy a loving pat as it rippled slightly. She didn't know why, but she loved her big belly. Her friends liked it too. They were always fascinated by its size and shape. They were always playing with it when they had the chance. Annie didn't mind, in fact, she liked the attention. She was snapped out of her thoughts by her belly giving a large rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're so demanding\" she chided to her tummy as she jumped out of bed with surprising ease for someone of her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly seemed to defy gravity as it stuck out from her body like a large ball. She leaned back slightly as she walked over to her dresser, to compensate for her large belly. She looked at herself in the mirror and noticed that her belly looked even bigger than yesterday. She smiled and patted her tummy before changing out of her pajamas. She got dressed in a pair of jean shorts that had no chance of buttoning over her belly, so she buttoned the underneath. She then put on a small tank top that showed off all of her tummy as her belly roared in hunger. This was something she was used to. She was almost always hungry, so her belly growled a lot and loudly too. Her friends would always poke some fun at her tummy when it growled, saying how they thought there was a dinosaur in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going okay\" she said with a rub of her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard some commotion coming from the kitchen which sounded like her mother.

A moment later, Julie replied.<br>\r\n\"Your sister went for a run; she's a crazy kid.\" Julie rolled her eyes; voluntary exercise was a foreign notion to her, and indeed to almost every resident of the little town. There wasn't a single treadmill or dumbbell for 50 miles around, and despite how close together everything was you'd never see someone walking. There weren't even sidewalks on most of the roads.<br>\r\n\"Weirdo.\" Annie muttered. Madison was four years older than her at thirteen, and was the only person she knew who ate salad voluntarily. Annie hated salad; she thought it boring and insubstantial at best, actively disgusting at worst. She really didn't understand her sister at all.<br>\r\nSoon, the two climbed back into the car and drove the thirty metres down the road to the shop, where they got out again and went entered. Annie grabbed a basket and started loading it with all sorts of cookies and chips and other unhealthy treats (though she ate that sort of thing so often it was hardly a treat anymore), while Julie began grabbing the more mundane things like bread and milk (full fat, of course; they didn't even sell skimmed anywhere in town). In no time at all they'd finished and paid, and the two climbed back into the car for the short journey home.<br>\r\nWhen they got back, the door was unlocked and a pair of sneakers sat next to the converse worn by the rest of the family. <br>\r\n\"I guess Madison's home.\" Said Annie, bending down and undoing her laces, stomach gurgling with the sudden movement as it struggled to digest her breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Nodded Julie inattentively, having considerably more difficulty getting her own shoes off. Although only twenty-eight she was extremely large, and had a similar body shape to her daughter; as a result her midsection had dimensions akin to an overinflated beach ball, making shoelaces quite an ordeal. Eventually she just sighed and straightened up, rubbing her aching back. \"Annie, get my shoes for me will ya?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing mom.\" The nine year old knelt down again, movement awkward because of her own oversized belly, and undid the knots with nimble fingers.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Julie said, kicking off the irritating footwear and following her daughter into the kitchen. Annie was a good kid, always helpful and hungry. If only she could say so much good about Madison; that girl just wasn't right in the head. She was incredibly thin, at least compared to the other kids around town, and did exercise for fun! Sighing, she went into the kitchen, bags of shopping in hand. Sometimes she despaired of her older daughter, she really did...</span></div></div>",

Her sandy brown hair was tied back in a ponytail. She wasn't Annie's size though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <b>bigger</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Annie's extra weight went into her stomach, this girl's went everywhere. Her round, apple-like middle was held up by a pair of thick thighs and legs, with two slab-like arms at her side. Her middle didn't protrude as far as Annie's, but it was certainly larger in width. The adorable pink t-shirt she had on obviously fit her a few pounds ago; her arms squished out of the sleeves like muffins, and the overhang of her belly peeked ever so slightly from underneath. The purple pants she had on looked a little confined around her thighs and backside too.<br>\r\nHer chubby face sported a pair of puffy cheeks, pinked from constant blush, and a thick double-chin proudly showing itself beneath her mouth, which was covered in crumbs. No doubt from a snack she had before coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Cindy!\" Annie grinned, greeting her next-door neighbour and best friend.<br>\r\n\"Hi Annie,\" the larger girl greeted back, her smile dimpling her cheeks and squinting her eyes a bit, \"wanna play?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Annie nodded, standing aside to let her friend waddle through the door. Of course, their idea of 'playing' was mostly, if not always, vegetating on the couch, eating snacks and watching TV. The playing part came from Annie's video games, of course.</span></div></div>",

Then, the two of the headed upstairs to Annie's room. Climbing the stairs was the most exercise either girl did in the average day, and by the time they reached the top both were exhausted. They both collapsed on Annie's bed, gasping for breath - Cindy was especially wiped out. For a ten year old she had a massive amount of extra weight, and her fitness was simply dire. As a result, by the time she reached the top her was face bright red and her lungs felt fit to burst.<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes lying on the bed, Annie recovered enough to grab the TV remote from the side table and click on the flat screen mounted by the foot, rousing Cindy from her exercise-induced daze.<br>\r\n\"Uhh. I hate your - puff - stairs Annie. Too long - puff - by half.\"<br>\r\nAnnie shrugged in response.<br>\r\n\"I hate them as much as you, Cin. I wish I lived at your house.\"<br>\r\nCindy's house had a few features better that made it, in Annie's opinion, the best house ever; no stairs for a start, which meant no early-morning exercise, and an open-plan living room/kitchen combo which meant the distance between couch and fridge was three steps. <br>\r\nThen again, her own room had its advantages. Lying on her belly on her bed, she reached down and opened the cooler by the wall and took out a couple of cans of pop. She passed the first one to Cindy, who looked like she needed it, then cracked open her own and began gulping down the sugary liquid.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Annie.\" Said the fatter girl, after taking a long draught of Coke. \"What's on TV today?\"<br>\r\nThey flicked through the channels, but nothing caught Annie's eye. Sighing, she opened a pack of cookies and began eating them, already forgetting her large breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, look like. She flicked past the news, then froze. \" Wait a minute...\" She turned Fox News back on and looked at the headline, amused.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Indeed, the story did seem to be about Collford NC, where the two girls lived. A slim reporter was speaking to a man they recognised as the local mayor.<br>\r\n\"So, they're saying Collford is, ah 'the fattest town in America'.\" Said the woman, her accent northeastern. \"How do you feel about that, Mayor Saunders?\"<br>\r\nThe big man squinted angrily into the camera, hat low over his wide brow.<br>\r\n\"I think it's none of their God-darned business what goes on around here. We keep ourselves to ourselves, and we don't want no city-folk pestering us about nothing. Now, if you'll kindly move away from my office, maybe I can do my job!\" <br>\r\nHe disappeared into a building Annie recognised as being situated just down the road from her house. She thought about going to the window to see if she could see the news crews, but then Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n\"Pff. What's that even supposed to mean? I'm sure that's not right, 'cos my mama says that I'm perfectly normal, and all the other kids at school are the same size as me.\" She muted the TV, but Annie watched the little statistics scroll along the bottom. Apparently, 70% of the adult population was overweight or obese, as well as 94% of kids. She remembered being told about 'obese' at school one time, by a teacher from out of town, but she didn't really know what it meant. Probably nothing interesting.<br>\r\nSuddenly she sat bolt upright, staring at the screen.<br>\r\n\"Put the sound back on!\" She ordered Cindy, who confusedly obeyed. She leant forwards; on screen, the reporter was interviewing Madison, her sister!<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Hunt- or can I call you Madison?\" Said the news lady.<br>\r\n\"Um, Madison's fine.\" Annie's sister was looking rather shy, peering out from beneath her messy black hair. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. So, Madison; how do you feel about being one of the only 'normal weight' kids in town? It must be strange.\"<br>\r\n\"I- I suppose. I've sort of gotten used to it.\" <br>\r\n\"Really? And how do you manage to stay so slim in a town of overweight children?\" The reporter asked, scribbling on a notepad. Madison licked her lips nervously.<br>\r\n\"I just go for a run a few times a day and don't eat all that much. I've never really had a problem with it- though some of the other kids do.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, uh- it's never good to stand out too much... y'know?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's all we have time for right now, but thanks a lot for your time, Miss Hunt.\" The reporter finished suddenly. Annie flicked the TV off as it cut back to the presenter.<br>\r\nShe turned to Cindy, who had got bored and started eating Haribo part way through the broadcast.<br>\r\n\"What d'you think of that then?\" Asked Annie, grabbing a pack of chips and tearing it open, then crawling up the bed to sit against the headboard. Cindy finished her mouthful, then followed her example. The bed was just about wide enough for the two of them to sit side by side if they squashed together, but the two good friends didn't mind that.<br>\r\n\"I don't think it it'll come to anything.\" Said Cindy sagely. \"Nothing ever happens around here, its probably just all being exaggerated.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Replied Annie, glancing down at the great bulge of her belly. It sat comfortably in her lap, its warmth reassuringly heavy. The waistband of her jean shorts was tight underneath, so she absentmindedly reached down and unbuttoned them. Ah... that was better.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and her mom peered in, red-faced from the climb up the stairs.<br>\r\n\"Hey, kids...\" She began.</span></div></div>",

Shall I send her up?\"<br>\r\nAnnie and Cindy glanced at each other, grinning - Abeera was their friend from school, and it was always fun when the three of them got together.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course.\" Annie said. Her mom's face disappeared from the door, and they heard her call down the stairs.<br>\r\n\"Come on up, they're in the bedroom.\"<br>\r\nHalf a minute later, their friend appeared in the doorway.<br>\r\n\"Hi Annie, Cin.\" The ten year old's voice was bubbly and energetic despite the climb up the stairs. <br>\r\n\"Hi Abeera.\" The two chorused as she shut the door behind her and came over to the bed. \"Why're you here?\"<br>\r\nAbeera grimaced, pulling off her hijab and hanging it over the back of a chair. She was from the only Muslim family in the town, and stood out distinctly against all the white kids at school.<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad are fighting again. Do you mind if I hang out here?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, not at all.\" Annie smiled.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Abeera spotted the pile of food on the bedside table and helped herself, grabbing a Mars bar before perching herself on the bed with a creak of strained springs. <br>\r\nThe Muslim girl was at least as big as Cindy, but considerably more bottom-heavy; whereas the others girl's weight was spread pretty evenly over her body, Abeera's was mostly around her hips and butt, giving her a distinctive, exaggerated pear shape. She truly was incredibly wide, each of her buttocks twice as broad as normal for her age, each thigh as thick as a slim kid's waist.<br>\r\nShe wore a dress which was probably loose and flowing thirty pounds ago, but was now so tight it clung to every roll and bulge of her dumpy body, stretched so thin as to be almost transparent. The pattern of brown and grey flowers that had once adorned the garment was distorted beyond recognition, twisted into indistinguishable blobs of colour. The dress was even tight around her thighs it was so outgrown, and though it had originally been knee-length it slid up far higher whenever she moved or sat down.<br>\r\nOf course, none of the girls so much as noticed any of that; in a town where obese was average, ill-fitting clothes were common.<br>\r\nAbeera pulled one leg up onto the bed and began massaging the ankle, stubby fingers rubbing at the joint. Annie looked on curiously.<br>\r\n\"D'your ankles hurt, Abby?\" She asked eventually<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I had to walk all the way here!\" She exclaimed, and the other two girls shook their heads sympathetically. Abeera's house was five down from theirs; having to walk in this hot weather would just be torture of the worst kind, at least as far as they were concerned. Indeed, the unfit girl still looked rather hot and sweaty, hair tousled and breathing unsteady.<br>\r\nFor the next hour and a half, the three girls just chatted together, mouths filled with candy or cookies whenever they weren't talking. Soon, Cindy had followed Annie's lead in unbuttoning her pants as their stomachs steadily filled, and before they knew it the sun had set outside and Annie's mom was calling them for dinner.<br>\r\nAbeera began looking worried, but Annie grabbed her arm.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, mom'll of made food for you too. You can probably stay overnight if you want.\" It was common for Abeera to stay over at either Annie or Cindy's houses whenever her parents argued, so it was hardly a problem<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The big girl looked grateful, but Cindy was already urging them out the door and down the stairs.</span></div></div>",

As the smell of a delicious dinner hit heir noses, a chorus of growls emanated from their stomachs as they totally forgot about their snacking spree and looked forward to stuffing their fat little faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three waddled into the dining room, staring wide-eyed at the humongous spread of delicious, greasy, and no doubt fattening foods awaiting them. Pizza, burgers, pasta, fries, chicken, and litres upon litres of cola! Even cakes, puddings and ice cream sat out amongst the feast. Annie's mom had a firm belief that large healthy appetite meant a long happy life, and since the desserts were going to be eaten anyway, what was the point in waiting for them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Julie had just sat down once the girls had walked in, with Madison sitting near the end. True to form, her plate only held a healthy-sized chicken salad with some fruit juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Maddy,\" Annie greeted, smiling as she sat with Abeera and Cindy at her sides.

Annie grabbed a burger, some large slices of pizza and fries; Abeera got a large helping of pasta and fries; and Cindy helped herself to a few slices of pizza, a plentiful helping of chicken and even a slice of chocolate cake. The three of them filled their tall glasses with as much cola as they could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie, her own plate piled high, encouraged Madison to have a bit more, saying that her daughter's meal would hardly feed a rabbit.

Wood creaked softly as the girls shifted on their chairs, providing the only noise except for a constant munching, chewing sound, and soon the diners had sunk into a veritable trance in the heat. They ate fast, often eschewing cutlery for the sake of speed, and messily.<br>\r\nAt some point Madison left, slipping neatly from her chair and disappearing with a slam of the door, but no-one even stirred. They were all too engrossed in the vast feast before them, and by the delicious flavours it provided, to even bother looking up. Stomachs swelled as they were filled by masses of fatty food, clothing strained at the seams. By the time the table was nearing being cleared, everyone had unbuttoned their pants but Abeera, whose dress seemed close to giving up its endless struggle against the bulging body it contained. Annie's own tank top had ridden up to reveal her belly in its entirety, cream-coloured under the yellow lights, the skin tight and strained. Along either side, stretch marks marred the smooth skin, angrily red against the pale flesh.<br>\r\nIt was exceedingly warm, the heat of the past day combined with their flabby insulation causing everyone to overheat. Even Abeera looked red-faced, light brown skin notably darker than normal. Her dress was dark with sweat under her arms and where the fabric was caught between fat rolls, the thin fabric more translucent then ever where it was damp.<br>\r\nCindy meanwhile, with inches of blubber around her middle, was especially affected, her face and chest flushed brightly. She wore a thin chain around her thick neck, the decorative yellow beads like setting suns against the crimson sky of her skin.<br>\r\nEventually, when every morsel of food had been devoured, every crumb dabbed up and every drop of drink drunk, the meal ended. The girls, still somewhat conscious, managed to drag their stuffed bodies through to the next room, leaving Julie snoring in her chair. It took them nearly three minutes to stagger the eight steps through to the living room, where they collapsed in a heap on the couch and lay still. Occasionally someone would let a burp, or groan as their stomach ached particularly badly, but no one said a word. <br>\r\nSomehow, Annie had ended up in the middle of the couch, squashed between her two larger friends. She could feel the warmth practically radiating off them, the damp sweatiness that clung to their clothes like a visible thing to her addled mind. Confusedly, she tried to shift into a more comfortable position, but her bursting stomach stabbed with pain so she gave up, letting her head loll sleepily against the cushions. Through the dull filter of exhaustion, she felt the soft curve that was Abeera's hip on one side, the jelly-like roll of Cindy's belly on the other, and her own gut sticking out furthest in front. Despite the pain in her overstuffed stomach, the squashed environment and the heat that made her sweat like a pig, she smiled happily to herself. <br>\r\nAs far as her young mind was concerned, this was the best life any nine year old could live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the doorway, a slight figure watched the three flabby children on the couch, considering. Madison's mind, unsullied by lethargy, was planning and scheming - behind her eyes, dark designs were born and cultivated. She hated their little town, and the lazy people who lived in it. She'd heard bitter mockery every day of her life, from kids so fat a walk up the stairs was hard work, but soon her time would come. Without a sound, she turned and disappeared into the unlit hall, the soft opening and closing of the front door unheard by all but the flies who had come to claim the leftover food.</span></div></div>",

However, in the months following the previous chapter her diet reached new levels of unhealthy. Her stomach was constantly filled fit to burst by masses of sugary food and drinks, and she spent almost all her time not at school either eating or sleeping. Most weekends she wouldn't even leave her bed from the Friday evening to the Monday morning, just lounging around in her increasingly strained pyjamas and drinking endless pop from the cooler.<br>\r\nSoon, the effects of her lifestyle began to show on her body. Whereas before all her weight had collected on her belly, now it began to settle in other places as puberty kicked in. Her arms and legs softened, becoming thick and weaker than ever. A slight double chin appeared below an increasingly rounded face, the jaw of which never seemed to stop moving in its quest to consume more and more food.<br>\r\nHowever, the worst effects were upon her torso. Over the course of six months, she  became wider by almost half again as her hips spread outwards, matched in pace only by her belly. Before it had resembled that of a pregnant woman, a great mound of fat attached to her midsection; now, it was swamped in soft rolls that bulged over the front and sides of any pants she squeezed into - not that she bothered to put any on if she could help it. <br>\r\nShe had even begun developing breasts, though they were more like flabby rolls at that point, downturned by gravity.<br>\r\nWhilst she was still particularly hefty around the middle, she had begun to even out as she approached her tenth birthday party, which incidentally is where our story resumes...</span></div></div>",

Or rather, so she could see the top half of the screen. Her belly, swollen by the masses of food already packed within, obscured her view of the lower half no matter how she craned her neck. Huffing irritably, she grabbed another slice of cold pizza and stuffed it in her mouth, wondering if it was worth the effort to sit up against the headboard so she could actually see the screen. Probably not, she concluded. The cartoon she was watching wasn't very good, just some drivel about a cat and mouse. Really, she was only watching it to fill the space between the other shows she wanted to watch.<br>\r\nThe door opened unexpectedly and she jumped, peering over her distended midsection to see who had come in. The round, smiling faces of Cindy and Abeera met her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Hey Annie!\" Said Abeera cheerfully. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\nAnnie heaved herself up to perch on the side of the bed, thick legs spread wide, belly sitting comfortably between her soft thighs. She smiled back at her friends, looking slightly confused.<br>\r\n\"Hey. Uh, why're you two here?\" She asked awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"For your party, of course!\" Cindy gushed. \"You said for us to come help set it up with you!\"<br>\r\nAnnie bit her lower lip, thinking. Wasn't her party tomorrow? Wait a minute - it had been quite dark earlier... was it was Sunday already?<br>\r\nReluctantly, she slid off the bed and waddled stiffly over to the window, muscles that hadn't been used for nearly forty straight hours groaning as they had to bear the weight of her oversized body once more. She parted the pink curtains with one chubby hand, squinting at the sudden rays of morning sunlight. She must have lost track of time after all; it was Sunday morning already.<br>\r\nShe turned to her friends, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. They were looking rather bemusedly at her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember now.\" She muttered. \"Let me get dressed, then we'll go get started.\" Her current attire was some way short of modest; just a T-shirt and panties. The T-shirt, however, was so outgrown that it barely even covered her upper chest, utterly failing over her massive midriff. Lower, her blue-striped panties were almost completely hidden beneath her bottom flab roll, just a peek of fabric showing under the sagging expanse of her belly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Abeera and Cindy took Annie's place sitting on the bed, chatting idly as they watched her dress. With their weights in the middle, there was a noticeable bow in the bed's wooden frame, and ominous creaks whenever they shifted position. Both girls had also gained in the past months, though not as radically as Annie. For Cindy it was another couple of inches around her waist, and the beginnings of a new fat roll beneath her budding breasts. For Abeera, the new weight joined the rest around her hips and butt, exaggerating her form still further. Whenever her dress rode up, which was any time she moved, ragged stretch marks could be seen across the tender skin of her inner thigh.<br>\r\nAnnie was getting annoyed. It was becoming obvious that nothing in her wardrobe was going to fit her, and her school uniform was still in the wash from when she'd spilt lemonade down the front. Was there nothing she could wear?<br>\r\nReluctantly, she bent down and began rummaging in the bottom drawer. The clothes in here were seldom used - it made her knees hurt to bend down like this - but things fell off their hangers occasionally and ended up in there. Too lazy to fish them out, she'd let them lie until they were needed - like now.<br>\r\nEventually, she gave an excited half-laugh and straightened up, revealing to her friends...</span></div></div>",

The two girls exchanged looks as their friend looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked, her excited face turning into a sad frown, \"Don't you like it?\"<br>\r\nAbeera was the first to speak. \"Well, uh, it's really pretty Annie, but don't you think it's a little, um...\"<br>\r\n\"A little what?\" Annie whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little cold!\" Cindy jumped in, grinning awkwardly, \"I mean, maybe you could put something on underneath it, like some tights or something...?\" She shot a look at Abeera.<br>\r\n\"O-oh, yeah, right,\" The wider girl nodded, getting the idea, \"it was a little chilly coming over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, gotcha!\" Annie nodded, her bright grin returning as she grabbed a pair of tights from a higher drawer. Her apparent obliviousness invoked a sigh of relief from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she waddled back over and draped the dress and tights over her bed, slowly taking off her shirt. The girls had changed clothes in front of each other for ages, so there was no hint of awkwardness in the air.<br>\r\nOnce it was off, she dropped it onto the floor and grabbed the dress, easily pulling it over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, tugging it down her middle was the challenge. As expected, it stopped as it covered her chest and reached her round belly and wide sides. She'd gotten her arms and head through, so it was just a matter of tugging the rest of it down.<br>\r\n\"Oof, c'mon you...\" She grunted, wriggling and tugging with all her might, her chubby cheeks reddening with the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try sucking in,\" Cindy suggested, getting a worried look from Abeera. Annie didn't seem to think much of it, as doing just that had gotten it down a tiny bit more. <br>\r\nThe dress had reached down to just above her belly button before she decided it was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were the tights. Annie sat next to her friends, invoking a deeper bend in the frame and another loud creak. She held her breath and leaned forward to get one of them over her foot, quickly exhaling and leaning back as soon as it was on. She repeated the process with the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could you, gimme, a hand, girls...?\" She panted, looking toward her friends.<br>\r\nThe two nodded and slid off the bed, which let out a loud creak of relief as it slightly straightened back up. Each girl grabbed a sock and pulled it up a thick leg, looking rather tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we got them,\" Abeera nodded, watching their friend slide off her bed and land with a heavy thud on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks girls,\" Annie smiled widely, her cheeks dimpling.</span></div></div>",

Carefully, she climbed down off the chair and moved it over a few feet, then climbed back up.<br>\r\n\"Careful, Annie.\" Said Abeera worriedly, taking hold again of Annie's thigh to steady her. On the other side, Cindy was looking equally anxious. The chair was old and rickety, the wooden legs warped outwards by years of heavy use, and whenever their friend shifted her weight it creaked ominously. Annie's mom had been supposed to do this bit, but she'd had to go out to buy replacement snacks after the last lot mysteriously disappeared. <br>\r\nOnce more, Annie managed to get the balloons into place before dismounting the chair and moving it over one final time. She was puffing from the unaccustomed exertion, rounded face red to match the butterfly clip in her hair. Whenever she raised her arms her dress rode up, revealing the pale expanse of her gut to her concerned friends. Not that it was well hidden usually, however; the dress was so thinly stretched over her midsection and chest it was semi-transparent, every bump and dip blatantly visible. The fabric was so clingy, even her deep belly button stood out against the vaguely blue fabric (it had been ultramarine originally, but it was so stretched the colour had faded). Her tights were even worse; stretched to breaking point over her thick thighs and bulging butt, they hid practically nothing. Every stripe on her panties showed through, and down the sides little slices of flesh could be seen where the stitching had given up its struggle.<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort, she climbed back onto the chair with the final bunch of balloons and reached up. Her short, pudgy fingers strained as she tried to tie the knot far above her head, squinting up at the awkward piece of string. She reached up on tiptoes to get a better angle, feeling her ankles protest furiously at their treatment as she did so. Nearly... nearly... aha!<br>\r\nShe pulled the knot tight, but at that very moment Cindy took the opportunity to sneeze, taking a hand away from supporting Annie to cover her mouth. Half a second later, of Annie's ankles buckled unexpectedly, and the inevitable happened. Like a great oak felled by dozens of burly lumberjacks, Annie toppled smoothly from the chair and tumbled to the ground far below.<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" All the air fled from Cindy's lungs as suddenly Annie's considerable weight landed on top of her, and the two girls crumpled to the floor. For a moment they lay there, fallen giants on the field of battle, then Annie's plump lips parted and she spoke.<br>\r\n\"At least I got the balloons up!\" She rolled heavily off her friend and climbed to her feet, before turning to look down at Cindy. The bigger girl was gasping like a fish out of water, face redder than ever. \"You okay, Cindy?\" Annie asked, vaguely concerned. The fat girl managed a nod, wheezing and gasping, hands clutching at her bruised middle. \"Great. It's a good job you're so soft, really; I coulda hurt myself.\" Annie waddled of to find some more decorations, leaving her friend on the floor. Abeera helped her up.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, take it easy.\" She said, struggling to support the other girl's weight. \"Let's go get you some food, kay? <br>\r\nAbeera lead Cindy to a couch and sat her down again, before heading off to find something for her to eat. Her mom had always told her that if someone had injured the best medicine was food, and that tradition hadn't failed her yet.</span></div></div>",

Part of her wished she was a little more concerned that one of her best friends had hurt herself, but on the other hand, she knew she would be if she was in genuine trouble, and she only seemed to have the wind knocked out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the pantry door and looked inside, seeing all the shelves were loaded to the brim. It seemed only the party snacks had 'mysteriously disappeared', so the regular ones went untouched.<br>\r\nTill now, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbeera grabbed armfuls of chip bags, chocolate bars, cupcake boxes and any other sugary calorie-packed treats she could reach. It'd take at least the majority of one shelf to cheer Cindy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneaked the treats past her oblivious hostess and into the living room, where Cindy was sat up and rubbing her sore middle with a quiet whimper.<br>\r\n\"Here Cindy, this'll cheer you up a bit,\" she said, smiling softly to her rounder friend as she dumped the collection of snacks next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy sniffled and managed a little smile before grabbing a chocolate bar. \"Thanks, Abby.\"<br>\r\nShe ripped open the foil wrapper and chowed down on the sweet treat, letting out a little giggle of joy as she chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbeera felt a wave of relief as she watched her friend gobble up treat after treat. She was obviously feeling much better already, and she knew she'd let her have a share of the snack pile. The wider girl propped herself up next to her and grabbed a few chip bags for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cindy ate and ate, her already rather packed shirt began to tighten even more, a pale sliver of her round belly peeking from underneath and getting larger as she continued. She didn't notice though; her need to eat was much too empowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she ate much less, Abeera was still in a continuous war with her dress. She could constantly feel it riding up her love-handles as she adjusted herself to get more comfortable, and she constantly tugged it back down with one hand as she ate with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind she had to wonder; how was Annie not noticing any of this?</span></div></div>",

She watched as Abeera jumped guiltily, looking up from the half-unwrapped candy bar in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Uh, um, we were just having a snack.\" She hurried. \"I didn't think you'd mind us eating your food.\"<br>\r\nAnnie shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the food, what's mine is yours and whatever, but you need to help with the decorations. The party's starting in an hour and we still need to do the pi\u00f1ata.\" She put her hands on her hips, feeling them sink slightly into the soft flab. \"Plus, I'm getting tired doing all this by myself.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Sorry.\" Abeera heaved herself off the couch, wincing slightly as the movement jostled her full stomach. The overfed girl glanced at the couch, and at the pile of empty wrappers on the cushions. She must've got carried away; that'd been an awful lot. She idly tugged her dress back down, wishing the damn thing would just stay in place; the old thing was tighter on her than ever, and rode up practically to her waist at the slightest provocation. It was a testament to the dress's manufacture that it stayed in one piece despite being stretched so tightly over her thighs and hips, and didn't just burst its stitches every time she moved.<br>\r\nAnnie led her two friends through to the sitting room, where a pi\u00f1ata sat disembowelled on the floor next to a great mountain of candy. As they entered, they saw Madison hurriedly straighten up, stepping away from the multicoloured pile.<br>\r\n\"Hey Skeleton. You eating our candy?\" Annie frowned at her older sister. \"That's not like you.\"<br>\r\nMadison glared at the three fat girls, anger flashing in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I told you not to call me that!\" She said, slipping something into her hoodie's pocket even as she pushed past them and headed for the stairs. Annie glanced after her, almost curious as to what it had been; however, there was a pi\u00f1ata to be made, so she let it go.<br>\r\nMadison, in contrast to her sister, hadn't changed much. Underneath her hoodies and tracksuits, she had the same slim, strong body as ever; perhaps she'd grown a couple of inches, or lost a couple of pounds, but she was the same strange, skinny figure she'd always been.<br>\r\nAnnie headed on in to the sitting room, and began fiddling with the pi\u00f1ata. Behind her Cindy and Abeera tried to enter at the same time and nearly got wedged in the door, filling the narrow space with their wide rears. They giggled and Abeera stepped back, letting Cindy go first. Soon, all three were sitting cross legged on the floor, shoveling great handfuls of chocolate and candy into the massive, multicoloured paper pony. In no time, its papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 skin was bulging all over it was so full, and the girls stepped back to admire their work.<br>\r\n\"It looks great!\" Said Cindy enthusiastically. The food Abeera brought for her, as well as a few candies pinched from the pile, had erased any memory of her injury from her mind and she was cheerful once more.<br>\r\nAnnie nodded, licking her lips hungrily.<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be awesome! Help me carry it through okay? We'll hang it in the back yard.\"<br>\r\nTogether, the three heaved it up off the carpet and headed to the back yard, huffing and puffing the whole way. It was truly huge, as large as Annie in size and probably about equal in weight, what with the amount of chocolate packed within. With much complaint and struggle, and more than one near-disastrous slip, they managed to get it out to the backyard and hung from a low tree branch. It looked magnificent, practically glowing in the blazing sun; it really had been a good idea on Annie's mom's part to have one. They stood admiring it for a while, fantasising about the candy within.<br>\r\nEventually, Cindy wiped a hand across her brow, breaking the stillness that had settled as they stood there. All three girls were hot and sweaty from the work, especially Cindy who was the most unfit of the bunch, and she was eager to go inside to have a snack and a rest before the party guests arrived. She was wearing an undersized tank top that had ridden so far up it was basically just a strip of fabric tight around her chest, under a light jacket which didn't even come close to buttoning up. She also wore a pair of denim shorts that were so tight her thighs more resembled overstuffed sausages than anything. Despite this light summer clothing her clothes were already damp with sweat, so reluctantly she turned and headed back inside, soon followed by the two others. <br>\r\nThey were all looking forward to the party, but right then a cold drink and a snack sounded perfect.</span></div></div>",

Their clothes were already dampened with sweat thanks to their taxing efforts of setting up the party, and the taxing climb up the stairs and onto Annie's bed didn't help them one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed's frame bended badly inward from the sheer weight set on it, and creaked ominously. Annie, sitting against the headboard, could just about reach the mini-fridge by the bed, which acted as somewhat of a bedside table. She pulled out a few cans of soda and shared them amongst her friends. Abeera sat just in front of her, her exaggerated pear-shaped body nearly taking up the entire width of the bed. Cindy sat before her, to her left. She pulled off her jacket and set it on the bed, thinking she'd cool down much faster without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking toward her two friends, she made a mental note to ask her mom about getting a bigger bed, like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large pile of sugary fattening treats was piled on the bed before the girls; after some thought, Annie decided her friends had the right idea, and they all decided to loot the pantry of as much food as their tubby arms could hold. Which was a surprisingly large amount each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hostess flipped on the TV to a cartoon channel and the three began to relax their way - snacking and lazing. Annie helped herself to some chocolate bars; Abeera a box of small muffins; and Cindy a bag of sugar-coated doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to snack and watch TV, laughing at the screen every so often. Ripped wrappers, hollow boxes and empty cans began to clutter the floor around the bed, but they were too engrossed in their lazing to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir fingers and faces coated with sugar, chocolate, cream and all manners of remains. Debris from their messy binging dropped onto their clothes, which did not fair well from even more strain put on them. <br>\r\nAnnie's shirt tightened, the overhang of her belly creeping out more and more, along with the tiniest bit of love handle.<br>\r\nCindy's tank top was no different than from when she started, serving only to cover her chest, aside from the new colourful food stains.<br>\r\nAbeera was once again having a disagreement with her dress, and every few minutes, or every adjustment to get comfortable, she found the infernal thing riding up again and again, and with a huff of annoyance she tugged back down every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Madison was in her room, no doubt she could hear the loud chomping and slurping of hedonism coming from close by.</span></div></div>",

Cindy was taking the top half of the bed herself, lying on her back with her belly sticking up towards the ceiling. Abeera was sprawled across the foot of the bed with her large form, but she was sitting against the wall so Annie lay back and rested her head on the fatter girl's bare thigh. It was exceedingly comfortable, the flabby flesh soft and warm, and in but a few moments she felt herself drift to sleep. The only sounds were those of Cindy still sleepily slurping down cola at the other end of the bed, and the grumbles of Abeera and Annie's stomachs as they began digesting. Slowly, Annie's eyes meandered shut... only to spring open with a start as the doorbell's chimes echoed up the stairs. She glanced at the clock on the wall.<br>\r\n\"The guests must be here!\" She gasped, realising with a start how late it was. She rolled off the bed, landing precariously on her feet before waddling hurriedly out of the room. Abeera and Cindy heard her heavy footsteps clump down the stairs, and reluctantly they got up to follow their friend.<br>\r\nAnnie reached the door as the bell rang a second time. Brushing the worst of the crumbs off her dress, and tugging the tight fabric down a bit further to cover her belly button, she pulled open the unlocked door. No-one ever really bothered securing their houses in Annie's town; everyone was too lazy to bother committing any crime, never mind burglary.<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door were three girls, and Annie grinned as she recognised them as Marilyn, Emma and Mariana, three of the other girls in her year. Living in such a small town, there were only about thirty kids her age around, so she'd invited all sixteen girls from her class to the party. These three were some of her better friends, so she happily accepted their presents and showed them in, leading them through to the sitting room where decorative multicoloured ribbons and balloons adorned the walls. A moment later, Abeera and Cindy joined them, looking red faced from the walk down the stairs. They all began making introductions.<br>\r\n\"You look nice, Annie.\" Said Emma, bright eyes looking her friend up and down. \"That dress really suits you - though it is a little short.\"<br>\r\nAnnie glanced down.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it is.\" She made a halfhearted effort to tug the offending garment further over her bloated midsection. \"Still, I think it looks pretty good on me. Um, you look nice too, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you.\" Said Emma sweetly, standing up to give a little twirl. Her neat pink dress fit her extremely well, at least compared to the others' outgrown attire. Although she was quite chubby, her weight collected on her hips and chest to form an attractive, if somewhat exaggerated, hourglass shape. As an amateur fashion enthusiast, she was always trying out new styles of clothing. Sometimes it worked, like today's frilly dress; other times, she looked more like an arrangement of felt and fur that had somehow achieved life.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Abeera had struck up a conversation with Mariana. The two were great friends, Abeera being from the only Asian family in town and Mariana being the only Hispanic kid their age. They also shared a great love of reality TV, and the two could spend hours talking avidly about who did what in the latest episode of Hollyoaks. <br>\r\nMariana was a rather short, astonishingly rotund girl. She was the second fattest kid in their year, and had at some point given up on trying to find clothes that fit properly, resorting to wearing two-piece swimsuits practically everywhere instead. She had collapsed into an armchair the second they'd entered the room, and now looked rather thoroughly wedged.<br>\r\nFinally, at the other side of the room, Cindy was awkwardly trying to rouse up a conversation with Marilyn, with little success. Marilyn was quite short, with curly dark hair and pale skin. She was also a bit slimmer than the other girls, with just a bit of a pot belly and chubby thighs to show her excesses - though she was known at school for eating impressive amounts for her size. She wasn't, however, very talkative.<br>\r\n\"I, er, I like what you've done with your hair.\" Cindy tried. Marilyn looked at her.<br>\r\n\"I haven't done anything to it.\" She said quietly. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, uh, how's school going?\" She attempted again.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n\"That's nice.\" Cindy smiled falsely, looking around hurriedly for something else to say. Luckily for her, the doorbell rang a second later.</span></div></div>",

More guests arriving so soon?<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back,\" she told Emma, and waddled off to the door to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the porch were three more girls Annie fondly recognised from class. The one in front was a rather chubby girl, a potbelly stretching her light blue shirt and hanging over the waist of her jean-shorts. Her hair was shoulder-length and curled at the ends, and a wide smile dimpled her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa,\" Annie grinned back, albeit not nearly as widely.<br>\r\n\"Hi Annie!\" Lisa squeaked, throwing her arms around the hostess, \"Thanks for lettin' us come!\"<br>\r\n\"Well we're friends,\" the wider girl said with a shrug, \"dunno why I wouldn't invite you.\"<br>\r\nShe happily accepted Lisa's gift and let her in to meet up with the others. She was very affectionate and energetic, particularly for a girl her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls, Rebecca and Veronica, were twins, and it certainly showed; the two had the same brunette hair running down their backs, the same amber eyes, and the same apple-shaped figure that their matching purple tops and grey sweatpants struggled to keep contained. The only difference was Rebecca was more relaxed and Veronica was chattier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming, girls,\" Annie greeted them, accepting their presents.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for letting us come,\" Rebecca smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is gonna be so cool!\" Veronica grinned; she was much like Lisa, so the two got along quite well. \"Wonder who else is here?\" She waddled inside, her calmer sister following.</span></div></div>",

Annie held the door open for her as she hurried inside.<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom. Whatcha buy?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n\u201cLoads.\u201d her mom answered shortly, \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d<br>\r\nAnnie followed Julie through to the kitchen. <br>\r\n\u201cUhm, me, Abeera and Cindy\u2026 and Marilyn and Mariana and Emma\u2026 and Lisa and Veronica and Rebecca got here just now.\u201d She listed. Julie grunted in agreement.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I saw their cars leaving as I got here.\u201d She pushed a few family packs of potato chips into Annie\u2019s arms, before flopping onto a chair, wiping sweat from her brow. \u201cTake those through and give \u2018em to your friends, okay? I\u2019m gonna have a sit down.\u201d<br>\r\nAnnie headed back into the sitting room and took a look around. Mariana and Abeera were filling (quite literally) the armchairs by the TV, chatting away happily about some dramatic occurrence on yesterday's episode of Twin Peaks. Emma was perched on the arm of the big red couch, which was creaking and groaning under the considerable combined weights of Cindy, Rebecca, Veronica and Lisa who burdened its longsuffering cushions. To fit all four girls on at once they were squashed together like sardines in a can, and Annie giggled at the sight of them. Marilyn, ever the loner, was standing quietly in the corner, examining her nails.<br>\r\nAnnie announced her arrival by chucking a packet of potato chips at everyone, giggling even harder as everyone but Emma failed to catch theirs. Grabbing a pack for herself as well, she planted her butt on the opposite, smaller couch and joined the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Have you seen the building site yet?\" Lisa was asking the others. \"It's huge! Apparently, they're gonna build a gym or something.\"<br>\r\nSeveral confused looks appeared.<br>\r\n\"What's a gym again?\" Asked Rebecca, biting her lip in consternation. It was Emma who answered her.<br>\r\n\"It's like, a place where you go to exercise and stuff.\" She said, but Rebecca just looked even more confused.<br>\r\n\"A building just for exercise? Why would you want that?\" She asked, but everyone just shrugged. Annie wondered if maybe they were building it just for Madison.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I heard they're going to have a swimming pool as well.\" continued Emma, brushing salt off her pink dress. \"That could be pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Broke in Veronica, remembering something. \"Have you seen the television crews around town? Apparently, they're making a docu... documentally?\"<br>\r\n\"Documentary.\" Supplied Rebecca.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that! They've been interviewing people for this show they're gonna make. They said it's gonna be called 'Collford; Fat Capital of the Western World' or something.\"<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" broke in Annie, \"Why're they doing that?\" She glanced around at all the people in the room. They all looked pretty normal to her.<br>\r\n\"Apparently we've got more, uh, 'obese' kids than anywhere else in the world.\" Continued Veronica. \"I guess that's a science word?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Agreed Annie, biting her lip. She was sure she'd heard that word somewhere before.<br>\r\n\"Oh wait, but that's not even the exciting part.\" Gushed Veronica. \"They told me, they're gonna choose a family and do a big part of the documentary just about them, filming their daily lives and having interviews and all that stuff.\" Her amber eyes turned dreamy. \"I hope they choose us. I always wanted to be a film star!\"<br>\r\nA moment later though, the ringing of the doorbell precluded any more conversation, and Annie jumped (well - climbed laboriously) to her feet and waddled off hurriedly down the corridor to answer it. She was getting rather tired by all this upping and downing - but on the plus side, she was working up a healthy appetite for later, so it was okay in the end. Plus, what could this be but more friends?</span></div></div>",

Her frilly rose-like dress fit rather snugly around her middle, her stomach and love-handles pushing against the fabric. Her white socks just barely covered her thick calves, and her dress hid her large thighs. Fancy matching red shoes with little bows covered her feet. She carried a nicely wrapped gift in her hands, topped with a bow and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tamara,\" Annie greeted with a smile. Tamara was the more well-off girl of their year, and one of the more popular girls. She often acted rather haughty, but she had a good heart and considered the other girls her friends, otherwise she wouldn't dare show up.<br>\r\n\"Hello Annie,\" she smiled back, letting herself inside, \"I see I must be fashionably late. No matter, I'll take care of myself.\" She finished, making her way into the living room with her eyes fixed on something. Probably the family-sized chip bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl was an inch or so shorter than Annie, but fixed her with a wide smile as she handed over her present. Her curly ginger hair reached her shoulders and her brown eyes almost shimmered on her round freckled face. Her pink t-shirt bore the slightly stretched image from a popular anime, with a pale sliver of overhanging stomach peeking from the bottom. Her black sweatshorts looked rather strained around the rear, and her thighs looked a little stuffed in the legs. Her tubby toes flexed in her sandals, free from socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Annie!\" She squeaked, throwing her arms around her friend.<br>\r\nAnnie grinned and returned the gesture happily. \"Hey Sarah, make yourself at home!\"<br>\r\nSarah practically bounced inside and made her way over to meet with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl was about Annie's height, with a ponytail of blonde hair reaching just past her shoulders, and a pair of thin glasses shielding her amber eyes. A meek smile crossed her chubby face. Her t-shirt, dark blue with the graphic of a popular MMORPG, fit relatively well for her size; almost too well, looking more like a nightgown than a t-shirt. Her sweatpants fit snugly on her pear-shaped figure, and her sneakers were blue and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Annie,\" she greeted, her voice soft.<br>\r\n\"Hi Lucy,\" Annie greeted, and the two shared a soft hug, \"c'mon in!\"<br>\r\nLucy nodded and made herself inside, no doubt looking around for Sarah. With the two of them being rather nerdy, Lucy for games and Sarah for anime, it was almost destined for the two to be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie grinned and set her gifts with the others before joining the girls.</span></div></div>",

Snacks were brought through and devoured, and conversation sprang up in earnest as they discussed the new developments in their lazy little town. Historically, theirs had been a place where not much happened; this news story, bemused as most of the residents were by its fancy words like \"obesity\" and \"malnutrition\" and \"caloric intake\", was still by far the most interesting thing to happen to Collford NC since the bomb tests of '82, and everyone was abuzz with rumours.<br>\r\nMost of the girls had heard about the new gymnasium that was being built, but only Tamara knew about the changes to the local school. According to her mother (who was good friends with Mayor Saunders), there was going to be a new lesson every other day called \"gym\". What this new lesson was going to entail even Tamara didn't know - it seemed it was as much a mystery to the teachers as it was to the students.<br>\r\nAt some point, Marilyn had spoken up suddenly from the corner of the room to tell them that she'd overheard that all the kids in the town were going to be assigned \"nutrition management specialists\" who would help them with... something? Marilyn hadn't been sure, and had quickly retreated back to the corner after saying her part. That had left everyone quiet for a moment as they collectively attempted to remember what nutrition was, but luckily Julie brought through a tray of three dozen donuts before anyone could think too hard about it. <br>\r\nBefore long however, they were all well and truly rumoured-out. As the conversation began grinding to a halt, Annie looked around for something to entertain her guests.</span></div></div>",

She lit up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's play Musical Chairs!\" She piped up, everyone suddenly going quiet to listen to her.<br>\r\n\"Omygosh!\" Lisa squeaked, grinning ear to ear, \"I <i>love</i> Musical Chairs!\"<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Veronica giggled, feet kicking, \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could do something,\" Rebecca said, shrugging with a grin.<br>\r\nSarah nearly hopped up from her seat, which she somehow shared with Lucy, and grinned over to Annie. \"Great idea! Comin', Luce?\"<br>\r\n\"U-um,\" Lucy muttered quietly, then managed a small nod with a smile to match, \"okay, sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to move around a lot?\" Cindy complained with a fearful frown.<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Abeera answered, shaking her head, \"You just walk around a circle of chairs and grab a seat when the music stops. You never played it before?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" she admitted, with a slight shrug, \"Always sounded like too much work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>suppose</i> I could join in,\" Tamara answered, smiling as she, slowly and with some effort, got herself up, \"but I intend to win, girls, just warning you.\"<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Emma smirked at the richer girl, sliding off the arm of the couch, \"I'm not going easy on any of you!\"<br>\r\nMariana, with some help from Abeera, got herself up from her chair. \"Me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie grinned, happy that everyone was on board with the idea.<br>\r\nOr so it seemed; She noticed Marilyn hadn't given an answer yet. She simply stood there and watched everyone get excited.<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna play too, Marilyn?\" She tried, smiling warmly at her, \"Or do you wanna do the music?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet girl blinked, biting her lip slightly in thought. <br>\r\n\"...can I do the music?\" She finally answered.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Annie chirped with a nod, \"I'll show you how the stereo works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girls each got a chair from the dining room, and anywhere else they could find, Annie grabbed a CD from the unit and showed Marilyn how the stereo worked as she turned it on. It wasn't that Marilyn was unfamiliar with stereos, Annie just felt she should show her what way each button was placed on her particular machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's the pause button there,\" she finished, popping the CD in.<br>\r\nMarilyn nodded, understanding, and sat on a little stool Emma had left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chairs were all set, one too little, hence the point of the game.<br>\r\n\"Whenever you're ready, Marilyn,\" Annie called to her friend, the others ready to walk...or waddle.</span></div></div>",

There was a moment's pause, then like a heavy cargo train slowly struggling out of the station, the procession of girls began to move. Slowly, some walking, some forced to waddle by the sheer size of their thighs, they began to circle the group of chairs, each poised to leap into action the second the music stopped. Abeera was in front of Annie in the line, and Annie watched with perverted curiosity at the way the bigger girl's butt jiggled and shook with every step. Although the Asian girl wasn't the biggest there, a genetic fluke had left her with the largest derri\u00e8re by no small margin.<br>\r\nAround and around they circled, and as the song dragged on without pause the line became more ragged as some of them began to stumble. Mariana, the fattest and laziest girl at the party, was already starting to pant, nearly falling as she tripped over her own feet and bumped into Sarah ahead. She wheezed an apology between gasps.<br>\r\nAnd still the music dragged on. Eventually they all ground, panting, to a halt. They turned as one to Marilyn.<br>\r\n\"Come on Marilyn...\" Annie said, before stopping to huff for breath. \"You've gotta... you've gotta turn the music off eventually!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, c'mon.\" Said Lisa, who was less puffed than the rest of them. She was known as a bit odd in their year for occasionally walking to school when the weather was cool enough. \"Cindy keeps stepping on my heels.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" gasped Cindy, who was leaning heavily on one of the chairs to catch her breath. \"I can't really... I can't really see my feet most of the time... gotta guess... where I'm gonna step...\"<br>\r\nMarilyn looked up from the stereo at the array of round facing glaring at her. She met Annie's eyes, the music still playing loudly in the background, and gave a very small smile. Then, very deliberately, she reached out one long finger and tapped the pause button. The music stopped.<br>\r\nFor half a second, there was absolute silence as the girls stared blankly at Marilyn. They weren't really used to unexpected events, and anything that happened faster than they could eat an ice cream sundae was generally considered too fast to be healthy. Even the tortoise gets there eventually however, even it takes him a year.<br>\r\nTamara leapt impressively for one of the chairs, bowling aside Lucy as she did so.  After successfully planting her rear on a seat, she turned to smile smugly at the rest of the group.<br>\r\nWhat occurred next was, put conservatively, somewhat chaotic. The ten remaining girls all jumped for the nine remaining chairs, and as is inevitable when so much weight it thrown around, casualties were suffered. Many of them were still poised by their chosen seats and were able to grab them immediately, but a few of them, whether particularly slow on the uptake or otherwise indisposed, were slower - Mariana was still catching her breath when the music stopped, and hadn't noticed over the pounding in her ears, Lucy was picking herself up unhappily off the floor, and Abeera had been fiddling with her dress. Once everyone else had taken a seat, those three were left to fight over the two remaining.<br>\r\nLucy recovered first, getting to her feet and slipping under Mariana's arm before going to plant herself on a chair. A millisecond before her butt hit the wood, however, Abeera slammed into her and sent her flying. Generally the Asian girl was rather calm and submitting, but the smug look on Tamara's face had incensed her and she was determined to win. <br>\r\nLucy, suddenly airborne, was less fortunate. Without even hitting the ground, she collided with Mariana's stomach and bounced off, landing in a dazed heap near the television. Marilyn looked down at her from atop her stool at the stunned girl, the corner of her mouth twitching in silent laughter at the chaos she had wrought. In the background, Mariana grinned in victory as she placed her ponderous girth on the final chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the first round of musical chairs was concluded, and Lucy went to lick her wounds on the Disqualification Couch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the madness of round one, things calmed down somewhat. Marilyn had had her fun and began to stop the music at appropriate times, the game progressing quickly for a few more rounds. The next person to go out after Lucy was, surprisingly, Lisa. Everyone had been expected Mariana to be out next, but her extra weight was actually coming in handy for once. Both her and Lisa had collided going for the same chair, and the lighter girl had come of worse, being knocked almost off her feet by the impact. <br>\r\nIn fact, Mariana was the unexpected leader for several rounds. Although she was the slowest there, she used her ridiculous size as a weapon to bludgeon her way to victory, ousting Rebecca, Emma, Sarah and Veronica by merit of simple Newtonian physics. Each had a close encounter with the floor as one by one they were literally bounced from the circle.<br>\r\nNow only Annie, Cindy, Abeera, Mariana and Tamara were left in the competition, 5 girls fighting over 4 chairs. The others watched excitably from the Disqualification Couch, bruises already forgotten. With the click of a button the music started up once more and the five began to circle four, a wobbling parade of sweaty flesh. Mariana was in the worst shape; she was so lazy she didn't even leave the classroom at lunchtime on school days, preferring to stay in her seat from arriving in the morning to leaving in the afternoon. As a result she was horrendously out of shape, and even this slow shamble left her exhausted and gleaming with sweat. Cindy, although similarly unfit, was faring slightly better; she had been lucky with her seat choices, and had made it thus far almost unopposed.<br>\r\nThere was a sudden intake of breath from the observers as suddenly the music stopped, and the five remaining contenders went to grab their seats. Annie and Abeera were the first down, quickly followed by Tamara who slipped around Cindy and into safety. That left Mariana and Cindy aiming for the same chair, a situation that could only end badly. <br>\r\nMariana, already tired from the previous rounds, was slightly slower, and Cindy managed to edge past her and onto the seat. She began to smile, pleased with herself. Mariana however, eyes dimmed by sweat and diabetes, didn't even notice the other girl and continued on her trajectory. Before Cindy could so much as squeak in protest, the larger girl's titanic rear came down on her bare legs with a meaty slap, and she felt a distinct sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as the chair splintered beneath them and they both slammed down onto the floor.</span></div></div>",

Everyone agreed that as Cindy had touched down first, Mariana should be out - neither girl, however, was particularly interested in continuing. Cindy in particular was feeling quite disgruntled that she'd been flattened twice in one day, first by Annie when they'd done the decorations and now by the much heavier Mariana. She was beginning to feel rather sick what with all these blows to the midsection, and would much prefer to sit on the couch and sullenly eat donuts than participate any longer. Mariana on the other hand was still wheezing and coughing on the other couch, occasionally reaching down to massage her bruised buttocks. Cindy was far from a pillow despite her layers of flab, and Mariana was already regretting her lack of observation skills.<br>\r\nAfter the casualties of war had been taken care of, the wreckage of the fourth chair was removed as well as one more, and Annie, Abeera and Tamara took up their places around the two remaining. Abeera and Tamara glared at each other, both determined to win. Annie, meanwhile, was just pleased that the party was going pretty well so far. She wasn't particularly bothered whether she won or not.<br>\r\nThe music began to play again and they all circled around, but there could only be one result that wouldn't preclude a dramatic conclusion, and the second the music turned off, Annie found herself left high and dry. Abeera shrugged at her apologetically - even though it was Annie's party, Abeera refused to lose to Tamara.<br>\r\nTamara, however, called for a short break before the final round. Smiling, she offered Abeera a plate of cookies to eat, before hurrying off to whisper something to Emma. Then, she headed over to chat quietly with Marilyn as everyone else took bottles of pop to drink.<br>\r\nSoon, Abeera finished the plate of cookies and Tamara hurried back over. The Asian girl wiped the crumbs from her face, then glared at Tamara.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna beat you.\" She declared. \"Your money won't help now.\"<br>\r\nTamara merely raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're doing insults now?\" She asked sardonically. \"I think I have some prepared if that's what you want. Most of them revolve around the frankly revolting size of your rear though, so I'd prefer to abstain.\"<br>\r\nAbeera coloured. She hadn't understood much of Tamara's sentence, but she could guess accurately enough - even among the oversized residents of Collford, her butt was quite exceptional.<br>\r\nBefore she could think of a counterattack, however, Marilyn started the music and they both lurched into action. <br>\r\nThe two girls were quite equal in terms of fitness - however, Abeera was heavier by a reasonable margin, and had a distinctive waddle from her massive thighs. However, she had the fire of determination on her side - it was going to be close.<br>\r\nThey circled the chair, each keeping one eye on Marilyn, the other on their opponent as they readied themselves for the second that would decide everything. Abeera was already beginning to tire, sweat staining the strained fabric of her dress and blurring her vision. She wiped a pudgy hand across her forehead, gasping for breath as the music droned on and on. Her inner thighs were chafing with every step she took, the flesh rubbed raw by the unaccustomed friction of skin on skin. What was Marilyn waiting for?<br>\r\nAnd then, she faltered. Her foot caught on something on the floor and she stumbled hastily forwards, and at the same time she was aware of someone shouting.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Abeera. Catch!\" managing to get her balance, Abeera glanced up - just in time to see Emma's hat come sailing towards her. Halfheartedly she attempted to dodge, but she was far too tired - the hat caught her square in the face and she sat down suddenly on the carpet, feeling rather overwhelmed. A moment later, the music stopped and Tamara sat down neatly in the final chair, the smile on her face intolerably smug.</span></div></div>",

She was still thoroughly out of breath, pulse pounding in her ears and sweat pouring down her face, but she was too angry to rest.<br>\r\n\"You cheated!\" She exclaimed, pointing accusingly at Tamara. \"That was cheating! I know it!\" face flushed with fury and exhaustion, she blinked rapidly as sweat ran into her eyes. \"I saw you talk to Emma and Marilyn. That's not fair!\"<br>\r\nTamara adopted a look of innocent surprise.<br>\r\n\"Who, me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Abeera said. Emma was looking somewhat abashed on the couch, so she glared at her too. \"It's not fair to cheat. I would've won that round otherwise.\" <br>\r\nTamara snorted derisively.<br>\r\n\"Sure you would have. I guess that's why you were already falling over when Emma threw a hat at you. It was all part of some master plan where you were going to win, right?\" The rich girl said sarcastically. As far as she was concerned, a bit of minor cheating was necessary to get ahead in life.<br>\r\nAbeera fumed, stepping angrily towards Tamara, and Annie frowned worriedly; her friend was peaceful by nature, but hated unfairness. Luckily, before she had to step in an excuse appeared in the form of the ringing doorbell.<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" Annie announced unnecessarily, getting up and waddling hurriedly out of the room before anything happened. She wasn't very good at controlling Abeera when she got into this sort of mood, and any reason to avoid trying was worth it in her books.<br>\r\nNot that she read books, of course; she preferred computer games and watching TV herself. Collford actually did have a library, but it was more of a video rental store crossed with a sit-in cinema than anything, and few of the kids ever bothered reading outside of school. TV was much more entertaining, and didn't require turning pages.<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again and she sped up as best she could, puffing along the infuriating distance between the sitting room and the front door.<br>\r\n\"One... one minute!\" She managed to shout. Who was arriving so late?<br>\r\nShe finally reached the door and pulled it open, and immediately her face broke into a wide grin as she saw who it was.<br>\r\n\"Ella! I thought you weren't gonna come.\"<br>\r\nOutside the door was another of Annie's classmates, Ella. She was a fair-faced, blonde-haired girl who held the dubious honour of being the fattest girl in the year by a significant margin - and she really was huge. Her body was vast, great folds and rolls of soft flab obscuring any hint of a normal child's body within their sweaty corpulence. Any glint of form, any sharp line or hint of bone beneath the surface, all were lost in the heavy drapes of obesity.<br>\r\n\"Hi Annie!\" The massive girl managed, shifting uncomfortably just outside the door. \"Can I come inside? My ankles are hurting real bad.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure.\" Annie moved aside, and another girl stepped out from where she'd been hidden behind Ella's corpulence. The new girl smiled at Annie as she helped Ella through the door.<br>\r\n\"Hello Annie!\" She said brightly, supporting some of her friend's massive weight as they entered the house. Ella almost stumbled on the doorframe as they did so, but managed to save it at the last minute.<br>\r\n\"Hey Lavender.\" Annie said, happily accepting the present that was thrust hurriedly into her hands. \"Why're you two late?\"<br>\r\n\"We had some trouble with the car.\" Lavender said, as she helped Ella take off her shoes. The massive girl hadn't so much as seen her feet in as long as she could remember, never mind being able to tie her laces. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ella agreed, leaning heavily against the wall as she waited for Lavender to finish with her shoes, \"I got sorta stuck.\" She giggled absently, a sound that seemed quite out of place emitting from such a body as hers. A hearty chuckle seemed more appropriate, but Ella was not the sort of person to chuckle. She was rather girly and sweet, na\u00efve in the extreme and more than a little dim. Most who met her found her terrifically adorable, and as such she had been pampered heavily by family and townsfolk alike. Unsurprisingly, she got on well with Annie.<br>\r\nLavender, by comparison, was far less straightforward - although quite heavy by the standards of the rest of the world, she was actually one of the slimmest girls in their school. Despite the soft bulge of her belly and a noticeably rounded rear, the only girl smaller than her was Marilyn - who was also the only one in their year to not be medically obese.<br>\r\nShe was fast friends with Ella, and had been since the two were only a few months old. At some point around the age of 5 or 6, she had assigned herself the role of carer to the oversized girl, and nowadays spent almost every waking minute looking after her. Every morning she'd walk the twenty feet across the road to Ella's house to serve her breakfast and help her get dressed, then proceeded to wait on her until that night when she'd put the bigger girl to bed and then return home herself. It seemed a dull life, especially in the holidays when there was no school to get them out the house at all - Ella was, however, far too large to manage on her own, and Lavender didn't seem to mind too much.<br>\r\nSoon, Ella's shoes were off and they all headed together towards the sitting room. It was slow going - even with Lavender supporting some of her bigger friend's weight, the best they could manage was a laboriously slow waddle, each step a trial. By the time the three reached the door to the sitting room, even Annie - a slow walker at the best of times - was getting impatient. Eventually however, she pushed open the door and led Ella and Lavender inside. <br>\r\nIt seemed the argument from earlier had cleared itself up, more or less. Tamara was sitting on one couch, Abeera on the other, each glaring pointedly in different directions. That was fine by Annie though - she knew neither would be able to summon the energy to actually get up off their butts again for a good while, so it looked like peace would reign until then. A moment later, Ella maneuvered her way into the room, a chorus of greetings meeting her.  She was popular among the group, if only because she had never given anyone a reason to dislike her.<br>\r\n\"Hi guys!\" She said, smiling inanely and waving with some difficulty. \"Um, is there anywhere I can sit down?\" <br>\r\nAnnie cast her eye around the room. Ella had a point; the couches were all full, and the bulky girl could never squeeze her girth into one of the armchairs. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Swallowing and bracing herself, she took the first laborious step, taking in a deep breath as she grasped the rail with a pudgy hand. Slowly, she made her way up the stairs, each thudding stomp sending a cascade of wobbles through her round little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made it to the top, and leaned against the wall to huff and pant, wiping the sweat off her wet brow and getting her breath back. Once she'd moderately composed herself, she continued the trek to her bedroom.<br>\r\nIn there, she spotted one of her beanbag chairs on the floor. It looked to be just about as wide as Ella, so it would be perfect!<br>\r\nGrabbing it in both hands, she held it up and began the careful journey back to the party, taking the stairs one step at a time since she could see even less when she looked down with this beanbag pressed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it back down safely and waddled back to the living room. \"Here Ella, use this!\"<br>\r\nShe plopped the beanbag down next to a sofa, and offered the humongous girl a smile, which was promptly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Annie,\" Ella giggled, which sent a few ripples through her enormous form, \"You didn't have to do that for me!\"<br>\r\nWith Lavender's assistance, she plodded over to the beanbag, and with Annie's added assistance, carefully settled her gargantuan behind down on the beanbag, causing it to spread out a great deal, but it was just enough for her. Lavender, meanwhile, gleefully settled herself between her best friend's legs, leaning against the enormous quivering mass that was Ella's tummy.</span></div></div>",

They had also guzzled their way through six or seven liters of various sodas. \"Alright, alright, hold your horses,\"  Annie wheezed, \"I just have to catch my breath.\" \"But Annnnnie...\" Abeera whined, \"we're hungry!\" \"Fine, fine,\" Annie grumbled, hauling herself laboriously off of the couch.

Mariana squealed with fright and flailed her legs as much as she could, accidentally kicking Cindy off the couch. Cindy, half-asleep and caught by surprise, swung a flabby fist at the nearest thing, which was unfortunately Tamara. Tamara, surprised and angry, responded in kind, and soon they were engaged in a very jiggly and very slow fight.

All the girls knew the cold claws of hunger all to well, and especially considering Ella's massiveness they wanted to make her feel as comfortable as she could. Annie raised herself off the ground and waddled quickly to the kitchen for food. She loaded herself down with chips, cookies, and even a container of heavy cream raided from the fridge, and then waddled significantly slower back to the the ravenous Ella.  But as she waddled closer, the load seemed even heavier, and she was afraid she was going to drop it. \"Hey, guys? Can I have a hand here?\" she called at the group. A number of the lighter girls sprung into action, bringing boxes and bags back to Ella, who immediately began devouring the food. Despite their empathy, the smaller girls also started indulging, and soon the party was back to normal, with laughter, fun, and food all over the room. Luckily, little Lavender was on food run duty, ensuring the larger girls didn't have to expend any more calories than necessary.

She felt ill just at the thought of how much food those girls were eating \u2013 and so slobbishly! She was no prude, but they seemed far more concerned with stuffing as much junk down their throats than anything else. It was disgusting!<br>\r\nSoon though \u2013 soon she\u2019d get her own back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying around to the back of the house and into the yard, she found the pi\u00f1ata already hanging from a tree branch a few feet off the ground. With any luck, the sleeping pills she\u2019d embedded in every third chocolate would perform their magic \u2013 provided the girls actually got round to using the thing at some point. She was beginning to wonder if they weren\u2019t just going to eat themselves to death in the sitting room \u2013 perhaps she should go remind them? It was getting late, the sun dipping down towards the horizon. There were still a couple hours of sunlight yet, but the heat remained as intense as ever. <br>\r\nDue to her lack of insulating flab, Madison was one of the few people who could actually go out in the sun without collapsing with heatstroke. This gave her a few hours in the middle of the day to savour \u2013 hours in which she didn\u2019t have to put up with her disgusting sister or the bullies at school. <br>\r\nStill \u2013 it would be better for the party guests to do the pi\u00f1ata sooner rather than later, despite the heat. With a long sigh, Madison headed inside to remind them about it. Her sister wasn\u2019t known for being organised, after all \u2013 she\u2019d no doubt forget all about it if she wasn\u2019t prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the girls were still making impressive headway through the piles of food. Although some of them were beginning to feel some discomfort, the majority were still going strong, packing away incredible quantities of food considering their age. Each girl had long since lost their gag reflex, and beneath thick layers of fat and flabby muscle their stomachs were grotesquely stretched from consistent overeating. They did have limits - they were only human after all - but each could down several times what a child their age should be able to, and a bit more on top of that.<br>\r\nBy the time Madison walked in, Ella had managed to get hold of the carton of double cream and was chugging it, gulping down the unhealthy liquid as eagerly as an addict. Every swallow it overflowed from her mouth, pouring in thick rivulets down her chins before getting lost in the sweaty folds of her chest and belly. The majority though made its way through her mouth and down her throat, to wreak more damage on her figure once digested and turned to fat. Occasionally, Lavender would reach back and dab ineffectively at her overgrown friend's chin with a stained handkerchief, before returning to her own bag of cookies. The devoted girl was dwarfed by Ella\u2019s elephantine form, appearing practically slender by comparison \u2013 though the fleshy bulge of her midsection showed she was no stranger to overindulgence herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did all she did to conceal her revulsion, but she couldn\u2019t prevent her nose from wrinkling in disgust as she pushed open the door to the sitting room and saw the intemperate chaos within. It was surprisingly quiet, everyone\u2019s mouths too full of food for conversation. The only sounds were those of crinkling packets, the munching of food, and the occasional immoderate belch. <br>\r\nTrying not to breathe too deeply, for the very air seemed loaded with sugar in that room, Madison attempted to get the group\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Not one girl so much as glanced up. \u201cHey. Annie!\u201d Finally, Madison\u2019s sister snapped out of her food induced daze and looked over, cookie halfway to her mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cWha?\u201d She mumbled, spraying crumbs across the sofa.<br>\r\n\u201cI - uh \u2013 just remember you\u2019ve gotta do the pi\u00f1ata soon, before it gets dark.\u201d She reminded her, forcing herself to meet her sister\u2019s eyes. The younger girl was a mess, smears of chocolate all around her mouth and on her dress, the taut skin of her exposed belly as round and shiny as a full moon. She was out of breath from eating so quickly, the flabby mounds of her chest rising and falling in time with the hand that delivered more food to her mouth.<br>\r\nWith difficulty, Annie swallowed down her mouthful of cookies, throat feeling rather dry. She glanced over enviously at where Ella was still chugging down double cream, but then turned back to her sister.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah. I guess we\u2019ll do it once we\u2019ve-\u201d She paused to catch her breath \u201c- once we\u2019ve done eating.\u201d She quickly stuffed the cookie in her hand into her aching mouth while she waited for Madison to reply, before reaching for another and finding that they were all gone. \u201cUh, actually,\u201d She interrupted Madison as she was about to speak, \u201ccould you go grab us some more snacks? And some more drinks? We\u2019re running out.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With only a few meagre hours lead on his pursuers, he had begged for the townsfolk to hide him from the corrupt sheriffs chasing him and, touched by his pleas, they had obliged. However, they were good, honest people; they had no secret spaces or smuggling compartments in all the town, and as the dust from galloping horses became visible in the horizon, it had seemed all was lost for the brave bandit. Moments before the sherrifs arrived, however, the young daughter of the town's mayor had an idea - to hide him inside one of the stuffed animal toys she had received for her birthday, which was that very day.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the plan didn't work. The sherrifs were not fools; upon their arrival they quickly deduced the bandit's location and, without even letting him leave his hiding place, beat him to death with their horsewhips. Despite this failure though, the myth have birth to a rather fun tradition - every birthday of a young Collford girl has, since that day, featured a pi\u00f1ata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk from the sitting room out into the back yard, while short, still took the girls several minutes. Stupendously unfit at the best of times, they were now also weighed down by the almost painful amounts of food each girl had forced into their beleaguered stomachs. Ella was especially slow - even with Lavender's support, each step was a struggle, her vast thighs forcing her into an exaggerated waddle. She'd already walked far more than usual - often at the weekends she'd never even leave her bed, except for when Lavender helped her to the toilet. Her muscles, wasted and decrepit from a decade of neglect, were crying out in complaint at this new ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, the fleshy, wobbling procession made its way into the back yard, and they all crowded around the pi\u00f1ata. <br>\r\n\"Who's going first?\" Asked Madison, surveying the group. She held the multicoloured stick in her hand.<br>\r\n\"Me!\" Annie said, snatching it from her sister's hand. \"It's my birthday, I go first!\" <br>\r\nMadison did her best not to sneer.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Stand still then.\" She took the blindfold out of her pocket and secured it tightly around the younger girl's head, then pushed her in the vague direction of the pi\u00f1ata. \"There you go. One swing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Annie raised the stick into the air, trying to sense the animal through sheer force of concentration. Left a bit... right a bit... there! She brought down the stick with all of her (decidedly unimpressive) strength, but hit nothing but air. Overbalancing, she toppled forwards, landing with a yelp on her swollen gut.<br>\r\nBehind her, Marilyn put her head in her hands. How had Annie managed to knock herself over just waving a stick around?! She kicked her sister in the side, the toe of her shoe sinking into the younger girl's flabby love handles.<br>\r\n\"Get up.\" She snapped, pulling away the blindfold and stick. As Annie picked herself up, with a helping hand from Abeera, Marilyn looked around the group. Who should go next? She thought the pi\u00f1ata could probably survive a few hits, so if Annie's performance just then was anything to go by this was going to take some time. <br>\r\nHow about...</span></div></div>",

Madison squinted at the girl\u2019s shirt \u2013 was the image from some cartoon? It was hard to tell \u2013 the garment looked to have been designed for a relatively slim kid, and the design was stretched beyond recognition over the girl\u2019s meaty midsection.<br>\r\n\u201cStand still already!\u201d Madison had moved over to tie the blindfold over Sarah\u2019s eyes, but the excitable girl was practically vibrating in anticipation. With an effort, she stood still long enough for the teenager to secure the blindfold over her eyes, before trotting forward to take her swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s shot was the best yet, hitting the pi\u00f1ata dead centre. Unfortunately, she was even weaker than Annie or Lisa \u2013 spending an average of 70 hours a week watching TV will do that to a girl \u2013 and despite using all her strength, she only knocked a tiny hole in the model horse\u2019s side. A single \u00e9clair slipped out the gap, but before she could so much as take off the blindfold Lavender had scampered forwards and snatched it up, delivering it loyally straight to Ella. The big girl had long since run out of energy to stand and was now slumped against the wall, gasping in the heat.<br>\r\n\u201cI hit it! I hit it!\u201d Exclaimed Sarah, tearing the blindfold away from her eyes excitedly. \u201cAww\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou knocked one out.\u201d Madison said, feeling kinda sorry for the bubbly girl. \u201cBut Goliath over there\u2019s eating it.\u201d She gestured. <br>\r\nSarah looked over just in time to see her \u00e9clair disappearing into Ella\u2019s ravenous gullet, vanishing beyond the reach of any man. She pouted, looking upset. <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty for all of you later, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Madison reassured her awkwardly. \u201cNot that you need it\u2026\u201d She mumbled, watching the girl\u2019s abundant rear jiggle within her sweat shorts as she wandered back to the group. She didn\u2019t know where these girls bought their clothes, but the stitching was a marvel of modern science \u2013 it seemed to have the tensile strength of spider silk. She was sure she could see flashes of the girl\u2019s panties between each stitch, they were strained so far apart \u2013 bright pink, unless she was very much mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around again.<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants a go next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This one, of all her sister\u2019s friends, she felt was most respectable. Her dress, whilst rather too snug about the middle, was neat and free of stains, and she held herself neatly and upright. Whereas some of the others seemed to be weighed down by their bloated forms, Tamara stood quite straight.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure. There you go.\u201d Madison fastened the blindfold around the younger girl\u2019s head, than shoved the bat into her sweaty hands. \u201c\u2019ts that way.\u201d She shoved her in the vague direction of the pi\u00f1ata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara adopted a position like a baseballer, almost knocking Lucy's glasses off as she brought the stick up and ready to swing. While still horrifically unfit by the standards of the rest of the world, Tamara was at least more muscular than Annie or Sarah, and so when she eventually did go to strike, the bat whistled through the air with some speed.<br>\r\nIt caught the pi\u00f1ata right at the end of its arc, setting the flimsy horse into a wild spin around its tether. Candy spewed from its ruptured belly, showering the guests with spiked treats, and there was a brief scramble as each girl tried to grab as much as she could and stuff it into their mouth.<br>\r\nBy the time Tamara managed to get off her blindfold, the majority of her spoils had already been scooped up by the other girls, the nauseating quantities of food they had already consumed forgotten in the face of this new opportunity. Veronica in particular was choking on at least a dozen fudges, which had melted in her bulging mouth. Half the viscous liquid, it seemed, she had managed to inhale - the other half now stained her purple top. How these girls had still not mastered the art of eating, after doing so damn much of it, Madison didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara glared around at the group, in particular at the full mouths each of them now possessed. They all put on their best innocent expressions, however, and thus Tamara was left to collect up the dozen or so candies still scattered on the ground, before giving up the stick and blindfold to Madison. <br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, guys.\" She said, putting plump hands on her plumper hips, scowling accusingly. \"I know there were more than this...\"<br>\r\nLisa swallowed with some difficulty, almost choking with the effort.<br>\r\n\"N-no, Tamara. That was all there was!\" She tried, smiling sweetly. The effect was somewhat ruined, however, by the chocolate stains around her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Sure...\" The rich girl said begrudgingly. She had won musical chairs after all - and there'd be candy enough for everyone once the pi\u00f1ata burst for real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Abeera was beginning to feel distinctly uncomfortable. Her skin was several shades darker than most of her peers, their already white pigmentation made pasty by a decade of lurking indoors. That, along with the muted colours of her dress, were combining to make her feel like she was trapped inside an oven - a moist, sweaty oven made of thick slabs of flab. <br>\r\nLeaning lethargically against the yard wall, she grimaced as she felt perspiration trickle its way down her bulging side. She tugged at the neckline of her dress, pulling the clingy fabric briefly away from her hot skin, but the moment she let go it snapped back into position. She\u2019d owned this dress for years now, and she occasionally wondered if she wasn\u2019t outgrowing it a little \u2013 it was incredibly tight, stretched to transparency across her wide hips and bulging waist, and now it was clammy with sweat the effect was only amplified. Every bump and bulge of her developing body was as visible through the fabric as if she\u2019d been wearing cling film, and the hem was barely long enough to cover so much as her panties, never mind the meaty expanse of her thighs.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s next then?\u201d Abeera heard Madison ask, through her heat-daze, and blearily she peeled herself away from the wall, her prodigious buttocks leaving two half-moon damp patches on the dry bricks.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go next.\u201d She mumbled, just wanting to get it over with, but Madison didn\u2019t hear her. Before she could repeat herself though, someone else had stepped forwards from the crowd to take their turn instead, and Abeera was left to wait longer. She let herself fall back against the wall and slide down it, leaving a dark smear, until she was sitting on the dusty floor. Luckily for her, she had a thick cushion already built into her backside, and she watched from there as the next person stepped up to take their go. <br>\r\nIt was\u2026</span></div></div>",

She'd even managed to sneak some of Tamara's loot, as apparent by the tiny stain of chocolate on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some encouraging mutters from Sarah, she plodded forward, with Madison getting a look at her. She at least tolerated the tiny (in comparison to the other girls) gamer, since she was quiet and seemed nice enough. The large shirt seemed to hide just how large she truly was, at least a bit, since her round belly and pear shaped midsection were still prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hold still,\" Madison said, tying the blindfold around her face and handing her the bat, \"Right there...little nerd.\" She added under her breath, as she gently shoved Lucy toward the pi\u00f1ata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy swallowed and let out a tiny, nervous whimper as she gripped the bat and tried feeling for the pi\u00f1ata.

To even stand, the giant girl had needed help, so exhausted from the walk into the backyard was she. Unable to rise under her own power, Lavender had to help her up, supporting the far larger girl's every movement as she heaved her bulk off the ground and slowly moved towards the pi\u00f1ata. The sheer vastness of her thighs forced her into an obscene waddle, stubby feet tracing half-circles every step, the pounds of fat that weighed down her body jiggling to and fro. Although her shirt extended down to her waist, her paunch sagged far below that - were she naked from the waist down, her privates would be no more visible than if she were wearing clothes. <br>\r\nEventually they reached Madison, and Lavender took the bat from the teen's hands and pushed it into her friend's. Both girls were looking nauseous - Ella from the strain of basic locomotion, Madison from sheer revulsion at the monster before her. As far as the skinny teen was concerned, this was the lowest form humanity could manifest. From the cultures that sprang up between the moist folds of her flab, to the dried food that encrusted her chin and upper chest, to her Ella was truly repugnant.<br>\r\nOf course - her friends saw differently. To them, weight was a non-entity, something thoroughly unimportant to life. Whilst they were aware their friend was essentially disabled, they were unable to connect that with the morbidity of her form. Had she been born with crippled legs, they would have viewed her in exactly the same way - an unfortunate victim of life's cruel tricks. As surely as they knew they would grow taller in the future, they knew they would become softer and weaker. That was just how it went - what you ate, and how much, had nothing to do with it. Many of them hadn't even grasped the concept that it was the extra weight that made exercise more difficult in the first place, instead assuming it was just sheer coincidence that the largest of them had the greatest trouble with everyday tasks.<br>\r\nBasic education in Collford, it seemed, was rather poor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha-thanks.\" Gasped out Ella as she took the stick, barely able to speak - though she still managed a breathy giggle. She let Lavender blindfold her, legs bowing outwards as they were forced to take the full weight of her bloated torso for a brief few moments, before the helpful smaller girl returned to lead her towards the pi\u00f1ata.<br>\r\n\"Stop, Ellie.\" Said Lavender, before helping the big girl line up a shot - slowly, she heaved the stick into the air, then over her head, thick arms wobbling fleshily with the strenuous effort. There was a moments pause before Lavender reached up and corrected the angle, then stood back.<br>\r\n\"Can - can I hit it now, Lav?\" The far larger girl wheezed, bat shuddering violently as her arms began to shake with the effort of keeping them raised. She felt isolated and terribly vulnerable without her aide's presence at her side.\"Yep, hit it! Go!\" Lavender was bouncing up and down with excitement, a grin plastered across her round face. She had no interest in participating herself - watching Ella try was enough for her, and when finally the bat jolted into motion she let out a bright cry of excitement. <br>\r\n\"You got it! You got it!\" She rushed forwards before Ella could take off the blindfold and gave the pi\u00f1ata a solid punch, dislodging a dozen candies and making it spin. Then, she pulled the sodden blindfold away from her big friend's face and gave her a hug, arms barely reaching halfway round the massive girl's girth.<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" She grinned up at her friend's rosy face.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Ella said, looking delighted but slightly confused. \"I thought I missed!\" Indeed, the bat was lying on the floor behind her, where it had slipped from her sweaty grip just as she went to strike. Still, she wasn't about to complain; she let Lavender lead her back to the wall, stuffing handfuls of candy into her face the entire way.<br>\r\nThe rest of the group smiled blithely - none of them minded the occasional machination on the part of Lavender, if it was for Ella's sake. Even Tamara didn't take objection, as happy as the rest of them to see the vast girl satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madison gazed on in disbelief. Was no-one going to point that out? No-one? She shook her head in dismay, only the thought of the sedatives soon taking affect staying her tongue. <br>\r\n\"Who's up next?\" She asked, tone clipped and irritable. What was the point in doing this if they were going to allow cheating, she thought angrily. The word 'fun', it seemed, just didn't exist in Madison's vocabulary - perhaps understandably considering her childhood thus far.</span></div></div>",

For a start, her dress actually fit her! Albeit it was slightly snug from the before-game binge, it still complimented her hourglass shape rather nicely.<br>\r\nMadison had overheard from her sister one day that Emma tended to make her own outfits. That made sense, considering her mother was one of the state's top fashion designers. She would often tag along to her mother's modelling sessions and fashion shows, some even taking them out of the country, and developed a love for the art. <br>\r\nHer mother's extroverted attitude also rubbed off on her daughter, who had made many acquaintances while away from home. She never forgot who her true friends were, of course, hence why she was with them all at the party right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like her mother, she was a serious go-getter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tied the blindfold around Emma's face, after disgustedly wiping Ella's sweat off it onto her hoodie.<br>\r\nAs soon as Emma was handed the bat, a smirk crossed her chubby face as she approached the pi\u00f1ata. \"I got you now...!\" She snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as mighty as swing as she could muster, which once again, wasn't anything to write home about, the bat just brushed the snout of the pi\u00f1ata. Luckily, it was just enough to dislodge a few candies from the large hole in the middle.<br>\r\nImmediately, she dropped the bat and undid the blindfold, beaming at the candies. <br>\r\n\"Alright!\" She cheered, dropping the blindfold and grabbing the treats, popping one in her mouth as she plodded back to Tamara, who she shared them with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison picked up the bat and blindfold, rolling her eyes. \"Next?\"</span></div></div>",

She turned red. \u201cI, uh, I'd like a turn please.\u201d <br>\r\nMadison rolled her eyes. She didn't think much of this friend of her sister either - the younger girl's dress was immodestly tight, and her body shape was frankly ridiculous. <br>\r\n\u201cC'mon then,\u201d she held the bat out, and waited as the oversized girl struggled to her feet and waddled over. Abeera's legs were so thick that despite the impressive breadth of her hips, the brown skin of her inner thigh was still rubbed raw every step. Eventually though, she made it to Madison and took the bat.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d mumbled the fatter girl, vision blurred by heat exhaustion. <br>\r\n\u201cDon't mention it,\u201d Madison mumbled back. At least this one had manners, she thought. \u201cLemme put the blindfold on.\u201d She span the smaller (at least on the y-axis) girl around, grimacing at how far her slender fingers sank into the flabby flesh of Abeera's upper arm. Did the kid have no muscles at all? Or even bones, for that matter? It felt like manhandling jelly - sweaty, caramel-coloured jelly that had been left out in the sun too long and had started to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the blindfold was secure, Abeera was turned in the rough direction of the pi\u00f1ata and released, leaving her to sway woozily under the boiling sun. Slowly she raised the bat slowly over her head, the motion dragging up the hem of her dress and revealing her panties, crisp white cotton straining over her trembling butt as it wrestled with hips no underwear was ever meant to face. The pale fabric shone like a beacon to the other girls, and they stared in dumb wonderment as Abeera wound up to swing - this felt significant, though none of them knew why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Abeera noticed anything - so preoccupied with the pi\u00f1ata was she, that if all her clothes had burst off at once she likely would not have noticed. Madison for one would not have been at all surprised if the young girl's clothes did burst apart; stitches popped and fabric groaned as Abeera's body moved in unfamiliar ways - which were, of course, any ways that didn't involve reaching for food - and even her panties looked in imminent danger of splintering into rags. The corpulent girl had an armchair at home in which she spent almost all of her time, situated between a fridge and a cupboard. Reaching into either, it should be noted, did not require raising her arms at all, and as such the muscles needed to do so were - somehow - even weaker than those elsewhere on her body. Just holding the bat over her head was taking considerable effort, and so, when the blow eventually came, it was more due to accident than any intent on her part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms shaking, the bat had slipped from between her stubby fingers and, as she attempted to catch it again, bounced off the pi\u00f1ata's multicoloured flank.  Although the impact was slight it was enough, and the pi\u00f1ata's bloated form finally split open, disgorging a tidal wave of candy directly into Abeera's head. The big girl sat down in surprise, landing cushioned by several inches of flab, and was quickly covered with bright-wrapped treats. She struggled with the blindfold but Madison had knotted it securely and it wouldn't budge, so not wanting to be left out she began grabbing candy blindly and shoving it into her mouth, foil wrappings and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the pi\u00f1ata had burst, Madison had had to leap backwards to avoid being trampled by the girls as they all leapt forward - except Ella of course - and now she watched in unconcealed disgust as they gorged themselves. Mariana was on her hands and knees, exposed belly scraping along the rough ground as she shovelled truffles into her mouth. She didn't even seem to notice the damage though, so preoccupied was she. To Mariana's left, Rebecca and Veronica were filling both their mouths and the pockets of their sweatpants with toffee, already distended stomachs bloating more as they ignored their bodies every warning and continued sucking down food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other girls gorged, Lavender was hurrying to and fro between the pile of candy and Ella, pushing chocolates between the massive girl\u2019s feeble lips. Her eyelids fluttered weakly as she was fed, unable even to muster the energy to open them fully, but Lavender was unconcerned. These periods of exhaustion were normal, usually happening after a meal or any form of exercise - today, both had happened in a row, so Ella's state was no surprise. She\u2019d probably have to have a nap soon, to rest, but first she needed to be filled with as much candy as possible so she wouldn\u2019t go hungry as she slept.</span></div></div>",

Ella was all but asleep, stumbling on every step she took, and even Lavender was beginning to feel drowsy, so it took them a ridiculously long time just to get to the back door and stumble inside. They made it to the sitting room where the other girls were relaxing, before Ella collapsed onto her beanbag and fell immediately asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender examined her anxiously. The big girl often felt tired after a meal or exercise, but it wasn't like her to fall asleep entirely - not when there was food around at least. Then again, Lavender was starting to feel pretty tired herself. She yawned infectiously and soon all the other girls were yawning too, lying back in their seats to get more comfortable. Feeling drowsy, Lavender sat down between her friend's thick legs and relaxed against the sweaty cushion of her friend's stomach. Looking around the room, everyone else was acting similarly - Mariana was snoring loudly from an armchair, and all the others looked close to following their larger friends' leads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrearily, Lavender unwrapped a toffee and popped it into her mouth. Normally she'd give it to Ella, but right then she felt too lethargic to bother. Compared to the massive girl, Lavender barely ate anything. For every four cookies she fed her massive friend, she took perhaps one for herself - which was why she was slimmer than most of the other girls. She was still distinctly plump by the standards of the rest of the world though - her waistband struggled without much success to contain both her swollen stomach and round bottom, and two plump, pale thighs emerged from beneath the excessively short skirt she'd decided to wear that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, compared to the sagging corpulence of most of the other girls, she was in decent shape - it would not be odd to see her in a school in any large American city - and she used her relative fitness to help the much vaster Ella. Without her, Ella wouldn't even be able to lever herself to her feet, never mind walk more than a half-dozen steps. As such, they were all but inseparable.</span></div></div>",

The enormous girls dozed off onto chairs, the floor, and on their friends, and soon the whole party was fast asleep, lost in their food-encrusted dreamlands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, seeing the drugged candies in action, was pleased. <i>Good, they're falling asleep.</i> she sniggered to herself. <i>Seeing them act like this normally...

Earlier she\u2019d planned to take the biggest, but after watching Ella eat constantly and rapidly the entire evening and still not slow down, she feared there wouldn\u2019t be enough food in the house to actually cause her discomfort. <br>\r\nInstead, she went for the smallish girl that seemed to be some kind of servant to the massive one \u2013 Lavender, had her name been? \u2013 and the bubbly girl with the cartoon picture on her shirt. Sarah, she\u2019d heard her called. <br>\r\nThe former was draped floppily over one of Ella\u2019s meaty legs, the latter face down on the floor snoring loudly, and so with some difficulty Madison dragged them both to the wall and sat them against it. They were heavy, but not unmanageably so; Madison was strong for her age, and she had fiery determination on her side.<br>\r\nOnce they were in place, she hurried through to the kitchen and began scavenging through the cupboards and fridges, grabbing anything she could see. Bars of chocolate, soda, the rest of the cream Ella had been drinking earlier \u2013 anything that wasn\u2019t going to choke the unconscious eaters. When she had all she could carry, she hurried back to the sitting room and dumped it on the floor next to the girls and stood back, hands on bony hips as she surveyed the two.<br>\r\nThis was going to be <i>fun</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with Lavender. Despite giving most of her food to Ella she\u2019d still managed to stuff herself with a fair amount, and her stomach sat full and bloated beneath the thin fabric of her blouse \u2013 not full enough yet though. <br>\r\nMadison tore the lid off a carton of double cream and put it to the younger girl\u2019s mouth, tilting it to pour the thick liquid slowly down her throat. She swallowed automatically, gulping it down surprisingly fast until the carton was empty and Madison threw it aside, grabbed another one and repeated the process. Soon Lavender\u2019s stomach was bulging more than ever, straining the buttons of her blouse. <br>\r\nWith nervous hands Madison unbuttoned the tight garment, letting Lavender\u2019s overstuffed gut swell forwards. The straining, stretched skin almost glowed in the moonlit room, already looking painfully full \u2013 but Madison wasn\u2019t done yet. Almost giggling, she retrieved a stick of cooking butter from the pile of food next to her and peeled it open, and began cutting pieces off to feed to the sleeping girl. She prodded the chunks of butter between Lavender\u2019s plump lips, watching them melt inside her mouth and slide down her throat. Soon the stick was gone entirely, but Madison just picked up another. She wasn\u2019t going to stop yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral sticks of butter later though and Lavender was beginning to look rather the worse for wear. Her belly was now agonisingly distended, the waistband of her skirt brutally tight beneath the great bulge of her midsection. Every slight shift or movement made her moan in pain, and though she was still fast asleep, she clutched her aching midsection protectively with both hands. <br>\r\nReluctantly, Madison stopped. She poked the last piece of butter into Lavender\u2019s mouth, then wiped her hands clean on the young girl\u2019s blouse and stepped back. She wanted to keep going \u2013 she\u2019d been feeling a rather sadistic pleasure, more so than she\u2019d anticipated \u2013 but she was afraid she\u2019d cause some permanent damage if she continued any longer, and then she really would be in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the grotesquely overstuffed girl one last slap to the belly for good measure, causing her to topple over with a whimper and curl up into fetal position, before turning excitedly to Sarah.</span></div></div>",

Some rather alarming noises were emitting from the fat girl, and though her gag reflex was long since annihilated the teen was worried she might throw up if she was given anything more to drink.

Yeah... she deserved a bit of a stuffing, for sure! Being one of Annie's closest friends, Abeera was at the house often - and though she was quieter and slightly better-mannered than most of the others, Madison hated her nonetheless.<br>\r\nGrabbing a thick arm, she dragged Abeera off the couch (her oversized body making an amusingly loud 'splat' as she fell heavily to the floor), then sat her against the wall with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she began the stuffing, Madison took a good look at the younger girl, eyes roving over her flabby body. How? How was it possible for her hips to be... to be so damn wide? They sprang out from her sides like buttresses, supporting the bulbous cathedral of her body as the young girl ate, slept, and... well, just ate and slept really. How else could she be so grossly overweight after only a decade on the planet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison needed something special for this one. She slunk back into the kitchen and dragged open a drawer, revealing jar after jar of honey - her mom's secret stash. She grabbed half a dozen, then moved back into the other room, popping a lid off as she knelt down in front of Abeera. The heat had made the sweet substance runny, so she didn't even bother with a spoon - she just tilted the jar over the younger girls mouth and allowed a long stream of honey to pour out. For a moment, it looked like Abeera was about to choke - then she began to swallow, unconsciously gulping down honey like she had reached the Promised Land at last after forty years hard travel.<br>\r\nBefore Madison had so much as a chance to giggle maniacally, the jar was empty, just a thin string of sugar left to show it had ever been full at all - all the rest was gone, slithering down the fat girl's throat and into her already-swollen belly. Grinning happily to herself, Madison popped another lid away and carried on her feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like no time at all - and indeed, was barely five minutes - all six jars of honey had been emptied into Abeera's gaping mouth. Her face and chest were sticky from where Madison had been a bit too hasty once or twice, causing an overflow, but most of the sickly sweet liquid had made its way into the shy girl's plump, bulging body. Compared with her hips and butt, her stomach was relatively small - but it was nonetheless oversized, a bloated, bulging potbelly that strained the seams of her stained dress past any reasonable bounds, gurgling and grumbling as it sat uncomfortably on her massive thighs. Not yet finished digesting the mass of sweets and candies she had already forced into her maligned body, now over 6000 calories worth of honey were added to the mix - her poor insides struggling audibly with her ridiculous consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, however, cared little for Abeera's discomfort. Instead, she was looking at the dwindling pile of snacks she'd brought through to feed the girls. Sure, the Asian girl sounded like she might burst if she ate any more - but since when had Madison let that kinda thing stop her? It was either keep stuffing Abeera, or move on.</span></div></div>",

She was leaned against the plush armrest, using it and her thick arm as a pillow as she snored. A sight not uncommon, as she was the most unfit of the three, and had habits of nodding off when she had eaten too much. Madison was surprised she could even walk, with how absolutely lazy she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen nearly audibly showed her disgust at the sheer sight of her. The girl was definitely almost nothing but pure fat. Her apple-like body proved too much for her tank top, which was more like a bra than anything since it only covered her chest. Her jacket was discarded a while ago to make room for an extra bit of comfort. Her denim shorts, once tight and growing tighter, were showing signs of surrender. White seams were showing from being popped by pale blubber, and her thunder thighs were sticking out of the legs like a muffin in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison put her hands beneath Cindy's plump upper arms and lifter her onto the ground, unable to do more than have her lean against the chair, but the globular girl didn't stir a bit. In fact, she simply snorted a bit and scratched her nose before her snoring resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was visibly unimpressed. <i>Well, if she wants to be a fat little pig, then she needs a bit of fattening up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supply of junk food was dwindling, but there should be more than enough. A large bag of chocolate balls was her choice this time, and she ripped them open. Feeling particularly evil, she waved it in Cindy's face.<br>\r\nThe chubby girl's nose twitched as it caught the ever-so-familiar scent of chocolate, and she grinned and licked her lips in her sleep. Madison was almost amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped one of them into the girl's slightly agape mouth, and she swallowed almost instantly. Not even a single bite, which would almost be impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's mouth hung open again, as if silently asking for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother went in, and another, and another. Gulp, gulp, gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison decided it was going to slow, and just poured a larger amount in. This time the biting came, and the girl chewed in her sleep before swallowing the delicious treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the bag was emptied, but there was plenty more where that came from. One by one, each bag was emptied into the black hole that seemed to be Cindy's tummy, before the tell-tale gurgling of complete fullness was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy gave a quiet moan as her sleeping face pulled a light scowl. Her plump hands went to her belly, which was taut and bloated even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't care much about her discomfort. This was the plan, after all.</span></div></div>",

Cindy may have been the largest of the three, but even she had limits. True, if she didn't fall asleep so easily she'd probably keep eating past them anyway, but dead to the world and <i>still</i> gulping down more chocolate, she was quickly being fed far beyond them. Madison hadn't thought it'd be this easy - she'd assumed they'd stop eating once they were too stuffed and start spitting food out or something, but apparently they'd been conditioned long ago to never deny food no matter how tortured their insides became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison halted in her feeding for a minute to take a long look at the massively overweight girl. Her thighs were forced wide apart by the great bulk of her potbelly, legs sticking out on either side of her to allow its swollen bulk room to sit without agitation - a position that only put more strain on her already-ailing shorts. How they'd held  together this long in the first place was unknowable, but now the stitches were finally failing all down the sides as the thick sausages of her thighs put them through hell and high water. Even as Madison watched, Cindy shifted slightly and the seams split further, revealing yet more pale, stretch-marked blubber between them.<br>\r\nThe button of the shorts was long since gone (it had burst off several weeks ago in fact, during a movie marathon with Annie, Abeera, and a metric ton of popcorn) but Cindy hadn't yet noticed that nor the popped seams - she was not a morning person, and thus was never aware of anything in the morning, and the sheer mass of her body prevented her seeing anything while she was wearing them, so she'd just carried on wearing them until she'd finally run them into the floor today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, however, took note and shook her head in disgust. How slobbish did you need to be to not change your clothes even once they started falling to pieces? Looking around the room though, just about every single girl was wearing clothes that exhibited one type of damage or another - mostly just popped buttons and broken zippers, but split seams were common, and stains were omnipresent. Lip curled, Madison returned to stuffing Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the thick inches of flab that coated her midsection it was difficult to tell just how stuffed she was, but as Cindy began to groan and frown after every bite Madison decided she was probably reaching her absolute limit. She'd ended up eating an incredible amount, and that on top of the food she'd already stuffed herself with earlier left her ridiculously swollen and quite excruciatingly uncomfortable, arms curled around her aching belly in a futile attempt to protect it from mistreatment. Madison had one more curiosity though - taking the girl by her thick upper arms, she shook her rapidly from side to side, and giggled to hear that yes, her stomach did indeed make an amusing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stood back from the poor little girl, and her eyes flashed around the room once more. Hmm... who was to be the next victim?</span></div></div>",

The dress, albeit stained and tightened on the girl's stuffed middle, helped to sell the amusing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The little princess of pigs,</i> Madison snickered in her head. The teen had something special planned for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next food of choice was a box of expensive, rich-looking chocolates, from a professional brand. Her mother had been saving them for a special occasion, but Madison figured this was special enough. She'd never get another opportunity like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped open the box and lifted one of the candies, letting Tamara sniff at it. A grin crossed the sleeping girl's face and her tongue slid across her lips before she opened and bit at it, chewing and swallowing the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...more...\" she mumbled a demand in her sleep and dropped her jaw for another to be presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, smirking a devious smirk, planted another candy in her mouth.

A gurgle from her belly signified it was nearing dangerous levels of full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison still had plenty of treats left, though...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tamara's dress fitted perfectly. Handmade by a tailor in Nepal it effortlessly complemented her rotund figure, downplaying the round bulge of her gut whilst tastefully emphasising her breasts and voluptuous hips. The rose-coloured fabric brought out the subtlest shades in the carefully applied blusher on her cheeks, the white lace working in perfect combination with her skin tone to bring to mind the image of a graceful, budding flower standing apart from the weeds that were less privileged children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, that had been how the dress had worked precisely two months ago when she'd been fitted for it. Since then, half a million calories worth of junk food (expensive junk food certainly - but still junk) had slipped its way between her plump lips and into her body, making the sight that met Madison's eyes that day a far cry from the good intentions of the past. Her belly had swollen, the thin fabric looking in danger of splitting with every laboured breath Tamara took, taking the centre stage in a way that made her look more like an radish than a rose. Further, the sweaty activity of the party games had left it stained and messy, and with her face flushed red from both the over-heated house and the mounting discomfort in her abdomen, she was altogether nothing like the composed young lady her mother had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then, why stop now? The pig-queen might be swollen and messy now, but Madison could see room for improvement. She opened another box of chocolates - cheap, dollar store ones this time - and began stuffing the oversweetened hunks into Tamara's mouth, barely giving her time to chew. A few pieces dribbled from her mouth, half melting, and landed on her swollen belly where they were quickly smeared into the fabric by Tamara's unconsciously massaging hands. Her face twisted into a grimace - though whether from the pain of her overstuffed belly or the shame of eating bargain chocolate Madison didn't know - as her already distended belly swelled larger and larger beneath her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the inevitable happened. As Madison forced one last bar of chocolate down the rich girl's groaning throat, the red material finally gave up the good fight and split right down the middle, letting her bloated belly come surging forwards. The damage to her dress was severe - it now revealed the entirety of her pale, taught gut, and more besides  - but from the sound of Tamara's agonised moan as her belly was suddenly jostled, it was in better shape than its owner. Hastily, Madison stepped back - that was quite enough for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she looked around the room for what she knew to be the last time. Her food supply was dwindling, and she was slightly afraid she might go too far and cause some serious injury if she carried on much longer. Finally, her eyes settled on the perfect final target - her own sister. The little spoiled brat deserved it really, with her ridiculous clothes and repulsive manners. Right then, she was wearing a blue dress and tights, which sounded reasonable enough - then one saw the dress didn't even reach past her belly button it was so outgrown, and that the tights were tearing themselves to pieces just from the strain of trying to cover her thick, toneless legs. Both garments were so thin and overtaxed that Madison could easily see straight through them, and noted with resigned disappointment that get sister was wearing some immodestly tight blue and white striped panties, and no bra at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips drew back in a predatory grin - she was going to enjoy this one most of all.</span></div></div>",

Still, it\u2019d be worth the pain just to see them struggle.<br>\r\nFirst \u2013 she had the unenviable job of moving both Ella and Mariana into the bathroom. She was planning to lock them in so they\u2019d have to starve for a while, a sensation she was sure from their obscenely corpulent bodies they hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. To do that though, she had to drag them halfway across the house and up two steps \u2013 a process she was sure was going to take some time. Cracking her knuckles, she set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana was completely filling one of the room\u2019s armchairs, her astonishingly rotund form all but overflowing past the armrests on either side. The lowest roll of her oversized belly hung so far over her crotch that Madison could only trust to hope that the young girl was wearing anything under there at all. She couldn\u2019t tell by looking, and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to investigate any further than she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the morbidly obese girl under the arms (cringing as her hands slipped on sticky sweat) she managed to heave her onto the floor. Then, after wiping her fingers disdainfully on her shirt, she grabbed Mariana\u2019s hands and began dragging her towards the door. God, she was heavy! She felt like some serial killer in the night, struggling to dispose of his most recent victim \u2013 but instead of some poor prostitute with a slit throat, it was the massive body of Mariana that Madison must move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got her to the hall, the going got easier. The floor out there was tiled, and Mariana\u2019s sweaty body slid across it with surprising ease \u2013 though leaving a slug trail of crumbs, melted candy and perspiration behind her the whole way. In a surprisingly short amount of time, Madison had moved her successfully into the bathroom where she was dropped heavily to the floor without hesitation. The Hispanic girl\u2019s head clunked noisily against the tiles as she fell, and Madison swore under her breath. Damn, she\u2019d feel that when she woke up\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she just had to move Ella through \u2013 which if anything would be even harder than moving Mariana.

Her dark smirk returned as she eyed up Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the bar down for a moment, she walked back over and lifted Lavender by the arms.

Hopefully it would make a convincing substitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the bar of chocolate and returned to Ella, opening it up and holding it just out of reach. The snoozing definition of childhood obesity started twitching her nose as something sweet wafted into her sinuses.

She had shown the bloated sows the meaning of excess and then some. They would be sure to see the error of their gluttonous ways! Surely, finally, <i>she</i> would be the role model! <i>She</i> would be in the right! Her figure would be <i>inspiring,</i> not the object of derision! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost cackled, but a sudden motion on Annie's part made her reconsider. Instead, she flopped down into a small chair which only she could possibly hope to fit into and settled down to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as one often does when waiting, to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she really done the right thing? To be sure, torment was wrong, but had it been intentional? Annie surely loved her, and the rest of the girls probably didn't have a mean bone in their bodies - if one could even locate a bone beneath the many, many layers of fat - so why had she done it? Did they deserve the fate they got if they weren't even trying to be mean in the first place? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course they did!</i> she thought back viciously. <i>Even if they aren't intentionally being mean, they're still being mean! Plus they deserve to see that they're too fat. They might even slim down!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part of her mind - the logical part - gently reminded her that this was completely improbable, but she shoved that part back down to where it belonged. This was a time of victory, and she deserved to celebrate. With that happy thought, she swallowed the chocolate with a look of triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nearly jumped out of her chair. <i>Chocolate?!</i> She stared at her hands in shock. Without even thinking about it her hands had automatically unwrapped one of the chocolates from inside the pi\u00f1ata and put it into her mouth. This would be bad enough for her strict diet if it wasn't for the fact that she had drugged several of these chocolates in particular - if the one she had ate was one of the tainted ones her revenge would be entirely pointless.

If possible, Madison almost hated her worse than Ella. Mostly because, even though Ella was barely capable of movement, she was at least modest enough to wear <i>clothesl</i>, albeit clothes that you could camp in. Mariana, on the other hand, waddled  around wearing only a bathing suit- and a ludicrously small one at that, every jiggle of her enormity threatening to reveal something she'd probably rather keep hidden. In such an outfit, her belly wiggled freely, unencumbered by such torture devices as pants, and hung all the way to her knees. Her knees! Madison could barely believe the scene before her. Nevertheless, she had to keep a brave face on, and handed the exhausted (from the effort of standing and walking about six steps) Mariana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana took the bat and almost dropped it. <i>Wow</i>, she thought, <i>this is so heavy. How do people even play baseball with this?</i> The truth was, they didn't l; it was a Whiffle bat, but her muscles were so atrophied from unuse that it felt like it weighed as much as her. Nevertheless, she readied a swing, and completely missed the pi\u00f1ata. A collective \"Aww\" arose from the obese party, as they would have to wait even <i>longer</i> for their eclairs. Madison moved to take the blindfold from Mariana, but- what's this?- Mariana was missing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery was solved in a moment, however, when a thin voice called \"Help! I fell down the hill!\" Mariana had merely overbalanced on her swing and rolled softly down the hill. Unfortunately for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Annie never liked that little hill; rolling down it was fun, but climbing back up was a nightmare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Sarah were already heading down the slope before their much larger friends were able to waddle toward it. They kept their distance from the top, so to not meet the same fate as Mariana. Even Madison had wandered over, ever so slightly concerned for the portly girl's wellbeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smallest girls of the group proceeded to lift the second-fattest member into a sitting position.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Mari?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Mariana muttered, back to her quiet self again, then aloofly looked under her flabby arm, \"think my swimsuit's broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thinner girls looked, and sure enough, somehow the strap holding the chest piece of the swimsuit had snapped, and it was just barely holding on!<br>\r\n\"Oh man, she's not kidding,\" Sarah muttered, biting her lip, \"Whadda we do now?!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have an idea,\" Lisa perked up, and climbed back up the hill (with some considerable effort) to let the other girls know of the situation. Their reactions were that of concern and surprise, whereas Madison's was of stifled amusement and a hint of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" Annie perked up, her chubby cheeks dimpling from a proud smile, \"She can borrow one of my shirts! I'm sure it'll fit!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, good call,\" Lisa chirped, grinning back and starting a brisk walk to the house, \"I know where your room is, be back in a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curly-haired girl entered the house, and after a few moments to catch her breath on the stairs, arrived at Annie's...rather messy room. Clothes and wrappers everywhere!<br>\r\nShrugging and thinking nothing of it, she opened the drawer and looked through her friend's clothes. Unfortunately, the drawer tended to be stuffed with shirts that Annie had outgrown, and therefore had no use for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, luck shone through as she lifted a large, pink shirt from the drawer, with a picture of some cute cats on it. It looked perfectly Annie-sized, so it should fit Mariana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, relatively, rushed back downstairs and out to the back, to see Mariana had rejoined the group, and was calmly saying she was okay to her concerned friends while Sarah was busy trying to reattach the strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Mari,\" Lisa said, holding out the shirt, \"Try this one on!\"<br>\r\nThe rotund girl took the shirt and pulled it over her head. Annie wore a look of realisation, as if she'd just remembered she had that shirt.</span></div></div>",

Gurgles and groans of full stomachs could be heard as they were being lovingly rubbed by their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was so much food!\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't believe I ate so much. But I just couldn't stop! It was all so good\" Abeera said as her belly gurgled beneath her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was so much fun, you guys. We should do this again\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe you could ask your mom if we could have a sleep over next weekend\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. I'll ask her right now\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her weight and dislodged herself from between her friends. She slid herself off the couch and onto her feet. All the movement jostled her round belly as it gurgled and churned at the movement. It was not happy being jiggled around with a full load. It would much rather prefer to digest in peace and have every single calorie go into the pregnant looking ball of fat that was her stomach and have it grow bigger and hungrier. Annie gave it a loving rub as an apology and made her way carefully to her mother. She was in the kitchen, massaging her own ball of fat on her abdomen. She had just finished her diner and was doing some paper work while rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom\" Annie started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Julie asked as she looked up from her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if Cindy and Abeera could come over for a sleep over next weekend\" Annie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd have to call their parents, but I'm fine with it if they are\" Julie said. \"I'll give them a call right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie smiled and waddled back over to Cindy and Abeera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did she say?\" Abeera asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that it's okay as long as it's cool with your parents\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of conversing, Julie came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I just got off the phone with your guys' parents and they said that you two can have a sleep over next weekend. They also said that they want you home, it's getting late\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww\" Cindy and Abeera said. They were both having such a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got up and said their goodbyes and walked home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Annie. It's getting late. You should take a bath and get ready for bed. You have school tomorrow\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Annie groaned as she got off the couch and into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got into the bathroom, she locked the door and took her ill fitting clothes off. She started to fill up the bath tube and noticed that her belly seemed bigger when she looked in the mirror. She gave it a pat. She always liked the feeling of knowing that her belly grew bigger. She almost took pride in knowing her belly got bigger. It was the most greedy part of her body by far. Refusing to give up any calories to anywhere else except those that were required for her to grow taller. Everything else stayed in the big, firm belly she sported. Not that she minded. In fact she preferred it that way. No one else in town had a body shape like hers. It made her feel unique. Every one knew it was her if they saw her coming. She snapped out of her trance and slipped into the tub. When she got in, her belly stuck out of the water like a big island. She giggled to herself as she washed up, making sure to get it nice and clean, even playing with it for a while. Eventually, she got out and dried off. She went to her room and changed into her pink pajamas. They were the biggest size she owned and even they were very small. She slid the bottoms easily up to her waist before hitting a snag that was her belly. There was no way she'd get them any further so she left them under her belly. She then put the top on. Her arms went in fine and the buttons around her chest were easy enough, but the ones around her belly had no chance. Her belly refused to be contained by the fabric, so she left the buttons undone. She fell back on her bed and as soon as her head hit the pillow, she was lights out.</span></div></div>",

It let out another loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be hungry? You were just fed!\" Annie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly let out another growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!

She went to the freezer and pulled out a gallon of ice cream. She then went to the fridge and got herself a gallon of milk. She began to chow down on it all with gusto. She finished the cookies with ease. Her belly had swelled a little bit and she gave it a loving rub before turning her attention to the ice cream. The first half went by fast, but she started to slow down at half way. Her belly felt very full and had expanded even more. However, she forced herself to continue. When she finished it, she drank almost half of the milk in the carton. When she felt full to bursting she set the carton down and rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you happy now you greedy thing?\" she asked her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gurgled its content as if to answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" she said as she got up and put the carton back in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleaned up and went back into her room.

It was time for her to get up and get ready for school. She kicked off the covers and jumped out of bed, causing her large belly to jiggle. She walked over to her dresser and put on a pair of shorts and a tank top that only covered her chest. Suddenly her belly let loose a growl of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, are you hungry?\" she asked her belly with a smile. \"Let's see what mommy's making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walked out of her room and downstairs into the kitchen where she saw her mother making a large batch of pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning Annie\" her mother said. \"I thought you'd be hungry so I made you a lot of pancakes.

It had a sleek but very homely charm to it, the staff were all plump and very enthusiastic, and the heavy customers chatted contently while they enjoyed their food. Maddie loved the atmosphere and her jaw almost dropped when she saw their more than extensive menu. It had almost every type of fast food that a customer could possibly want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like sweetie?\" He mom asked, snapping Maddie out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie paused for a long moment as she tried to decide.\"Can I have a bacon burger and a chocolate shake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a medium bacon burger, a side of garlic bread and a side of onion rings, and a large chocolate shake,\" her mom told the cashier, \"and I'll have the triple deluxe burger, two sides of mozarella sticks and one side of onion rings, with an extra large strawberry shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie was surprised how eager her mom was to spoil her, there was no way she would have ordered a medium burger and two sides for Maddie before. That was an amount more suited to someone twice Maddie's size and she didn't even ask for it all.<br>\r\nIt also seemed as though Lucy was splashing out on herself a little as well, a triple deluxe burger and all those sides was seriously heavy-duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meal arrived Maddie was very keen to see how she liked proper fast food. The moment she bit into her bacon burger she felt like she was in heaven, the bacon and beef combo was divine. The crispness of the bacon perfectly complemented the wonderful softness of the burger. While she ate politely, she started to devour the burger greedily, as if an angel of gluttony was leading her actions. Why hadn't she eaten fast food more often?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're enjoying that.\" Her mother laughed invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie could only nod. She consumed about half the burger before she started to slow down, and started her sides. She alternated between the thick garlic bread and greasy onion rings for a while (with a few of Lucy's mozzarella sticks) before going back to the burger. Lucy was pleased at her daughter's appetite.<br>\r\nWith only a quarter of the burger left Lucy definitively declared she was full. It was strange feeling the weight hanging on her tummy, which was bloated and pressed tightly against her t-shirt. It wasn't an unpleasant feeling however, and Maddie admitted to herself she could easily get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed, baby, but I think you can finish that burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom's encouragement gave Maddie a new-found determination, she downed the rich chocolate shake in one and she kept pushing herself to take another bite of the burger until she was finished. Maddie was sweating and almost panting from the effort. Her shirt was riding up a little and some of her bloated tummy was peeking cutely out from underneath her shirt. She'd never felt so full in her life, but she did manage to finish the burger.<br>\r\nLucy pushed the plate of garlic bread towards Maddie who managed to eat two more pieces, leaving only a few pieces of her sides left, which her mom finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you, honey, you ate so much\" Her mom sat back satisfied, putting the last onion ring in her mouth. All the food was finally gone, her mom looked quite bloated from all the food she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out of Poochy's, Lucy wrapped her arm around Maddie and held her close, rubbing her swollen little tummy intimately with her hand. At that moment Maddie realised she kind of liked being spoilt.</span></div></div>",

She had slept in for an extra hour and was only woken by the delicious smells drifting into her room from the kitchen. As she got out of bed, she noticed she was still a little bloated from the night before. Her auburn hair stuck out messily as she wandered into the kitchen.<br>\r\nLucy was cooking up a storm, bacon, sausages, eggs, French toast, pancakes, waffles, far more than Maddie's mom had ever made before. As soon as Maddie entered the room her mom handed her a plate with three eggs, a thick stack of bacon dripping with grease, and five sausages on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, honey, there's plenty more where that came from.\" Lucy said, sitting Maggie down at the table, which already had a knife and fork laid out for Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie tucked in, keen to please her mother. It was fantastic, Maddie never knew her mother could cook so well, and she joyfully stuffed her face. Before she could even finish her first plate, her mom put down two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going, sweetie, you're doing excellently.\" She purred, patting Maddie's growing tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the plates was stacked heavy with plump French toast drenched in butter with more bacon, and the other was loaded with pancakes and waffles glistening with a healthy coating of syrup. It was all twice as thick as mom used to make. Maddie ate ravenously, as fast as she could. It melted delectably in her mouth. She clutched her stomach almost in pain by the time she'd finished gorging, but felt pleased she managed it all. Her mom helped her up from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was brilliant, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, I guess I should take it easy at lunch, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not if you don't want to sweetie, you can eat whatever you want. Oh look at the time, you need to get ready for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie piled her lunch tray high with food at school, enjoying her new freedom. She took a separate plate of lasagna, and macaroni and cheese, all things she wouldn't allow herself to eat before. They weren't huge portions but she didn't want to over-do it after breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat with her best friend April. April was a quiet girl around everyone but Maddie, and had long black hair that hung down her back. She was 9 and had a similarly slim build to Maddie, but she was significantly taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're going to eat all that?\" April queried, \"Is your mom okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she's perfectly fine with it,\" Maddie laughed, putting some lasagna in her mouth, \"she said she feels bad about being so hard on me recently.\" She felt a slight sense of pride in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky,\" April sounded faintly jealous \"I wish my mom would let me off the hook every once in awhile. You're still going to soccer practice tonight right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, mom said I don't have to go to cheer-leading practice for a while, so I'm stopping. Well, for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll be so boring without you.\" April replied bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" was all Maddie could manage. She was actually delighted she didn't have to do any sport activity any more. She'd grown to hate soccer and cheer-leading and was starting to enjoy getting to eat all the food she'd denied herself before. For now she was just going to let her mom indulge her. Good food and no exercise sounded like the perfect way to enjoy being spoilt.</span></div></div>",

They were the remains of what had graciously been provided for her by Lucy, who had been baking a lot more recently to help her spoil Maddie. Recently, with her mother's encouragement, Maddie had taken to snacking a little between meals to tide over her increased appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother appeared in the doorway. \"Dinner's ready, sweety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie entered the kitchen, greeted by the now familiar smell of fattening treats. She was sporting a slightly different form to the one she previously had two weeks prior. The new Maddie was a little plumper, a sweet layer of pudge coating her little tummy, giving it a very slight bounce when she skipped. Her thighs and arms were slightly thicker, and her ass had become a little more defined, cutely pressing more tightly against her panties. Her face had filled out ever so slightly, with faintly fuller cheeks, and the slightest whisper of a double chin. While it was almost completely undetectable, there had even been a slight growth in Maddie's chest, a warm promise of plump little breast-buds that would bloom with Maddie's soon to be fuller figure. The changes to Maddie's body were undeniably positive, she had a warm energy and radiance about her now that only accentuated her sweetness and made her cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go honey.\" Her mother said, placing a plate of thick creamy pasta in front of Maddie. While Maddie had noticed her portion sizes increasing over the last two weeks, she thought little of it and certainly didn't complain. It was just part of being spoilt. And with that, a larger Maddie continued eating.</span></div></div>",

Though, she made sure to rise at some time in the morning; after all, she couldn't miss out on breakfast, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dressed herself on no particular morning, she hadn't seemed to put together that she was indeed ballooning at quite a rate. Her tummy had become nicely rounded, with the slightest overhang, and just the tiniest peek of soft flesh sneaking out the bottom of her shirt, the sleeves of which giving her bigger arms a bit of a squeeze and getting a little stretched in the chest area. Her jean-shorts weren't faring any better, starting to get snug around her wider rump and thicker thighs. Even the little struggle to get the button clasped went unnoticed.<br>\r\nHer cheeks were rounder, with the cutest little pink tinge to them. Her double chin was definitely noticeable by now, at least to anyone who wasn't her. She just brushed her hair like all was right with the world, and to her it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie seemed to be totally oblivious to her growth, but that was because her head was filled with two things; ideas of how to laze around for the day, and what food she wanted to treat herself to. The latter, combined with the smell of fresh cooking from downstairs, got her empty belly rumbling. With a greedy little giggle, she exited her room, unaware of the heavy thuds on the floor that came with her skipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't disappointed when she reached the kitchen; the smell hit her like a speeding train, and a grin crossed her face, dimpling her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Morning, sweetie,\" Lucy smiled warmly from the oven, and nodded to the table, \"Breakfast's up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table was a plethora of fried egg, sausages, bacon and toast, with a nice glass of orange juice to go with it. A few chocolate brownies sat on the side as well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not long after getting home from school had Maddie turned on the tv and lay comfortably on the couch. She was starting to feel a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom can I have some doughnuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unusual absence of a \"please\" had not gone unnoticed by Lucy, but she took this as a positive sign that Maddie was starting to welcome and expect her mom's pampering. Maddie didn't need to ask so nicely to be spoilt anymore, and Lucy was only too pleased to provide for her growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, sweety.\" Lucy entered the room with a doughnut in her mouth, and placed plate with two on Maddie's tubbier middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much mom!\" Her gratitude certainly hadn't lost any enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had loved the last month of her life, it had been a better award than she could ever have anticipated. Although Maddie had hardly noticed, the month had been a perfect storm of rich fast food, wonderful treats, and fattening dinners, and it had definitely taken a toll on Maddie's once slim, tight figure. Maddie herself simply and earnestly had no idea indulgence could be so much fun and she'd really discovered her sweet tooth. Doughnuts, brownies, flapjacks, chocolate bars, pancakes, cookies, muffins, and all manner of sweets her mom would buy her on the way home from school had made their way into her expanding tummy. Soda was so much better than water, chocolate fingers were so much better than carrot sticks And there were so many more delectables Maddie still had to try. Best of all was that there had been very little soccer or cheer leading practice. There was something so liberating about not having to stay at school after lessons on Mondays and Thursdays, and not having to give up some of her lunch breaks. Maddie was free to go home and stuff herself with more new food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Maddie had looked different after just 2 weeks of good eating, then a month of being such a well fed girl made her look almost like a changed person. Maddie's deep auburn hair, once short, had been allowed to grow out a bit and now hung freely in curls down to her shoulders. Her school uniform was noticeably tighter on Maddie's fuller form. The sleeves of her pretty blouse dug into her thicker arms, and stretched the material more closely over the the slight extra plumpness of her chest. Her small fresh breast buds meant her chest wasn't completely flat anymore. Her tummy, once svelte and trim, was certainly a bit chunky, and rounder now, causing her already strained blouse to ride up slightly. Her tummy stuck out and jiggled a little, sometimes leaving her charming innie visible when her soft tummy wasn't pressed tightly against the waistband of her dress. While it certainly wasn't close to hanging over it, her tummy did peek over the dress by about 2 inches, giving Maddie a respectable little pooch. Little love handles where sprouting and poked also slightly over her dress. Maddie's cute ass had filled out some more, giving her lovely fuller hips that developed a slightly more confident swing to them and a nice little extra perky plushness to her butt. The gap between her meatier thighs was narrower than it had been previously but they didn't touch and rub just yet. Her face had a bit more softness to the cheeks and her double chin was just starting to develop.<br>\r\nThere was no denying it, Maddie was getting nice and chubby. The way Maddie moved was a bit more weighty than before, making more noise as she skipped around, and she moved just a bit more heavily and slowly too. Indeed, had you not known Maddie a month ago, and had not seen how Lucy had grown her daughter into such a well fed little girl, and how Maddie had expanded to enjoy being just a little bit spoilt, you might gawk at the sight of how much porkier a previously athletic, sweet child like Maddie had grown into such an enchanting porker in such a short length of time. Maddie, however, was oblivious to how exquisitely she had filled out. It did irritate her that her clothes were tighter but she merely assumed they had shrunk in the wash. Lucy, on the other hand, was well aware of Maddie's gain, but was not at all concerned. It was natural for girls to chub up at her age, and each pound only made her look more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one small thing that threatened Maddie's future of indulgence, and that was the limited guarantee on her mom's promise to spoil her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie adopted a very sweet, polite tone as she approached Lucy. She was surprised this appreach felt a little unfamiliar. \"Mom, I know it's been a month since you offered to start spoiling me, but I wanted to tell you that it hasn't any effect on how well I've been doing at school, and I feel like we've grown even closer since this started. I've been having so much fun, so do you think we can keep going for another month, pleeeeaaaasssseee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course honey,\" Lucy looked a little surprised, \"I just want you to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am so happy mom, thank you ever so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing honey, do you think you could hop on the scales for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, sure, if you want Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"63lbs. Is that bad?\" Maddie asked, sounding worried, \"That's 10lbs more than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had indeed managed to pack on a good ten pounds in her month of over-eating, which came as a bit of a shock in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy laughed. \"It's absolutely fine sweety, it's all just part of being spoilt. It doesn't matter if you get a bit plumper, it's very cute on you.\" She intimately rubbed Maddy's chub for emphasis, and kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Mom.\" Maddie sounded a little doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, come and have some flapjacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh okay.\" As Maddie went to eat, Lucy wrote down Maddie's higher weight in a little diary. Spoiling her was going so well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy's words had been weighing on the young girl's mind. The early morning sunrise beamed in through Maddie's window, casting the room in an apricot glow as Maddie researched her chunkier body in front of her mirror. She jiggled the pooch of her belly and pinched her love handles, rubbed and wiggled the extra thickness of her butt, and squeezed the added flab on her thighs. Her mom was right, Maddie was definitely plumper.<br>\r\nPart of her couldn't believe she hadn't noticed until now. Maddie had never really thought much about her body or her appearance. It was an odd feeling knowing there was more of...Maddie. Knowing she took up more space. Knowing her thickness gave her features she didn't have before. Knowing if people talked about Maddie they would class her as a chubby girl now. What was stranger still was that it didn't really worry her. Maddie never had anything against gaining weight or fatness. It was only really her mom's previous encouragement to exercise and play sports, and her foolish ignorance of how heavenly indulgence could be, that stopped her getting quite porky. It was just different knowing she was fatter was all, but it definitely wasn't unpleasant. How could it be, when her mom told her she looked cuter carrying a bit of weight? Yes, Maddie decided, if she was going to be spoilt, <i>really</i> spoilt, then she would gladly accept that she might fatten up a bit. And that was just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might go to soccer practice today.\" Maddie told April, between mouthfuls of her second helping of school lasagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, err, really?\" April almost choked, and had to compose herself. \"Well, great, okay, it'll be nice to have you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's recent growth hadn't gone unnoticed by her best friend, who, honestly, was equally concerned and jealous by Maddie's recent change of life-style. Maddie was definitely getting to be porky, but April couldn't bring herself to say anything. Of course, this could be the point where Maddie would get back on track, but April wasn't sure the bigger Maddie could handle the exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this won't be regular, they need an extra player and I just want to see if the new weight will affect me much.\" Maddie wanted to start being frank about her new body, and rubbed her tummy pudge to make a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril nearly choked a second time, but managed to squeeze out a feeble \"okay\". Curse Maddie and her cool mom. April silently admitted to herself she might have given up her tight, slim body if it meant she got to quit soccer and cheer-leading. Obviously all the good food at lunch and the delicious stuff Lucy gave Maddie after school didn't seem unappealing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's soccer kit was once a baggy on her skinny figure but on her new chubby form it was starting to get tight. Maddie noticed she was one of the larger girls in her class now, and some of the girls were surprised at how much little Maddie, short, skinny Maddie had had become a bit of a chubster. Out on the pitch, it was peculiar feeling more of the wind on her thighs and the bottom of her tummy, and all the other tubby parts of her body that hadn't previously existed. Maddie was shocked by how much  simple warm-up activities wore her out - she was practically sweating before the match even started. She was heavier on her feet and couldn't keep up as well with her tummy's new jiggle. Maddie used to be a good player, but her skill had clearly dipped, and her team just barely won. The coach gave chubby Maddie a disapproving look. While Maddie was worse than she expected, she wasn't bad. It was satisfying knowing she could eat herself into a chubby girl in just a month and still be a decent soccer player. It was a fun experiment and Maddie kind of liked observing the changes to her body, in a strictly observational sense, of course. Anyway she was completely done with exercise for now, all Maddie really cared about was letting herself go for a while and getting properly spoilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I think I need some new school clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy knelt down and with her hands on her daughter's little love handles, and affectionately nuzzled Maddie's exposed tummy chub. \"It looks like it honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie giggled. \"Thanks mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store, Maddie found she had to go up two sizes before she had clothes that were properly comfortable. However, Lucy got Maddie to try on some clothes that were a few sizes too big as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to prepare for my lovely growing little girl,\" she whispered in Maddie's ear, and kissed her plump tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea mom, I guess these might not last that long.\" Maddie gestured to the clothes currently in her size. Lucy was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie isn't the only one having a change of heart, however:</span></div></div>",

Her envy of Maddie's new life-style had peaked over the last few days, and she despised having to go to cheer-leading and soccer practice whiled she imagined Maddie joyfully lazing around and stuffing her face with so much enticing food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something up, April?\" Maddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hate having to work out all the time.\" April said, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Maddie asked inquisitively. \"Well you could just stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's not just that,\" she irritably bit into her apple, \"I'm sick of dieting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh,\" Maddie teased, taking a huge bite out of her third helping of bbq chicken, \"does this make you jealous, Apirl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She snapped. It was nice to see April's trade-mark fire. \"You get to stuff your face with whatever you want, and you look like you're having the time of your life, while I have to keep exercising. It's so boring! I mean sure you've put on some weight, but it just looks fun to indulge a bit, okay?\" April had finally admitted her envy, just as Maddie had wanted. She knew April wanted to, but she needed to hear her say it. In truth, Maddie hadn't been able to spend as much time with April as she would have liked in the last month, and couldn't stop thinking about how fun it would be to stuff herself with her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gave April a sly smile. \"Well, what's stopping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom, I don't think she'd like it if I started to get, you know...fat.\" April's tanned face flushed red for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, it's really not bad being a bit tubby. Feel how soft I am now,\" Maddie took April's hand and placed it on her chubby stomach. The plumper girl adopted a more sincere tone, \"I'm fine with the bigger me, and I'd say it's worth gaining just for how fun it is to let yourself go.\" April pulled her hand away. \"Look, if you're not sure about it, give in for a week or two, and if you're worried about it, you can just stop and go back to how things were before. You should come round mine tonight and me and Mom will show you how fun it is to let yourself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept across April's face. \"You can be very convincing when you want to be.\" With that April got up from her seat and returned with a plate piled with sticky bbq chicken, and proceeded to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want another muffin, April?\" Maddie's mom held out a second delicious muffin. Despite already feeling a little full from the two chocolate bars Maddie's mom had generously supplied her with, and the first muffin, April felt like she couldn't refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Ms. Bloss.\" April bit into the muffin, her eyes rolling back in pleasure. She wasn't used to food this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Lucy.\" She smiled warmly and April took another big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours passed in a blur of fattening treats and lazing around before Lucy bought them out pizzas for dinner. Both her and Maddie had a whole medium meat passion each, while Lucy had a whole large bbq worshipper to herself. April was properly stuffed by this point, but managed to force herself to eat nearly three quarters of the pizza. She didn't want to stop, the pizza was amazing, but she worried she might burst if she gorged herself anymore. April had never been so full in her entire life, and she rubbed her distended tummy as she unbuttoned her painfully tight trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Lucy, I'm so full, I don't think I can manage anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's fine April, I wouldn't have expected you to have eaten it all anyway. You have an excellent appetite for such a skinny girl, I'm sure in a week or two you'll be able to eat a lot more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy gave April's left over slices to Maddie, who had devoured her pizza and pushed herself to eat what remained of April and her mom's pizza. She couldn't let good food go to waste anymore.<br>\r\nFor a sweet moment, April felt contented. Lucy was so cool, April wished her mom was more like her. She had a wonderful freeing, encouraging, and enabling aura about her that made April want to eat. In that moment as she just managed to finish one of Lucy's rich gooey brownies, April realised she wanted to let herself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does April's mom feel about it?</span></div></div>",

They had been friends ever since their daughters had met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she talked a lot about getting spoilt after that.\" Kate replied, with just a tinge of concern in her voice. Like Lucy, she too was a single mother, and would always do what she could to make sure her daughter was in the best position possible, whatever that may be. She was a refined woman, sophisticated, and always well dressed. Lucy had often admired how attractive Kate was, her Italian descent gave her pretty olive skin, and rich brown hair that hung down to her shoulders. That was on top of her lean, fit figure, moderate, but very perky and well-shaped bosom and her gody ass. It was not hard for Lucy to see where April got her beautiful and enticing looks from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sound so worried, Kate.\" Lucy chuckled, \"You must have noticed I've been feeding Maddie up a bit lately. She loves being spoilt, and I love spoiling her. She told me herself how happy it makes her, and we're much closer now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried about April getting fat, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I think Maddie looks adorable with the extra weight, she's so cuddly and soft now.\" Lucy spoke so passionately. \"It's only improved her confidence, she's always been short, so it's lovely that she's still able to make up for her height in a different way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true, she does look cuter now she's a bit chubby,\" Kate admitted, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, besides, April's so skinny she could stand to pack on a few pounds anyway.\" Lucy found the conversation so...<i>exciting</i>. She loved speaking so openly about their daughters fattening up. It felt good to be honest about spoiling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so persuasive Lucy,\" Kate smiled warmly, and put her hand on Lucy's arm. \"I will start spoiling April, it sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect actually excited Kate a little. She had seen how happy April was after returning from Maddie's, and it would be nice for April to be able to let herself go and enjoying indulging. Kate's skinny, boney daughter would be so much nicer if she were more cuddly and jiggly. Lucy's was right, Kate needed to put some meat on those bones.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maddie did a little twirl as she entered the Ultra mart, taking in all the colours and smells of all the fattening foods around her. To Maddie, Tubb's (a new supermarket chain that exclusively offered delicious food - there was nothing healthy to be found) was now a kind of paradise, and Maddie was already eyeing up all the food she wanted to stuff herself with in the coming weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can choose whatever you want, honey.\" Lucy said with an encouraging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as much of it as I want?\" Maddie asked, with an equally expectant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally, baby,\" Lucy said, giving Maddie a devious grin and a lightly patting her plump derri\u00e8re, making it jiggle slightly, \"I've got to keep my growing little girl well fed, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, you do.\" Maddie replied, half distracted by an shelf of Oreos. There was variety everywhere. She had no idea there were so many favours of just Oreos - lemon twist, candy cane, peanut-butter, red velvet, watermelon, birthday cake. She hummed happily as she dropped ten boxes of different flavours in the huge shopping cart, and threw in three packs of Mega stuf for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie proceeded through the store as if she were in a trance. There were so many foods she wanted, nay <i>needed</i> to try. Cookies, cookie dough ice cream (the fourth tub of ice-cream in the cart), tubes of raw cookie dough, Twinkies, eclaires, tubs of caramel shortcakes, tubs of chocolate mini-rolls, ginger-bread men, packs of Jaffa-cakes, pink and white nougat bars, chocolate nougat bars, Maddie poured so much new food into the shopping cart. For cakes, Maddie chose a very rich triple chocolate cake, a thick carrot cake, a delicious looking battenberg cakes, and two heavy cheesecakes, one of which was chocolate, which Maddie was most excited to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy would encourage Maddie throughout all of this, just to make sure her daughter was going to be eating the best (and most fattening) food in the coming weeks. She would say \"Oooh, get the mini-doughnuts with sprinkles\", or \"You should get the triple chocolate cake\" or \"Here, have three more packs of M&amp;Ms, they're buy one get one free.\" or \"You might as well get five pounds of fudge\", knowing they would add pounds to her daughter. Of course Maddie was only too happy to oblige her mother, and by the end of the trip the cart was practically overflowing with all sorts of fattening goodies, too much to list in any reasonable length of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier was a cute hipster girl named Jane, who had obviously recently packed on a bit of weight, and was absent mindedly rubbing her belly, that was pressed tightly against her Tubb's uniform. She had raven hair and a fringe that framed her piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right into Lucy. She gave a wise, curious little smirk at Lucy, and leaned in close as she scanned the items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all for her right?\" she whispered, giving a little nod to Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Lucy replied confidently, raising an eye-brow inquisitively towards Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you've been feeding her up a bit, huh?\" Jane stated with a confidence that let Lucy know she wasn't just assuming. \"Do you have a picture of when she was skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was fascinated by Jane's demeanour. \"Here you go.\" she said, with no hesitation holding up a picture of the once trim Maddie, from her phone for Jane. This was her first time showing off Maddie to someone, it was quite exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane bit her lip. \"She looks so much better now she's chubby.\" she said breathily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt a close connection with Jane. \"Right? The weight looks so cute on her, I knew it would. She so much softer and more cuddly now.\" She'd never been able to speak about Maddie quite like this with anyone before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, all the the food was scanned. \"Enjoy this Maddie.\" Jane said, flashing Maddie an encouraging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I will.\" Maddie beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy moved to pay, but Jane stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, you can have this on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But there's so much, won't they mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'll cover for it, just promise me one thing\" Jane put both her hands on Lucy's shoulders, and looked her straight in the eye, \"keep her well fed, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy topped her, and stroked Jane's plump belly for a moment, whispering so close Jane could feel her breath on her ear. \"Don't worry hon, she's only going to get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane flushed a fierce crimson.</span></div></div>",

Maddie had graduated to full on demands now, and why shouldn't she? Lucy had made it clear she wanted nothing more than to cater to her growing daughter's every desire. Maddie was pretty lazy now anyway she need to exercise something, so why not her power.<br>\r\nMaddie licked the melted chocolate off her finger from the three different chocolate bars she'd been eating and habitually rubbed her tummy, which was starting to get a little stuffed. The feeling of being properly full had become a little unfamiliar as her appetite had increased over the last month, but it was nice to know she was indulging more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At your request, my queen.\" Lucy said with a mock-bow, and placed her bountiful offering in Maddie's lap. She was a good servant. \"I also bought a tube of cookie dough, and some Nutella brownies for your pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Maddie stretched and Lucy squeezed her tummy like some kind of reward for her service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all just a fun little act that had developed between Maddie and Lucy, but Maddie had to admit she enjoyed it, and Lucy did too. She piped out the thick cookie dough and ate it. \"You have served me well, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will keep serving my queen, until she's nice and fat and satisfied.\" She knelt down and gave Maddie's tummy a long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie giggled. \"You better bring me double for that next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring you triple.\" Lucy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more casserole.\" April told Kate. She too was becoming more demanding, but April had always had more of a feisty streak than Maddie, so it came more naturally to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fourth helping, so you have to ask nicely.\" Kate told her mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril rolled her eyes, and laboured her words just to make a point. \"Pleeaaassee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, that's the last of it.\" Kate poured another generous helping of the greasy rich casserole onto April's plate and she ate it greedily. April was actually stuffed but her mom was such an unbelievably amazing cook that she wanted to push herself to eat beyond capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she finished the casserole, April said \"Ooooh, I'd love one of those cinnamon buns.\" She gestured towards the fruits of her mother's baking cooling on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manners?\" Kate prompted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, this is so unfair\" April was suddenly impassioned, \"Lucy doesn't do this to Maddie, she gives her whatever Maddie wants, and that's just part of being spoilt. If you really want me to indulge you should feed me whatever I want, when I want it because --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate cut her daughter's speech short by cramming an especially plump cinnamon swirl into her mouth. April forced herself to scowl, but it was pretty difficult when her eyes were almost watering from how good Kate's baking was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so upset, I'm just messing with you when I make you talk politely. Besides you make a good point, if I'm going to properly spoil you then you shouldn't have to ask for it, so open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril opened her mouth, and Kate pushed another cinnamon roll into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class a few days later, Maddie offered a packet of M&amp;Ms to April, who took a handful, before Maddie tipped the rest into her mouth. The pair had taken to snacking in lessons to tide them over until lunch or the end of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie, April, how many times do I have to tell you, no eating in class.\" Mrs. Hall told them for the 4th time that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry miss, we just have to eat these Oreos and then we're done.\" Maddie told her. Mrs. Hall rolled her eyes but didn't stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy, a particularly snobbish rich girl from the row in front of them turned to Maddie. \"It's not like you need any more food, piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be begging me to share this with you, tooth-pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Suzy turned her sights on April. \"You should watch yourself, or you'll get fat as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I wouldn't mind.\" She turned to Maddie. \"She just doesn't know how good indulgence is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie shook her head condescendingly at Suzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 weeks of being thoroughly pampered:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat food do we have left from Tubb's, Mom?\u201d Maddie asked, lying out on the couch, her mouth full of the last slice of Battenberg cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust two eclairs, that's it, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I don't really like <i>those</i> eclairs, but bring me them, I'll eat them anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy obediently bought them and Maddie stuffed the last two eclairs greedily into her mouth, before downing the last of the two litre bottle of soda she had been working on. She let out a little burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all gone, Mom.\" Maddie said proudly, patting her much more stately belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, there was not a crumb of all the food Lucy had bought from Tubb's left in the house. The last two weeks had passed in a euphoric blur of delicious abundance, gluttony and inactivity for Maddie. Lucy had made it her personal mission to ensure Maddie was pampered and worshipped with all the food and treats she desired. Maddie only had to make demands, and Lucy kept her comfortably full the whole time. She'd become Lucy's proud, fat little princess. She had also become lazy. Maddie's top priority was (over-)indulging, so she'd let herself grow pretty unfit, just the short walk to school was enough to get her out of breath. However her gluttony didn't stop there. Even in class, Maddie would often be munching away on something, which those around her had come to begrudgingly accept as normal. In fact some other students had even started to take advantage of Mrs. Hall's crumbling will, and began eating in class as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get you back on the scales, honey\u201d, Lucy said, taking Maddie's chubby hand and leading her upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was ecstatic to be weighing Maddie again after only 2 weeks. The anticipation was giving her chills. The scale creaked a little more than it had done previously as Maddie put her full weight on it. Maddie's eyes widened as she saw the pin settle on the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c75lbs! The means I put on 12 lbs in two weeks. I guess I have gotten kind of fat...\u201d Maddie blushed, realising in a rare moment of humility how big she'd made herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don't be embarrassed, princess, you know how good the extra weight looks on you.\u201d Lucy sunk a hand into Maddie's chunky rear and slowly caressed her lower belly with the other, \u201cGod, you're so soft and cuddly, I can hardly keep my hands off you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you can't keep your hands off me, Mom.\u201d Maddie said, with a cheeky smile and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were both right. Having packed on more than double the weight she'd gained in the previous month, Lucy's little girl was now definitely tipping into fat girl territory. Maddie now carried a glorious extra 22 lbs on her petite frame, and it showed. Perhaps most impressively she had developed adorable, fluffy starter boobs, and was much more well endowed than most girls her age. Maddie's face was now plump, her cheeks had grown chubbier and her double chin was soft enough to be noticeable. Her arms had thickened out more, a nice layer of chub hung beneath them that wobbled as she moved. Her tummy had graduated into a full-on belly that stuck out illustriously in front of her. It was doughy and heavy, having thickened out so much recently that it now sported a few little stretch-marks. It had also developed a splendid little hang to it. When she was standing, it would ooze over her waistband. When she was sitting, it would cover her crotch, and rest seductively on her lap. Her remarkably heftier middle was backed up by meaty love handles that also bulged enticingly over her waistband. Maddie's back had grown fatter, with two thick rolls that reached around above her love handles. Maddie's pert ass had filled out into a bountiful bubble butt, and claimed more territory on Maddie's throne (the sofa). Lucy loved to watch how it proudly swung and jiggled with Maddie's self-satisfied strut. Her thick, creamy thighs had a nice coating of flab, and rubbed together lusciously as she walked - her thigh gap a distant memory of the skinny little girl Maddie once was. So much of Maddie had a jiggle to it now when she moved. For such a young, petite girl, it was impressive how much space she took up, sitting or standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get a picture of your progress, sweetie.\u201d Lucy said, holding up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hesitation, Maddie struck a sassy pose, left hand cupping and lifting her belly fat, index finger of her right hand placed naughtily over her lips. Lucy took a picture and sent it to Jane, as well as a few other people she had gotten interested in seeing Maddie thicken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had to admit she actually kind of liked the extra weight. Everything was so much more...<i>satisfying</i>. The extra cushiony chub adorning her figure made every seat more comfortable, and there was something cosy and homely about the way her rolls rubbed softly against each other. She would often catch herself absent-mindedly rubbing and jiggling her doughy belly and feel a little embarrassed, but it was hard to resist when it felt so wonderfully soft. Yet it was about more than just feeling for Maddie. She loved being heavy and formidable. Being bigger made her feel important, she liked having a bit more weight behind her demands. Maddie knew she should feel bad when her classmates talked about how fat she was getting, but part of her liked the extra attention. She was a princess and it was only right that her subjects should acknowledge her superior weight and plumpness. Perhaps most of all Maddie liked pleasing her mom, who made her feel more like royalty than anyone else. Lucy adored the gorgeous fullness of her daughter and she was teaching Maddie to love it as well. Whereas before gaining weight was just acceptable, par for the course, suddenly the idea of packing on the pounds, maybe even intentionally, seemed almost desirable to Maddie. <i>Almost</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy helped Maddie get dressed for school the next day, Maddie realised, with some surprise and a strange little rush of pleasure that she was now big enough to fill out the largest set of school uniform she had. It was even a little snug in some places. This was the uniform Lucy had bought Maddie to grow into, fat girl clothes, and she had managed it in just two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you just keep sizing up, don't you honey?\u201d Lucy said in a low moan, eagerly grabbing Maddie's belly under her jumper and giving it a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie felt butterflies in her tummy for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey Maddie, I heard a rumour that you were deliberately gaining weight.\u201d Chloe asked, licking her fingers clean of the iced bun she had just devoured. Chloe was a cute bottom-heavy brunette that sat on the table next to Maddie and April. She was never quite as svelte and sporty as Maddie and April had been, but she had become down-right tubby sitting next to the class' fastest growing duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie chuckled at the question. \u201cNah I've just been eating very well. So yeah, I have gotten pretty fat, but it's not deliberate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d Suzy cut in, spinning round from the desk in front so her legs were either side of her chair's back, \u201cI thought you were trying to dethrone Mary as fattest girl in the class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie stuffed a custard filled doughnut into her tormentor's mouth, partly to re-assert her dominance, but also to get back at her for making her think weird things again. \u201cBetter eat up, collar bones, looks like you're competing with Eleanor for the title of most anorexic girl in the class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the idea of being the fattest girl in the class that had got Maddie going. Being that fat did have a certain appeal. Her cheeks reddened just for a moment as she imagined students, parents and teachers all talking about how Maddie was so much heavier than the other girls in the class. She imagined Mrs. Hall, her friends, the whole class having to pay attention, staring stunned as she walked in, even fatter than Mary. She would be the most impressive, physically imposing girl there, demanding the most space and attention. Mary could easily be classed as obese, especially because she was even shorter than Maddie, but she wasn't bad looking for a girl of her size. Maddie knew she would be prettier when she was that big though. Her auburn hair was much richer than Mary's bright ginger colour, and Maddie's deep emerald eyes were more striking than Mary's dull lime. Maddie was certain her cheek bones would still be visible under all that cheek fat as well. She'd just carry the weight much better in general. Still, Maddie had caught her mom in awe a few times at how huge Mary was. She was easily a good 15lbs heavier than Maddie, but Maddie could definitely make herself bigger. Everyone would admire all that luscious- She stopped herself. Suzy had a weird way of getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie watched the warm pleasure pass over Suzy's face as the custard of the doughnut filled her mouth. Maddie was beginning to develop a sort of weird respect for Suzy. Someone that would unapologetically tease her about her weight was actually kind of fun in a class that was no longer that impressed by Maddie's size. Suzy was a bit thin for Maddie though. She started to imagine how good the blonde bully would look if she were a bit chubbier... Maddie dragged herself back to reality, this was getting out of hand, she had completely missed the last few things that were said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you'd like it.\u201d Chloe mused between mouthfuls of Reese's. \u201cYou should eat more though, you really are skinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's easy for you to say, I for one like not being fat.\u201d Suzy awkwardly swallowed the rest of the doughnut, and turned her sights on April, sensing weakness. \u201cDidn't I say you would get fat hanging round with Maddie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril looked shyly up from her work, having been uncharacteristically quiet throughout the conversation. She said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might need to change your name to another month, April. Looks like you've gained an extra day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned Suzy a few laughs as April flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright leave her alone Suzy, I've probably just as big as April is.\u201d Chloe was being nice, she'd had more of a head-start than April and had definitely eaten less. \u201cY'know, with the way this class is going, the skinny girls are going to be outnumbered soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you're right actually,\u201d Maddie said, a little taken aback someone else was aware of this. She turned to Suzy with a devious grin. \u201cThen we can all shame you for being skinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, in your dreams.\u201d Suzy grinned, spinning herself back around to resume her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie wasn't sure how much Suzy knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d April hissed, attempting to summon her growing friend to her side as the other students went to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat April?\u201d Maddie returned, mocking April's whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as April started to go red. \u201cLook...I-I'm kind of worried that I'm getting fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gave a very unsympathetic laugh. \u201cYou're not fat, look at you. Is this about what Suzy said yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No\u2026 well, a bit. But I've been kind of worried about it for a while now. Look at my gut. I've gained 12lbs, Maddie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie wasn't entirely sure how April had managed to chub up quite so fast in the last two weeks. That said, April was always talking about how much of a fantastic cook her mom was and how she would feed April late into the night, so it might have had something to do with that. Whatever it was, it had certainly taken its toll on April's once athletic physique. Kate had taken a more dominant role than Lucy in diligently indulging her daughter, stuffing April full of her glorious cooking as a way of playfully keeping a lid on her daughter's ego. April's slender body was now coated in soft, cute fat. Her chest was looking a little fuller and her previously visible ribs were now protected by a slight layer of pudge. A flash of her plump, tanned tummy now peeked out enticingly from under her jumper. April carried a pleasant pot-belly now, a little rounder than Maddie's more jiggly tummy at that weight, but no less adorable. Her thighs had lost a lot of definition and had filled out in their softness, the olive skin of both vying to touch. April overall just looked much more domesticated, her body more the result of a loving mother than a tight sports regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're over-reacting. So you're a bit chubby now, it's no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a big deal! Suzy keeps making all these horrible jokes, and she's kind of right, I used to be really in shape. I was a pretty good runner, and Mrs. Croach gave me this big talk about how I was letting the football team down by allowing myself to get chubby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares what they think? First of all, Suzy just...a skinny bitch. She doesn't get it. Second, you said yourself, you like indulging way more than you like training with Mrs. Croach. You don't want to give up your mom's cooking do you? Besides, I thought Kate said you look much prettier now you're a bit plumper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Mom's really likes how much I've gained,\u201d a smile crept across April's lips, before her cheeks started to turn red, \u201cbut...I don't know, getting chubby just makes me feel...weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird in what way?\u201d Maddie asked. She suddenly felt genuine curiosity, immediately much more engaged in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know, it feels kind of...\u201d April trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie stood behind her friend, and slowly rubbed April's tummy chub. Maddie's belly fat was pressed tight against her back. \u201cKind of...nice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a really, really weird way\u2026yeah.\u201d April was now blushing profusely as she made eye contact with Maddie, who was eagerly looking up from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Maddie whispered, before slyly squeezing April's plusher behind. \u201cIt feels good being softer, right? It feels nice knowing there's more of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril could only nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to be embarrassed about April. You look much cuter now, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie surprised herself with the sincerity of that remark. She wasn't just saying that to comfort her friend, she genuinely did find April more attractive with the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour problem is you still care too much what other people think. You started indulging because it makes you happy, so don't stop just because a few people are being mean. You do it for you.\u201d It was ironic this was coming from Maddie, who was becoming increasingly fascinated with the idea of people talking about her fattening up, but that wasn't the point. She was just telling April what she needed to hear. \u201cAnd, you know, if you happen to like the extra weight, then you really have no reason to cut down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie moved to dangle a chocolate bar temptingly in front of April's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on April, let yourself go. Let yourself...grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gave in and took a bite of the chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a cute pun,\u201d she said sarcastically, \u201cbut I guess you're right, I do need to loosen up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie grinned, clearly satisfied with her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially if I like the extra weight.\u201d April thought to herself, keenly cramming the rest of the chocolate bar into her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Ever since the trip to Tubb's, the girls had eaten almost nothing but sugary, empty-calorie junk food from the moment they woke up to the second they fell asleep. The lack of physical activity that came with their new lifestyle was doing a number to their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had to be at <i>least</i> double the size she was before her new life started. Her round belly, peeking from her too-small purple top, had an impressive overhang that almost totally covered her crotch. Her sweatpants, albeit stretchy and comfortable, were starting to get snug from her enormous backside and thunder thighs pushing against them. Her thick arms, if she lifted them, would reveal the warning of smooth bingo wings. Her face was also fatter, her plump cheeks even rounder and getting a natural blush, and threatening to give her the tiniest wince in her vision. Her double-chin was unmissable from any position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, April was showing signs of welcoming her new diet. Kate had begun spoiling her daughter too, and it was already starting to show. A cute round pot belly pushed against her blue top, and her jean shorts were looking just a little snug. Her limbs had gotten thicker, and she had gotten a pair of rounder cheeks with a ghost of a double-chin appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as their waistlines grew, their metabolisms lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Lucy catering to her and letting her sit around and do nothing but snack all day, Maddie had grown incredibly lazy. She was slumped into the couch, cramming potato chips into her mouth while watching cartoons. She hadn't moved from that spot all day, aside from the few times she needed the bathroom.<br>\r\nHer eating was becoming careless as well - crumbs and stains littered her face, fingers and top. The only cleaning she bothered to do was licking her fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril wasn't nearly as bad, being used to a more active life and being late to the hedonism party, but given how sunk into the couch she was, she was definitely getting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, girls!\" Lucy smiled, walking in with half a triple-chocolate cake for each of the girls. Fudge brownies stuck out from the top and side.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" The girls giggled greedily, and dug into their snack. April leaned over and took neat bites of her piece, while Maddie shovelled globs of it with her hands and crammed it in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy could watch with pride and approval as the girls glutted themselves silly once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maddie grabbed a little bit of each of the food available to make sure she gave each a proper try. A mixture of pizza, burgers, fries, fried chicken, cake, cookies and other various foods filled her tray. Although there was a lot of food they amount of each was somewhat small portioned. Maddie decided it a good idea to take a little bit of everything instead of large quantities. She grabbed a seat and began to eat. She took a first bite of her burger, grease dripping down her chin and onto her shirt. That one bite made her ravenous.Bite after bite food was shoveled into her mouth. She didn't care to taste anything only to inhale. When the crumbs settled she was able to each everything on her tray. She leaned back and look at her stomach. Swollen very large from her meal. She began rubbing it trying to relive some pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate to much.\" She mumbled under her breathe. She heard the bell ring and slowly got up. Her stomach being too large to be contained in her shirt. She got to the classroom late and sat at her desk barely listening to her teacher. The food making her lethargic, she closed her eyes and slowly dozed off. She awoke to the sound of another bell. She looked up at the clock and realized that it was the final bell. Maddie slowly got out of her desk and began to head towards the exit. Her belly not as swollen but it still peaked out a bit under her shirt. She walked towards her mothers car and got in seeing her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi dear how was school today\" Linda began to start driving home glancing over at her daughter real quick. She saw her belly peaking out a bit but thought nothing of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great mommy. They had much better food at school today. Like pizza and cake. It was so yummy!\" Maddie said happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good hear dear. Make sure you are getting enough food at school. You are a growing girl after all.' Said Linda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mommy I'll make sure to eat lots of food. Oh could we get food on the way home I'm hungry\" Said Maddie trying to look extra cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can how about some Big Belly Burger.\" Said Linda. Maddie Nodded in agreement and they where off to get food. Linda had a lot of trouble saying no to her daughter. After her divorce all she wanted to do was make sure her daughter was as happy as possible. She noticed that she was really happy when she ate food. So she figured the best thing to do was to make sure she was able to eat whatever she wanted. Finding out that the school had made the food selection more vast was somewhat of a godsend for her daughter and for her now that her daughter would be happier at school. They arrived at Big Belly Burger and Linda realized she was somewhat hungry. She decided to get a double burger for herself and a single for her daughter. With a large fries and a milkshake for her and a diet soda for herself. As she drove home she watched as her daughter devoured the food more grease covering her chin. She ate the burger her own fries and her moms fries along with the shake. When they got home Linda Realized her daughter had fallen asleep in the bad seat. She picked up Maddie carefully as to not wake her up. As she brought her into the house she noticed that her stomach was slightly larger from the meal, she smiled and was happy to see her daughter was full.She placed her daughter on the couch allowing her to rest off her large meal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The week had gone by in a blur of overindulgence. Maddie would wake up to her mother either cooking her a larger than average breakfast or she would get her something to eat on the way the school. Then she would eat a large amount of greasy food during lunch time each day she would pile on more food on her tray. After eating she would make her way to the classroom and fall asleep at her desk, wakeup from her nap, walk to her moms car, get feed on the way home, nap and then get feed at dinner. Maddie took a bite of her third breakfast sandwich while on the way too school. Her mother looked over at her with a smile on her face looking down at her daughters growing stomach. The constant eating was having a great effect on it. There was not a moment when Maddie wasn't eating leaving her stomach mostly stuffed and bloated. Her stomach stuck out a good amount now resting on her lap. her shirt now too small to contain her belly. They arrived at the school Maddie finishing the last of her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Mommy see you after school\" Said Maddie opening the car door and walking towards the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye sweetie have a great day at school.\" Linda. Linda watched as her daughter got out the car her belly escaping her shirt once again. She examined the rest of her daughters outfit. She decided to wear a skirt today once loose fitting. Now her slightly larger rump could be seen a bit. Her softer thighs getting closer to touching and her arms leaving little sleeve left on her shirt. She thought to herself that maybe Maddie had put on a bit too much weight. She then looked down at her own slightly expanded stomach and patted it slightly, a week of fast food had also taken its tole on the single mother. After watching her daughter leave she figured it would be a good idea to get some new clothes for her growing daughter when the weekend came. She considered possibly talking to her daughter about her weight as well if she saw the right opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie walked as fast as her plump legs would let her, her belly making it difficult for her to move. She watched around her school and noticed that a lot of the other students have been putting on weight as well. Being at an all girls school she felt more comfortable showing off her larger tummy. It seemed that the other girls felt the same way. Tighter clothes, full tummy's peaking out under shirts, skirts lifted up slightly higher, the school had collectively gained weight due to the new menu. Maddie made it to class to be greeted by the teacher. The teacher began to talk about the new school curriculum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello students I hope you had a great weekend. Now the school has decided to change how things work at this school I think you will all be excited. Starting each day you will get a nice big Breakfast. Then you will go back to class and be given snacks throughout the duration of the day while we go over our lesson. Then it will be lunch time and after that you get to go home early. Doesn't that sound amazing. Said the Teacher with a smile on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids cheered at the announcement. Most of them because it meant they got to leave early. The day went on just like the teacher said. Breakfast, snacks and then lunch. Maddie continued to enjoy the school day with loads of tasty foods. When Maddie left after lunch she slowly began the trek to her mom's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda watched from the car her daughters belly fully expanded, her shirt was only able to cover her chest. The walk took a few minutes longer than normal but she finally was able to make it to the seat. Her hands slowly rubbing her full tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi hun how was school today\" Said Linda a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much food\" Maddie groaned rubbing her belly to try and release some pressure. She burped softly. \"The school.....Huff....decided it would be....Huff.....a good idea to give us breakfast, and snacks and........huff......Lunch.\" said Maddie trying to catch her breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice hun, at least you where full all day though. Would you like to go home or get some food on the way home?\" Said Linda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home would be nice i want to take a nap\" Said Maddie yawning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda drove them home and saw that Maddie had once again fallen asleep in the car. Linda picked her up carefully and was able to see that her daughter wasn't the most clean with her consumption. Crumbs and stains where on her bunched up shirt. Drool and grease could be seen around her mouth and chin, her belly also had signs of food stains and saliva on it. She was going to have to wash her before she went to sleep tonight. Linda went inside and layed her on the couch and let her take her nap hopefully her appetite would return later. She put her hand on her daughters belly. My happy little girl. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month had gone by of Maddie and Linda and things had changed for both of them. Maddie's eating didn't stop and she constantly would ask for unhealthy food while at home. Linda would comply with her child's demands knowing it would keep her happy and full. Unfortunately for Linda this also meant she was adding on pounds to her  frame. The sound of an alarm was blaring in the room. Linda's eyes opening slowly as she reached over to turn off the alarm. She got up out of her bed and looked at the time. 9:00am meaning it was a weekend. She would have to make sure her daughter had enough food for the day to match her excessive consumption during the school week. She looked at herself in the mirror wearing her nightgown, her weight was distributed in her hips, thighs and ass giving her a pear shape. Her stomach sticking out a bit more. Not too much damage she thought to herself. She put on a pair of yoga pants and a tank top which showed off her chubby stomach. She walked over to Maddie's room and opened the door. As usual she saw her daughter passed out in her bed just in a pair of too tight panties and a too small shirt. Her daughter was laying on her back her huge belly rising and falling with each breathe. Her body had begun to find places to put the weight she had gained making it grow out wider. Her belly growing wider instead of sticking out more, covering the her panties even when on her back. Her lower half expanded as well doing its best to try and hold her stomach weight. Linda woke her daughter up by rubbing her enlarged tummy. Maddie slowly opening her eyes seeing her mom's smiling face. Maddie slowly got up to the best of her ability, her belly weighing her down. She got up her belly covering her thighs. Maddie smiled her chubby cheeks adding cuteness to the smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we get food. I'm hungry.\" Said Maddie trying to look cute. This was the norm in the house hold. Maddie would wake up and ask for food right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure hun. But first we need to clean you up. Then we can get food on the way to the store. We need to go shopping for more clothes\" Linda said. Maddie nodded and got out of bed waddling towards the bathroom. Linda watched as her daughters larger rump jiggled with each step. Her panties being devoured by her lower half. She followed her to the bathroom and began to draw the bath food her daughter. Maddie began to slowly take off her clothing. The amount of effort it took left her somewhat winded. Linda examined her daughter seeing that her Belly was now large enough to cover her bottom half. But the added weight was starting to give her chest a bit more to it than other girls her age. Two mounds of fat rested on top of her stomach is what she called her chest. Linda carefully picked up her daughter, her weight making it harder to pick her up by the day. After the bath Linda decided to dress her daughter in a cute dress that fit her around 50 pounds ago. Maddie's stomach pushed the limits of the front of the dress, this left the back of the dress a bit breezy for the young girl. Linda figured they could just wear the new clothing after they bought it so she wouldn't be indecent for too long of there trip. Linda and Maddie walked over to the car and began their trek to the store. </span></div></div>",

She was always glad when the weekends came around; she could sleep for as long as she pleased!<br>\r\nWiping the sand from her eyes, the 8 year old smacked her lips and began a slow sidewards roll to the edge of her double-bed before sliding off it, the bed's metal frame giving a soft creak of relief.<br>\r\nShe glanced at the body mirror on her closet door and noticed her long. softly red hair was all over the place, and so grabbed her hairbrush from the bedside table, to begin combing it to its straighter but a bit curly look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing to remember about Maddie is how <i>large</i> she is. The young girl had quite the comfortable life, with doting parents that gave her all the delicious food and treats she could want. This, combined with her irregularly large appetite, caused the little redhead to balloon quite a bit. Being a little short for her age, the weight spread outward through her body, giving her a rather round physique. Her stomach was the largest part; a large sliver of white flesh protruding from under her buttoned-up pyjama shirt, which had a bit of strain due to its wearer's wideness. <br>\r\nHer large thighs and wide backside caused her pants a bit of trouble as well; namely, pulling them on and off when getting dressed for school. Her tubby little toes stuck out beneath the baggy legs of the pants, wiggling subconsciously as Maddie made a few extra strokes with her brush.<br>\r\nHer soft arms owned a pudgy hand each, both sporting a set of sausage fingers. Her round freckly cheeks had the slightest natural warm blush of pink to them, each one slightly protruding the bottom of the girl's peripheral vision. A round prominent double-chin sat proudly beneath her regular one, which along with her cheeks gave Maddie's face an adorably round and puffy look to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this bothered Maddie at all, nor did she really notice it; being a large little girl most of her life, she thought nothing of her blubbery body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the brush was set back down on the table, as if on cue, Maddie's large tummy gave a long grumble. Putting a pair of thick hands to rub it, she licked her lips in anticipation and slowly made her way out of her room, her round body and large thighs giving her a bit of a waddle.</span></div></div>",

Grinning to herself, Maddie waddled her way to the kitchen, her gut swinging side-to-side from the waddle. Her Mother was waiting, and was cooking breakfast...a lot of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's mother had long, brown hair, and blue eyes, and was quite big herself. She stood at just 5'2, but weighed easily in the upper 200s; her hips were enormous, almost as wide as the doors, and thighs to match; her belly was a ball of fat, hanging over her jeans, and was somehow fully covered by her shirt; her breasts were as big as her head, resting atop her gut. It was easy to see where Maddie got her eating habits. Turning around, she smiled. \"Hi sweetie! Have a good sleep? Feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie nodded, yawning again. \"Yeah, I'm fine, Mom, just a little hungry.\" On cue, Maddie's blubber-gut let out a low, moaning grumble, desperate to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother grinned, her own stomach growling practically a roar. \"Hungry too? My my, Sweetie, you might end up like me if you keep eating the way you do!\" She gave a pat to both their bellies, proud of how huge she was--and Maddie too. \"I made your favourite, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie clapped her hands and thanked her mother. She LOVED french toast, and here it was a whole table full of it! Pulling up a chair, she sat down and began eating the scrumptious feast. She was not messy though: Maddie ate neatly and politely, but eat she did: the plates were emptied, one by one, and her stomach slowly filled, inch by inch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie let out a small burp. \"Excuse me...hic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother patted her full gut. \"Good girl, got a nice healthy appetite, hehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie nodded and smiled back, but was in quite a daze. She wasn't just full, she was <i>stuffed.</i> Her pajamas creaked and groaned in unison with her belly's uncomfortable moans of indigestion. Maddie patted her gut--now quite taut--and let out a satisfied sigh...<b>POP!</b> went a button! Maddie blushed, laughing nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healthy appetite indeed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>POP-POP!!</b> went the last two buttons on Maddie's pajama shirt, sending her bloated belly lurching forth with a slosh, actually bumping the table. She just blushed, and gave a sheepish grin to her mother.</span></div></div>",

You're gonna be such a big girl soon.\" She gave Maddie's grumbling and very stuffed belly another pat and then straightened up, relieving most of the pressure on her clothes. \"Why don't you go to bed and sleep it off cream cake? Mommy will clean up and make you a nice lunch for when you wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie nodded gratefully and groaned as she shifted her body to sit sideways on the chair, her belly rubbing against the table. She stopped to gather herself and wait for her gut to stop sloshing before attempting to stand. Fortunately she was small enough that she didn't have to get up very far. She let out a loud grunt of exertion as she stood, partly launching herself off the chair with her arms. She staggered for a moment as she adjusted to the new weight but the sloshing of her full belly didn't make it easy for her. She managed to stay on her feet and steadied her belly with her hands, holding it almost like a baby holding a large rubber ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a tentative step forward wish jostled her belly a bit but she managed remain firm footed. Shen then took another step, more confident this time and boldly took another step right afterwards. She finally developed a waddle that could keep her going at a steady pace, despite her belly's sloshing from side to side as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon managed to return to her bedroom and stopped by the bed to lay her belly onto it, taking a load off of her body. It sure was heavy and it would take a while for her large meal to turn into fat and spread throughout the rest of her body, making it easier to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning she rolled forward onto her belly, creating a loud sloshing sound and letting out another belch as the gas was forced out of her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" she muttered quietly, remembering her manners. Grunting she crawled along her bed, dragging her belly along with her. The bed frame uttered a few groans of stress as she moved her bulk into a comfortable sleeping position, flopping onto her side. She grabbed her blankets and pulled them up over her body, sighing contently as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently cradled her stomach as she started to drift to sleep, until she finally lost consciousness and started to dream while her belly churned and gurgled.</span></div></div>",

On the other side stood a fridge, and not just a normal one either; this one had to be at least the size of a house! This, coupled with the child's short stature, made it seem rather intimidating, despite her always seeing one as a storage for her favourite treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrrruuuwwwll...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of treats, Maddie's round middle began to demand some, and quite loudly at that. Just then, the humongous door of the fridge unstuck itself and began to slowly open, as if Maddie's stomach had spoken a password to unlock it. The loud hum of the fridge light sounded, and the light inside revealed that not only did the oversized appliance hold ordinarily sized shelves, but that they were filled to the brim with all sorts of sugary goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie watched with wonder as the desserts began to float off the shelves in single file, coming to rest on the table in front of the chubby child and filling up the tabletop with mass quantities of snacks; cakes, pies, muffins, cookies, cupcakes, and large pitchers of chocolate milk all sat in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping drool off her mouth with a thick arm, Maddie grinned and reached down for the first thing in front of her; a plate of chocolate chip cookies. But before she could grab one, the one she aimed for magically raised up into the air on its own, as if knowing it'd be chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greedy girl blinked, puzzled at this little display. The cookie ran itself beneath her nose, allowing her to take in the mouthwatering aroma of chocolate and biscuit which caused another growl in her stomach and a sliver of drool in the corner of her mouth. The little treat gently bumped itself against her mouth, as if asking her to open it. Interpreting it as so, she opened wide and allowed the cookie to float safely inside before crunching it up out of instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the cookie, a few more began to rise up, and she repeated the process with those. And then more, and more, and <i>more</i>, until the plate was emptied. What Maddie failed to notice was, not only did she not feel full from the small mountain of cookies she'd just ate, but she had gotten much rounder and thicker; her belly and sides pushed even more against her straining pyjamas, her thighs becoming tight against her pants. Her hands got pudgier and her face got rounder, but she was oblivious to all but the food in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate poofed out of existance, and a large chocolate cake slid in front of her, magically cutting itself into big thick slices that were fed to the red haired glutton one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate and grew, she eventually began to grow in height as well as weight. The chair creaked and bended as its occupant slowly outgrew it, before finally giving up and collapsing in a heap of sticks and splinters. Maddie wasn't harmed though, or even aware; she just happily allowed this magical food to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she ate, and ate, and grew fatter, and larger, the plethora of desserts not ceasing or even slowing down...</span></div></div>",

She had made it so much bigger that there was no way she could stay mad at it. Her belly had become a huge orb that, if she were older, would have made her look 9 months pregnant with at least one baby, maybe two. She leaned back to compensate for her large tum and cupped her hands underneath. She lifted the great weight with a slight grunt and dropped it. After watching it bounce a few times before settling, a sharp growl reminded her of her mission. Her tummy voiced it's complaint about being played with and not fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playtime can wait, I'm hungry\" her belly seemed to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands on top of her behemoth tummy she started to drum her hands on top of hit and hummed a tune as she waddled her way down into the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big loud growl!

She blinked a few times, confused, glancing around the room. Where were her parents? Why was she sitting at the table if not for a meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a breeze and looked down, realising suddenly that she was naked. Her pudgy, pale body was completely unclothed, oversized belly sitting comfortably on her soft thighs, which themselves sat on the cool wood of the chair. Cali bit her lip, glancing furtively around the dining room again. Wh-why wasn't she wearing anything?! She wasn't a particularly self-conscious girl, but it'd be super awkward if mom caught her hanging around the dining room without any clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, her belly spoke.<br>\r\n\"Feed... meee...\" the faint voice came from her midsection, barely audible. Cali's eyes widened in shock and she stared down at her bloated tummy, mouth hanging open. <br>\r\n\"Feed... me!\" the voice came again, a little louder this time, too loud for her to pretend she hadn't heard it.<br>\r\n\"A-are you my tummy?\" she directed the question down at her own body, hardly able to accept that this was happening. Was this a miracle? Mommy always said that miracles were wonderful things that couldn't be explained, and she definitely couldn't explain this. Whether it was wonderful though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Feed me!\"</b> her stomach bellowed, and suddenly with a sound like tearing paper it split open across her belly button to reveal a salivating, gnashing mouth. <b>\"FEED ME!\"</b><br>\r\nCali screamed, falling off the chair and trying to crawl away from her own torso. She scrabbled across the floor on her back, eyes wide and staring as she tried to comprehend the gaping maw now dividing her midsection.<br>\r\nHer brain kicked into gear for a second and she leaped to her feet, stumbling to the fridge and yanking it open. She reached in and began grabbing everything she could reach - slices of ham, eggs, milk, butter - and dumping it onto the floor. Then she collapsed down next to the pile and began unwrapping, unpeeling, unpacking, before flinging everything she could into the crunching mouth on her belly. <br>\r\nIt slurped it all down - ready meals or ingredients, raw or cooked, sweet and sour and salty all swallowed down by the ravenous mouth in its insatiable quest for satisfaction. Before long, everything was gone, all the food Cali could find obliterated; and still the mouth was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"FEED ME!\"</b> it roared, and Cali burst into frantic tears.<br>\r\n\"I can't! I've given you everything! I can't feed you any more!\" she pleaded with it. There was a brief silence, and then...<br>\r\n<b>\"THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO EAT YOU INSTEAD\"</b> it thundered, and began opening wider and wider, taking up more and more of her body. In seconds the mouth had encompassed her, the impossibility of the situation coming second to her terror as sharp teeth snapped shut over her head, cutting off her horrified screams once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she woke up on the kitchen floor, shivering and shaking. Her pyjamas were stained and damp, and as she glanced around she saw dozens of empty food packets littering the tiled floor. With trembling hands she yanked the front of her top open, tearing the buttons off in her haste, but where the terrible mouth had been only moments before there was now just the smooth white flesh of her swollen belly.<br>\r\nUnspeakably relieved, she lay back again on the cool tiles and fell immediately asleep.</span></div></div>",

Her daughter asking politely for something and not just demanding it? What on earth had happened?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cali was sulking. In her eight years of life, if she hadn't wanted something, it hadn't happened. As long as she wailed for long enough, thrashed her arms, cried and sobbed and whined, then eventually her parents would cave and she'd get her way. When they'd tried to limit TV to only five hours a day - when she didn't want that nurse's appointment - when she really, <i>really</i> wanted that pink dress - every single time, they'd give up and let her have what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single time except now.<br>\r\nShe'd bawled her eyes out, smashed her mom's favourite chinaware, punched her father in the knees, torn the rest of the buttons off her shirt, stomped her feet, yelled that she hated both of them, beaten her fists on the floor until she was red in the face - and yet she was sitting in the back of the car headed to her Auntie Aida's nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were absolutely resolute; she was going to go and stay with her aunt and cousins for a while, and nothing she could do would change their minds. For exactly how long, they wouldn't say - or even why she was going, or where they would be in the meantime. They'd just waited until she'd bawled herself into exhaustion, then her dad had picked her up (with some difficulty - she wasn't exactly a light child) and carried her to the car, where he'd buckled her securely into her carseat. Her mom had brought her breakfast, which Cali had immediately flung right back into her face; something she was now regretting three hours of driving later as her tummy was beginning to rumble more and more loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was sulking. No matter how greedy or hungry she might be, sulking took precedence, so she absolutely refused to say a word. As far as she was concerned, she was never speaking to her parents ever again. Her arms were folded resolutely over her pudgy chest, shoulders raised, eyes red and puffy from crying. She was still wearing her pyjama top, now hanging completely open at the front, but she was in such a mood that she didn't even care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just trying to think of another word that rhymed with 'hate' for a new song about her parents, when the sound of the car's tires on gravel alerted her to the fact that her journey was finally over. The car slowed to a stop, and her father opened the door for her and began unbuckling her from her car seat.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, princess, but this is the only way,\" he said, looking upset. She wouldn't even look at him though as she climbed out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuntie Aida's house was a modest, detached property, all red-brick and white-framed windows. She scowled at it - right then, it could have been a beautiful fairytale mansion and she'd have hated it. In front of the house stood three people, one of which she recognised as her Aunt Aida. An aged, crow-like woman, she wore a rather tiny pair of spectacles on a rather large nose. Next to her stood a boy aged perhaps 15 or 16, then beside him two girls. One looked around her age, the other a couple of years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were already greeting Aida, hugging and shaking hands. Cali hung back behind them, not wanting to show any interest in the people who would be her new family. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, Cali's in a bit of a mood,\" she heard her mom explaining tearfully, \"We had to spring this on her unexpectedly.\"<br>\r\n\"That's quite all right, Rachel,\" Aida replied, embracing her sister, \"It's perfectly reasonable to be upset given the circumstances.\" She smiled over at Cali, \"Come and say hello, dear. It's not going to be as bad as you think, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Cali trotted forwards, and was almost immediately pulled into an embrace by her aunt. The older woman's bony body managed to dig into her own soft one in about a dozen places, and she was extremely pleased when Aida eventually pulled back and let her free.<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce you to everyone, dear,\" Aida said, gesturing first to the teenage boy, \"This is Aiden, my oldest. He's a good lad, helps me with things since my husband passed away. He's used to dealing with his little sisters so I'm sure you'll get along fine.\" <br>\r\nShe pointed next at the girl who looked around Cali's age, \"This is Beth. She's eight, like you; I'm sure you two are going to be firm friends in no time.\"<br>\r\nCali doubted that. Just about the only things she liked were music and TV, and she loathed just about every type of sport. This girl was not only wearing a soccer jersey, she was also wearing a baseball cap and wearing running shoes; Cali hated her already.<br>\r\nFinally, Aunt Aida waved at the smallest girl, \"And this is Mel, my youngest. She's six.\"<br>\r\nMel waved at Cali excitably, looking delighted by the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, are you hungry dear? I've got some food prepared inside for you if you are.\"</span></div></div>",

She let out a stubborn sigh. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Aida smiled and ushered her kids in, and Cali's parents grabbed her into a hug before she could follow.<br>\r\n\"We're really sorry, princess,\" her dad muttered, \"but it's just for a little while.

A soggy plate of salad leaves, thinly sliced tomato, cucumber pieces and sugar snap peas, topped by a lonely piece of boiled chicken breast... for a girl used to adult-sized meals of fast food all to herself, it was mockery.<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right?\" she asked, looking at the healthy meal with visible disgust.<br>\r\nAunt Aida raised a solitary eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't. I take it you're not a fan of salad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a fan of <i>rabbit food!</i>\" Cali said, turning red again as she geared up for another tantrum. As if this day wasn't already the worst! \"I want pizza. Or- or a burger!\"<br>\r\nA flicker of a frown cast its shadow over Aida's face, but almost at once it was replaced by an indulging smile.<br>\r\n\"Well we don't really eat that kind of thing ourselves, but I'll see what I can do, alright? Now how about you and Beth head upstairs and take a look at your room while I get something sorted for you, hmm?\" The two locked eyes for a minute. Cali wanted to continue making demands so that she'd have an excuse to keep sulking, but it seemed Aida was more concerned with keeping the peace than sticking to principle. Well... that could work for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Cali nodded her head. If Auntie Aida was this much of a pushover, maybe this unexpected trip wouldn't be as bad as she had feared after all.<br>\r\nShe was still feeling fairly irritable though - a state only exacerbated by her rumbling, hungry stomach - so she took the opportunity to slam the door as she followed Beth out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she was out of earshot, Aiden turned to his mother, eyes flashing with righteous indignation.<br>\r\n\"Mom, why are we doing this? The kid's a brat!\" he exclaimed, \"Best case scenario she makes our lives miserable the whole time she's here - worst case her attitude rubs off on Beth and Mel and she makes our lives miserable for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Aida shook her head, the smile dropping from her face.<br>\r\n\"I know. But I promised my sister I'd look after her. She shouldn't be here for too long; can't you put up with her for a little while?\" she pleaded apologetically, \"Maybe we can even straighten out her attitude a bit along the way, send her back to her parents a little better than how she came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Aiden's turn to shake his head.<br>\r\n\"You've started us off on the wrong foot then already. You should'a made her eat the salad. Kid obviously isn't gonna starve any time soon, it'd probably do her good.\"<br>\r\nHis mother sighed deeply.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, but she needs to trust someone around here. At least we can let her eat what she wants for the first few days, just to ease her in. This is a big change for her as well, remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Aiden grumbled, grinding his teeth, \"She'd better not give my little sisters any bad ideas though, or I'll, I'll...\" he trailed off, not entirely sure what he'd do. He could only hope she wasn't going to be too bad an influence on the household...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile upstairs, Cali was discovering yet another bad thing in a day of bad things - she wasn't going to get her own room; or even, for that matter, her own bed. She was sharing a bunk bed with Beth, and faced with the prospect of a dozen different soccer players grimacing down on her every night from their posters as she went to sleep, her mood was darker than ever. Before she could demand they were taken down though...</span></div></div>",

The other girl was adept at video games - almost as good as Cali herself - and seemed happy and friendly despite Cali's admittedly abrasive attitude, playing down her own victories and lauding Cali's. By the time Aunt Aida called them down for breakfast (now probably late enough to be called lunch) she was starting to feel that this stay away might actually be fun after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls hurried down the stairs towards the kitchen, a starving Cali in the lead. Her rumbling stomach had become louder and louder as they had played their game, her gut so used to constantly digesting food that it was made miserable by even this temporary deprivation. She burst into the kitchen, and was thoroughly delighted to see several boxes of takeaway pizza sitting on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to treat us all, since it's your first day here. I'm afraid our meals aren't usually so unhealthy,\" Aunt Aida began to explain, but Cali wasn't remotely listening. She'd already wrenched open one of the boxes, grabbed a thick slice of greasy pizza from within and was stuffing it into her mouth. Aida, Mel, Beth and Aiden all looked on with mixed awe, disgust and fascination as she swallowed it down with nary a chew, oil and tomato sauce dripping from her chin to further stain her already ruined pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the slice disappeared into her overused mouth, Cali looked around and seemed to surprised to find everyone staring at her. <br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" she asked, mouth still full of pizza, \"I wa' hungry!\" She slid into a chair and took another slice of pizza, eating it only slightly slower than the last piece. Shrugging, the other members of the family sat down as well and began to dig in, though with far less enthusiasm than Cali. They weren't a health-crazy family by any means, but pizza for breakfast was still strange for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope this is enough for her...\" Aiden muttered under his breath.</span></div></div>",

She quickly slid onto the ladder and pursued, catching up to Cali as the chubbier girl entered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cali, what'cha doing? We're not supposed to be up this late,\" she whispered urgently, but Cali ignored her and headed straight for the fridge. Beth thought she was muttering something about a mouth under her breath, but it was so soft that she couldn't be sure. \"Cali!\" Beth grabbed the other girl by the arm, making her jump sharply.

I was just... just... just getting a midnight snack, y'know? I do it all the time back at home,\" Cali invented hastily.

I don't think mom would like that... she needs that milk to make her shakes tomorrow anyway...\" she blathered anxiously, wringing her hands as Cali pulled the lid off and began chugging directly from the carton. Honestly, Cali wasn't a big fan of milk - especially semi-skimmed - but she wasn't thinking straight right then, trying only to cover up her most recent visitation by the belly-mouth.<br>\r\nAfter she'd drunk a fair amount, and now feeling quite sick, she shoved the milk into Beth's hands.<br>\r\n\"There you go, your turn. Drink up,\" she said, wiping her mouth with her sleeve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"I can't! Mom'll be mad. We're not even supposed to be down here!\"<br>\r\nNow Cali rolled her own eyes.<br>\r\n\"Your mom'll just blame me anyway, you may as well,\" she said, now genuinely interested in whether she could convince the other girl break the rules, \"And it tastes <i>really</i> good,\" she lied, trying her best not to look too queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Beth raised the carton to her mouth and took the tiniest sip; then immediately shoved it back into Cali's hands.<br>\r\n\"I- I did it!\" she squeaked excitably, \"I did it!\"<br>\r\n\"Pff, barely,\" Cali mocked, passing the carton back to her, \"Drink properly or it doesn't count.\"<br>\r\nWith more confidence this time Beth drank, gulping down almost everything left in the carton. Then she put it hurriedly back in the fridge and slammed the door.<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I feel kinda ill,\" she admitted, hands on her stomach. Normally completely flat, it was now bulging ever so slightly from all the milk. \"Can we go back to bed now?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Cali nodded. Her own belly made Beth look emaciated, a great bulge of flab that stuck out sharply from the rest of her body. Even it looked a bit more swollen than usual though. \"Let's go back to bed...\" </span></div></div>",

Both girls' bellies had slimmed a bit from the milk the night before, Beth back to looking slim and Cali still as round as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls greeted each other before getting dressed, Beth quickly getting into a soccer shirt and shorts while Cali lazily slid on comfy black pants and a pretty pink top, which both looked rather snug on her plump form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all set up, they headed downstairs for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

She grabbed a piece of toast and spread toppings on it as Cali had, then tasted it - and grimaced. It was sickly-sweet, thick enough to get stuck in her teeth and so sugary it seemed to burn her taste buds. There was a certain... tantalising aftertaste to it, though; she nibbled at it again, then a little more, and before she knew it it was completely gone. She could feel it sitting in her stomach, intensely filling. She'd only had one slice and she felt stuffed - Cali was on her fourth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then though, Aunt Aida spoke.<br>\r\n\"We're in need of some more groceries. If anyone would like to come and give me a hand, I would much appreciate it,\" she said, looking around the room. Immediately Mel volunteered, excited to visit the supermarket - then, to everyone's surprise, Cali's hand, smeared as it was with honey and chocolate spread, poked its way into the air.<br>\r\n\"I'll come,\" she mumbled, mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you both,\" said Aida, looking impressed. \"We're leaving in twenty minutes, so go and brush your teeth and get ready and we can set off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali nodded. She was finally feeling full, and the new day had left her in a surprisingly good mood all things considered. However, that positive attitude was soon to be challenged...</span></div></div>",

She smiled and patted her belly, watching the waves of fat ripple its soft supple, yet gravity defying surface. Her belly responded with a series of purring gurgles of affection, causing the sphere to jiggle noticeably. The greedy beast that she had cultivated and grown had gotten bigger than it was yesterday, and she was determined to keep that trend going, seeing as she was going to try to persuade Mel to get her all the foods she wanted. As it had grown bigger, it seemed to take on a mind of it's own, seeming to even have emotions that would correspond to Cali's mood. It would loudly growl when she was angry and purr when she was happy. Right now though, it was making her clothes feel very tight, meaning that a shopping trip was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of shopping trip, she snapped out of her deep thought and turned to go to the bathroom. She hopped up in front of the bathroom mirror and grabbed her toothbrush. As she was brushing, Beth came in to join her.

With a yawn and stretch, she sat up and looked around. It had all been a dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali's room looked pretty average for an 8 year old girl. Loads of pink things and dolls littered both the walls and floors. The only thing that seemed a little out of place was the number of princess outfits the little girl could see in her closet. They looked recently used and were well worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to the average observer this would be just another little girl thing Cali was into. However, her mother knew better. They were a bit of a testament to how the chubby girl felt about herself. She loved acting like a spoiled, pampered and yes even bratty, princess. It was why she would sometimes were the costumes around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, today wasn't going to be one of those days.

She smiled, feeling her belly tighten before a noisy gurgle moaned out from the stuffed depths of her belly. She giggled slightly and wore a huge smile on her face. That was what she loved the most. Her belly going crazy with noises! She loved when her belly growled, whether it was full or empty. Sometimes, she'd go to school without eating breakfast, causing her belly to growl loudly and hungrily in class! Most of her classmates thought it was funny, but only a few knew about her secret love of belly noises. The thought of going to school on a hungry growling stomach, then stuffing herself at lunch so much to make it gurgle loudly the rest of the day put a smile on her face as she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slept soundly throughout the night and woke up with a smile and a stretch.

A small stack of pancakes, 4 scrambled eggs, a few sausages, half a dozen strips of thick-cut bacon, and of course a giant bowl of her favorite sugary cereal with heavy cream poured over it as opposed to milk. The little girl happily stuffed her face with the fattening fare, all the while her mother packing her an even more fattening lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to force herself to eat everything placed before her the young Brianna bleched loudly, wiping her grease-soaked hands across her equally greasy face.<br>\r\nFinishing up with another big belch she tried to pull her shirt down over her overstuffed belly. Riding up over the mound in her middle that held more calories than a girl her age would need all day after just one meal. Scooching her chair back she hopped down and waddled over to her mother. \"Momma...\" Her rounded stuffed gut prominently poking out. The sounds of digestion gurgling and churning as she rubbed it. \"Is there more?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled excitedly. \"Well of course sweetie! But you are going to eat it on the way, we are running late!\" Brianna nodded in agreement, grabbed her backpack and waddled to the car. Her mother following close behind with her daughter's lunchbox, if it could still be considered one as it was more like a small cooler in size and capacity. Placing it on the seat next to her blubbery baby girl, her mother strained to clasp the car seat around Brianna's belly. Finally succeeding she got in the driver's seat and began to drive away as her daughter continued her feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was only a short 20-minute drive, Brianna had devoured everything only a few minutes in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kim looked to the big fire that was burning. The light got reflected in her eyes. Around the fire were a lot of trailers or camper's. A lot of people were sitting or standing around the fie. Some were eating, talking or reading, little kids were chasing each other and some teens tried to find  spot to make out (or maybe even more then that).<br>\r\nKim's real name was Kimberly but everyone called her Kim except for her grandparents. Kim liked being a gypsy. Most important reason she liked being a gypsy was that gypsy's were honest and did't judged people because  how they looked or the way how they lived. Kim was a real Gypsy she wore long dresses and normally a scarf around the top of her head. Some times also some bracelets. <br>\r\nGypsy's were more fair against people who looked a bit different. Like Esmeralda. She was born without legs or feet. But she could walk very well on her hands. She could walk even faster on her hands then most other kids running. In the place were she was born people still really believed in god and the devil and when Esmeralda was born many people believed her mother had done something terrible that her daughter was cursed and that was why she was born without legs. Other people believed that her mother made a deal with a devil and that she give him the legs of her first born for something else. Almost no one wanted to see them so her father bought a trailer and joined the gypsy's and they accepted the three people and no one ever made a problem about the fact she had no legs.<br>\r\nShe looked in the direction of the city and saw the many lights burning. Kim was't very fond of he city. She did't mind the city that much but it was more how people there reacted to them. They only tried to make a bit of money with fortune telling, hand reading or tricks. But most people acted like they were riffraff and thief's. When she sometime saw a kid looking in her direction or did a step towards her his or her parent took the kid tight by the wrist saying they could better stay away from people like her. Like if she had some threatening disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... are we save this time? I don't want that people throw a rock through my window like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I talked with Daniel and he said he made sure we could stay here. So legally the can't force us to go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked towards Daniel's trailer. One of the best. Daniel was the leader. A muscled man with long blond hair. He loved to party but he knew very well that some things were more important and he always made sure they could stay somewhere safely before he did any other thing. She saw his teenage daughter sitting outside. Slender, with a perfect skin, long blond hair that fell like a waterfall over her shoulders and DD boobs. Boy's all thought she was beautiful and some were drooling over her. Especially when it was warm weather and she left her breasts naked. <br>\r\nNot that naked was special or unusual for them. A lot of people washed themselves or their children outside and anyone could see them, and when there was a sunny day some of them went sun bathing naked. No one of them really cared if someone was naked so their kids also never cared if somebody was naked. When it was warm weather and they were near a pond or lake some kids (also sometimes boys and girls) went swimming naked together and no one really cared<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We Gypsy's are proud of what we have.\" She mumbled. \"Mom! is dad almost back with our food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped dad also get some vegetables and fruit. While a lot of parents had trouble to let their children eat vegetables or fruit Kim always loved vegetables and fruit. That was probably also the reason she was pretty thin. She also ate grains and meat or fish not because she liked hat so much but you need that food too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost honey.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked at the two buses they had. It were double-decker's. One was from Johnny. He had long hair and a peace sign around his neck. His bus was full of books. Books for little kids who just learned how to read till big books for adults like books from Stephen King. You could always borrow as many books from Johnny as you wanted. It was like their own personal library.<br>\r\nThe other bus was from mister a misses Jefferson. They used to be teachers and took  lot of books an other school stuff when they joined he gypsy's. They gave every child that lived with them a good education. Something like their own school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Kim I'm back with food.\" Her dad said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I'm starving.\" Kim sad and followed her father inside. \"Wat did you take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well today I tried to make it easy so I bought some Mc Donalds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kim asked who never had eaten Mc Donalds before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have for you a hamburger, some fries, a milkshake and a salad especially for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought the hamburger looked a bit strange. Meat and salad on a bun with sauce. But like her mother always said you always need to try something new. She took one bite and was sold. She fast wolfed her hamburger down. It tasted terrific. She could't remember she ever before ate something that tasted so good. So delicious. She took one sip from her vanilla milkshake and loved the creamy liquid. She tasted fries before but they never tasted so good like these.<br>\r\nAfter she ate the fries she took her salad. Even while she liked it, it was't so good like the hamburger. She washed the salad down with the last of her milkshake and leaned back. That was her best meal ever. However her dress felt a bit tighter.   <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",
