Can't really say the place were headed for is safe for someone like you.\" Though he try to surpress it, you can't help but gulp. You could always tell him the center didn't send you, but then what? He would swallow you down in a hot second. Its probably better to just play along for now. You follow the young wolf down the stairs to the kitchen and out the side door. Standing outside is the weirdest group of teenagers you ever layed eyes on. Rudy starts to name them for you as you get closer. First he points to a strongly built wolf wearing a blue jacket and fleece draped over his shoulders, \"Thats Bruno, he's my best friend.\" Next he pointed to the sheep beside him. \"Thats Corrie, his girlfriend....\" You can tell from the disgust in his voice that he doesn't approve. He then points to the last member of the group, a fox girl with pigtails and glasses, \"This is my girl Fiona.\" As you guys draw closer Fiona steps forward. She gives Rudy a soft smile and then  turns to smile at you, though this time its much more sinister. \"Well Rudy its about time, we've been waiting forever. We were supposed to catch a bite to eat BEFORE heading to the county carnival. Now I know you didn't just make us wait for nothing. You wouldn't just let us stand outside on your lawn for 40 minutes unless you had something important to do.\" Rudy has started to look very uncomfortable. \"Well uhhhh..... yeah, I had very important stuff to do.\" Fiona's face contorted in rage, \"You liar I heard your stereo. You could hear that head banger garbage from a mile away. The only reason we didn't rush in is because your mom assured us you were finishing up your history project!\" If Rudy could blush under all that fur, he certainly was doing so now. \"I'm sorry it just slipped my mind.\" Bruno just laughed while Corrie shook her head. \"Alright,\" Fiona snapped, \"Lets just go..... who is this guy?\" Rudy turns his attention back to you, \"Oh, this is....uhhhhh..\" Fiona's face suddenly lit up, \"Oh you brought him along as a snack! Good, I'm starving, give him to me.\" You expect Rudy to deny it immediately and tell them about how your there to help out. Unfortunately Rudy doesn't respond. You look up to see that he is concentrating hard. \"Rudy, tell her.\" Your starting to grow nervouse. You came here to help out!!!...... Or at least thats what he thinks. He wouldn't sacrifice you to appease his angry girlfriend would he? I mean, even preds have morals right? All of a sudden you start to tremble.</span></div></div>",

It may not be possible, and if it isn't then you have to learn to survive,\" she tells you as she punches a few buttons on one console and then motions for you to stand beside her, instantly you are caught up in a flash of light and are suddenly standing in a room that seems to come straight out of the history books of Old Terra.

I was given the impression that humans weren't quite that light on their feet,\" she comments to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well some of us aren't, but as a First Class duel winner I have few extra points in that regard,\" you tell her, spinning the pistol on you finger like some of the cowboys you've seen in old movies before returning it to its holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because I think you're going to need it,\" she tells you, walking up to the door of the house, whose mail box has the name Dewclaw on it. Not a good sign and you find your hand on the pistols butt as Ms. Aura knocks. After a few moments the door opens to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wolf woman and a rabbit man(Kevin and Kell)</span></div></div>",

Oddly you find the presence of a carrion eater to be comforting, as the boy, or rather wolf boy in shades looks her up and down before turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, they went out to take Lindesfarne to a special class for her insect hunting. Coney went with them. So what's with the short, rat thing?\" he asks pointing at you and snickering. You really want to hurt the wolf cub, but Ms. Aura's wing blocks you path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a rat thing Rudy. His name is Corrin Markus and he happens to be a lemur,\" she corrects him. He looks at you again and then nods while looking up in to space in a thoughtful gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right lemurs. You use them in a few of my mom's favorite dishes,\" he comments, smiling at you out of the corner of his mouth. Again you move to attack him, and again Ms. Aura blocks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not an ingredient Rudy. He's a member of a friends family and he needs a place to stay for a while, until his parents get back. I need to ask your parents if it's okay with them,\" she tells him, and then looks back at you with a warning eye. Obviously she knows you could take the wolf boy, and doesn't want you hurting him. Too bad, the kid is asking for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see where mom would have a problem with that, and Kevin usually listens to her. So why don't you try back in an hour. I'll have the oven warmed up by then,\" he says, smiling at you again and showing off his fangs. You nearly let the rage take over and attack him, but instead do a three breathe exercise designed to calm an agitated mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, well then I'll come back later,\" she tells him, waving goodbye even as she flutters off into the air, grabbing you by your shoulders and then hauling you up into her tree house. Landing proves to be a bit softer when you are dropped feet first and you are standing again eye to eye with the condor woman who is now your only possibility of getting home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that could have gone better,\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" you ask her sarcastically, moving to sit down in one of the odd chairs that you could have sworn weren't in the room before. Considering the avians' tech level you didn't doubt that they might be new to the room if not the planet, placed there for your comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

After all this is a world of eat or be eaten, jungle law, and whatever other synonyms for wild you can think of, and humans were not really that threatening a species to such things, at least not by looks alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wolf pup was nothing Aura.

Beating on Rudy might be satisfying emotionally, but socially it was lacking in ept or grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, but if what you told me is true then I have to establish myself as a predator or at least as a violent person before class tomorrow, otherwise I'm going to have to deal with them all day trying to take bites out of me,\" you respond to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. I'm a teacher of the class and I can keep most of the students off you, simply by lying and saying you're poisonous or something,\" she says, taking a perch that faces the chair in which you're sitting. You find anger welling up in you again, but do your best to contain it as you face the avian woman in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hide behind shields like that. I am a Terminal Gamer, and we do not hide when fighting is more efficient. If you just give me a chance tomorrow I'll prove it to you,\" you tell her, and from there the conversation shifts to other matters, including subject material for tomorrow's class, and what you are going to wear, which is at least for now going to be what you have on. For almost an hour you continue to debate things with the woman when a honking horn announces the arrival of the family below.

This time instead of being pushed you leap out of the door, letting the rope coil outward behind you, and causing you to halt a few feet off the ground before it rips out of your hand. Pulling your legs in you roll along the ground for a few seconds before leaping up and standing in a battle posture, this time leaving the pistol holstered at your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening you eyes you find yourself face to tooth with the wolf woman who has leaped between you and her family, obviously intending on protecting them from you, but luckily before she can launch a preemptive strike Ms. Aura lands between the two and holds out her hands to stop you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin, impressive as that was, please don't do that again. It seems a lot like an aggressive move,\" she warns you, obviously startled by what you just did. The wolf woman, upon seeing your avian jailer/advisor/bodyguard stops in mid-pounce and un-ruffles her fur before walking up to the woman more calmly than you would have thought possible for someone just so recently agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms. Aura, this young being wouldn't happen to be one of your's would it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment he is anyway, Kell. I was wondering if you would have any problem with him staying with me while his parents are away on business,\" she asks somewhat sheepishly, a new emotion for her in your eyes. She hadn't kowtowed to anyone else, but then this wolf woman was supposed to be her landlord, and that might explain a bit of the subservience. Feeling a need to show respect you bow to the woman you now know is named Kell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\" you tell her as you rise, realizing her height for the first time, and making you feel even more like a midget as she stands up straight from her own battle stance and then bows back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise. And Aura, any friend of your's is a friend of ours, so long as he knows the rules of the house,\" she tells Aura, and you look at the bird woman with a raised eyebrow. She hadn't mentioned anything about house rules, though she had been a little busy telling you about the social rules of this strange planet you now find yourself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hadn't gotten around to telling him all of them, but I'm sure he can learn quick enough. Corrin, why don't you help them with those grocery bags while I discuss some things with Mrs. Dewclaw, hmm?\" she says, almost sweetly. You contain your own distaste for the woman and wander over to where a very tall rabbit man is unloading brown bags from the car, handing them to what looks like a porcupine girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the suggestion you walk over and pick up two of the bags yourself and follow the girl as she walks into the house. You notice as you follow her that she can't seem to take her eyes off you, and not in the same way as the wolf boy. Her attention is not on you as a food source, instead you can see an inquisitive sparkle in her eye as she looks up and down you body, making you feel even smaller compared to her.

For a moment, just a moment you almost answer the question with your species name, just as you would with any customs official, but you catch yourself just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a...Short Haired Lemur, and my name is Corrin Markus,\" you tell her, trying to act proud of the lie you are having to live down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A short hair lemur?\" she says questioningly, looking you up and down and circling around you. Something tells you that she doesn't believe, and that she may just know what you are, although how she would is beyond you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We aren't really common, indigenous to only a few island chains,\" you say, hoping that this world is similar to Old Home Terra in the distribution of species, and that this porcupine girl has never actually met a lemur before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok then. Well my name is Lindesfarne Dewclaw. Welcome to our side of the world,\" she tells you, still looking at you out of the corner of her eye, as if she knows that you are lying. Trying to shrug off the feeling you follow her back outside to find that Rudy and the big rabbit man already have the groceries well in hand and are taking them inside, with Mrs. Dewclaw and Ms. Aura trailing behind talking in low voices, though you hear your name and Rudy's both used at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have a bad feeling about this?\" you mutter to yourself as you bring up the rear of the new formation going into the house of the Dewclaw's. Once inside the door closes behind you with a thud like the knelling of a death bell, nearly causing you to throw yourself against it and run, but you control that primal instinct. After all you've been in worse straights than this, and you will survive, if only so you can go back and finish that match the bird brains pulled you away from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting the rest of the bags in the kitchen the entire family, plus you and Aura enter what you would call a sitting room, everyone else taking a personalized seat, leaving you standing with your foot against the wall near the exit. Most of the eyes in the room shift from you to Ms. Aura, obviously asking her for the explanation on your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, now that we're settled I have some introductions to make,\" says the bird woman from a perch waving her hand around the room in an all encompassing gesture before bring her wing to solely point at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone this is Corrin Markus. His family has been a friend of mine for many generations, and a few hours ago his parents were forced to ask me if I would take care of him for a while,\" she says, already falling fast into the lie that her people fabricated for you, and pointing at each of the family members for you in turn, saying their names for you and causing you to nod at each. Kevin is the name of the rabbit, and he is the father of the family, with Kell, the wolf woman, as his lovely wife. Rudy and Lindesfarne both nod in response to your nods at them, and Rudy smiles that infuriating smile of his. The last memeber of the family is apparently a baby rabbit named Coney, though you know the eyes of a predator when you see one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin this is everyone.

You knew from hat Aura told you earlier that her people were the teachers on this planet. Most of them anyway, and so any class you go to will be at least somewhat protected, but obviously Ms. Aura is still intent on keeping her personal eyes on you. Not that it matters to you. One jailer is the same as any other as far as you're concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rudy. Corrin will be attending your class, and I hope you help him to try and fit in. He's new to this area and Ms. Aura says he's probably not going to be too good at fitting in right at first. You will help him, right?\" asks Kell in a voice that you can't help but admire. A voice and tone that remind you so much of Jasmine. Rudy, with a very reluctant grunt, agrees, or at least you think that growling sound means he agrees as Kell and Kevin both smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then. So Corrin, where exactly are you from?\" asks Kell innocently, not noticing the spark in her daughter's eyes that makes you feel like walking out of the room, but you can't run away, not from a simple question, so you answer with the information you can remember about lemurs on Old Home Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the south seas, Mrs. Dewclaw. A small island chain with very little resources, but a beautiful ocean view, and trees more beautiful and colorful than anything you could believe,\" you tell her, trying to sound homesick. Taking a sidelong glance at Ms. Aura you find that she's nodding in approval. Obviously this planet is a lot like Old Terra, more so than you thought would be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice. So why did your parents leave?\" she asks, just as innocently, though this time Aura's eyes also go a bit wide, knowing that you haven't been told that part of your cover story. You decide that in this case ignorance my be the best defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know myself. My parents don't think I'm ready to get too involved in the business adults yet, so they just told me it was important for them to leave and that Ms. Aura could take care of me until their business was concluded and they could swing by and take me back home,\" you tell them, trying your best to act like one of those teenagers from the old holo films about American society of the twentieth century, namely uninterested and uncaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I would think you'd have someone closer than that who was able to take care of you,\" commented Mrs. Dewclaw as she looked at you, luckily this time it is Ms. Aura's turn to fill in the gaps in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is, but since his parents are going to be over here they want to be able to at least visit their son, so he's staying with me so that they can at least be on the same side of the planet as each other,\" says the bird lady, more pointedly than she probably should have, but none of those around seem to notice as they nod in agreement. Family values must be a bit higher in this society than in the ones of the old Americans. The family, well Kell and Ms. Aura anyway, spend the next few hours droning on about things which don't matter to you at all, and you can see a look of utter boredom in Rudy's eyes that you know is mirrored in your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you are too different after all. At last though the conversation of the two women runs to a close, and they say good night while Ms. Aura leads you towards the door of the Dewclaw home. Once outside she prepares to take you up in her claws again but you stop her, grabbing onto the rope and pulling yourself up to her home. Though it does take a bit longer than flying would have, climbing gives you the physical exertion you need to clear your mind, and face the two bird people, Ms. Aura and her son, with a cal and centered mind once you get up to their tree house and then coil up the rope before hanging it on a hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you like the Dewclaws?\" asks Ms. Aura the minute you finish putting away the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting specimens of this planet. Worthy of further observation,\" you tell her, trying to reestablish with her that despite the grade she's putting you in, you are an adult, with knowledge about the universe she can only dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope so. They are the best hope for future peace this planet has after all,\" she responds as she picks up her son and flies to one of the lofts set into the wall of the house. You look after her with a questioning eye, but you see that both she and her kid are trying to get comfortable and get to sleep after what has probably been for them an interesting day. After all you're the first human they've met. Ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fact that isn't lost on you when you find that the only place for you to sleep is in the chair you had been siting in during Ms. Aura's lecture on the planet's culture and customs. Not feeling like complaining at the moment you climb into the extremely plush chair and quickly drift off to sleep. It wasn't the first time you'd had to make due with something that was not a real bed, and in fact this was one of the better chairs you'd encountered, making it easy to fall asleep. You awaken the next morning to...</span></div></div>",

The pike, it's tip shining with energy, slices into the flesh of the monstrous behemoth that is facing you, and causes it to turn its gaze towards the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this, sir!\" he yells over the creature's angry roar, those glowing red eyes illuminating the rookie like a kid of living spot light, and showing off just how good he is with the pike. He drives it home again even as the creature turns towards him, causing it to leap away. Bradley seems to have the upper hand for a moment, before the whole scene shifts in whirl of chaos. Now instead of Bradley holding a war pike, all he has is a conical shape of rock that he's using to push the creature's attacks aside, but with every swipe of the creature's massive claws Bradley is pushed farther back, towards a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out, Kid!\" you warn him, somehow your foot has now become wedge in part of the rock of the cavern, and you are unable to help Bradley beyond tossing a few rocks at the creature, a Hy'Tan Dragon, which ignores you for now, not seeing a trapped human as much of a threat. The focus of the monster's attention is Bradley, and it will not stop until the kid is dead. The twelve claw tipped tails lash out behind the thing in expectation, awaiting the moment when the prey is pinned and they can go in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey forced to wait only a few seconds, as Bradley suddenly slips, slamming into the wall and knocking his makeshift weapon out of his torn and battered hands. With no way to defend himself he shouts at the creature with all his might, trying to scare it probably, but the Dragon knows no fear, and its tails spring forward simultaneously burying twelve different three-foot hooks through the boy's chest, causing his back to arch as the life leaves his body. Through with that prey the Dragon whips the tails and flings Bradley's limp body against a wall, causing a loud cracking of bones to permeate the cavern, which is soon replaced by the dull booms of the Dragon's feet as it approaches you, mouth open. From deep within a green light begins to build, and you can feel the heat coming from the open maw for only a second before the fire streams forth right at you in a river of death from which you cannot escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you cry as you wake up, dropping to the hardwood floor of the odd house in which you find yourself. Used to falling out of bed thanks to the old model anitgrav mattress you sleep on you are not hurt, yet you are stunned by your surroundings for a long moment, focusing you mind, and pushing the memories of the dream aside as you search for those of how you came to be here. Finding them tucked away in the back of your head you take a moment to review your situation and find that it is not one you enjoy, but it's better than the cave of a Hy'Tan Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about you find that your avian hostess and her child are still asleep. Your cry was obviously not that loud. A second look around reveals no sink or bathroom that you can recognize, and it wasn't something you'd questioned the good bird about the other day. Feeling the need to use both you look out of a window that faces the chair where you'd been sleeping. The morning sun is just breaking over the horizon, and is probably the external stimuli that made the dragon's fire seem so real in the dream. Laughing at your own foolishness you look out upon the world that you are stranded on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour view is what one would call scenic, if nothing else. Everywhere you can see natural formation of land and earth, though some have power, phone, and other various lines running to them, giving an odd look to the entire area. Not one to focus on beauty very long you instead look for a stream or river, and luckily find one only a few dozen meters away from the house. Looking back at your hostess one last time you grab the rope from where it's curled around a hook in a wall, and then you open the door as quietly as you can. With not a single stir coming from the two birds you leap out the door and slide down the rope to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the ground you take a moment to look around, fanning out with your senses for any hint of danger. Not that this planet would be that dangerous to you. After all a Terminal Gamer of your level is supposed to be able to take down any foe one on one, and while these people may have been excellent hunters, such creatures rarely made good fighters. The depended on the prey to run and hide rather than stand and fight, and that is what a TG is trained to do if they can win the fight at least. Finding nothing too bad in the local area you make your way down the path to the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the shores of the stream you are surprised to find it clean and pure. Truly pure, not like the waterways of other worlds you've seen, where the flow of waters like this are filtered at some point, pulling out everything that could prove harmful to populations downstream. This one though is pure in that its waters are untouched, and allowed to flow at least somewhat freely. Looking down you put you hand in and find the temperature nice and cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood for swimming, though before the fun you have to do what you came to do. Pulling at your belt you remove the dueling pistol, and as expected you can feel the hollowness inside the sounding chamber, meaning it is empty. Sighing you thrust the smooth, chrome colored weapon directly into the water, and watch as suddenly whirlpools begin to form as the pistol's starts the process of taking in the water around it, and converting it into fuel for the gun's abilities. Since the process will take several minutes you lay back and...</span></div></div>",

Looking at it you are surprised at the mixture of memories it brings back. Some of great battles of the past, both those of history and those you've found yourself in, as well as the stage of a theater where you were forced to preform for the troops due to your skill with the instrument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was better cause the others didn't practice,\" you comment to yourself as you look into the water to find the whirlpools only growing bigger. It will be several minutes until the gun's chamber is full again, and so you decide on a song that should take the same amount of time. Putting the mouthpiece to your lips you find that the personal mouthpiece still fits you perfectly, despite how long it's been since you first got it made. Laughing at the image of you in the mirror when you first received the instrument sends a small wind through it, that causes the instrument to play a short, sharp note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat noise brings you back to the moment, and causes your mind to focus on the flute as if it were an extension of your being, as it was long ago during a battle with a particularly nasty race of... Forcing the memories of war from your mind you can find only ne song in your mind to play on the instrument, though its origins might as well be one of war, and is certainly one of death. Taking a deep breath you begin to play the Balled of the Blue Winds, the Eulogy of the Ukatai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song takes over you being once more your mind is taken by images of the Ukatai and their sweeping cities. The deserts of their planet that went on forever no matter where you stood, and everywhere the light of at least two moons lit up the sky. It was near a lake of silvery water that the Ukatai built their monolithic grand design, which was the testament to their glory, and power. A bending of the very forces of their world to their will. The building of that monument would take many of their lifetimes, but the Ukatai cared not, for they put every heart and soul into the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey... A snap of a twig brings you back to reality, and forces you to admit that you've been playing with your eyes closed because you became wrapped up in the melody. Cursing yourself silently for making a rookie mistake you open your left eye slightly expecting to find yourself surrounded by drooling carnivores, but instead find that you have an audience of mixed company, including your hostess and her landlords. All of them are looking at you expectantly, some even making motions for you to continue with tears in their eyes. Not one to disappoint, you close your eyes and begin playing again from the point where you stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had originally planned on playing only the first movement of the piece, which is a few minutes long, but with an audience to please you decide to go through all three, including the part that is known to most races as Combine's Harvest, the third movement that the Combine, the human \u2018government', discovered was hidden within the Pipes of the Blue Winds, sealed long ago by the Ukatai when they finished the building, and at last passed into the sands of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creation of the pipes having used the fresh water of the lake, killed the Ukatai, dooming them to a slow death by thirst, but according to their writings they were happy, for they had finally made the winds sing to them. Utter foolishness. They died to prove something to themselves, and thus negated the proof. Many, of course, believed that the Ukatai remained somehow within the pipes, which were far too massive to make the notes they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans, masters of cynicism, did many scans of the pipes, finding that in their structure existed many smaller paths through which the air passed, causing many notes which became a single symphony when the wind blew strongly enough. The scans also revealed many blocked tubes that the humans eventually opened up, allowing the pipes to play the third movement, and thus gain the gift of the Ukatai. Many saw that movement as the testament to the human races lake of imagination and dreams, as it denied the dreams and stories that many had built up about the pipes and their magical songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the third and final movement of the song you rise to your feet and place the flute back in its spot on the side of you belt before plucking the weapon out of the water where it is more than full now because of the extra time you let it sit under the current. Checking it for a moment you slap it back into its holster before turning to face your audience, many of whom are just sitting around, unable to move as they are afraid to break the serenity of the moment, which the Ballad of a long dead race has created in the clearing by the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba Wee Grana Weep Mini Bong,\" you say while bowing deeply to them, and then without warning you spin on your heels and walk away. Several shouts follow after you, some asking for an encore, others asking what you had played and if you could teach them to play it. Ignoring both you make you way back to the rope that is your way into Ms. Aura's home and climb it back up to the door and inside. You see parts of the crowd standing now at the foot of the rope, but you ignore them as you walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible,\" says the familiar voice of your jailer as she flutters her way into the open door and you grunt in response. She doesn't seem to notice your response or lack there of to her question and instead walks over to the chair and looks you in the eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that song called?\" she asks you, and you feel a moment of choice. You could of course give her a taste of human cynicism and tell her the title is Eulogy of the Ukatai, but you could just as easily tell her that it is entitled Balled of the Blue Winds. The first is of course the human name for the song, while the second is the name the other races call it.</span></div></div>",

I learned it from an old friend who wanted me to geta little more culture than I was,\" you tell her, leaving out the minor details of the statement, but giving the bird woman just enough that she was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful. I had no idea humans could learn such stirring melodies. Forgive me for saying but the data we have on you kind suggests a kind of...\" she pauses as she searches for the right word to describe what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynicism that makes us very depressing to be around,\"you finish for her, having heard it said about your race more than once in your travels. Obviously it was exactly what she was thinking, but Ms. Aura still tries to think of a more polite way of saying it before she gives up and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. We are like that, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate the finer points of life,\" you tell her, pulling out your flute and playing a trilling tune before smiling and putting it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Aura smiles in response and then walks over to one of the doors that lead out of the main area of the home. You are reminded again that you have no idea where the bathroom is in this house, or if it even does have one, but your thoughts on personal hygiene are blasted from your mind as the carrion eater opens what you have to assume is her pantry, and from the smell coming from inside it's a well stocked one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you like for breakfast? I don't exactly know what the dietary requirements for a human are, but we can whip something up that should suffice,\" you hear her say, and want to answer but are afraid you might just vomit if you open your mouth. After forcing your body to adapt to the smell, mostly by holding your nose shut, you pull out the pistol at your belt just as she exits the room holding what to her is probably a balanced breakfast, though to you it looks like something that belongs in a garbage dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you, this is all I need for food,\" you tell her, motioning towards the pistol in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're going to go hunting?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. Here let me show you,\" you tell her, pulling the pistol closer to you and putting one hand on top and one on the butt. Pulling the butt of the pistol down while holding the top in place you remove what to her probably looks like a gun clip, but instead of bullets it has small brown squares that resemble dried dirt clods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These,\" you begin, pulling one of the squares out of the gun, \"are called nutrient cubes. They are a by product of the weapon's recharge cycle, which converts mass to energy. Well some guy figured that since nutrients are used by the body to produce energy he could basically create an energy supplement that cut out the middle man, giving the body pure energy to use as it pleases, and viola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the cube on you tongue you suck on it twice, feeling as the small piece of energy heats up, returning to the original form and then is literally absorbed directly by your body. The feeling of strength you get is an immediate pick me up, kind of like what you think caffeine did back in the days when people drank it for a wake up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Can I try a piece?\" asked a new voice, and looking down you find that Ms. Aura's son has reentered the house. Looking to his mother you get a nod that you take to mean he can have a piece and so pull of a cube and hand it to him. The young bird sniffs at the cube, and finding it has no smell puts it in his mouth. You watch in amusement as he sucks on it, and then is surprised to find that it vanishes. You can see in his eyes the energy has done it's work and he's probably stronger then than he's ever been in his short life. His expression also shows that he's found the downside of the cube as well. Namely the fact that it tastes like cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" is all the little bird says as it hobbles off. You smile after him, knowing that he'll crash in a few minutes, and yet still feel like he could climb a mountain. Done with that you look back towards your hostess who is gazing after her son with a concerned look, but then turns back to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't hurt him, will it?\" she asks, like a true mother, and you could almost laugh at the image it calls to your mind, but you stifle that emotion and respond in a matter of fact way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it can't hurt him. He'll feel like a million does for the rest of the day,\" you say, scratching you chin as you search your memory for those old sayings, because you think there was something wrong with that statement, and obviously there was because your hostess has a short laugh and then looks at you with an amused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's close enough. Anyway we have to get ready for school. Since I normally fly in to work I've had to arrange transport for you with Rudy. You'll be...</span></div></div>",
