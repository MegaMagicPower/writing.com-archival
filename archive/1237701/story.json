Awfully strange to have oak trees along the beach, you realize, but they make for good shade. You step to your right, towards the water, and look up to the mountains. The sight is remarkably clear, and you can finally see it! There, in the distance, is Bing's fabled Tickle Mansion! You can barely make out the place, so it is still a ways off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick a couple berries off a nearby bush and lean against a mighty tree, contented. All that blind drive is gone and you can finally remember why you're going:</span></div></div>",

You chuckle more than a little, twitching, but don't bother too get up or even look at who or what's tickling you. Instead, you simply continue to ly there with your eyes closed, enjoying the feeling . You can feel it  tracing delicately around the ball of your foot in an elliptical pattern and slooowly sliding down your arch to start spiraling around your heel, before heading back up towards your toes some time later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your eyes pop open as the sensations start to poke around, on and off, in the skin between the pudgy didgits, and you let out a genuine guffaw, fully wake now. \"Okay-okay! I'm up! I'm up!\" You laugh, turning towards the source of the faint tickling. A doe with short brown fur, flecked with faint white spots and turning to a bright, eye catching- white colour on her belly, kneels by your foot, idly doodling her fingers all over it. She turns lightly, a pair of caramel colored eyes, flecked with gold, meeting yours. \"Well, well, look who's finally awake...\"</span></div></div>",

I was just heading over to the place, actually, to see if they'd let me join as a full-time Tickler. How 'bout you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Nah. Like you, I'm not from the mansion, either. Heck, I'm even going there for the same reason you are; I want to know if they're hiring, or handing out certification, or whatever it is they do there. Say, wanna travel togethor the last little ways? It isn't far now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You consider for only a few seconds, cupping your chin in one hand.

What the-Hahah!\" She bursts out laughing, bringing in her arms and stumbling back. With the skill of long practice, you keep pace, not letting up in the slightest. She stumbles and instinctively goes to the ground, landing on her short tail, trying to get away from your tickling fingers. Youd on't even bother to very the routines, just keep your hands firmly clamped in position, only helped by her arms, rapidly wiggling your short fingers. After a few moments, you abruptly let up, grinning down at her as she wipes dampness from her watering eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as you're ticklish, I'm sure I wouldn't mind you coming along. \" You chuckle, turning your back on her and bending to pick up your pack.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unexpectedly, she hurles herself forward, tripping you up as she latches around her legs. Before you fully understand what's happening, you're lying on the ground on your front, your feet nestled in the crook of one of her arms. \"Hay, wait, what the- Gah! Ahahaha!\" With shocking speed, you already feel her fingers rapidly running over your big feet, not nearly as gentle as she had earlier. You understand that she needs to keep you fully off balance with the maximum amount of tickling on short notice, and know that if you can rally you should be able to even it up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In practice, you could barely roll around and  reach her if she wasn't tickling the heck out of your poor, soft green soles. Now, you can only twist aorund and thrash on the ground, laughing crazily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like you, though, she lets up after a few seconds, sprightly jumping back to ther feet and leaving you to massage the lingering feeling sout of your feet. \"There! I'm surprised you have such ticklish feet; I haven't had the fun of tickling someone like that in too long. And if you try to tickle me again, rest assured there's plenty more where that came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?\" You ask playfully, once again getting up and hauling on your pack. \"Well, now that we more or less seem to understand each toher , can we get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins, and suggests a course.     </span></div></div>",

Whew! You were right; you are pretty good.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You beam at the praise, worming your way down to the end of her body on your knees. \"Thanks! Most of what I know I learned first-hand; when my siblings and their friends tickled me when I was little.\" You relax cross-legged at her feet, pulling the fleshy tickle-targets into your lap. She doesn't resist as she responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? People used to tickle you too? I'm the same case, only I always preferred dishing it out to taking it. I had an older brother and sister, and they would always run or fly me down and tickle me for a-hey-hages!\" She lets out another of those cute little giggles as you trawl an exploratory set of fingers up her slowly wiggling left sole. \"But, I had some friends of my own, and we got together and ambushed them from time to time. There was so ma-ha-ha-any! of us that (hee hee!) they usually couldn't really do anything.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that so? Sounds like you were all quite the tickle-devils.\" You say, regarding the feet in front of you. Both soles are the white undertone that you see runs up the inside of her legs up to her thighs, over her belly, and colours her underarms. The foot proper was the same shade of crystalline light-pink as the rest of her. There were, sadly, only four large toes bedecking them, flexing back and forth as you gradually grow more aggressive, lightly pinching and scratching at tempting patches of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahaha! Yeheheh-eep!-hep, we would pretend to (Ha-herm!) to want to play a game with one of them, and get them alone. Then two of us would tackle their legs and trip them up, which let the others grab their arms -Gahahaha! Notthearch! Nothearch! Hahaha!- and hold them down. There was usually five of us, so each got a limb to keep track of while one could tickle without,\" Pinning a foot with one hand, you suddenly screw your pointer finger into the height of the arch with the other, briefly driving her wild. \"Aw gahahahawd <i>thahat</i> tihihickles- Ahahahaha!- Hahaha, hehe, hoa.. Without interruption. My big bro had the most ticklish upper body out of everyone who's ever lived, but my sis's feet... Ahahaha-heehee! Those were to die for.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shifting on the spot, you tuck both feet under one leg, held in the shape of an inverted 'v', and start to flicker your pointed tail-tip over the pale expanse, slowly feeding in more fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahahaha! And she would always end up getting tickled there, too!\" (You skitter your fingers over one soft sole.) \"Haha! Just walking across grass, walking on thick, fuzzy carpet, hahaha! And she always had to be on the alert whenever she was lying down; always,\" With your tail delicately wrapped around her big toes, you bring all your fingers together in the centre of both arches and slowly spread them outward, before dragging them back in again, exerting more force each time and carefully timing it with her words. \"On... The.... Watch... For the... Tickling fingers... Ofsome passerby! Errgh-umph!Ahahahahaha!\" She breaks out into full-fledged angelic laughter as you intensify your attack, succumbing to what you wanted to do since the start and scratching away almost angrily, tail forcing the toes back and holding the entire nerve-laden surface at your mercy (or lack there-of).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well whatever they were like, I bet they weren't as ticklish as these!\" You taunt, as she claps a hand over her eyes and falls back, yelling with the excess laughter that had been slowly building over the course of your conversation.                         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well I was heading towards the mansion up there in the mountains. It's the only place nearby, so do you want to come with me?\" you offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Bing's Tickle Mansion?\" she asks. \"Sure! I was headed there anyway! That is until these vines got me.\" She turned to look at the cinders that were once her relentless ticklers. They didn't look like much anymore except a pile of ashes. \"Thanks again by the way. That was some pretty impressive fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Look, maybe we should leave before we find out if that plant had friends,\" you suggest. Walking back towards where you came, you turn to see the dragoness pick up the pair of stocks and follow. Together you return to the trail where first you heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you look into the distance to see Bing's Tickle Mansion nestled in the mountains. Between it and you lies a mountain range, the forest, and the lake. The path you were following takes you around the lake, through the forest in mountains and all the way to the mansion itself. The journey will be a least a couple more days, but at least now you have a companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you turn left and continue to follow the trail. After a few minutes of silence, you try to begin a conversation with the cute dragoness. \"So how did you end up like that anyway?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she says, blushing. \"Well, I was on my way to the mansion when I felt the sudden urge to sleep. So I stepped off the trail, set down my stocks, and dozed off. When I woke up I was locked in and being tickled by those vines.\" She shook her head. \"I like being tickled, but those vines were just too much. I was tickled for nearly half an hour before you showed up. I can't tell you how relieved I was when you burst through the bushes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half an hour? Must've been tough,\" you reply. \"Sorry by the way, for busting those stocks of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness shakes her head violently. \"No no no no, it's okay. I can easily repair them.\" She glances at the stocks in her arm. \"I've had these for a long while now. I've both been tickled and tickled people in them. They're quite handy!\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a break in the conversation while the two of you traverse a river. You wade through the current, shielding your eyes from the bright sunlight reflecting off the clear water. On the other side you see the trail leaves the shore and enters a lush jungle, filled with brightly colored berries hanging from healthy green bushes and trees. You see a couple birds fly through the canopy, but apart from that see scarce signs of wildlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back and see the dragoness with the stocks above her head wading through the river behind you. Behind her you see the path that hugged the shore until now, and the clump of trees where you found the dragoness. You also turn to look at the mountains, still in front of you and a bit to the right. You think ahead to the long days of traveling that await you, but once again make light that at least you have company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the river, both you and the dragoness bask in the sun a bit, letting the heat dry your scales. You spread you wings, feeling the warmth spread across them. You turn and walk forward with your friend still in tow, thinking about how to keep the conversation going. \"So why are you going to the Tickle Mansion?\" you ask finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, to tickle and be tickled,\" she answers calmly. \"Especially to tickle. I've always liked tickling ever since I was a <br>\r\nhatchling, when I was tickled by my older brother. It was fun, but it was even more fun when I got to tickle him back!\" She giggles at the memory. \"Since then I've always asked people I knew if I could tickle them. Some find me a bit weird, but I don't mind. It doesn't endanger any of my friendships.\" She pauses while the two of you pass into the jungle. \"I hear that all the greatest ticklers assemble at the mansion, so I hope they can teach me a thing or two. I also hear there's an assortment of some of the most ticklish people in the world there. I can't wait to tickle some of those people!\" She smiles and then thinks for a bit. \"So why are you going to Bing's Tickle Mansion?\" she asks in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"I came for pretty much the opposite reason.\" You close your eyes and remember those times you spent <br>\r\nwith your friends long ago, how you'd end up in tickle fights and laugh so hard your sides would ache. Ah, good times. \"I spent most of my youth getting tickled by friends and family,\" you continue. \"At first I didn't think of it as anything other than something for them to torture me with, but when I grew up I began to really enjoy it. Soon I was looking forward to the times my cousins would come over and tickled me senseless, and enjoying the times when my ganged up and tortured me, sometimes for days while our parents were out on hunts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the dragoness comments. \"You must've liked it a lot. Days straight, just wow. And I was only tickled for half and hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to Bing's Tickle Mansion to be tickled by some of the best ticklers in the world. Just the thought of being trapped in a set of stocks with my arms taught above me, at the mercy of ticklers for days sets my heart thumping.\" You turn to look at her and smile. \"And maybe you might be one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute dragoness immediately blushes and bright red. \"W-well, I guess tickling you would be rather fun, uh, if you'd be okay with that.\" You take satisfaction in the fact that she's a little nervous, but decide to let her off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you say, \"we should probably get there though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" she answers. Unable to look at you anymore she turns away. You turn forward and continue down the worn path. A few more minutes, and you hear the dragoness behind you. \"Oh wow. We don't even know each other's names. I'm Sarah, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduce yourself, and together you continue into the lush jungle. The berries on either side look tasty, but you aren't hungry yet. You take note however, that the juiciest berries are the blue ones and they will be the first ones you will try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the day ends and the moon peeks through the tees. The sounds of wildlife die down around you, and crickets chirp somewhere in the distance. Both you and Sarah fight the urge to sleep, but soon you are unable to resist. You wander a bit farther into a nice open clearing settle down and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt daybreak, you get up and rub your eyes. Unfolding your wings and stretching, you yawn and examine the place where you have slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in a berry patch, with bushes  covered in berries of all kinds in neat rows. Right next to you is Sarah, who is just beginning to wake up, and her set of stocks. To the left is the path from which you came, so to the right is where you want to go. Your stomach is growling though, and the berries look quite appetizing. There is a sign by the first row of bushes that reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLEASE READ<br>\r\nBerries have different effects. Please read and be sure to select only the ones you want.<br>\r\nYellow berries = temporary paralysis<br>\r\nBlue berries = more sensitive skin<br>\r\nRed berries = no effect<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it. You wanted to be tickled, and you had someone who enjoyed tickling right next to you. Who says you can't be tickled now? Of course there will be more ticklers at the mansion. It's up to you. Either eat the weird berries and have some fun, or eat some red ones and continue your journey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The plan is all set in your head, just another preparation before you can move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around a bit more carefully, you spot something you can use; a small leather sack near the last row of bushes. It may be useful for the road ahead, as well as for carrying more berries. Slinging it over your shoulder, you turn back to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick walk and you're next to the pink dragoness. \"Hey, Sarah,\" you say, shaking her gently. \"Wake up, I need to show you something.\" She yawns, rubs her eyes, and turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm awake,\" comes her groggy reply. \"What's up? Ready to continue our journey?\" she asks jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but look at this first.\" You point at the sign, beckoning for her to read it. As she approaches it you enter the rows of berries and proceed to pick quite a few handfuls; mostly yellow and blue, but a couple handfuls of red ones in case you or Sarah should get hungry. Some berries are for the journey ahead, as you hope this will happen at lunch and dinner as well. By the time you're finished, the sack is nearly full of berries. You return to see Sarah looking at the rows of bushes, her head turning left and right, looking for the different kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prod her side, and are rewarded with a surprised \"eep!\" at the unexpected tickle. As she turns you empty the sack's contents on the ground between the two of you. Red, yellow and blue berries roll out onto the ground, creating a multicolored collage. Sarah looks at them, then at you. At first her face is creased with confusion, then it clears up as she begins to understand. She breaks into a huge, bright smile that seemed to radiate joy and happiness. \"Can I really tickle you?\" she asks, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer you reach out with your claw and grab a mixture of blue and yellow berries from the ground. She looks giddy with anticipation as you swallow the berries in a single gulp, laying back on the soft green grass as you do so. You fold your arms behind your head, stick your legs straight out and spread your wings out beneath you, displaying your young red scaly body for her to tickle. From the pose it looks like you might be napping, but you know sleep will be impossible for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue berries start to kick in soon after. It's nothing sudden, nothing drastic, just a slow subtle feeling washing through your entire body. The first sign that the berries are working comes when you can feel the inch high soft grass sway slightly against your arm. The breeze, previously unnoticeable, was barely moving the grass at all. But each sway against your skin was like a slight itch. You giggle softly when the feeling washes lower and the swaying grass slightly tickles the edges of your underarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to itch the awkward feelings, you discover that the yellow berries are also working. You try to unfold your scaly arms to scratch, but it just can't be done. You try moving your legs, but they're paralyzed too. Even your midsection is stuck where it is. After some experimenting you conclude that the only thing you can move at all is your head, which to your surprise remains relatively free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happened within less than a minute of eating the berries. Both you and Sarah stand (or lie in your case) for a few seconds in silence. There's a look of calm on your face and a look of giddiness on hers. Both of you anticipate with excitement what's about to happen. Suddenly, the silence is broken by your voice. \"Alright, it worked,\" you inform. \"Apart from my head, I cannot move at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah literally squeals with joy and runs over to you. Kneeling beside you, she drags a claw lazily up your belly. Immediately you break into laughter, squeezing your eyes tightly. When they open you see Sarah with thoughtful stare at your exposed form. Quickly and hastily, Sarah pulls your limbs into an X on the ground, totally exposing every part of your body to her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you like being tickled right?\" Sarah asks. She seems to have lost her shyness about tickling you from yesterday. You nod, feeling that it wouldn't be appropriate to talk in this situation. \"So tell me where your worst spot is and we'll get started right away! No, wait, that wouldn't be good. I want to become the greatest tickler, and finding your weak spot will be good practice. Just tell me which half of you has your most ticklish spot, and I will find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her cute, joyful expression and say \"My most ticklish spot is on my...</span></div></div>",

Her radiant smile was helping you feel totally relaxed. \"Now, where should I start looking?\" she asks rhetorically.<br>\r\n\"Here?\" She drags a claw across your tummy, sending you into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n\"Or here?\" A claw scrabbles in your armpit, pushing you farther into hysteria.<br>\r\n\"Or maybe here?\" With a deft flick she sends her tail deep into your belly button, shattering what little resistance you had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we should work our way up, hmm?\" Sarah wiggles her claws and reaches for your hips. Normally you'd be squirming at the sight of someone's wiggling claws, but thanks to the yellow berries you can only stare at the dragoness' descending doom. You start to wonder why you did this when Sarah's dancing claws meet your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately break out in laughter, as your reflexes tell you to buck your hips. However, even reflexes are halted because of the paralysis. There is nothing you can do at all to hide or escape. All you can do is just sit there, fully exposing yourself to Sarah's torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, for her part, was much better than she let on. The blue berries were probably helping out a bit, but even then you could tell Sarah was a masterful tickler. Her fingers groped at your motionless hips, eliciting peals of hysterical laughter from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's claws move a bit higher and you go silent, lapsing into a fit of silent laughter. Her nails spider dance around your belly and sides, sometimes questing deep into your navel. This drives you insane, light scratches on the inner walls and pokes on the bottom of your extremely ticklish belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several torturous minutes, Sarah's claws once again migrate upwards. They reach your ribs and decide to stay for a while, and you suspect they enjoy it there. Little sharp points delicately tracing the gaps between each rib, scratching ever so softly, making you laugh and laugh and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claws then reach your underarms, and you're afraid you're going insane. The sharp nails of her claws lightly spider-dance in your hollows, sometimes simply digging in for variation. You've never laughed so hard in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell this is where Sarah really likes tickling people, as she stares there a good deal longer than she did with any other part of your body. Eventually she does let up, and you take the opportunity to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you can focus on her, Sarah smiles and ask \"Now where's that tickle spot?\" She returns to your hips, and even though you brace yourself you still break out laughing as soon as she starts tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

You decide to ring the bell at the side of the front gate, oddly shaped like a feather. \"I guess that makes sense for a tickle mansion\" you think to yourself. To your surprise, the doorbell doesn't make a sound, but instead automatically opens the gates. Deciding you'd better head inside, you walk into the front room. It looks like a reception area, with someone who looks like a secretary standing behind a computer at a desk in the middle of the room, with a number of doors along the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look at the secretary, you notice she's not entirely human either. In fact, she appears to be at least part bird! A pair of feathery blue wings sprout from her back like angel wings, and her hair appears to be soft downy feathers rather than normal hair. You can't see all of the rest of her, so you can't tell what other differences she has. On the whole though, she seems like a pretty bird woman, with light blue eyes and a pleasantly happy expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, and welcome to Bing's Tickle Mansion!\" she says, noticing you looking at her. \"My name is Alicia. I bet you're applying to be a ticklee, by the look of you. Just look at all those bare tickle spots!\" Alicia says, suddenly hopping over the desk with a beating of her wings, carrying her to drop down, standing right in front of you. Her feathery wings stretch out in front of her and brush against your bare belly, each feather delicately stroking against your smooth skin. But you stand there stoically, not tickled at all by the sensation, actually feeling like a pleasant feathery massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're tummy isn't ticklish!\" Alicia says, a very surprised look on her face. \"What gives? You're showing it off like its the perfect place to tickle! You tease...\" She scowls at you, as you try to explain your situation, surprised by Alicia's aggressiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's why I've come to the tickle mansion.\" You tell her. \"I'm not ticklish at all, and I've always wanted to know what it feels like. I thought that someone here might be able to help me! Oh, uh... I'm Misha, by the way. I didn't get to say so earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia looks even more surprised now. \"What? Not ticklish at all? No way! I need to see for myself, raise those arms of yours. I bet those armpits of yours are ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says, stretching your arms over your head, revealing your bare underarms and stretching out your tummy as well. With a last wistful look at your belly, Alicia brings up her arms this time, scritching her fingernails under your arms. She draws zigzags and explores as much of your underarms as she can, but you don't even smile or flinch. It doesn't tickle at all. But Alicia has a determined look in her baby blues, and you realize you'll have to stop her on your own. You bring your arms down and grab her sides in retaliation, playfully lobster pinching a path from her ribs down to her hips. Alicia's response is instant, immediately backing up a step and breaking into giggles, trying to bat you away with her hands and wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wants to keep on tickling Alicia. She's obviously ticklish, and maybe you should teach her a lesson for even trying to tickle you out of the blue like that. Then again, maybe you should just get down to business and try to find a way to make yourself ticklish.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You walk past rows of shut doors, the only thing unique about them is a number on each one. Presumably, the people here know which door is which, but it looks incredibly easy to get lost in this wing of the building. You also notice that you don't hear a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, its so quiet in here. Are we the only people in here?\" you ask Alicia as she takes a turn down a different hall, past even more doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh no, not at all!\" she tells you, smiling a little at your question. \"Its just that all these rooms are completely sound proofed. You understand that in can get pretty loud in some of them\u2026 oh! We're here. Dr. Ticklov's lab. C'mon!\" Alicia opens the door to room E14396 (like you'll ever remember that if you need it) and you step into a large room. On one side of the room is a large machine with a chair placed in its center, with elaborate computer screens and dials on either side. The chair has straps in a number of places\u2026 ankles, thighs, wrists, shoulders. The other end of the room looks like a high school chemistry class. Flasks and beakers of brightly colored liquids line a long table, all like scientific notations you can't begin to figure out. At least, not with the quick glace you get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a desk in the back of the room is a woman. She appears to be in her early 20s, with long fiery red hair tied in a braid around her head. She's wearing a long white lab coat that goes down to her feet, adorned with black boots. Similar black gloves cover her hands. You can only see her head, but she appears to be completely human, which is something of a surprise in this part of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia walks up to the red headed woman, who looks up at the two of you with pale green eyes. \"Dr. Ticklov, we've got a girl here who could use your help.\" Alicia turns to you and introduces you. \"This is Misha, and she's completely unticklish. She was hoping someone here could help with that, and if anyone can, I'm sure it's you Doctor. Misha, this is Dr. Ticklov, she's our resident expert on a lot of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely unticklish? Forgive me if I'm skeptical Alicia.\" Dr. Ticklov says, in a confident voice that has a soft Russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it, Doctor. I tested it out, myself!\" Alicia tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor gets up to shake your hand, just as you blurt out \"You're really an expert? You seem too young!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child prodigy.\" Dr. Ticklov tells you curtly. \"I assure you, I'm well qualified. Before we begin any treatment for your unfortunate condition\u2026\" the Doctor pauses slightly as she says this, and you can see her eyes quickly steal a glance at your bare belly. You grin at this glimpse of humanity from the otherwise steely Russian scientist. \"\u2026uh, we must thoroughly test to make sure you do not already have any tickle spots. Otherwise, the results of the treatment could be\u2026 intense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ticklov walks over to the chair and machine. \"Come, sit down. This won't take long. And if you are truly unticklish, it will go quite quickly.\" You shrug at her and walk over to sit down in the chair, as Dr. Ticklov straps you in. You're pretty confident she won't find any tickle spots, everyone you know has been trying for years. But you can understand her skepticism. Then again, maybe she just wants a chance to try and tickle you herself. That wouldn't be a first for you, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the test begins...</span></div></div>",

She seems almost angry to hear this. \"I have to fix this. No one should be completely un-ticklish. It's a travesty.\" She mutters. In turn, you frown. It seems as if people around here consider a lack of ticklishness to be on par with a disease, which you find slightly and vaguely insulting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'I could have told you that.

Alicia, grab that lever there, would you?\" The bird-girl acquiesces, and your bindings slide away. \"Now, I can think of two ways off the top of my head to make you ticklish. One, you would put on a full-body suit that I've designed. The interior is completely lined with feathers that are designed to be highly receptive to static electricity; the slightest movement makes them stand up and brush against the triggering body part. It's meant for use on repeat offenders who've broken Mansion rules, teaching them a lesson while letting them go about their duties,\" The edge of her pretty mouth curves up. \"Indeed, I remember prescribing one to Alicia quite some time ago.

It'll stimulate cell growth and eventual ought to make you ticklish, as well as improving your sense of touch. It's less intensive than the other procedure I could try, which would be to fully submerge you in a tank of the same gel-ly stuff and run a light electric current through it to speed up the process. Unfortunately, while it would be quick, it would mean that your first experience with tickling could be overpoweringly strong.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you're excited to be made ticklish, and the prospect of a quick session fixing everything was enticing, you decide that a slower process would probably be better for you. You're not sure how you'd adapt to being tickling, and going at it in stages is probably for the best. A bath in electric goo also sounds pretty gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go with the body suit, Dr. Ticklov.\" you tell her hesitantly. That one doesn't sound like a lot of fun either, to be honest. You never liked wearing a ton of clothing. And this one would be filled with gel? That also sounds a little gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" says Dr. Ticklov curtly. \"This will give me an excellent chance to try out the suit. You will be its first subject. I'm looking forward to collecting all sorts of useful data.\" Dr. Ticklov's eyes seem to glaze over, as if she's thinking about a million things at once, as she leaves the room to go get the suit. You sit in the examination chair awkwardly, not knowing what to do with yourself while the doctor gets the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Alicia\u2026 you were put in some kind of feather suit? What was that like?\" you ask Alicia, who also seems to be milling around. You get the sense that she's procrastinating going back to her desk, but you're not one to call her out on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it tickled so much!\" Alicia tells you, shivering at the memory. \"The worst part is, the won't tickle you if you stand perfectly still. But that's so hard! Every time you move, it tickles! Which make you move, and it tickles more! Even laughing was enough to make my tummy shake, which tickled and tickled\u2026 oohhh\u2026\" Alicia trails off,  appearing to vividly remember the experience. Not being ticklish, you can't sympathize with her at all. Although the idea of the tickle suit does make you curious. What would it be like to be in that thing? Maybe you'll get to find out eventually, if Dr. Ticklov's treatment works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as you have that thought, Dr. Ticklov returns with a cart, the tickle suit laying on it. It appears to cover most of the body, stopping tightly at wrists, ankles, and neck. There appear to be boots that you put on separately. Thoughtfully, there even seems to be a spot cut out for your tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here it is. Take off those clothes and put this on. I want you to wear it for the rest of the day and through the night. Tomorrow you can take it off and we can run another test.\" Dr. Ticklov tells you, motioning for you to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, change right here? In front of you?\" you ask, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all women here, Misha. Besides, I am a doctor. There should be nothing to be ashamed about. Nonetheless, if it bothers you, I can ask Alicia to leave.\" Dr. Ticklov tells you, impatiently. With a shrug, you decide not to make a big deal out of it and change. You slip off your clothing and put it on the lower level of the cart, and grab the body suit. Putting on the suit nude feels like a weird thing to do, but there isn't any point in getting your underwear all gel-ified. Besides, the suit needs to be against as much skin as possible, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your legs in the suit, which fits you snugly. How did Dr. Ticklov know your size? Does she have more of these than she lets on, or was this just a perfect coincidence? However, you don't have time to wonder that, as you zip the suit up tight, you feel the gel press against you. Its\u2026 slimy. It\u2019s a very weird sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew\u2026 I feel really gross.\" you blurt out. \"Like I need to take a shower.\" You move around a bit experimentally, the squishy feeling of the gel against your skin with every movement. It doesn't tickle, and you can't feel it being rubbed in or anything, but its definitely pressed against you tightly. Your ears droop at the thought of having to be in this for a whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you hear the doctor sigh slightly. \"There's nothing to be uncomfortable about. The gel is perfectly sanitary. It simply needs to be against your skin for a prolonged period. With such an extreme case as yours, I'm not sure how quickly the gel will cause ticklishness. Tickle spots may also appear unevenly across your body. That's one of the reasons we need to run another test tomorrow. If the gel does not work at all, I have a few more ideas I can try. Liquid medicine to be taken orally, perhaps in combination with hypnosis therapy\u2026\" the doctor trails off, thinking for a moment. \"But that's nothing to be concerned about now. Misha, please put on the boots now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. You feel gross enough without squishing in slime every step! \"No! Please, I feel icky enough as it is! I don't want to squish around all day! Plus I can't sleep with boots on anyway!\" You plead with the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the doctor responds, her features softening slightly. \"We can take this in stages. But your feet will not become ticklish this way, just so you know. But you must be tired after all this, and making it here. I'll have your clothing sent to your room. Alicia, please accompany Misha to her room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nods, and gestures for you to follow her, as she takes you to your room. The corridors wind until you make it to a different wing, where you're shown a nice and spacious room for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Alicia says, thoughtfully. \"Would you like to just turn in early today, or would you like some company for a while?\"</span></div></div>",

A short hallway with a bathroom to the right leads into a tiled kitchenette, the counter serving as one border to a spacious and tasteful sitting room. A bay window with a glorious ocean view and the elegantly vaulted ceiling combine to make the space seem even larger than it already is, handily preventing the couch and massage-chair set before the impressive hearth from making it feel stuffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Mansion.\" Says Alicia proudly. \"Nice, isn't it? My room's only a little ways down the hall from here, if you want to ask me something.\" She plops herself down on the cushions in the bay window, wings folded primly behind her. \"Like, seriously, talk to me. I need an excuse to get out of the foyer for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is signing people into the Mansion really that bad?\" You take a seat next to her, too busy enjoying the crystalline water beyond the cliffs outside and the warm sun sparkling over them to let the suit get you down. \"I'd have thought it'd be interesting, getting to see the kinds of people who come through here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is,\" Says Alicia conversationally. \"But most of them are tickle-freaks of some kind or another. If you watched me in action for a few days, you'd see that when I leaped the desk and tickled you, it really wasn't that presumptuous compared to what a lot of people do. It's why they prefer to hire avians for the desk jobs; we need the endurance, ticklish as I am.\"   <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"So, why'd you come to the mansion?\" You grin wolfishly. \"You're so ticklish, I'd have thought you'd try and do anything to avoid a place like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not that ticklish!\" She says playfully. \"But, now that you mention it, I guess I just have an interest in tickling from when I was younger. My friends and family would tickle me all the time to make me do things for them. And when I got older, I always had to be on my guard whenever I wore a shirt that showed off my belly, like what you were wearing earlier. People wouldn't leave me alone.\" She shrugs her wings. \"At first, I hated it, but I learned to get used to it and even like it over time.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm something of the opposite,\" You say, reclining against the wall. \"Most of the people I knew were, ticklish, but, obviously,\" You run a hand down the leathery side of the suit, making a face as gel squelches against you. \"I'm not. People would try to tickle me, but I usually just ended up tickling them back. It was so funny, seeing them curl up, laughing and laughing, that eventually I decided I wanted to see what if felt like.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Dr. Ticklov should be able to do that easily enough. You can always count on the Doc.\" She leans forward, giving one sleeve of your garment a tug. \"Is it working yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" You shake, ears perking up as an idea comes to you. It merely seems appropriate, given the location. \"But you said that these things tickle when they move -hey, were you trying to tickle me?\" You glare at her in mock anger, expression stern in fictitious outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I was merely testing to see-\" She squirms under your glare, wings fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-If I was ticklish. You know what that means, when you try to tickle me?\" Before she can answer, you leap forward, grabbing her wrists as she raises them to defend herself. Apparently having suspected a tickle-attack any minute, she puts up a struggle. With some grunting and struggling, you both roll off the ledge, landing on the carpet in a burst of feathers. \"That I get to tickle you!\" You answer yourself as you gain the upperhand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowny blonde hair tousled and blue eyes lit, the Avian glares up at you, defiant look at odds with the way you have her wrists neatly pinioned to the carpet out to either side of her head.<br>\r\n\"The thing about this position,\" She says, with obviously enforced calm. \"Is that you have to let up one of my arms to do anything, and that's all I need.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know?\" You ask contemplatively, eyeing the base of her top, jostled by the brief struggle and showing a faint line of pale skin. You stare at it predatorily, out of the corner of your eye watching her goggle as your great fluffy tail sinuously hovers into position next to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a striking snake, you flick it neatly under her shirt, swirling the fuzzy appendage back and forth. You smile down at her as she bursts into laughter, twisting back and forth, trying to free her hands from your grasp. Wings thrum out a tattoo on the carpet as she squirms, legs kicking, and you grin all the wider as you nose your tail right into her navel.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyhehyehey! Hey! That's not fair!

Since she was like the receptionist, you decide to let her \"sure, go ahead\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant smiles \"this will be fun, I never usually get a chance to tickle\" she looks around the office \"here, sit in my chair\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the chair, you sit down \"put your arms on the armrests\". Doing as she asks, you place them on the armrests and watch her tie your wrists using some rope. Then using some more rope, she ties your legs together before getting a spare chair and sitting down propping your feet on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a theory that people who show off parts of their body aren't that ticklish there\". She pulls off your shoes revealing your feet. \"So because I wear shoes, you think my feet are going to be ticklish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, now lets see\" she drags a finger across your sole seeing if you'll react. \"Nothing yet, maybe if I.....\" she starts tickling your feet more vigorously hoping you'll start laughing but just like everyone else you has tried, you stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, that has to tickle\" as she was scratching at your soles, you could see she was becoming frustrated with your lack of response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that your soles weren't getting her anywhere, she moves onto your toes. \"Now these look awfully ticklish\" you shrug your shoulders \"if that's what you want to believe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to figure out if you're bluffing or not, she reaches over a grabs a feather off the desk. \"Feathers are my favorite, even the slightest touch can reduce a person to laughter\". Using the feather on and in between your toes, she was getting so frustrated that she uses the quill of the feather to stab your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! WHAT THE HELL, THAT HURT!\" not sharp enough to draw blood, but hard enough to hurt, you start pulling at your restraints \"let me out of here you psycho!\". It was then the office door opens and in walks a blonde haired woman. \"What on earth is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Ticklov, I was......uhhhhhh\" \"why is she tied up in your chair?\". The assistant began to panic \"I was just seeing if she was ticklish\". Dr Ticklov looks at you \"I heard you shout\" \"she stabbed my foot with that feather quill because I didn't laugh\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to you and proceeds to untie you from the chair. \"Heather, what did I tell you if you did something like this again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather whimpers \"you said I'd be punished\". Having been untied, you look at your foot \"ow, this really hurts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ticklov groans in anger \"Heather you've crossed the line this time, tying up someone who's here for some assistance and you hurt them\" she shakes her head before walking to the desk and dialing for reception<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello reception!\" Alicia says \"Alicia, its Dr Ticklov I need you to bring 2 security guard with you to my assistant's office please\" \"of course Dr. Ticklov\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Alicia and 2 huge security guards enter the room. \"Guards can you take Heather here to Room 4 please, I think she need a thorough going over\" Heather gasps \"No please not Room 4 anything but that\". The 2 guards carry her out of the room before walking down the hallway all the while she screams her protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about her hurting you, she's done something like this before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I'm just glad she didn't use a pen or something sharper\". Looking at your foot again, you look up at Dr. Ticklov seeing her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to see her punishment as a way of revenge?\". Hearing that suggestion, you smile \"that would be fun to watch\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could get down to the reason on why you're here?\" \"its up to you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's it to be?

Putting your shoes back on, you follow the doctor as well as the protests of Heather as she's carried down the hallway \"this Room 4 that she hates........what exactly is in there that's so bad?\". Dr. Ticklov smiles at you \"wait and see\". Arriving at Room 4, you enter it just as Heather is being restrained on a metal frame under a large metal box and you notice one of the guards remove her shoes leaving her barefooted \"thank you gentlemen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 guards leave the room, closing the door as they do \"this is Room 4\" Dr. Ticklov says as Heather struggles in her restraints. \"Years of research and countless testing have brought us to this\" she says pointing to a large piece of machinery. \"This right here is in my mind the smartest computer ever!\" even though Dr. Ticklov was sounding very pleased, you couldn't see why it was such a big deal \"not to insult you doctor.......but what's so great about it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you \"I'll show you\". At that point, Heather starts protesting again \"no please doctor, I've learned my lesson\". Sitting down at the desk, she starts typing at the keyboard before hitting enter. \"Hello Amy\" \"Hello Doctor\" you jump at the sound of the voice \"who was that?\" \"that was the computer\". You look at the screen \"you named it Amy?\" \"actually she named herself........Amy could you upload the profile named Heather please\". \"Of course Doctor\" you could see why Dr. Ticklov was so proud of the computer \"the Heather profile is uploaded\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.......now Amy I'd like you to initiate Phase 4\" \"WHAT, NO ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!\" Heather shouts \"Phase 4 initiating\". Just then several mechanical hands appear from the metal box below Heather \"Amy's a computer that tickles basically. She has profiles of everyone who has been in this building. To make a profile, she scans the person to find their spots\" you nod understanding by what's talking about. \"Finding a person's weak spots, she then uses the best techniques to get the most out of them.......so to speak\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in amazement as 2 hands pull back Heather's toes making the soles taut then 2 other hands tickle her feet. Then at the other end, 2 hands are attacking her underarms bring out the most tortured laughter you've ever heard \"HAHAHAHAHHAA PLEASE STOP IT HAHAHAHAHAHHA I HATE IT\". Heather was already crying with laughter as the hands attacked her with expert precision. \"In about 2 minutes, she'll be out cold\" Dr. Ticklov was correct with her estimate as Heather passed out at exactly 2 minutes \"wow.......that looked intense\". The same 2 guards from earlier entered and removed Heather before walking out \"so Misha.......you want a try?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure but that would be a waste of time since it wouldn't affect me\". \"Lets see shall we?\" leading you to the frame, you climb onto the frame before she straps you in place and removes your shoes \"this should be interesting to watch\" Dr. Ticklov says as she walks away from you. She sits down at the desk \"Amy, we have a new profile to set up\" \"of course Doctor, is this staff or patients?\" \"Patients\" the lights in the room changed from white to blue. \"Male or Female?\" \"Female Amy, she's a catgirl\" the blue lights then turn to pink \"Doctor what's up with the lights?\" \"they change every so often, nothing to be alarmed about\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the patient need Doctor?\" \"unfortunately Misha is not ticklish\" \"the name Misha has been stored.......I'll begin a scan\". A green beam suddenly drops down from above and slowly moves over you from head to toe \"body scan complete\". \"Excellent......what are the results Amy?\" \"the scan shows there are no areas on the body that show a rate ticklishness\". \"Tell me something I don't know\" you say \"I can begin a complete remapping of her body Doctor?\" \"whoa hold on, a remapping?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it plainly, she can make you ticklish\" your eyes widen \"really? I can be ticklish?\" \"yes but I'll need to know if there are any parts of your body you want to be more ticklish\" \"well I want my whole body to be ticklish but my belly, sides and ribs to be more ticklish\". Dr Ticklov nods \"let me just put that information in and the remapping can begin\". After a few minutes of typing then lights fade \"are you ready Misha?\" you nod \"you bet I am\". \"Amy begin remapping\" the process lasted for 5 minutes and at the end you was left with the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the remapping work? </span></div></div>",

Doing the same for your arms, she straps up your wrists and biceps. \"How are they?, too tight?.....too loose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull your arms down and your legs up but the won't move an inch \"doesn't look like I'm going anywhere\".

Get off for a moment, will you?\" so, you do. Taj immediately licks straight across your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, what?\" you protest, trying to wipe off the spit with  your fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see your feet,\" the tiger demands. So, you sit down in a nearby clearing and face your soles towards him. \"Hefty. Pronounced ball, heel, and toepads. Well worn, too. Would be nice for tickling, only if.\" With that, he licks both feet, heel to toe. Doesn't tickle a bit, but it feels good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could help you out right here for free, but I don't know if i can find all the ingredients and you'll never see the mansion. Or, we could just continue on. your call, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you take a closer look, you begin to think of this: if you cross a sneasel (pokemon) with a native American, then colored it green, that's it would look like. You try to break free of your bonds, but they remain firm. It walks up to you and shouts behind him,\" Fugita horimaka!\" Shouts of cheeriness and applause can be heard. You are lifted up, and then released but still kept under guard. You are tied to a large, slanted board of tree bark spread eagle. You attempt to squirm free, but they fasten the vines on even tighter and all you get is more laughter and applause from the crowd of sneasel-things. The one that appears to be the leader whips out a feather. Still trapped, you scan your surroundings. A large clearing, edged by rainforest trees, and you appear to be on a stage. More jeering can be heard from the crowd as the feather massages your foot. You attempt to not laugh, you can't be embarrassed now. Another feather comes out of behind the sneasel's head  and begins tickling your other foot. You continue to squirm, but are determined not to laugh they stop tickling your feet. Instead, they go for your belly. To your horror, the two feathers begin to rub all over your belly. Your beak begins to clatter: you can't hold it in for much longer. They unmercifully tickle all over your sensitive belly. Another sneasel joins in, tickling your wingpits.  Yet another sneasel goes to work on your sides. If they keep tickling you, you might wet yourself!</span></div></div>",
