It was tough, had good armament, and could out-dive the Zero. However the guns didn't always work, it was underpowered, wasn't very maneuverable, didn't have good range, and couldn't climb very well. The Zero was fast, maneuverable, had great range, could climb well, and could dive fast, but not as fast as the Wildcat. It still had one weakness. It ruggedness. The Zero lacked self sealing rubber fuel tanks, had no armor plate for the pilot and if you hit the spot where the left wing met the cockpit the Zero would instantly catch fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails knew he was up against a good plane. He was confident in his abilities but was respectful of the Zero. As he flew his first mission he and his squad of five encounter 6 Zeroes. He knows what to do. \"Squad keep them on the straight path if you turn with them you're dead.\" The two sides merge and bank into each other. Tails reverses his turn when a Zero flies perpendicular to him. He gets on his tail and fires a short burst to kill the Zero. Another Zero is on his tail. He skids the plane to force the Zero to overshoot. He kills it with another short burst. Tails sees another two Zeroes diving on him. He calls for his squad to dive out of the fight. However no one else does. Tails is alone when he sees something off his left wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wingman Sonic stayed with him throuh the fight. Tails checks their six o'clock and sees\u2026 </span></div></div>",

The Zero, in times of desperation turned into a kamikaze or suicide aircraft, was following Tails. Tails wasn't happy about this and knew the danger he was in. Even if they both ran out of ammo, the Zero would ram him killing them both (maybe Sonic too if more were present). <br>\r\n He reacted quickly and banked a hard left. The Zero easily did the same and fortunately it wasn't in range to fire any rounds. Tails glanced back to see Sonic roll in behind the Zero. Tails straightened out, if the Zero followed Sonic would have a clean shot. The Zero gave chase and Sonic peppered him down. The Zero pulled skyward, Sonic went by the Zero when it dove on him to bring Sonic down with him. Sonic saw the danger and rolled right but the Zero just clipped his wing, but the ruggedness of Wildcat saved him. Tails yelled, \"YOU OK?!\" Sonic called him, \"Yeah I'm fine but there are not only more but a fleet of Junkers getting ready to do a bombing run on the town.\" Junkers were borrowed from Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",

Sonic gets three when his guns run completely dry. \"Tails I'm out I gotta head back. Be back soon.\" Tails must use his remaining ammo sparingly. So he gets on a Junkers' tail when the rear gunner starts shooting. Tails takes hits to his wings, his engine, his canopy, his prop, and one bullet hits him in his arm. He fires the last of his ammo into the bomber to bring his kill total to 5. He's an ace in a day, but his fifth kill may be his last. The remaining fighters gang up on Tails and he is already wounded. Tails tries to open the canopy but it's jammed. He needs help soon or the Wildcat will be his coffin.</span></div></div>",

When Tails was finally cleared, the new F6F Hellcat entered and prepared to leave its fearsome mark. Tails brought the Hellcat to the runway with the others. The green light was given and they took off. The new Hellcat had about a 260-280 mile greater range than the Wildcat, giving about an extra hour of flight time, but was no less rugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the Zero the Hellcat had almost every advantage. It could out-dive, out-run, hit harder, and take more punishment than the Zero. It could climb with the Zero. Leaving the Zero with a very small range and turning advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails and the others took off and flew patrol until someone call on the radio, \"BANDITS, HUNDEREDS OF EM 9 O'CLOCK!!!!!\" Tails looked to his left and saw there was hundreds of em. (Meaning there was lots of them not literally hundreds) Tails reacts with cool calmness. \"Time to take the Hellcat for a test run.\" Sonic being flight lead orders a split. The thirty Hellcats were warned of a possible enemy attack from radar so more planes than normal were sent. The score was thirty Hellcat against at least sixty Zeroes. Despite the 2:1 odds Tails and Sonic lead the squad into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the planes crossed it turned into a mix up of aircraft everywhere. Tails was to keep Sonic's tails clear at all times unless the leader says otherwise. Sonic however knows Tails has been itching for action for some time now. \"Go have some fun Tails.\" \"Thanks.\" Tails breaks off and latches onto a Zero knocking it out with his .50 cals. Tails sees a Zero diving on him from 10 O'clock and banks left. The Zero shoots past and Tails reverses and dispatches another Zero. Tails then sees a Zero below him going in the opposite direction. Tails does a split-S and gives chase. (In a split-S the pilot puts the plane on it's back and pulls on the stick until the plane levels off on it's belly) Tails gives a quick burst sealing his third kill. Tails then sees a Hellcat with a Zero in hot pursuit. Tails moves in behind the Zero and gets his fourth kill for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many planes that everywhere you pointed it seemed like there was a Japanese plane and they were so easy to kill Tails still had plenty of ammo. Then Tails is on the tail of another Zero and as he killed it his plane rocked under the force of 20mm shells. Tails decided enough was enough and he dove away from the fight. Suddenly a line of three Zeroes fleeing from the fight appear in front of Tails. Tails dives from 9 O'clock and shereds the three Zeroes with his remaining ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails returns to base with 8 kills to his credit. For this feat is awarded the Flying Cross. Of the 60 Zeroes reported, half were killed. Three Hellcats were lost but the mission was still a great success. Tails is also moved back to flight lead. Tails' next mission is\u2026</span></div></div>",

Tails was having a rather \"boring\" flight day as he was gliding in a Hellcat that was different than the one he customized. However this didn't last too long. He saw a fleet of \"Betty\" bombers heading their way but this wasn't a ordinary fleet. He recognized the \"Betties\" but he didn't recognize what they were carrying. He saw a new weapon that looked like a large rocket but not for long because the \"Betties\" turned away. This worried him because he didn't know what the JM's were doing. <br>\r\n Sonic was in a different situation. He moved to a temporary position as a Marine (no one knows why or how). However he saw some \"Betties\" and Zeroes coming towards the ship. He reacted fast and ordered them to prepare for battle. The \"Betties\" came to them as predicted. <br>\r\n Sonic was in trouble as he saw the Zeros fire at the Abele (ship they were on) they of course fired back and knocked out at least five of them but then he saw the \"special\" planes come. These came and fired the weapon, which seemed like a rocket with wings and a tail. In reality it was a piloted bomb<br>\r\n  Tails flew over and didn't believe his eyes.

Tails was supremely confident in his abilities as a fighter pilot and had been waiting for this day. Tails calls bingo fuel after a long uneventful flight when\u2026 BANG. Tails' plane dives by itself. Tails rolls the plane over to bail when it climbs. Tails hears his squadron mates say they destroyed a Fw190 that attacked Tails. Tails rolls the plane on its belly when it dives again. So he then rolls it on its back so it'll climb. \"Damage assessment.\" \"Uh I may need my vision checked but I think you lost your tail.\" (Without the tail the air will push the plane down if it's right-side-up and push it up if it's upside down.) Tails tries to bail but the canopy is stuck. He rolls over 500 times on the way back. All the while he's on fire. He times it right and lands the plane where the canopy is broken and Tails climbs out. Because his plane was on fire for so long he became known as Firefox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tails is in the air he sees a 109 on his tail. What will he do\u2026</span></div></div>",

Making him a double ace in the Spitfire on day one, without firing a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his victory leaves a bitter taste. 18 V1s got through and ponded London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails: Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrick: (Tails' #3 of 4, and his second most experienced pilot.) Why what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails: Why are we fighting. We're not ready for a ground attack and only 20 miles of water separate us and the Third Reich. Even if we do stop the air raids, we can't stop a ground attack. Is it even possible to win? We've made so many mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrick: (BTW he's an African Leopard about 6'2 and 200 pounds.) No. You've made one BIG mistake. That stupid pity of yours, that's your mistake, but it ends RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW! If you think like that it will be impossible. Remember America? We thought it was impossible for them to win against the most powerful nation, but they did. Why can't we do the same? GET YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT TAILS! OR I'LL PUT A BULLET IN YOU MYSELF TO MAKE ROOM FOR THOSE WHO WILL STAND AND FIGHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails:...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrick: When we get back to base, I'm going to teach you a lesson. Personally.</span></div></div>",

Probably a blank spot, as usual. For some reason, the Russain pilots haven't been very active recently. Was it because they were gearing up for a big offensive? Unlikely, they didn't have any forwawrd airbases to launch from. Then they'd only be able to launch their long-range planes, the big Tupolev bombers. A Tupolev without air cover was, in short, a heap of cow flop. Even the Russians themselves had admitted that. So what <i>were</i> they up to? Suddenly, the scramble alarm started yelling yet again.<br>\r\nHe jumped into his Raptor, which had just finished refuelling and re-arming. Once again, he was up in the air in a few seconds, ready to go. Within a minute, he had a formation of eight bogeys on his radar-should be enough for his squad of four Raptors to take on.<br>\r\n\"Lighting Squadron, report in,\" Tails said calmly over his radio.<br>\r\n\"Lightning One, standing by.\"<br>\r\n\"Lightning Two, standing by.\"<br>\r\n\"Lightning Three, standing-\"<br>\r\nA humongous explosion shook the skies as Lightning Three was shot out of the sky by a KS-172 long range fighter-killer missile.<br>\r\n\"Lightning Command, evasive action! Repeat evasive action!\" Tails bellowed as the squadron broke up in mid-flight. How were these Russians able to take them out at such long range?! The only plane able to run to the U.S. mainland from Russia was the Tupolev, which didn't carry missiles!<br>\r\nAnother blast told Tails that he only had one wingman left-he checked his squad list. Well, there was at least some good news! The survivor was Lightning Two, Lightning Squadron's second best pilot to Tails himself.<br>\r\n\"L-2, break left! Two bogeys bearing down on you, three o'clock high!\"<br>\r\nThe obedient pilot broke left as told, giving the rapidly approaching Russians a harder time to catch him. To do that, they'd have to do a vertical dive at Mach 2.<br>\r\nThen, his radar warning confirmed five missiles locked onto him at the same second. </span></div></div>",
