The rebuilt 7th Heaven was a thriving business, an integral part of the ever growing Neo Midgar, a city that was being built up from the remains of the past, and she wouldn't of had it any other way. Tifa made her way back over to the bar itself to run a warm, wet cloth over the top, rubbing a little to make the surface shine. It felt strange to go back to being a bartender, after having saved the world, but in her mind she knew that it was the right thing to do. She had no other home to go to, and given the world had almost gone to hell, everyone could do with going somewhere to relax and forget their worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Tifa stretched her slender arms high above her head, closing her eyes as she felt her shoulders tense, then sink in relaxation. It was rewarding work, but it was hard work, and left Tifa with a lot of late nights to contend with. Making sure that everything was switched off for the night, Tifa made her way upstairs, to the small apartment she lived in above the bar. She was exhausted, and the thought of a hot bath and snuggling down into her bed was the one that appealed the most to her. Tifa padded into her apartment and made for the bathroom right away, turning on the hot taps and letting the bath tub fill up with water. Sitting down on the edge of the bath, Tifa leant down to peel her shoes off, before undoing the belt that clipped her black skirt into place. As it fell about her ankles, Tifa gazed down at herself for a long moment, frowning as her thin fingers felt over the slightly rounded curve of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to cut down on the free drinks,\" Tifa admitted to herself on feeling the considerable beer belly that was sticking out from underneath her cropped white top, a perfect curve of flesh that felt warm to the touch, \"I forget how many calories are in those things.\" She pulled her top off to join her skirt down on the floor, before climbing into the hot, bubbly bathwater. She closed her eyes, relaxing as she sank down into the water completely, her long dark hair curling in soft tendrils in the water about her. She could forget about the bar for a moment, about her worries over Cloud, about the beer belly that was starting to show given her skimpy work uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Given Tifa was a stunningly beautiful barmaid with a generously sized chest, it was almost every other customer who insisted that she 'have a drink on them'. Still trying to build up her customer base to turn over a decent profit in the first year of her business, Tifa realised wearily that she had no choice but to accept most of them. She aimed for drinks that weren't too alcoholic, beers mostly, given she still had to work. Unfortunately beers were packed with calories in a way spirits and wines weren't, her usual drink of choice, and even someone as fighting fit as Tifa wasn't immune to the effects of several extra calories a day. She was fortunate she had a fairly active job, Tifa knew that her problem would be much bigger had she not had a job where she was on her feet all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was beautiful, from her amber eyes, to her heart shaped face, and to her long legs that were complimented by the short black skirt she wore. Her breasts were round and full, and strained at the white tank top she wore for work, perky despite their size. Until recently her stomach had been flat and toned, with the hints of abs under the pale skin. Weeks of beer had pushed her slightly softer stomach out into a pot belly, which was fast developing into a heavy gut that hung over the waistband of her skirt. She looked almost seven months pregnant, given the rest of her body was still slender and toned, Tifa sighed a little as she looked down at the rounded belly that stuck out stubbornly from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to work out more,\" Tifa ran a hand over the curve of it, it was surprisingly firm to the touch, and quite heavy as she ran her palm under the bottom of it, \"Seriously. I don't know how much bigger I can get.\" She could feel her stomach swaying with her as she walked behind the bar, and noted with some embarrassment that she had to take extra care not to knock anything off the low shelf behind the bar; her bigger stomach made the area behind the counter feel all the more narrow. Blushing a little to herself, Tifa poured out a couple of glasses for two of the locals, biting back a groan as they grinned, and insisted she had a drink on them. </span></div></div>",

As she had had time to digest the massive amount of calories from the beers, her body had softened all over. Her face was rounder, a second chin almost appearing in view. Her rear end was almost as large as her stomach now, jiggling as well and competing, it seemed, with her stomach for dominance behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her patrons didn't care. They would rub her increasing gut as a good luck charm and buy her another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach day Tifa would head upstairs to sleep bloated and exhausted, the stairs she took to get her to her bed more of an ordeal as each day passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, she vowed to truly change and refuse any free drinks from now on.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach had billowed out to the point of making her look as if she were seven months pregnant. With twins. It was strange, Tifa mused as she sank back into her bubble bath for the evening, her stomach sticking out from the water no matter how deep she had ran her bath. The calories from the drinks had added fat mainly to her stomach, giving it a smooth, rounded appearance that was surprisingly taut to the touch. Tifa pushed down against the curve of her stomach with the flat of her hand, not wanting to think of how many calories she had consumed in order to get it to that size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the locals, her beer belly was the talk of the city. People would travel to be served by the pretty young barmaid with long legs, big breasts, and a pot belly that bounced with every step that she took. Tifa blushed a little as she sank down into the bubbles, she had to admit, she did like the fact that more people seemed attracted to her now. She felt over her stomach thoughtfully as she tilted her head back, her eyes closing contentedly as she lost herself to her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she get more customers if she got her stomach bigger? </span></div></div>",

And if they wanted a fat barmaid, then a fat barmaid they would get. After her bath, which she pondered over this choice for half an hour more, weighing the options available to her, she decided that this is what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor too long had her life been ruled by diets and watching what she ate. She would enjoy herself and pig out on the foods she had long denied to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGut, she reminded herself with a bit of a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was determined not to get down in the dumps over her size from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking from the bathroom to her kitchen, after dressing of course, Tifa noted how tight her shirt was and how her gut pushed out against her shirt. Opening her fridge, she saw a pint of ice cream and some chocolate syrup, the ice cream largely full, the treat having been placed there when Marlene had stayed the night a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking both out, she drenched the vanilla ice cream in syrup and took a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically moaned at the taste and shoved a larger spoonful in after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had scooped out the last of the ice cream from the carton, she was nearly full, her gut taut at the touch, quite unlike her stomach after being filled with beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing filled with food was better, she decided, as she rummaged around her fridge for more empty calories, for more food to completely sate her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tifa expanded slowly, but steadily, over the weeks. Her nightly binges packed full of empty calories had started to really add the pounds to her frame, her whole form had rounded out until she had become quite the butterball. The most prominent part of her new body was her stomach. It was huge, round and bulging, and stuck out several inches in front of her. Tifa had even had to sort out the storage behind the bar to prevent herself from knocking expensive bottles of drink over; and even then it was a tight squeeze. It gave her a thrill, she admitted, at the fact her stomach brushed the edge of the bar no matter how far back she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were full and wide, and her legs tapered down towards her still fairly small ankles. Her rear stuck out behind her into a generous curve of flesh, one that pulled at the larger black miniskirt she had to buy, which was fast becoming too tight for her. Her breasts were larger, and strained at the white tank top that now resembled more of a crop top, given it had no hopes of even covering the top of her fat gut. Tifa's face had rounded out some, but stayed mostly the same, asides from the double chin that was sneaking in whenever she smiled. And customer service was better than ever, due to her expanded body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an absent minded comment by one of her regulars that gave Tifa her next idea. Given how busy the bar was now, Tifa had hired a few barmaids to help her run the place, and give her some much needed time off now and again. They were local girls, pretty and slender, and were already winning over the customers with their charm. But, as one customer correctly assessed, they were missing something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" the man remarked after receiving his drink, his eye fixed pointedly on Tifa's massive stomach, \"It's a shame those girls ain't as gorgeous as you. Imagine goin' to a place where all the girls are big and beautiful.\" Tifa watched him thoughtfully as she moved to serve another customer. It was her large size that had made the place so popular, Tifa realised, what would an entire staff of big girls do for them? She let her mind wander as she thought to what the place would look like, she would certainly had to make a few changes here and there to cope with the larger sizes, but it wasn't anything she couldn't afford now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa nodded her head to herself, and began making arrangements that very night. The first step was getting the rest of the girls to put on weight. </span></div></div>",

The hours can be long, the patrons, sometimes, unruly, but I am incredibly grateful for the sacrifices you have made in helping this bar to become a success. So I'm going to say this straight out: I believe that, instead of one fat barmaid, the whole staff should gain weight. If I can draw in customers with this fat body of mine, then imagine what we could draw if everyone here was larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around for the initial reactions to her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some who went pale, some who looked excited, and others that seemed confused in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, Tifa received her answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll gain,\" one woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat opened the floodgates as all the other women eventually agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll gain,\" the final woman said, \"But I want reassurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind?\" Tifa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you, being our boss, to set the heaviest example. Promise me that you'll always be larger than the largest of us and I'll gain as much as you want me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last woman expected Tifa to disagree, to argue that she'd already filled out enough, but Tifa merely offered her famous warm smile and rubbed her gut, feeling the soft flesh her largest feature possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. Of course I'll be the biggest. Now we have a few hours before the rush starts. What do you ladies say to a buffet?\" </span></div></div>",

Her padded bottom jiggling with each step as she bought food and drink to her loyal patrons. Her once thin chef blossomed into a hefty 300 lbs belly heavy beauty. Her skill not wavering even with the increasing difficulty that reaching around her big belly bought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleaning crew, consisting of 3 lithe women, had expanded the most out of the workers as they demolished their share of food along with the discarded dishes and misplaced orders. They each clocked in at a whopping 400 lbs of feminine flab, their bodies all taking on hourglass shapes. Patrons would deliberately spill just to get a glimpse at the assets these gals were packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, by far, was the largest as agreed weighing in at an amazing 550 lbs of flabby beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks had thickened to the point that her eyes appeared slightly squinted and her thick lips always appeared to be slightly puckered. This added to the charm of her smile, causing quite a few patrons to offer more than a drink to her in a night. She always refused but was beginning to get flattered at their creative speech when asking her for some alone time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already bulbous breasts grew thicker and elongated as she continued to gain, they no longer rested atop her upper belly fold, taking on a tear-shaped appearance as they cascaded down her flabby sides. She had forsaken bras a few hundred pounds back as they did little to support their weight and had instead taken to stuffing them into her tube top instead. She loved the breezes that would whisk across her cleavage and her nipples, when she had grown too excited by her feasting, to even think about ordering another bra again. They had grown more sensitive, strangely enough, causing her to not get violent if a drunk patron tried to cop a feel. She would stifle a moan and hold back a smile despite her growing arousal long enough to correct the individual and have him or her sent home for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had taken on a hefty double folded appearance with a pair of lardy love handles and dimpled underbelly for definition. She had no desire to change her outfit other than its sizes, as such, her black miniskirt was held atop her dimpled backside and flabby forefront by her overworked suspenders alone. Her uppermost belly fold engulfing the waistband, her lowermost fold exposed underneath, in the front while her blubbery butt spilled over and under from behind.<br>\r\nShe had long sense discarded of her belt, her fat finger made it near impossible to adjust properly anyway. Seated her belly reached her knees, mid thigh when standing, always distended and ever growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perky bubble butt had long since been losing its tightness and now was heart-shaped and cellulite dimpled. Her dimpled hips, thunderous thighs, and blubbery butt being perhaps the widest part of her body. Small folds of back fat wrapped around and stacked themselves atop its mass, while its lower cleft succumbed to gravity atop her thunderous thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa had become truly massive and their was no one in Midgar who hadn't heard about it. Her bar soon became a high profile area and her massive body a sort of symbol of her prosperity. Time continued to pass with her and her staff thickening and growing until the day that a familiar face came through the doors at closing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tifa was left both impressed and awed as she watched her girls fill out, going from slender, to overweight, and then into the chubbier territory. She kept in mind that she was always to be the heaviest, she had made a promise, and Tifa Lockheart never went back on a promise. It came as a surprise to her one day, that the barmaid who had made her make said promise in the first place, was only pounds away from meeting TIfa's own weight. It wasn't as if she hadn't been trying, Tifa fretted, she had kept up her nightly binges religiously, but her weight gain had slowed down lately; she guessed it was due to her metabolism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa sighed as she walked down the stairs from her apartment, noticing with a shiver how she now brushed the sides of the staircase, and into the bar that had been renovated since she had started her brilliant idea. The area behind the bar had been made a lot wider to accommodate the growing barmaids, and all bottles and glasses were kept above the bar level, to avoid accidents. A mirror had been fitted behind the bottles, so the girls could keep tab on their appearances, especially concerning buttons accidentally popping off mid shift; something that had become such an occurrence, the girls had started up a betting pool over who was going to pop next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with reinforced seats and tables, Tifa was just as eager to welcome bigger people to her bar, the bar had never looked better than ever. Tifa's only worry was keeping her promise by being the fattest, and she had to turn to one of her old allies for help. Tifa looked up as she heard the widened doors open, the lean silhouette of the young ninja thief framed in the bright sunshine outside. Yuffie's face broke into a smile as she approached Tifa, leaning up to hug the dark haired girl about the neck, before standing back to admire her bigger form with a low whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Tif',\" Yuffie grinned at her as they took a seat in one of the booths, \"You've really porked up, huh?\" Tifa felt her chubby cheeks flush, Yuffie gave a good natured laugh, leaning back against the seat with a grin. \"It looks good on you. So,\" she added, before Tifa could become more flustered, \"What can I help you with?\" Tifa couldn't help but compare how big and fat she was compared to the lean ninja, she was easily four times the size of Yuffie, and possibly even more than that. Still, she explained her predicament to Yuffie, and was surprised when the younger suddenly smiled even more brightly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got just the thing,\" Yuffie reached into her bag, pulling out a glowing orb of materia, \"I found this stuff by accident.

They had set up a large chair for Tifa to sit on, slightly elevated so that the entire room could get a good view of her. It was comfortable, given she would be sat there for some time, and was built to expand for her size should it need to. A display above her head showed her current weight, a massive five hundred and ten pounds already. Tifa herself was sat in the chair elegantly, dressed in a short miniskirt and a crop top, her bare stomach exposed for anyone to rub. A collection of treats were to one side, ranging from sweet chocolates to sugary snacks. On entering the bar, the customer would take a treat, feed it to her, and then rub her enormous stomach for luck. Tifa was nervous when it came to opening time, even more so on seeing the huge crowd outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust halfway through the night, Tifa's weight was now displaying at five hundred and eighteen pounds. Tifa groaned a little as she felt her overstuffed stomach, it bloated out in front of her so wide it almost obscured her vision of the door. Each treat was fattening and packed with sugar, and it was starting to show in how she had almost gained ten pounds in just the first night. Tifa sighed as she rubbed over it, smiling a little dazedly despite herself. It was a great idea, she decided, before looking up as the next person entered, for her eyes to open wide. </span></div></div>",

His daughter, his little girl, pushing food into Tifa's mouth, all while the older woman begged her to; with a whining that was unnatural, and out of character for her. Barret frowned a little as he stood in the doorway, studying the look on Marlene's face. She was a girl obsessed, her eyes gleaming in a way that chilled him to the bone as she continued to make Tifa fatter and wider before his eyes. He noticed the materia glowing gently to the side, and it hit him with a sudden retaliation; it was the damn materia he had given her that had started all of this. Angry at himself for giving such power to a little girl who clearly wasn't mature enough to use it safely, he strode across the room to take it. Marlene turned her head, gasping softly on seeing her father there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad,\" she stammered, her brown eyes wide as she tried to look innocent, \"I didn't do this.. um... Tifa made a wish and..\" she trailed off as Barret slowly shook his head. He knew her far better than that, and he knew Tifa too, and this wasn't something she would have wanted. Marlene had been obsessed with Tifa's weight lately, to an unhealthy degree, and had even begun to try and gain weight herself by eating extra helpings at meal times. Barret could have kicked himself, he should have seen it coming, and was about to speak when Tifa did, her eyes dazed as she looked to Marlene with a soft whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry,\" she whimpered, reaching out pathetically towards the food that was still stacked to the side, \"Feed me? I'm just so hungry.\" Barret's resolve darkened on hearing his strong, proud friend reduced to little more than a whining child, and while it broke his heart to do so, he reached for his PHS to call for back up, his eyes never leaving Marlene, who had tensed up completely underneath her father's stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Marlene,\" Barret sighed as he hung up, \"You need help. You're not right if you do something like this, kid.\" Marlene stuck out her lower lip into a pout, tears glistening in her brown eyes. Before Barret could reach out to her, she began stuffing Tifa again, giggling with glee as she forced more and more of the food into Tifa's massive gut. Barret wrapped a muscular arm about Marlene to pull her back, but not before several pounds of weight had been added to the already immobile Tifa's massive waist. Tifa whined softly as the feeding stopped, and Marlene struggled against Barret's arm to try to get back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, everyone involved decided that it would be best for Marlene to attend a home for the mentally sick. Her obsession with weight gain never really stopped as she grew older, she had gained a considerable amount herself, and was focused on trying to get everyone else to become massively overweight too. It was a slow and steady process that saw the obsession with other's weight start to fade, and after several psychological assessments, the much heavier Marlene was allowed into a less strict home. It was only when they discovered that Marlene had held a poor nurse hostage and stuffed her to the point of bursting that they realised their mistake, and she was confined once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was really never the same after that wish. Barret, Cloud, and even Rufus ShinRa had worked with the materia trying to bring her mind back to a normal state, but a lot of the power had been used up by the original wish. The best they could do was to at least stop her hunger and whining, though it gave her a childlike state of mind. Rufus had gone one step further into paying for surgery to help Tifa lose the sheer amount of weight; if she stayed at that size, she would die. Several years of careful dieting and rehabilitation had bought Tifa down to just twenty pounds over her original weight, her entire body softer without the toning she had gotten from fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie took over the 7th Heaven bar for her, and made sure that while the girls were big, they would never get anywhere close to how big Tifa had become, the idea unsettled her so deeply, she lost sleep thinking about it. Her beautiful, smart friend had been reduced to so little, and all because of one selfish little girl. Yuffie rubbed at her forehead, they said Marlene was insane, she personally thought the girl was smarter than she let on, and that scared her even more. Yuffie slimmed down a little out of anxiety, food didn't seem quite the same to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was in a home too now, one for mentally challenged adults who would never be well enough to function in society on their own. She spent her days mostly gazing out of the window, with flashes of memory of the life she once had, a half smile on her face. Cloud visited daily, and while she would smile at him, there was only a hint of his best friend left in those brown eyes. He would force a smile back, and sit with her on hours on end, her small hand in his. Every now and again her eyes would light up, as if about to return to herself, only for them to fade again. </span></div></div>",

Her duties now didn't lie with healing her comrades, or summoning help from mystical beasts above, it was with seeing that her kingdom was well looked after. In actuality, Garnet had very little to do when it came to the every day running of her city. Her guards knew their positions, and followed the law rigidly, even the Pluto knights had shaped up to perform their jobs almost flawlessly. Her advisor took care of everything without so much as a bat of his eyelid, and would report to her at the end of the week with a two hour meeting that told her almost everything that was going on in her kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust two years after her coronation, Garnet was left to her own devices during the day, as long as she didn't leave the castle without being flanked by at least two bodyguards. It was tiresome, Garnet knew full well they were only looking out for her best interest, but it was just so boring not being able to go where she wanted to, and when she wanted to. She found herself missing her travels with Zidane all the more, but if she were honest, she missed the monkey tailed thief even more. Kuja had always been fast to call Garnet a canary who wasn't content with remaining in her gilded cage, it was even more true for Zidane. While his official home was the castle, he came and went as he pleased, sometimes disappearing for months at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Garnet hadn't loved him quite so much, she would have insisted he stayed with her. But the moment she saw that adventurous look enter his aqua eyes, she couldn't dream of holding him back. Hearing his tales about his adventures, about where he had been, about the strange people he had met, that was enough for Garnet for now. She could see the world through his eyes, even if she was no longer allowed to explore it with her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEighteen years old and strikingly beautiful, Garnet had filled out a little since her early teenage years. Her hips flared out from her narrow waist, and her modest breasts filled a top nicely. Her rear was rounded for a thin girl, though it was hidden for the greater part of the time underneath the dresses she was required to wear as Queen. She was still on the thin side, too thin, Doctor Tot often lamented, but it was growing increasingly hard to keep her trim figure when she had nothing to do around the castle. Her days were spent in the library, reading up everything that she could, surfacing occasionally for meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut lately, all of that sitting around was taking it's toll on her figure. </span></div></div>",

As he walked up the spiral staircase to the throne room, he smiled as he imagined her greeting hug. They were always so full of life. Of course the fact that she pressed her breasts practically right into his face was not factoring in his head at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he winked at Steiner, who was guarding the door with Beatrix, he practically strutted before the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Garnet was there, in all her majesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a bit more majesty as he glanced at her body. Her face was a bit rounder, her middle as well, and when she stood up to come closer to him he could tell that her rear was taking up more and more of her wide dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his arm to receive a hug, she nearly bowled him over, kissing him fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily they were alone or else Garnet would have had to put off such an emotional display until later.

Taking that as their cue, the pair went into the royal dining hall, where, to their surprise, they found Freya seated among the attendants along with Beatrix and Steiner, Garnet insisting that her two heads of security join her for this repast as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, Zidane took a glance around, noticing Beatrix's rounder face and Freya's kind-of-plump middle.

But watching her adjust her especially adapted armour over her fuller figure, Zidane knew that something had to be going on. Beatrix had rounded out to the point that she had developed a waddle, one that made the plates of her armour clank erratically whenever she was on patrol. Her stomach was huge, a fleshy mound that jiggled with each step that she took, and her heavy breasts weighed down on top of it. Her legs were full and curvy, and brushed against one another as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would quite easily, Zidane realised with some surprised, outweigh ol' Rusty by this point. He slapped on a sheepish smile on seeing that she was staring at him, and he stuck up his hand in greeting. \"Yo. Is Garnet about?\" he asked, he hadn't seen the young Queen that morning; they were of course forbidden to share a room until they were married, \"I was gonna see about taking her out into town for a bit. Before you ask,\" he added, Beatrix had parted her plump lips to cut in, \"I'm considered a bodyguard an' we're taking Freya with us too. That's two bodyguards.\" Beatrix frowned, Zidane had a very good point, Zidane, Freya, and even Garnet herself had once saved the world. They were more than enough to protect their Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. where will you be taking her?\" Beatrix finally queried. She could at least be assured that the place was a safe one, and not one of the dive bars she knew Zidane frequented when he needed a pick me up. Zidane rubbed over the back of his neck, his tail swaying gently from one side to the other. Beatrix had noted, with some amusement, that Zidane's tail tended to follow his emotions. When he was angry, it bristled, when he was sad it drooped behind him, when he was excited it was all over the place, and when he was thoughtful, it swayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about taking her to an All You Can Eat that's going on down at the Blue Lagoon,\" Zidane admitted, \"She's really enjoyin' her food lately, and you get to taste stuff from all over Gaia there. Lets her have a chance to see what else is out there, you know? Since she can't just up and leave the city any more.\" While he personally thought it was cruel keeping her locked up like that, he could reluctantly see why they had to.

It boasted a fairly popular bar, and a dining room that was surrounded by fish tanks, filled with the most tropical life they could get their hands on. It had the effect of making the diners feel as if they were underwater, especially with the glass ceiling that let the natural sky shine through. Lights were in the floor at intervals, helping add to the atmosphere by shooting soft beams of light up to the ceiling. Garnet was enchanted as Zidane led her inside, gazing around with awe in her gentle brown eyes. She had never seen such a beautiful place, and while the rational part of her mind told her she was still in Alexandria, her imagination let her be anywhere that she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Zidane,\" Garnet murmured, clasping his arm tightly with her own, \"This is amazing.\" Her yellow jumpsuit clung generously to her curves, creases appearing in the form fitting material about her round stomach, and full rear end. Garnet blushed a little as she walked to their table with Zidane, she was getting a lot of looks from having her gluttony so blatantly on display, and she could feel every ounce of her fleshier body jiggling slightly with every step. Zidane showed surprising manners by pulling out Garnet's chair for her, and when she had sat down, tried to push it in for her.

Zidane had set off from Alexandria some months ago, willing to look anywhere and everywhere for help. While he wasn't opposed to the fact Garnet had gotten bigger, and he wouldn't love her any less if she grew twice the size of Brahne, he still wanted the cure to be an option for her. Garnet had gone quiet on learning about what was making her so constantly hungry, and while she kept up a brave face, Zidane could read her like a book. She was scared, and he wanted to relieve her, no matter what it took. It was with that Zidane pushed on, raking the libraries around the world for any information on the Spell of Alexandria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Garnet was growing steadily underneath the effects of the spell. Doctor Tot estimated she had roughly reached half the weight Brahne was when she was at her largest, and Garnet was still growing by the day. The castle was fortunately adapted for housing Brahne's large build, so that had never been an issue, but the young Queen found herself having to ask for new clothes. Her body was wide and fleshy, her stomach spreading out between her fatter legs, the pretty white dress she wore clinging to her bigger curves. She was eating almost all of the time now, even when she tried to break away to read, she would find herself reaching for food again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet rubbed at the bulge of her stomach after consuming an entire cake, one that would have served over a hundred people easily, crumbs and flakes of frosting clinging about her mouth.

She was sometimes afraid he had left because of her size, even though she trusted him far more than that. In the end, he was still a flighty person. A sudden rip bought her thoughts back down to earth, and she looked in dismay at the popped seam of her dress, creamy white flesh poking through the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garnet!\" the young Queen was torn away from her despair at Zidane's voice, smiling at him as he ran to her with spark and energy in every step, \"I found a cure!

The tables of the rich and powerful that hosted her soon found their own ladies bursting the buttons of their clothes and making way for fuller rears and rounding bellies. From Lindblum, Garnet decided to vacation a bit in Treno, the card-obsessed city soon becoming the card-and-food-possessed city after Garnet left a month later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet continued to gain, her appetite for food increasing naturally this time instead of through magical means. But as she arrived back home in Alexandria, noting the swelling females of the continent along the way, she discovered that she had regained total mobility, something that was on the wane when she had left her lands. Doctor Tot, upon being notified of this, theorized that the love of fat that Garnet inspired had altered the spell, aiding those who were now overweight throughout Alexandria as women who couldn't feed themselves were suddenly able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet, for one, was happy that she could move around, but secretly still enjoyed letting a few of her fatter maids feed her desserts from the kitchen. And of course she loved it when Zidane would feed her the richest foods he had found while Garnet was busy with her feasting during her trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Garnet neared five hundred pounds, the citizens of Alexandria decided to hold a party in honor of their queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd try as she might, Garnet could not get them to stop.

Their journey had been an incredible one, she had learned far more about herself than she could ever hoped for, but now it was back to the daily grind of working, and going home to a now empty house. Serah had moved out to be with her lughead of a fianc\u00e9e Snow, Lightning rolled her eyes slightly at the thought of the broad shouldered man; while she had learned to tolerate him a lot more over their travelling together, she still thought her little sister could do a lot better. Still, she had given them their blessing, and they were to get married the following month. Serah had bought over a bridesmaid dress for her to try on, Lightning just felt so awkward in it; she didn't do dresses, the skirt she wore on a daily basis was only bearable due to the shorts she wore underneath it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning was tall and thin, and toned. Her sister Serah was a little shorter, and softer, she was slender but didn't have quite the same stick thin look that her older sister had. Serah was the kind of girl that looked gorgeous in a dress, it clung to what little curves she had, and made her look beautiful. Lightning had only tried on her bridesmaid dress once, and she felt more awkward and skinny than ever in it. Still, it was her sister's big day, in the end Lightning would do whatever she could to make Serah happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late when Lightning got in that night, exhausted from a full day's work. She flicked on the light in the hallway, placing her gunblade down in the stand by the coat rack, and shrugging off her jacket to hang up over it. She noticed the red light of her answering machine flashing in the mirror, and turned to press the button to hear her messages, turning away in the meantime to pad through to the kitchen. She hadn't eaten since breakfast, and that had been just fruit and cereal, it really was no wonder she had actually managed to lose weight lately from her already thin frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Have. One. New. Message.\" her answering machine informed her, before beeping, and playing back the message for Lightning as she set about making herself something to eat. </span></div></div>",

As the sisters hugged, Serah couldn't help but notice the slight softness she felt as her body met her sister's. Stepping back a bit, Serah glanced down quickly at Lightning's still slightly full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the oddest sight, to see any extra weight on Lightning. Her sister could be the poster child for dieting success, Serah figured, whipping her lanky figure into a lean, toned, fighting machine. But along with the oddness, Serah also felt a sense of relief. She had often worried about Lightning's weight and this extra pudge may be the solution to her stress over her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to invite you to dinner again Claire. Snow and I really enjoyed having you over last time. Will you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning, unaware of her sister's mental observations, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her food forgotten, Lightning reached the hospital in record time, no doubt breaking a good few laws on the way to get the maximum speed that she could. She barked her sister's name at the poor receptionist on duty, before striding past her to the correct part of the hospital, her mind straying as she walked down the narrow hallway as briskly as she could. Snow's message had been shaky, and hard to understand at best, but he had managed to choke out that he and Serah had gotten into an accident when she had been practising her driving. Lightning's thin lips drew in tightly against one another, her first instinct was to blame Snow completely for the entire thing, but the nagging part of her mind reminded her that it wasn't the way to go, no matter how frightened she was for her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reaching the right floor, Lightning could see Snow sat in the waiting area, his broad form stooped over as he rested his hands down on his knees. He looked up on hearing Lightning's footsteps echo on the tiled floor, a bandage wrapped about his forehead, a severe looking graze on his cheek. He looked a little relieved to see the elder Farron sister, and stood up, hjis eyes red rimmed and his skin a little paler than usual underneath the artificial lights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light,\" he greeted her hoarsely, his usually playfulness absent from his tone, \"Sorry.. been tryin' to get hold of you all day.\" Lightning looked him over with a critical blue-green stare, before touching her hands to his wide shoulders, and forced him to sit back down in his chair. He was injured, and she noted that he was shaking slightly, no doubt he was in shock still. He shouldn't have been left alone, despite her worry for her sister, Lightning felt a frustrated urge to grab the nearest doctor and demand to know why that had happened. Instead she sank into the seat next to him, folding her arms across her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she?\" Lightning asked after a moment of silence between them, she knew if Serah had been well enough for visitors, then Snow would be in there grasping her tiny hand in his. Given he was stuck in the corridor outside, that meant Serah was still being taken care of, and that he probably knew no more than her about how she was doing. She was correct as Snow shook his head slowly, his blond hair swaying slightly from the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" he admitted with a sigh, folding his arms back onto his knees, \"Haven't seen her since they bought us in. It was bad, Light,\" he added, looking over to her with light blue eyes, \"I don't know what happened. Serah turned the car, then there was a massive crashin' sound. They told me later that we'd collided with a truck,\" he added, reaching up to massage over his brow, \"Guess Serah didn't see it coming. I didn't wake up until I got here, and Serah was already in the theatre by the time I was allowed to get out of bed.\" He bowed his head, biting down hard over his lower lip, his hands clenching at his knees. \"Bet you hate me, huh?\" Lightning watched him, before slowly shaking her head, leaning back in her seat and crossing one leg over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she responded as calmly as ever, \"Accidents happen. As much as I want to blame you for this.. I can't bring myself to. Right now,\" she took a moment to gather her thoughts, before heaving a soft sigh, \"... right now Serah needs for us to be strong for her. It won't solve anything if we blame anyone. We just need to be there for her, and wait until we get some news,\" she looked sidelong to Snow, her eyes narrowing a little, \"You look like crap. You should go home and rest. I can inform you if anything happens.\" Snow snorted softly, leaning back against the wall behind his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I ain't leavin' until I know what's going on,\" Snow responded stubbornly, \"I can't rest when Serah's like this!\" Lighting sighed, shaking her head to herself. It was a predictable outcome, but it wasn't as if she hadn't tried to get the older man to go home. She closed her eyes for a moment against the gritty feeling underneath her eyelids, it had been a very long day at work, what she really needed to do now was get some much needed sleep. Not that she could blame her poor little sister for getting herself into a car accident, and she never would, no matter how much sleep she lost because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Lightning had been quiet for a matter of time now, Snow glanced over to the rose haired female, stunned to see her asleep. Lightning had her head tilted back against the wall, her leg still crossed over the other, her usually stern face somewhat softer and peaceful looking as she slept. Snow studied her for a while, it was at that moment he could see even more of a resemblance between Lightning and her younger sister. Lightning looked exhausted underneath the harsh lighting, shadows underneath her eyes, and even Snow noticed that she had dropped weight recently. He shook his head to himself, leaning back against the wall as he gazed at the clock opposite. When Serah found out, she was bound to have words with her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours later that a doctor finally emerged from one of the rooms, looking shattered and unkempt, his brow speckled with sweat. Snow sat up the moment he approached the pair, the rustling of fabric jerked Lightning awake, and she too focused up on the doctor with bleary sea green eyes. </span></div></div>",

She fought hard, but she passed away in theatre.\" Lightning listened with the dazed sensation of being outside of the conversation completely, as if it wasn't happening to her. Snow let out a growl of frustration at her side,and struck at the wall with his clenched fist, desperate sobbing breaths leaving him as he struggled to keep his calm. Lightning's world continued to blur as she tried to focus on the doctor, who was still speaking to them about the complications that had arisen. Lightning swallowed thickly, before licking over her dry lips, only just trusting herself to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. can we see her?\" she finally asked, her voice shaking a little more than she realised. The doctor looked to her, before shaking his head slowly. Lightning had thought as much, Serah must have been in quite the state, and she was grateful for the chance to remember her uninjured and healthy. She just gave a small nod, her throat aching as she fought to keep herself composed. She had to remain strong, the sobbing Snow was clearly in no state to deal with this, and she wasn't willing to fall apart in front of a complete stranger. Lightning swallowed again. \"I see. Thank you.\" The doctor nodded, before moving away to deal with the paperwork that had came with Serah's death, while he was upset that such a young girl had died, his thoughts were only allowed to focus on the next patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit... damnit!\" Snow hit the wall harder, his harsh breathing racking his entire body, \"Serah... Serah! Why the hell... why the hell did this happen?!\" Hot tears were leaking from the corners of his eyes, he had almost lost the girl once, to lose her again with a more permanent fate hit him much harder than anything. He took in a deep, pain filled breath, pulling himself back from hitting the wall to study the young woman who would have been his sister in law in just a few weeks time. Lightning was as composed as ever, Snow felt the sudden urge to reach out and shake her by the shoulders, demanding that she show at least some emotion over her little sister's death. But he restrained himself, settling for resting his forearm against the wall with a heavy thud, resting his forehead down against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funeral was just over a week later, Serah's paperwork had been completed fairly quickly, it had been nothing more than a terrible accident that had claimed her life. Her funeral was a small, intimate affair, filled with her friends and members of Team Nora, with a sombre air hanging heavily over the proceedings. The ceremony itself was typical Serah, it was light and airy, with flowers that seemed to represent her short life in beautiful shades of pink and yellow. A couple of her friends spoke about her, Snow managed to choke out a few words, and then she was finally laid to rest next to the plot where her and Lightning's parents were buried. A more sentimental mind might have found relief at Serah at least being with their parents again, Lightning could hardly bring herself to touch upon such fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ceremony people began to leave, sharing their sympathies and regrets with both Lightning and Snow as they passed them by. Lightning forced herself to remain polite for the most part, despite wishing to be left alone to her own thoughts. She had found a close fitting black dress suit for the occasion, the a-line skirt flaring from her narrow waist, and the jacket nipping in tightly at the top. She barely spoke to the well wishers as they passed, just nodding her head to them at the soft words that were supposed to make her feel better, anger and guilt flaring in intervals within her; on one hand they were trying to help, on another they were just making her feel worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was just her and Snow left in the graveyard, with bright blue skies stretching far above them. While it didn't seem at all appropriate for a funereal, it did seem somewhat appropriate for Serah's sunny nature. Snow ran a hand down his face, his stubble more prominent than ever, approaching Lightning with the weary gait he hadn't lost since that night in the hospital. He still bore the scars of the accident on his face, a couple of black stitches holding the long scar over his eyebrow together. For a moment neither of them spoke, a gentle wind tugging at their clothes, and at their hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you ain't eaten in a week,\" Snow finally spoke hoarsely, gesturing with his hand, \".. c'mon. We should grab something.\" Usually Lightning would have refused, but right there and then, she realised that getting something to eat would help to ease the hollowness inside of her. If just a little bit. She nodded silently, and the pair of them left the graveyard. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cafe was one Snow had taken Serah to before, a pretty little place off the main square of the city, tucked away into the corner where many people just passed it by without a second thought. It was warm and cosy inside, with light orange walls and wooden tables and chairs, pictures of sunflowers completing the warm and sunny feel of the place. Lightning raised an eyebrow as she and Snow were given a table at the front of the shop, nestled against the shop front, and dropped into one of the chair's without another word. She didn't need to know that it was somewhere Serah loved, she could tell from the warm atmosphere alone that her little sister had loved it there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get a coffee, extra large with sugar,\" Snow managed to flick on his charming smile for the young waitress, though it was weak compared to it's usual brilliance, \"And uhh.. the pasta special. Thanks,\" he looked over to Light expectantly, who was looking at the menu with an expression that suggested she was quite out of her depth; it was an unusual look for the young woman to show, \"What about you, Light? It's on me.\" Lightning closed the menu, passing it to the waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea. Black,\" Lightning instructed, her eyes narrowing on the look that Snow was giving her, \"... what?\" The larger man sighed, rolling his eyes good naturedly before looking back up to the uncertain young waitress that was hovering nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll have what I'm having,\" Snow assured her, sending the waitress away before Lightning could even think of protesting, \"You've got to eat, Light,\" he added before she could even think of speaking, \"You're all bones! Serah was worried about you before, but lately you're getting worse. She'd be pissed if she could see you, you know?\" There was a certain pang in his chest at his words, Serah wasn't there to berate her sister for not taking better care of herself, but he was worried on her behalf, and hell, he was worried on his own behalf too. Lightning was a friend to him now, and he couldn't take a back seat while she was like this. Lightning frowned, before looking pointedly away to stare out of the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she managed shortly, \"I don't have the time to sit around eating.\" She hadn't felt like it either, every meal she had tried to choke down just made her think of Serah and her cooking, and her throat ached too badly to manage anything more than a few mouthfuls. She was aware that she wasn't eating well, it showed in how her clothes hung off her, and how weak she felt every now and again, but it wasn't something that she could fix overnight. Especially when she just didn't have the time to sit down and eat most days, or rather, she didn't allow herself the time. Stopping only let her thoughts drift back to Serah again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just humour me and eat a damn meal, Light,\" Snow finally sighed, though there was a good natured air to it, \"C'mon, it's free food. You can't pass up on that, right?\" He knew he had won by the way Lightning gave one of those sighs that suggested she wasn't willing to fight this, and managed a faint grin at the brief triumph he had won that day. Their drinks were put down on the table just moments later, Snow took a swig of his sugary coffee with a sigh of relief at getting the caffeine hit he needed so badly, while looking with undisguised disgust at Lightning's black tea. She raised a stern eyebrow at him as she set her cup back down on it's saucer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Snow held his hands up in mock defence, he knew damn well that despite being a good head or so taller and a great deal heavier, Light could knock him on his ass with one well aimed punch. That was the last thing he wanted to feel on that day, of all days. Light gave a snort in response, sighing as she continued to gaze out of the window. A heavy silence fell between them until the dishes arrived, large plates of pasta that was smothered in cheese and a tomato based sauce, with chopped vegetables mixed in. Snow took up his knife and fork to begin eating hungrily, he had skipped breakfast out of sheer anxiety that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning picked at her dish, taking a few bites of the pasta, admitting somewhat reluctantly that it tasted nicer than she had expected. The cheese was creamy, the tomato was a little sharp, and the vegetables added a deeper taste to the sauce. She had barely cleared quarter of the plate when her stomach became uncomfortably full, and she set down her fork with a light clink of metal against china. Snow looked over from where he was still ploughing through his own meal, swallowing his current mouthful, and taking a swig of coffee to drink it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full, huh?\" he questioned, piling more pasta up onto his fork to start eating again, \"Guess you're not used to eating too much now. Makes sense. I'm all the happier for knowing that you've eaten.\" He really was, while it was a small amount, it still meant that she had eaten something, and something filling and nutritious at that. Lighting rolled her eyes at him, and Snow hid a grin behind his fork. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spending time with Lightning was helping to ease his heavy heart about Serah. Snow would always love Serah for as long as he lived, and he would always miss her presence at his side, but gradually the permanent ache in his heart was starting to lift. He found excuse after excuse to get Lightning out of the house for something to eat, he even dropped by a couple of times to leave her a dish of food he had 'accidentally' cooked too much of for himself. Months had passed after Serah's funeral, and somehow, he and Lightning had managed to get closer through their grief. She had dropped her cold exterior a little around him, and at times Snow swore she actually wanted his company, and in return he found himself trying to be less jokey, and more genuine when it came to her. Some of the time, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking at the door with a bag of food in his hand, Snow managed to look innocent when Lightning finally opened the door to him, looking as if she had just gotten in from work. He gave her a grin, and held up the brown paper bag as a peace offering. Lighting looked it over, before rolling her eyes slightly, and stepping back to let him in. Snow did so, closing the front door behind him,and shrugging off his coat to hang it up on the peg; Lighting had threatened to physically hurt him the one and only time he had left it casually draped over the back of a chair. He grinned at her a little more, flicking some of his feathery white blond bangs back out of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get dinner sorted?\" he suggested good naturedly, \"You can grab a shower or whatever it is you do to relax after work. I'll be about twenty minutes or so.\" Lightning looked for a moment as if she were going to argue, before closing her eyes wearily. The idea of a hot shower did sound good to her aching muscles, and she gave a curt nod to let him know that was fine to her, disappearing up the stairs to the second floor of the home. Snow moved down the hallway to the kitchen,setting the paper bag on the side, and began hunting through Lightning's cupboards for a saucepan he could use. It was getting ridiculous, he pulled out drawer after drawer looking for what he needed, only finding more empty space or storage containers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light?\" Snow called as he made his way back through the hallway and up the stairs, assuming that she was still going to be showering, he couldn't have been looking for that long after all, \"You got any saucepans? I know your kitchen is mainly decorative, but I'm gonna need something if we want to get this dinner started.\" He moved up the last step into Lightning's bedroom, the door was slightly ajar and he nudged it further open, \"Light-\" he cut himself off on seeing the very vexed, very mostly naked Lightning in front of him, with just a towel wrapped about herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe months of meals had not gone to waste, Snow realised suddenly on seeing the way the towel clung to curves that had not been there before. Her legs were softer, still long and thin, but with a gentle softness to their shape that not had been there before. Her arms were the same, and her pretty face didn't look anywhere near as gaunt as it had done. Lightning held the towel tighter about herself at his presence, an awkward blush crossing her pale cheeks, her gaze dropping to look anywhere at him. For some reason that made her all the more attractive to Snow, who could see how stunning Lightning looked when she had a few more pounds on her slender frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Light,\" he began sheepishly, rubbing at the back of his neck, \"I was looking for a saucepan and figured you'd be in the shower already and-whoa, that doesn't make it sound any better. I didn't mean to walk in on you like this. Not that you look bad,\" he added hastily, well aware he was slowly digging himself deeper, \"You look good. Better.\" Lightning raised an eyebrow at that, the hand clutching her towel together tightening a little bit, though her eyes creased in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" Lightning questioned as she stepped closer to Snow, her bare feet silent on the wooden flooring of her bedroom, \"What makes you say that?\" Snow drank in every detail of the rose haired young woman before him, able to see the way her stomach pressed against her towel with every quiet breath she took, and the way her breasts curved gently above that. She looked stunning in the soft lights of her bedroom, she looked closer to her real age somehow, soft and pretty with the sharp edge that made her Lightning. Snow swallowed thickly, before forcing himself to speak again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. since you started eating again,\" he pointed out with a badly hidden stammer, \"You look healthier now. Really suits you. I mean, you were way too skinny before, you know?\" Lightning merely looked a little puzzled at his words, before gazing down at herself, as if seeing for herself what he could see. It was at times like that, Snow remembered that for all of her confidence and bluster, Lightning didn't really seem to think all that much of herself. He watched her until she had looked up from the floor again, before quickly looking away to the side again. She's Lightning, he reminded himself, she's Serah's older sister. You're sick for thinking what you're thinking, you're mad, she's going to kick your ass again-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his thoughts were lost when he felt Lightning's hand curl in his top to drag him down to her level, and he felt her soft lips on his own. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snow, the big idiot that he was, had been growing on her for some time. It was only when those blue eyes darkened as they looked over her that Lightning had realised the cause for that strange squirm in her stomach every time she had been seeing him, something that wasn't down to the food he was making her eat. Snow was attractive, he was kind, and she could finally see what her sister saw in him, that despite his boastful nature and idiotic moments, he as a good man. He didn't have a malicious bone in his body, and even while he was dealing with the grief of Serah's death, he had still made sure to take out time to look after Lightning. He had seen past her carefully constructed guarded exterior, and had seen that she had needed someone to help her through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt guilty at first, of course she had. Her beloved sister had loved the big idiot dearly, it wasn't right to be with the man she had one day planned to marry. It was only when time had gone by, and her feelings had grown for Snow, that Lighting took a moment to reflect on her little sister. Serah was sweet, selfless, and beyond all, caring. She would want them to be happy beyond anything else, even if that happiness was with each other. Lightning tried to force herself in her darker moments to not think of it as an excuse for her to be with the man she had become gradually attracted to, but as a genuine reason for why they could finally be together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when she had seen Snow looking her up and down like a starving man, she had given in and kissed him. And he had kissed her back, his muscled arms wrapping about her small frame to crush her up against her chest. The kiss grew deeper between them, Snow's calloused fingers trailed down Lighting's bare shoulders, slipping underneath the towel wrapped about herself and tugging at the material. Lightning guided him backwards at the same time, towards the double bed that had barely been slept in lately. Snow guided the smaller woman down onto the bed with a gentleness despite his large frame, and tugged away the towel to drink in Lighting's softer body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had filled out in ways he hadn't even been able to imagine, Snow's fingers trailed over her soft skin. Her once flat stomach was now pushed out into a soft belly, he ran his fingers down it, marvelling at how full and pliable it was under his touch. Her hips flared with the extra padding, and on slipping his fingers behind her, Snow could feel that her behind had rounded out into a more shapely curve from her lower back. Her breasts were fuller and softer, Snow ran his hands over them, causing Lightning to let out a gasp from underneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning's arms curled up about Snow's neck to drag him down onto the bed with her, her breathing faster from the way those calloused fingers brushed over her bared skin. She lowered her hands to start working on his belt, undoing the buckle with slender fingers, and tugging to pull his pants and boxers down over his hips. Snow lowered his head to press a kiss down to the soft bulge of her stomach, Lightning moaned softly, her toes curling as she wrapped her arms back about him. Snow grinned, parting his lips to suckle on the flesh, before kissing his way up her chest, and back to her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow made love to her once the rest of his clothes had been discarded, her arms wrapped tight about his shoulders, her softer legs curled at his waist. She gasped softly at his every move into her, her nails digging in slightly against his shoulders. Snow held her closer, his dazed blue eyes focusing down on her face, her relaxed, open face that betrayed every single ounce of emotion she felt due to her arousal. He worked harder, and he worked faster, until they both collapsed into a sweaty heap on the bed, tangled in together on top of the sheets as they fought for breath. Snow was the first to recover, and after pulling carefully out of Lightning, turned her in his arms so he could hold her to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting didn't protest, her forehead pressing against Snow's chest, her breath tickling at his skin. Just moments later her breathing had evened out, her hand resting loosely against Snow's side. Snow watched her for a moment, watching her breasts and stomach rise and fall from every soft breath, before reaching down to pull up what covers he could over them both, wrapping himself about her for the remainder of the night. </span></div></div>",

She sat up blearily, the night's events returning to her at her very naked state, and the sheets that lay in a disarray about her legs. She drew one of the sheets up over her chest, watching with sleepy eyes as Snow entered her room with a tray of food, setting it down carefully over her lap before joining her on the bed. He was just in his pants by this point, showing off his tanned and toned chest as he made himself comfortable next to her. Lightning gazed at him for a moment, before looking to the breakfast he had cooked for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than be the one to awkwardly start speaking again, Lightning chose to eat instead, taking up the fork and spearing a rasher of bacon onto the end of it, wrapping it around the head of the fork before carefully eating it. A part of her assumed that Snow had bought her up breakfast for that exact reason, and she felt a little grateful for it, she was never the best at speaking after delicate situations like the night before. Snow watched Lightning eat for a few moments, admiring the way the tip of her tongue would dart out over her lower lip now and again, before finally speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. last night, huh?\" Snow began in a vain attempt to be casual, it fell short with a nervous chuckle on receiving one of those looks from Lightning, \"Yeah. I know. But.. I'm not going to lie to you. I liked it. A lot,\" he rubbed the back of his neck, his fingers disturbing some of the strands of hair that fell there, \"I like you. A lot. I don't want to think of last night as a mistake since it was so amazing, but,\" he pressed his lips together, \".. just thinking about her makes me feel guilty and.. mad at the same time. You're damn amazing, Lightning. Is it that much of a sin to want this...?\" Lightning set down her fork as she swallowed, closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she finally answered, her voice a little softer than it usually was, \"It's not a mistake. And it isn't wrong. Snow,\" she looked up to him with intense sea green eyes, \"If.. if Serah were here, she would.. she wouldn't be against it. I know that. She wouldn't want us to be unhappy. If that happiness was with each other then,\" Lightning frowned, her gaze dropping again, \".. at least, that's what I believe. Is it an excuse to feel less guilty? I... don't know. But I do know one thing,\" she finally raised her gaze again, \"I don't want this to end.\" Relief flooded Snow's expression, and he smiled, leaning back against the headboard to watch Lightning from under the soft bangs of his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" he admitted, before taking up the fork Lightning had discarded briefly, scooping more food onto it and offering it up teasingly to her lips, \"So what do you say? Think we should take a shot at makin' this work?\" Lightning fixed him with a mildly bemused look at the food being hovered in front of her, before relenting, and parting her lips to take it. She swallowed, wrapping her fingers about Snow's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that we should.\" Snow grinned at her more brightly than before, his face and eyes lighting up in a way they hadn't since Serah's death. </span></div></div>",

She had never been concerned about her weight before, ever since she was a young girl she had been tall and awkwardly lanky for her age, but now her expanding girth meant that she could no longer fit comfortably into her clothes. Lightning studied herself in her reflection, in just her underwear, assessing the situation as she turned this way and that to see just where the added pounds had gone to on her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a lot softer all over, her arms and legs had filled out to a curvier shape, she actually had thighs these days. Her behind had pushed out into a gentle curve, by no means big, but far more generous than it had been before. Her breasts were larger, Lightning had gone up a good two cup sizes since getting together with Snow, and her face was fuller than it had been before, it had the effect of making her look a little younger. The most notable gain was in her stomach, the toned flat stomach she had worked hard for was gone, replaced by a pot belly that stuck out several inches from her. She couldn't even cover it up anymore, even when she wore clothing that would cover it, it managed to protrude against the fabric, as if reminding her that it was still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning was only grateful that her Guardian Corps uniform still just about fit her, though the jacket was uncomfortably tight against her midsection. The rest of her clothes had a habit of gaping open when it came to her stomach, or refusing to do up about her much thicker waist. It was a pain more than anything to have to buy new clothes, it was both time and money she could have spent elsewhere. The added weight didn't worry her too much at that moment, it hadn't slowed her down that much, though her Corps duties were mostly paper work and simple field work these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Snow seemed to love it. Lightning rolled her eyes good naturedly, Snow could barely keep his hands off her softer body and bigger curves, and she knew exactly why he always pushed her to eat well; it was his good food in the first place that had added the pounds to her frame. While she would never openly admit it, Lightning felt a little more feminine for having some weight on her. It only helped that Snow had the knack of making her feel beautiful whenever he got his hands on her, the softer side of her personality liked that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lighting felt over her protruding stomach with a wary eye, it was something to keep an eye on. She didn't want to become too big to complete her Guardian Corps duties effectively, or she would be stuck on paperwork for the rest of her career; she always preferred being out and about, where she could physically make a difference. </span></div></div>",

Annoyed at herself for letting herself go to such an extreme, irritated that she had been taken off patrol and reduced to desk work, and beyond angry that she still couldn't stop stuffing her face. Dinner that night was a thick stew and several warm bread rolls, and Lightning tore into them as if she had been starved ever since she had left the house. She dipped a roll into the stew, before licking the dripping gravy from the bread, and cramming the rest into her mouth. Before she had even fully swallowed that, she took a generous spoonful of the thick stew, forcing it between her lips. Anger radiated from her every pore as she continued to eat, barely pausing for breath when she helped herself to a second help. Snow cold only find himself watching in amazement, both concerned, and slightly aroused from how easily Lightning was putting away her dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light,\" he asked in some concern when he finally had the chance to reach across and gently grab her wrist, \"Is everything okay? You're really packing it away-,\" he trailed off anxiously on seeing the glare in her green-blue eyes, \"I mean,\" he certainly didn't want to end up on his ass yet again from being on the receiving end of one of Lightning's punches, \"... here,\" he pushed over the second bowl he had just started, \"Have mine too.\" He had of course noticed his girlfriend filling out, he thought every single pound on her frame made her all the more gorgeous, but he hadn't quite seen her so worked up in quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he was watching Lightning mop up the remains of the stew from the pot itself that he intervened, moving over to catch her chubby hand in his, gazing deeply into her frustrated eyes with his gentle, and hopefully, calming blue ones. \"C'mon, Light,\" he tried a little softer, \"Tell me what's bugging you? Maybe I can help.\" Lightning scowled, and turned away to the side, her eyes closing as she heaved a sigh over her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't help me,\" she responded simply, \"There's no point in telling you.\" Snow seemed to accept that for all of a few minutes, before he suddenly grasped her by the shoulders, gently tilting Lightning's chair back until she was flat on the floor behind her. She struggled as he crawled over her, playfully pinning her chubby wrists easily to the floor above her head with just one large hand. Lightning scowled even more up him, receiving only a teasing smile from her currently very annoying boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you tell me,\" Snow began, \"Or I'll tickle you until you tell me.\" Lightning's eyes widened as she saw those fingers lower down to her sides, for someone to stoic, she was unbearably ticklish. She squirmed all the harder, her stomach jiggling a little as Snow's deep laughter reverberated from his own body to hers. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Along with her weight gain, there had been more pressing issues at hand. Like the nausea Lightning felt in the mornings, or how sore and tender her breasts had been, despite having not entered her time of the month for a while now. While Lightning had been content to ignore everything and carry on despite how fatigued she was feeling, Snow had been concerned, and had insisted that she go and see a medical professional. Lightning had sighed, tried to point out that she didn't want to waste anyone's time, that she wasn't sick, and there was no need to make such a big fuss over nothing. Snow had persisted, and growing tired of being pestered so much about it, Lightning had given in, and booked herself an appointment with her doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Miss Farron,\" the doctor smiled as he held out his hand to her, \"You're five months pregnant.\" Lighting just stared at him in response, ignoring the outstretched hand for the moment. Pregnant. With child. She shook her head, she was a soldier, she wasn't a damn mother. She didn't have a single maternal bone in her body, granted she was the official big sister of a certain white haired boy, but she wasn't a mother. She looked down at her stomach with a raised eyebrow, it certainly explained why her stomach was sticking out so much from the rest of her gained weight. And five months ago.. that had been <i>that</i> night. She held a hand to her head, sighing wearily as she tried to massage away the oncoming headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\" she questioned the doctor wearily, who looked a little taken aback at being asked such a question, before dropping his gaze down to Lightning's very prominent bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he nodded, \".. I'm quite certain, Miss Farron.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost ironic that Snow had taken the news far better than she had. The moment she casually told him over dinner, his eyes lit up in that oddly endearing boyish way, and he had moved from his seat to pick her up into a tight hug against him. Lightning fought to catch her breath as the taller set her down again, a large hand resting over the curve of her rounded stomach. His grin grew even wider, only falling some on looking back up to his girlfriend, who seemed to look more worried than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not excited, Light?\" Snow questioned as he rose to his full height again, his hands folding over her shoulders, \"Oh.. you're pissed I knocked you up, aren't you?\" he added sheepishly, \"I mean talk about unlucky, the first time and all.\" He was trying, and failing, to hide how excited he truly was. Lightning shook her head slightly, resting her softer hand on top of the baby bump. Just over a year ago she had been a fit, fighting soldier. She was now a chubby mother to be, the woman her sister had aspired to become one day, and the woman Lightning never thought would be her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not angry,\" Lightning admitted as she looked back up to Snow, \"I'm worried. I can't do this.. how can I be a mother? These hands,\" she looked down at her palm, her brow furrowing, \"These are used to fight. They have blood on them. They're not the hands that hold a child. This..\" she closed her eyes, \".. this should have been Serah. Not me.\" Snow watched her, before reaching out and grasping that hand in his, gently pulling her fingers back to expose the palm, placing a kiss to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" he agreed, \"But the fact is that it's not Serah. It's you. You're Lightning,\" he pointed out, \"You're the hard ass who can knock me over when you get pissed off. You're the person who cares about those close to you, even if you try to hide it. Sure this came out of no-where but,\" he shrugged a wide shoulder, \"Hasn't everything this year? This is just another thing in life. Another thing that you're going to adapt to and be amazing at. Trust me,\" he grinned, a flash of white teeth appearing behind his lips, \"I know you, Light.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertainty still gripped at her, but Lightning couldn't help but feel somewhat comforted by his words, by his simple belief in her. She gasped as she felt him touch her stomach again, before picking her up easily, and throwing her, gently, over his shoulder. \"Hey! What are you doing?!\" she demanded as Snow began to carry her off, chuckling all the while. She fought to escape, only to be lowered gently onto the bed once he had managed to get her upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know what?\" Snow grinned at her, lowering himself to rest his toned stomach to hers, \"You're cute when you get mad..\" </span></div></div>",

Snow was always out for some reason or another organising Team Nora, and while Lightning would never say it to his face, she was starting to miss him. Just a little bit. There was only so much she could do in the house before she got bored, and resorted to staring at the television and absorbing the tacky day time television programs she hadn't even known existed before. The fact she was so bored had led to a little more eating than she would care to admit, it was just something to do while she was all alone in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back against the couch, Lighting gazed down at the bump that was sticking out quite prominently from her. She suspected some of the size was down to her snacking throughout the day, and vowed that the moment she had the kid, she was going right back to her rigorous fitness regime. It still felt strange to her to be referring to the bump as an actual person, if she were honest, it was a little disgusting that there was something growing inside of her. Snow had already taken to fatherhood with the eagerness of an overgrown puppy, and while he was in Lightning's presence, seemed to spend more time stroking and talking to her bump than he did her. Irritatingly, it was endearing enough for Lightning not to have a good excuse to deck him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to do something,\" Lightning sighed as she slouched further down on the couch, her stomach straining at the material of her vest top, \"When is this kid going to hurry up and come out?\" She rubbed over her stomach with the palms of her hand, trying to ease the slight ache that had started up in one side. Then she felt it. Lightning's eyes widened as she looked down at the bump, pulling her hand away to stare in astonishment at the side of her stomach. She had felt something flick against her hand, something with quite a bit of power behind it. Lightning frowned, before gently placing her hand there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt it again, another firm kick. She gazed down at herself in complete surprise, a mixture of awe and anxiety spreading through her. It was kicking her. It wasn't just a mass of cells, it was a real little human, kicking her for all it was worth. Her expression softened a little as she sat up straighter, keeping her hand to the side of her belly should the kid choose to kick again. It had been the first time she had began to truly feel like a mother, and it was the kicking of her child that had set it off. </span></div></div>",

The moment he started to grizzle at night, Snow was the first one out of the bed to comfort him, and only returned a good few hours later. It was sweet really, Lightning often thought on seeing Snow, the big powerful man, cradling something so small and fragile in his arms. He had been a natural father from the very start, Lightning closed her eyes for a moment, he and Serah would have made amazing parents. Serah had been the motherly type ever since she was small, helping the younger neighbour hood kids, and babysitting the moment she was old enough to. It was cruel that she had left the world before she had the chance to show just how great a mother she could be, but Lightning was trying to be one in her place. Trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to exercise when you had a five month year old to lug around with you, Lightning had resorted to running in the mornings before Snow left for his Team Nora duties, and again in the evening when he returned home. It was good to be exercising again, her feet pounded the pavement, her ponytail tickled the back of her neck, and her muscles ached pleasantly from just being used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening Lightning returned home from her run, and after taking a much needed shower, crawled into bed with Snow. He looked over the moment she joined him, wrapping his muscled arms about her small form with a squeeze, taking his time in feeling the excess flab that Lightning had yet to lose. She rolled her eyes good naturedly on feeling those big hands paw against her, especially the soft bulge of her stomach that was refusing to leave her just yet, a pot belly that was growing to the same size it had been six months into her pregnancy, though far softer and squishier. Snow sank his fingers into the soft flesh, before tugging Lightning against his firm chest, his hand stroking down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lose too much weight, okay?\" he finally murmured into her hair, \"'You look really cute like this.\" Lightning didn't respond, but curled one of her hands about the back of Snow's neck. While she liked to pretend she was struggling to lose the last few, well, several pounds, she had kept them on simply for Snow.</span></div></div>",

Their relationship was actually stronger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Rinoa was depressed because one of her classes weren't going so well: Cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuistis and Xu were the teachers for this particular class, which had started a few months ago, and most of the student body were surprised when the two had shown up that first day, both significantly chubbier than they had ever been before. This chubbiness progressed to fat as the months wore on and now Quistis's hips would brush against the sides of the tables when she walked by and Xu's stomach was bulging out more than usual these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa had failed her latest test, her grade actually lower than the first D she had gotten on the test before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she turned to what most Balamb Garden students turned to when they were pity eating: hot dogs. Zell was her companion today, the energetic young man somewhat lifting Rinoa's spirits as he ate his tenth hot dog. Rinoa dug into her twelfth, her stomach painfully full by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinoa, don't feel so bad. So you failed two tests. You'll come back and ace the next one, I'm sure of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't cook Zell, that's the thing. I need someone to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light-bulb went off in Zell's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Ma could help you. She's a great cook, the best I know in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she wouldn't mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZell shook his head. \"Not at all. Just go see her this afternoon and work something out. I'm positive she'll take you on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa truly smiled for the first time since she had gotten the test results back and gave Zell a quick hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Zell, you're the best!\" As Zell blushed and muttered a 'you're welcome', Rinoa walked away, her full stomach noticeable as she exited the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour and one calorie-burning walk later, Rinoa was standing outside Zell's home in Balamb, awaiting an answer to her knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened then, revealing the stout figure of Zell's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinoa dear, is that you?

Granted there was the occasional disgusting dish, but the majority of students at Balamb were talented, and smart enough to follow a basic recipe. It also meant that it made it very easy to pack on the pounds when you were taste testing so much food every single day; Xu had to admit that was one of her favourite parts of the class. She leant back in her seat, her soft stomach pushing up against the desk, despite her chair being a good foot away to accommodate for her larger size. Her generous ass filled the seat completely, stretching her skirt to it's very limits, and was even beginning to hang very slightly over the edge. Xu looked down at the list of students that she was going to be testing that day, her dark eyes falling on the next name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinoa Heartily,\" Xu called out, looking over the class of students for the dark haired girl. She was dreading it a little, Rinoa's last test just two months ago had been awful. Despite how bright and clearly eager Rinoa was, Xu and Quistis had to mark her extremely low for how disgusting her food had tasted. Xu gave a little sigh as a shadow fell over her desk, it was her job to taste every single one of those samples, no matter how gross they might be. She looked up to greet her student, blinking in surprise at the fuller figured girl that was stood before her, chubby cheeks stretched into an anxious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa's weight had ballooned ever since Ma Dincht had taught her one valuable lesson, taste your food as you go along. Rinoa had found herself tasting, eating too much, and having to cook the dish again, only for the same thing to happen. Weeks of improving her cooking had led to more and more pounds packing onto her slender frame, until Rinoa had passed from being on the thin side, to extremely chubby. Her tight black shorts pinched at her thicker waist, pushing up her stomach to appear even bigger than it was, and her ass sticking out a good bit behind her. The blue duster that usually fell to her knees was caught on the rounded curve of her bigger rear, the material could only just cover it now. Her stomach stuck out into a bloated mass against the denim skirt she wore over her shorts, the buttons straining in their holes at the flab that was pressed against the thick fabric. What fat couldn't be contained poured over the top into a soft roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXu continued to stare at her student. Rinoa's face was a great deal softer, two double chins underlying Rinoa's face when she smiled, and her breasts had groan to strain at the front of her tank top, her blue duster threatening to untie itself from the sheer weight pushed down against the tie. Rinoa just smiled as she placed down a dish of food in front of her portly teacher, Xu had to admit, it smelt absolutely gorgeous, and looked just as good. With that, Xu took up her fork, and tasted a mouthful. </span></div></div>",

Rinoa's dark eyes gleamed as she noticed her score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull marks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped for joy only to stop after the third jump, panting a bit. Of course Rinoa had realized her gain over the last couple weeks or so but not one of her friends or Squall seemed bothered by it. Squall even seemed to like the added softness to her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXu swiftly went to grab Quistis, who had to deal with whatever Zell had summoned from the fiery pits of bad cooking hell, and practically dragged the larger woman over to Rinoa's station. Quistis's flab jiggled as she was placed before Rinoa, a question in her eyes but before that question could be voiced, Xu had crammed a slice of pie into Quistis's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter savoring, chewing, and swallowing this morsel, Quistis looked at Rinoa and gave her a bright smile, causing Rinoa to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstructor Trepe never smiled like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great improvement Rinoa. Xu and I will have to take your entire pie, to finish of course.

She said she was going to make some today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rin, I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa smiled, her chubby cheeks rounding out a bit as she did so, and moved ahead of Zell, her stomach giving a bit of a rumble.</span></div></div>",

As Yuna groaned softly from how much of that fattening substance that had been pushed into her, Seymour took his hands to feel over her stomach. It was very round, and stuck out a good deal from the young summoner, he felt the weight of it with a slow smile; it would truly be a magnificent gut once it had softened up. He massaged over it to help Yuna's food digest, another soft moan was drawn from her at that, her body relaxing back in her seat as she slowly drifted off. Seymour pulled away at that, just watching as Yuna slept, her stomach rising and falling with each breath that she took. Her arms were a little softer, he imagined her legs were too, underneath her robes, and even her face had filled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can grow much bigger, Lady Yuna,\" Seymour murmured as he stroked her hair, \"Much bigger.\" He turned the dial on the machina to a more gentle setting, before pulling the switch again. The machina began to pump the summoner full of the fattening substance again, but so slowly it would gently fill her out as she slept. Seymour checked that the machina was in working order, before moving away again, exiting the room while ordering to guards to stand at the door outside. And slowly, Yuna began to billow out as she slept. Her stomach pushed out further, until it stuck out between the fold of her robes, a dome of taut flesh that left her skin as tight as the skin of a drum. It grew heavier, hanging down to brush her fleshier knees, her arms filling out enough for the sleeves of her robes to bite into the flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn finally stirring, Yuna found that..</span></div></div>",

Lulu was more focused, more concentrated, she wasn't willing to let something like that take over her mind. With that, Lulu slipped out of her dress, lowering her pale, curvaceous form into the water. She was already curvier than Yuna and Rikku, though her stomach was flat, her hips flared out generously to the side, and her breasts were full and heavy. Lulu sank down into the hot water, giving a sigh of relief as the nutrient rich fluid helped ease her aching muscles. Closing her eyes, she rested her head back against the side, letting herself relax even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the early hours of the morning that Lulu came to with a start, shocked that she had fallen asleep in the water; she scolded herself momentarily, she could have drowned. Lulu pushed herself to climb out of the water, confused by how much of a struggle that was. She tried again, sinking down into the water with a considerable splash. Lulu frowned, looking down at herself with sudden understanding. Her mind had been lax during her sleep, she realised wearily, and the effects of the spring had made themselves known. Her stomach had pushed out into quite the pot belly, her ass had rounded out to press back against the wall she was leaning against, and she just seemed so much softer. She had already surpassed Yuna and Rikku in size, Lulu scolded herself as she climbed out of the water, and forced her dress on; it was far too tight about the middle, her fatter stomach was all too visible against the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen..</span></div></div>",

With that..\" Lulu trailed off as she began casting Doublecast over and over, she expanded a little with each spell, but not massively so; Rikku was almost disappointed, until Lulu spoke again, a little out of breath as she held her bloated and aching stomach, \"I've cast Doublecast enough times to enable me to cast Ultimate ten times,\" she explained, \"My next casting of it will cost me 5000lbs.

She grew fatter and rounder, bigger and bigger, her cheeks swelling up with fat as she grew. It wasn't long before she was little more than a mound of jiggly flesh, her head seeming so small on the top of it, folds rounding out her arms and legs, as well as her massive stomach. Rikku crossed her legs a little, Lulu looked gorgeous like that.

Her peaceful mealtime was interrupted by the loud huffing of her cousin Rikku. \"ComequickcousinLuluismassivelyfatandstuckandneedsyourhelptogetfree!\" The out of breath, Rikku yelled out as quickly and in as few syllables as possible.

I'm going to teleport the air around us into Lulu's body. Here goes nothing!\" Yuna weaved her spell, her hand glowed and so did Lulu. Lulu closed her eyes, feeling a filling sensation as she felt her body groan and gurgle, her belly reeling in added pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku watch with rapt attention as her enormous friend grew outward. Her favorite belly growing even more, she couldn't wait to run up to it, hug it, and snuggle up with Lulu's folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu's vastness expanded ever more outwards, but this time instead of gaining weight and heaviness, she became lighter and bouncier, while still retaining her fat. The air piled within Lulu, stretching her out wider in all directions, including higher. Lulu's belly gained about three feet in height, and six feet in diameter. Yuna and Rikku had to look upwards as their friend rose higher, although never leaving the ground, she was still far too heavy for that, the altitude she was gaining was pure expansion on her part. Her already enormous belly gained the lions share of the air Yuna was pumping into her, but that wasn't the only location getting filled. Lulu's breasts and rear were not far behind. As her belly grew out and upward, so were Lulu's melons, becoming more like beach balls they were already large, bags of fat, now they were doubling in size, half filled with fat, half with air, each breast was more than four times the size of Lulu's head. Her boobs rose higher and higher, obstructing much of Lulu's vision. Her ass meanwhile, was growing too, not willing to completely lose out in the race in matching her stomach in size. Her butt grew wide, tall, and proud, nearly as tall and reaching as Lulu's head, which was centered among this veritable sea of fat and inflation that was her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll during Lulu's expansion, she only groaned once. Her black and grey belt dress was stretched to the absolute limit, somehow managing to still cover up her rear, legs, and hips, although leaving the vast majority of her belly and the entirety of her breasts exposed. Rikku speculated the dress most have been enchanted to grow with its wearer, but even that enchantment had its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of the air filling her, Lulu never left the ground, her mass was still the same five thousand pounds of fat, but the buoyancy she gained was enough for Lulu to stand up properly, hopefully allowing her to dislodge herself from the crevice. The black mage finally stood up on both of her thickened thighs for the first time since she fattened herself as a demonstration for Rikku. As Lulu stood to her full height, she felt the sideline pressure on her waistline and thighs lessen, allowing her flesh to flow outward and take up the space the higher rock allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! I'm still stuck! I can stand now, but the air widened me out even more. Yuna your plan didn't work.\" Lulu grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna was briefly taken aback by her plan's failure before coming up with a new idea. \"Maybe all you need is a good push? Rikku, give me a hand, we'll push Lulu out of this hole. You take the left cheek, I'll take the right.\" Rikku nodded, and after a jog around the crevice, arrived behind Lulu's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting behind Lulu's left butt cheek, Rikku found it to be even larger than she remembered it to be, now it was several feet wider, and even a couple of feet taller than she was, and this was just one half of only Lulu's ass, making the entire immensity of Lulu's body truly a sight to behold. \"Hey Lu, your butt is even more massive than the last time I was back here! Seriously, it's like four of me.\" Rikku giggled at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ha ha...\" was all Lulu retorted, mildly annoyed at Rikku's observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between Lulu standing and her body lighter from the air, I think all we have to do now is propel Lulu forward to the wider area of the rock, and she'll be out free.\" Yuna said, surveying the area they had to work with. Both cousins got to work, pushing with all of their strength, Rikku's hands sunk into the flesh of Lulu's butt. It was like a mix of heavy, bulky fat, but also a lighter, airy feeling. The added air definitely was making a difference as soon enough, the summoner and the thief were making real progress, Lulu helped in her own way to free herself, moving her legs forward, getting her hips and waist through the narrower rock to open area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a last tug, Lulu popped free, jolting forward a bit, knocking both Yuna and Rikku flat on their faces, unprepared for Lulu jumping forward more than a few inches, while Lulu herself was cushioned by her ginormous stomach. Lulu let out a sigh of relief, Rikku squealed before jumping onto Lulu's bulk, crawling around to the front where she could lay on Lulu's belly. Rikku pressed down on the bloated mage's stomach, feeling up her vast belly. Laying down on, it was still squishy like it was before, but the air now made it a little firmer, like an inflatable mattress. Lulu was still immensely fat, the air now gave her the ability to walk and be mobile, kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku, for her obsession, found Lulu to be a kind of exotic and unmatched beauty, she wanted this and more of it.</span></div></div>",

One fat mover spell coming up!\" Yuna yelled, hands glowing and staff glowing. This time Rikku didn't interfere, instead her eyes were rapt with attention for what was about to happen next. Light collected in Yuna's hand and staff, once she gathered enough magic, she aimed for Lulu's posterior, trapped in the crevice, yet somehow still draped by Lulu's dark grey belt dress. Yuna's plan was to move fat from Lulu's rear to her belly, but that was before a sudden idea bore fruit in her mind. \"Hey, Rikku, want to see a trick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course cousin!\" the bubbly thief responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of merely moving fat from Lulu's butt to her stomach and letting her slip out that way, why not shift fat from Lulu's belly to her rear and crush the rocks that way? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOURGLASS!!!\" the summoner yelled at the top of her lungs. Lulu's eyes bulged open, <i>just what was Yuna planning to do to her?</i> Lulu felt a pressure around her ass begin to billow outward. The pressure keeping her stuck was already there, and now it was only intensifying. To Yuna and Rikku's perspective, Lulu's titanic tummy was churning and raging, then it began to scrunch up and finally recede, lending its fat and mass elsewhere. The force on Lulu's rear heightened further, going from minor irritation to more painful, her hips and butt were being pressed in on all sides except for the very behind. Lulu clenched her teeth and shut her eyes, biding herself from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku was slightly disappointed by the shrinking stomach, but was willing to give her cousin the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Lulu's butt was bulging with more weight, there was a second shift, higher up, in Lulu's most (in)famous possessions. Her chest was stretching outward as well, \"That's the other half of the 'Hourglass' effect,\" Yuna explained. At a similar speed to Lulu's receding belly, her breasts were making an advancement in the opposite direction. Taking up most of the space on the ground her belly had just given up, Lulu's boobs grew outward, straining her belt dress. Rikku curiously poked Lulu's expanded breast; it was taller and wider than she was, and several times larger too! It was more shapely than her belly, but its material was similarly squishy, and the skin was just as soft and sensitive, if not more so. <i>This could be alright</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu felt like her body was made of clay, as it changed and shaped and shifted itself at Yuna's command. Now she was feeling the strain everywhere, her belly receding back into her body, while the fat shifted to her growing derriere and chest. 1,250 pounds in each breast and butt cheek. Her domineering breasts took up the entire range of vision of all three women, albeit from a differing point of view for Lulu, they were her breasts and she saw everything through her canyon-like cleavage if she wanted to see at all. Finally, the pressure and force on her butt was coming to a head, the intense force her butt and hips had on the rocks was finally paying off, crushing and pushing the rocks that made up the crevice back into the soil it jutted from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Lulu let out a mighty roar as her colossal behind utterly crushed the rocks that formerly imprisoned her behemoth form. She was relieve her poor butt was finally free from the harsh resistance the rocks had given her. Rikku and Yuna looked on in combination of amazement and joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LULU, YOU'RE LIKE, A HYPER HOURGLASS OR SOMETHING!\" Rikku cheered on her absurdly busty and amble reared friend. She hopped onto Lulu's breast, climbing into Lulu's now crevice sized cleavage, nuzzling the soft skin against her face. \"Now you can walk again, and I can ride around in your cleavage.\" Rikku said, excited at the new prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu could only sigh, but inwardly, then slowly, outwardly, could only chuckle at the antics of her bubbly, blonde haired friend. Then, the incredibly shaped mage unexpectedly returned a smile, a guilty smile, \"...okay.\"</span></div></div>",

And now, she had reached a truly impressive girth. Her belly bobbed up and down with every step, and on its downward trip, it regularly brushed the ground. The day seemed to be fast approaching when her belly would simply rest on the ground as a matter of course. In fact, this outcome seemed so obvious, that debates were raging behind the scene as to whether it could be kept from anchoring down the queen through means of magic, technology, a use of helpers holding it up, or whether some soft of harness system could be built into her dresses, keeping it at least from draping the ground. It occurred to many that this was probably the first time such debate echoed through this castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her belly was a source of concern, her bosom was simply a source of awe. Always hefted up proudly by powerful dresses, she was almost never seen in public without cleavage big enough to lose something in. At night, when her and Crono retired to their private chambers for some personal time, the removal of her clothing, particularly around the breasts, resembled a dam bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass, too, was simply shocking. No matter how generous the proportions on the dresses she wore, her ass always pushed the stitches to the limit, and swelled out so dramatically, that they were always skintight, and left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the queen's ever-growing fat deposits started out as a source of gossip and jokes, it didn't take too long before the people of her kingdom began to get almost swept up in it, and as their biggest influence and role model, conventional standards of beauty began to change dramatically across the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen everywhere began to indulge more, reasoning that if their beloved queen did it, it couldn't be so bad. And with how undeniably stunning the queen was, in spite of our because of her size, the husbands of all the newly fattening women were seldom bothered by the developments of their wives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the average weight of Guardia's female population had grown by leaps and bounds, and women were trading dieting tips that headed in the opposite direction. Enjoying the impact that here own simple gluttony had sparked, the queen announced a new annual fair: every year, there would be a massive celebration of food, full of feasts and festivities. And there would also be a contest, awarding and celebrating the three heaviest women in the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, every year, only two of those slots would be filled by anyone but the queen, who won first place every time. The fact that the queen would win had practically become tradition, and few actually expected to be able to beat her...year by year, she had always stayed ahead of the competition, thanks to her private chefs, and the blessing of fat-prone genetics. But still, everyone had fun trying in vain to surpass her, and second and third place were still tremendous honors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale for the event, which had to be impressively powerful and precise, was built anew each year by Lucca, who wanted to perfect a superior version every year, and who had thus far been one of the few women not swept up in the weight gain obsession. When asked if she was against it, she simply said, 'Not at all. But...well, you'll see'. And that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this year, Lucca had sent a regretful letter explaining that she couldn't spare the time to build a new scale this year, and that they'd have to re-use last year's. This was no problem, but still had everyone puzzled. What was Lucca so busy with? No one knew. She herself had been in her massive, newly-constructed workshop, which was the size of a damn warehouse, and while she kept in touch, nobody had actually seen her for weeks leading up to the fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, the night of the event came. With a great sense of ceremony, everyone weighed in, the queen going last, clocking in at an impressive 946 pounds. Just as applause for the inevitable winner was about to ring, though, a speaker began to boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" Lucca's voice echoed \"Would you please direct your eyes this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see an enormous platform, rolling on steam-powered wheels, towards them before gradually stopping. There appeared to be some huge, vague shape on the platform, but it was covered in a massive tarp. But then, a crane-like arm unfolded from the side of the platform, and grabbed the tarp, ready to tear it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone...BEHOLD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a flourish, the tarp was removed, revealing...</span></div></div>",

Each of her breasts was bigger, much bigger, than the entire Queen (the nipples were covered by a black fabric, for the sake of the children). To say nothing of the rest of her. Anyone in the audience too close to her couldn't even conceive what they were looking at, from up close she seemed like a curving, skin-colored wall. The  genius was so piled high with corpulence, and draped over with so many vast layers of flab, that only the Queen, from her high vantage point, could see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" the Queen asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply decided to provide you with a worthy challenge.\" Lucca called out calmly, her bright eyes glittering from behind her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen loved Lucca. She was a great friend. But if not for the audience, she would give her one heck of a talking-to. And not with any sense of superiority as a queen, but an angry talking-to as a betrayed friend. Lucca had humiliated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really all you?\" the Queen asked, secretly hoping this was a practical joke, and that Lucca was simply wearing the world's largest, most convincing fat suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no such luck. Lucca began to laugh, and as a demonstration, tried to move her arms (curtained with yards of fat), which did nothing but send waves of jiggling flesh sloshing across her form, rattling the platform she was resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me. All me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, trade secret. But, uh, would you care to hear how much I weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a panel rose up from the side of the platform, and numbers began to madly spiral and count up. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n23,453 lb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen's heart sank.She was a speck of dust next to Lucca.<br>\r\n\"Lucca!\" she shouted \"You...win. By far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider how fat I am today to be a declaration. Of my challenge. I didn't come here today to humiliate you, but just to show you what you're up against. Truth is, you've inspired me. I love being this huge, seeing my body stretch so far out of my reach, feeling awash in my own huge, soft body, feeling soooo much ground beneath me, having so much skin to feel the wind blow against, and rain fall and slide down...it's an experience. And I want nothing more than to grow even bigger, even fatter. But how much funner that would be if I have a rival. So, I choose you. I won't share my trick for getting this big, but you're a clever gal. You can find a way of your own, I'm sure. You can't put up with how slowly you've grown so far. Look at you! You're wasting away! So...get huge. Fatten up. Eat, and be merry. And in a month's time, we'll meet again, and see who the real winner is.\"<br>\r\nThe Queen was shocked. It seemed impossible to grow so vast in one month, enough to be in Lucca's league, but...if Lucca could get that big, so could she, dammit! She just had to start thinking outside the box.<br>\r\n\"It's a deal!\" the queen declared.<br>\r\nApplause roared from the audience. The next month should be entertaining.</span></div></div>",

While her command was mostly respected due to her great strength, a nice fringe benefit is that, especially by cave person standards, she was a wise and intelligent leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile violent run-in's with the Reptites were common, whenever another human tribe was encountered, things always went swimmingly. In fact, some smaller tribes were so impressed by the size, strength, and traditions of the Ioka Tribe, that they voluntarily chose to join it. With each tribe united with the Ioka, the tribe's strength and stability grew. Ayla's pride in herself and her people ALSO grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe often stayed on the move, creating new, temporary villages whenever they found a promising site. But reptites, dinosaurs, and just plain old-fashioned food limitations meant that they often had to stay on the move. But Ayla's tracking instincts, paired with her hunches, always lead them to a new home, and all the many tribe members could rest easy knowing that food, though scarce, would always turn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one day, Ayla sniffed a delicious scent on the wind, and lead her tribe off their course,and deep into an immense cleft in a cliff wall. And there, on the other side...paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plains, rich with massive, slow, wonderfully edible herbivorous dinosaurs. The ground was covered in a carpet of delicious roots. And pocketed all over the place were small forests, teeming with more edible li'l critters, and ripe, juicy fruit of every description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying a two-second long prayer of thanks to their gods, the whole tribe began to fan out and snatch up as much food as they could. The vibrant, fertile land seemed to stretch out forever, and there were no reptites or carnivores to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as Ayla was about to chase a brachiosaurus down and beat it to death with her bare hands for dinner, three strangers, dressed in bright bird plumage, appeared, and address the Ioka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is leader of your tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayla is leader.\" Ayla explained eloquently indicating herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Not anymore. Ruun is now leader of your tribe. Just letting you know. Thank you. Have nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Ayla roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is land of plenty. All of you welcome to stay. But any who live here follow Ruun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Ruun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the goddess, the ruler of paradise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayla want speak to this...Ruun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Ruun welcomes all new followers happily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AYLA IS NOT FOLLOWER. Take Ayla to Ruun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangers lead Ayla to one of the woodlands scattered across the plain. But Ayla was surprised to find that after only a minute spent under the shadow of trees, they came to a clearing. And resting in the middle of the vast clearing...was Ruun. And she was...</span></div></div>",

Seated on a bamboo palanquin adorned with flowers, jewels, horns, and feathers, was an enormously fat young woman, the largest Ayla had ever seen. Though her seat looked like it could fit three normal women, her bottom still seemed to ooze a bit over the sides. Ruun's feet were just barely visible, most of her legs concealed by the apron of her stomach, a thick expanse of flesh, proudly displaying her great and ample breasts like trophies upon a shelf. She was dressed in nothing but a jeweled necklace and tiara. Her hair and eyes were an emerald green color, and her skin was lightly tanned. At the moment, The \"goddess\" was being waited upon hand and foot by a cadre of male servants, tending to her whims as she brought a red and juicy fruit to her mouth. The man who had been leading the Ioka to this destination got down on his knees and kowtowed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Great Goddess... Please forgive intrusion. Chief of newcomers wish to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuun bit into the fruit messily, the juices glistening upon her plump lips and cheeks, running down her body. One of the servants reached in to wipe off the mess as she gazed upon the Ioka and their chieftain, who looked upon the spectacle with slack jaws and wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the diplomatic tactics that Ayla had been going over during the trip were blown away by the sheer absurdity of what lay before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll tact lost, Ayla voiced the first words that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FAT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuun stared blankly for a moment, and then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off what could have been a major faux pas, Ayla started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me Ayla, lead Ioka tribe. Go through many hard times! Beat Reptites! Beat dinosaurs! Bring in other tribes! Make Ioka big and strong! Want live here, live easy, but no want follow Ruun, but no want fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess seemed to consider Ayla's words for a minute. Then, she too began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me Ruun, lead Debu tribe. Live here since forever. Only one tribe in land, or disaster come. Stones and clouds and ancestors say so. Ruun have powers. Special. Ruun fat, so land fat. Ruun fat, Ayla not fat. Ayla no lead. Ioka join Debu or Ioka leave. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyla fumed, and began to punch into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayla strong! Beat up disaster big time! Beat up Red Star! Beat up everything! Ayla challenge Ruun! Any challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense silence that seemed to last an eternity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Before it was broken by the shaking of Ruun's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Ruun accept challenge. I choose. Leader must be fat. So, if you get fatter than Ruun by full moon, Debu join Ioka, Ayla chief. If you not fatter, Ioka join Debu, Ruun chief... And Ayla servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyla stared. She was hoping for something along the lines of a hunting contest, or mortal combat, something she could win easily. She wasn't sure about this, but her pride was urging her not to give in so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What you say?\"</span></div></div>",

So, with not so much as a sliver of doubt exposed, Ayla puffed her chest up with pride, and declared<br>\r\n\"Ayla will make Ruun seem like skeleton.

Because Ayla is best, Ayla will be biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuun, leaning back as much as her hefty rolls of back-fat would allow, reclining and sinking into her own softness, smiled.<br>\r\n\"Good wods.

Finally, Ruun has excuse to get as big as a goddess should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women grinned at each, their eyes burning, in Ayla's case with defiance, in Ruun's case with arrogance.

Around them, fruit grew in abundance, while wild game was plenty. As the sun shone down through the trees onto the group, the Ioka began to disperse and forage, as a few stuck around to make a few fires. A short time later, they emerged from the forest, bearing large baskets of fruit and fallen prey. While the prey was prepared for roasting, the fruit was set before Ayla, and she immediately began to dig in. Hand over fist, she brought the ripe and juicy morsels to her mouth, eating messily. Juice ran down between her breasts as the fruit in the basket grew smaller and the pile of cores behind her grew larger. However, by the middle of the next basket, she had begun to slow down noticeably. She groaned a bit and lied down, rubbing her aching and distended belly in an attempt to appease it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... *urp* This harder than Ayla thought it would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a noise came from the forest...</span></div></div>",

For an instant, the Ioka could not see it, for most of his features were covered in long and shaggy green hair. His mane covered his scalp and then some. Unbelievably bushy eyebrows concealed what his hairdo couldn't. And then there was the matter of his unkempt beard, which touched the ground. Slowly, the rest of him followed. He was tall and bone-thin, and covered in clothing made out of leaves. He propped his scrawny frame upon a gnarled staff, and looked directly at Ayla. He drew closer, ignoring the mumbling of the Ioka, bent down... And gave their chief a sharp poke in the gut with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all you got? You never beat Ruun like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyla looked up at the intruder with a spiteful glare. \"Shut up, old man! Ayla *hic* beat Ruun. You *burp* see.\" The old man gave out a harsh laugh at this. Suddenly, Kino went up to him an grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you laugh at! Kino beat you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger gave a derisive snort. \"Will take whole tribe, pup! But not come here for fight. Come to help.\" Slowly, Kino released his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger threw a pouch to Kino, who looked at it quizzically. The stranger grinned with a nearly toothless mouth. \"Berries. SPECIAL berries. Grow only in one place. Secret place. MY secret place. But... You can have some. Sure you will put to good use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the strange old man leaped backwards into the forest, his laughing vanishing into the distance. Kino stared after him, then stared down at the pouch of berries. He took one into his hand. They were small, but plump, with a bright orange coloration. Ayla slowly picked herself from the ground, and faced Kino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kino... Give Ayla berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKino looked down at her, with a clear look of protest on his face. \"But Ayla! Why we trust weird old man? What if poisonous? Or, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyla brushed the back of his head with her hand, silencing him. \"Kino sweet. But weird old man right. We never beat Ruun like this. But maybe berries will help. Give Ayla berries.\" Kino found a hard time resisting Ayla. So, despite his initial distrust of the situation, he decided that Ayla was right, and it was worth a shot. He handed the pouch over to Ayla. Defying her already-agitated stomach, she downed the whole pouch. The berries were one of the sweetest things she had ever tasted, with a strange but pleasant tang to them. Suddenly, Ayla felt a tingle up her spine. Her swollen gut began to shrink back to normal. However, this did not last long, as the digested contents were transformed miraculously into fat. Soon, her formerly athletic frame gave way to a slightly curvier body. Although the initial gain was not impressive, Ayla recieved something else. Her eyes burned with a fierce determination, reborn like a phoenix from the ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AYLA HUNGRY!\"</span></div></div>",

Hey girl what brings you here?\" chun li asked\" I was looking for a fight but you've gotten kinda chunky,I don't know if you can keep up with me now.\" Well chun li looks down at her self \"holy shit what happend?!?\" then chun li smiled and said \"Even with a little weight I can still beat you no problem let's go.\"  \"Are you sure?\" cammy asked and chun li replied \"yeah I'm sure ur going down.\" both ladies  took their stances and put there hands up....chun li went to throw a punch but it was so slow cammy dogded it with ease as she dogded she slap chun li's big jello<br>\r\n butt rippling throwing her off balence this made her mad so she went for her lighting leg kick but it didn't come out....just two kicks and chun li was exsausted. Cammy laughed \"Wow chunny ur not gonna hit me with those turky drumsticks. Chun li said huffin n puffin\" Just....you wait.....I'm gonna...beat the tar....outta you\" chun li's bent over,hands on her knees her skirt is so far up you can see her panties and the only thing holding her breast in place is one little button. \"bring it fats\"cammy said and in a blind rage chun li stupidly came at cammy full force but cammy was ready she punched chun li in the face with a rear straight punch chun li's fat body wiggled and jiggled then standing there stiff....her fat face rippled up and down,her head snapped backwards. As she stands there she has a dazed confused look on her face....her big belly hanging over her skirt,her skirt resting on top of her large fat butt,Her left hip is sticking out like a hooker,her arms are still up like a boxer but her hands are limp her eyes are crossed and has a glazed look.  Still dazed she dried to punch put it came out really limp cammy blocked it witch left chun li's big belly opened.Before chun li knew what happend cammy punched li in her fat gut and it was so soft it went all the way to her elbow. Chun li eyes widen,she doubled over in pain and she through up most of her meal.She was completely caught off guard with drool running out her mouth she went \"HUH??!.\" Then  cammy uppercuted her popping her back up making her dazed again. Then suddenly cammy grabbed chun li from behind in a RNC (rear neck n choke). Usually chun li can get outta moves like this but she was too fat,tired and exausted to get out this one. Cammy leaned back making chun li's back arch and curve,as she struggled her large, voluptuous tank ass kept bumping up against cammy's rock hard abs(witch turned cammy on) her big bulvis belly stuck out rocking up n down side to side like a big basket ball, her skirt was invisible now all you saw was her panties and large ass jiggle and that one last button popped off let loosing her now giant watermellon breast....popping out her bra slapping back and forth as she struggles to get free.chun li has lost all dignity but she dosn't care she's trying to survive. Finally she starts to go limp and feable. Her eyes roll back in her head,she starts to drool and she's making snorting sounds like a pig.  Weak and humiliated she falls unconscious and cammy let's her fall to the floor with a loud thud shaking the room. Her ass up in the air. Cammy laughs and says \"Man chunny I said it before and I'll say it again....you really let ur self go.\"   </span></div></div>",

Her breasts grew a little as she ran faster toward the briefing room, her thighs beginning to make her tights stretch as her pace became faster and shorter steps were taken.

But what she didn't know was that she had gained, officially, around 100 pounds during that trip to the briefing office, making her have a large belly now, with a spare tire to boot. Her tights had started tearing, although it was unnoticeable due to her rapid breathing, so the increasing circumference of her thighs went unnoticed. Her arms had grown much softer, but was not seen by other workers as Chun-Li streaked past, hurrying to the garage. Her butt had gotten larger as well, fueled by her swelling hips, which by now could crush a chair. Her breasts now pushed against her uniform, struggling to get comfortable. She was so busy she had noticed nothing of her new, and noticeable, 100-pound gain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much bigger will she get? Stairs, or Elevator?</span></div></div>",

You guys are the best!\u201d The kind words pleased the chef, leaving him with a smile as he returned to his duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the thousands of perks of being sponsored by the Kanzuki Corporation is having unlimited access to world renown culinary artists. Those artists, thanks to the generous salary, are more than happy to serve whoever whatever they wanted at any time of the day. Ever since the Iwashigahama Japan Women\u2019s Pro-Wrestling (IJWPW for short) tour ended, Mika has taken full advantage of this service provided at the Kanzuki Estate. Mika\u2019s actions as intended as they were have come with a consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrg, gotta make a little room,\u201d the blonde wrestler mumbled pulling down the zipper of her baby blue hoodie. The fabric parted just enough to give Mika\u2019s bulging belly more room to breathe and added leeway for another bowl or two of udon noodles. Although, it may seem like it, R. Mika\u2019s stomach fat isn\u2019t the most bothersome feature of her weight gain. She often fusses with her billowing bust and it\u2019s growth that has caused destruction amongst her bras. R. Mika resorted to binding them down by tape, until she finds a suitable size, but even then, it\u2019s not enough to stop her enlarging bosom from getting in the way of her daily life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest problem of R. Mika\u2019s gluttony has affected something she valued the most. Her legs, specifically her butt. She\u2019s never been ashamed of her plus sized stature or shapely rear, yet recently it\u2019s grown more rotund in shape becoming the main source of most of her problems. Getting stuck in chairs, knocking things over on tables, and most recently bumping into people. The upside, however, is that her flying peach becomes more powerful everyday Mika stuffs herself. And for that reward alone the weight gain is worth it. Even if it means putting up with the unwanted attention of a certain ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating up again, eh?\u201d Ibuki teased sticking in index finger into R. Mika\u2019s turgid stomach packed with succulent food. \u201cCut it out! Unless you want me to make you my new training dummy.\u201d Ibuki backed off on her approach, then went right back in. This time coming for Mika\u2019s hoodie, \u201cC\u2019mon. Quit hiding your belly. Unless you aren\u2019t ashamed of your weight gain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMika crammed the last slice of ham into her mouth, turning to Ibuki with a pouty expression and puffy cheeks full of food. \u201cI\u2019ll take it off if you bring cake to my room\u2026two whole cakes and milk.\u201d Ibuki\u2019s face brightened to pure pleasure. Mika left the dining area with an already full stomach and Ibuki ran off for the cake and milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy\u2026it\u2019s a little tight.\u201d Ibuki looked Mika in the eyes, \u201cA little is an understatement.\u201d The ninja tugged at the zipper and watched as Mika\u2019s globular tummy pushed forward as the zipper lost it\u2019s connection. The hoodie flopped to the floor leaving Mika in a too tight IJWPW t-shirt, but relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s so much better!\u201d Mika huffed, plopping backward on the bed, \u201cSwear it fit looser this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep telling yourself that,\u201d said Ibuki lying down next to R. Mika, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll keep feeding you this cake.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's all it took for the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members to leap into action, splitting off to discover if any of their comrades had survived this horrifying nightmare. Jill, keeping close to Barry, eventually found herself alone too; whether he had intended to or not, she was deserted in one of the mansions many hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for action and pistol loaded, she crouches down as she slowly makes her way around each corner, always half-expecting another bizarre creature ready to pounce on her. At the most though, she found some splodges of blood and knocked over furniture after every turn. Eerie, but not exactly frightening. After an hour or so, she had relaxed. At this point the most she'd seen was that one animated corpse and the enraged dogs outside. It'd be foolish to assume that would be the extent of the threat, but it'd be worse to accidentally waste all of the ammunition of her main defense. Dropping her stance, she opted to walk a bit; by the time she got up to a stairway, she was making far more time and distance than she was earlier. Hell, room after room was becoming more and more orderly, insinuating that whoever, or more likely <i>whatever</i> was making its way through the mansion had been heading away from this spot. Sliding open a door slowly to check whether it was safe, she walks in and takes a breather on a container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have it violently thump against her weight. \"Oh shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill darted out of the room almost instantly, hoping that whatever lied within didn't spy her; these things were pretty damn slow afterall. If it weren't for their gruesome appearance and immense strength, it'd be a cinch to fight or outright overpower all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lucky, when she crouched down and took a peek through the locked door's key hole, she saw the figure of a long passed male climb out... And look around aimlessly, before eventually falling back down. She swore it even looked like it was sighing in annoyance. Snickering, she got back up on her two feet and turned around, just in time to greet a rather revolting and rotting woman with a missing eye hissing a foot away from her own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct told her to kick, yet Jill's foot slammed through the body's stomach, wedging it instantly. Instinct also told her to go for her gun, so in the split second she had during the zombie's slight confusion over its inability to move, its head explodeds from the impact of a single bullet, part of the carnage splattering on her boots. \"Gross...\" Pulling the body off of her feet, she darted off; she still has her communicator, and she had to find a safe haven if she wanted a chance of survival. FAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly climbing the stairs, she rushed into the first room that laid in front of her, locking the door instantly afterwards and grabbed her radio. The signal was dead. But before she could do anything else...</span></div></div>",

Jill quickly grabed for her gun, yet fumbled as she couldn't find it in her trusty holster. She does a roundhouse kick, yet finds it did little difference; the body's still looming towards her. Deciding to go on an all out melee, she tackles the corpse head on, punching it as it starts to moan, yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts face was soft and gooey. Too soft even for a rotting body; like, Jell-O soft. She takes a closer look, and noticed that it lacked many of the features your typical zombie would have. Hell, it lacked just about anything, having only a vaguely humanoid shape. She's about to lift herself up, before it takes a swing with a practically liquid hand- straight for her open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste put Jill into pure, delectable bliss. It had sweet taste, yet as it went down further, it also had a smooth, rich texture. It was practically everything Jill liked in her food... Except, it wasn't the slightest bit filling. Without even remembering that under technicalities, this thing was alive, she starts biting wildly at it, her face happy with glee and oblivious to the dangers lurking in every room around her. Yet with each bite, the figure seemed to be getting fatter... And fatter, until it was obvious it was regenerating itself every time the girl mawwed away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after a few moments, Jill felt the need to undo her belt as her belly poked through her uniform. She simply rips it off and continues eating, apathetic that her pants are now somewhat loose and that her figure was slowly going to hell. She couldn't even think straight; all that mattered and existed in the world was herself and filling her mouth with as much of this stuff as possible, perhaps even forever.</span></div></div>",

Bliss was the only thing that came to mind, the taste completely unworldly as if perfect in flavor. Delicious wouldn't scrape the surface of how it tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to groan as it was filled beyond normal capacity even for a binge, yet it was in no pain and the groans weren't of indigestion but almost as if it was saying <i>more</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate and ate, suddenly a voice came into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, you deserve it, you've earned it Jill\", was what it told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it eat up, every last bit, let it strengthen you, build you,...fill you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug in faster now oblivious to even what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about your body, your gorgeous when gorged, more food means more beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a split moment rubbing her bloated belly moaning softly.

More beautiful, more powerful, more of a woman than ever existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her now rounded stomach as it bubbled and groaned placing a hand on it to rub it slowly while still feeding herself with the other.

Regaining consciousness, she starts to make out her surrounds: a small, nearly blindingly white room, with a small table next to a chair that she was strapped to, unable to escape from. Across from her seat was a long, ultra-reflective mirror. She didn\u2019t need to think over it twice to discern that it was a one-way window and that she was almost definitely being watched from behind it at this very moment. She started to recollect what had happened to wind her up here, yet all she can remember is walking home from her college like usual... And a heavy hit to the back of the head. Quickly putting two and two together, she realized that she had somehow been victim to another kidnapping by a terrorist group. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think harder over any of these vague memories, a young man in a lab coat strolls in with a note pad. In a surprisingly posh voice, the man started to do his work. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve finally come to, eh? Alright, I\u2019ll just have to take a quick few tests-\u201d Yet before he could do anything, he was cut off by Ashley frantic kicking and screaming. \u201cWHERE THE HELL AM I!? Who\u2019re are you!? What\u2019d you guys think you\u2019re going to do to-\u201d All the man did was take out a large syringe from his coat pocket and before she could react, he injected its contents into her arm. \u201cHeh, we forgot to do that before you woke up. Now then, as I was saying, I\u2019m going to quickly ask you a few questions, run a few tests and then we can get this over and done with! Firstly, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Whatever had been shot into the girl was wickedly strong: not only did she calm down, Ashley felt light and dazed, yet not tired. Somehow even happy, yet the drug wasn\u2019t powerful enough for her to forget she was a hostage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Eh, Ashley Graham\u2026 I think\u2026 Maybe?\u201d It was powerful enough to intentionally make her forget aspects about herself though. \u201cRight, good answer, good answer\u2026\u201d The attendant stated with a warm smile, while writing a few quick notes on his clipboard. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026 Um\u2026 Oh boy, no idea!\u201d Despite her heightened confusion, the drugs had an intoxicating effect on Ashley, leaving her somewhat ditzy even though she had some lingering recognition that she was trapped. \u201cDon\u2019t worry now, that\u2019s the answer we wanted!\u201d The man laughed, writing a few notes. After a few minutes, the following other than her name and gender could be gathered about Ashley, from Ashley; absolutely nothing, and even her name and gender left her somewhat uncertain in this state. \u201cSo\u2026 Eh, did you kidnap me just to ask those questions?\u201d Ashley asked innocently. \u201cHeh heh, of course not! No, I just needed to test how little of your memory was intact. Can\u2019t have pesky memories getting in the way of our work. No sir!\u201d His eyes started to seem somewhat more menacing when he finished this sentence, yet Ashley hardly noticed. \u201cHeh, guess not!\u201d She giggled, oblivious as to what he had just strongly hinted at. Or why she was giggling in the first place. \u201cNow\u2026 We just need to take you to the Operating Room!\u201d He proclaimed, beginning to grin madly at her with a slight hint of a twitch. </span></div></div>",

If they\u2019re naturally curious and outgoing, then I guess they\u2019ll act more like the subject is.\u201d She flatly stated, not taking her eyes off her work. She turned to him and lowered her look. \u201cJust be glad she isn\u2019t naturally violent.\u201d She added, having a quick chuckle. \u201cYeah, yeah. Just start up the equipment.\u201d With a flick of a switch, the machine started to whir into gear, and Ashley was slowly brought into the tube. Suddenly, several sharp tubes started to inject themselves into her body, including her mouth, and started to slowly pump in a strange, violet coloured liquid, yet before she could register the pain, she once again fell unconscious.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she woke up, she realized that now she was now in a dank, uninviting warehouse. Wondering why she\u2019s no longer in the pleasant \u2018white\u2019 room, she piped out. \u201cEh, anybody there? Is this still part of my doctor\u2019s operation?\u201d She got up and walked around, looking for anybody. Suddenly, a voice rings out from the intercom, completely unrecognisable to Ashley. \u201cThis is Experiment Subject # 12, testing phase 01. You are amongst the first in a series biological weapons designed to seek out and destroy any other life forms for sustenance. When this red-alarm rings, we will let loose several different subjects.\u201d Strangely, Ashley felt the need to intently listen to this voice\u2019s orders, even if she couldn\u2019t understand half of what it was saying. Just then, the voice started a countdown. \u201cCommencing in 3. 2. 1. Begin hunting now.\u201d The alarm sounded, and she could now hear movement within the different warehouse aisles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately began to run at an amazingly high speed, instinctively climbing and jumping off walls to increase her mobility. She then started to sniff the air; she seemed to be unaware that she had never, ever been able to sniff out people before, or run at impossible speeds. She found herself running down a lone aisle, making out despite the darkness a lone figure, crouching in the corner. Smelling the stench from this area, she increases her pace, until she was right up to the body. As the petrified man slowly looked up at Ashley, she quickly lashed forwards and\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrew him aside, and tore with amazing strength into a metal container filled to the brim with chips. She gnawed up half its contents in a minute, stopping only to lick her fingers. By the time she was done, her jumper was pushed up by a large, spherical belly, bloated from the huge amount of junk she had just stuffed herself silly with. Her supposed victim watched in confusion as she sat down and rubbed her belly, smacking her lips with a large smile. \u201cOh, sorry about that. I was FAMISHED. Actually, now that I think about it, I\u2019m still starving! Um, this wasn\u2019t yours, was it?\u201d She grinned back at the even more confused man, who could only think to awkwardly smile back. \u201cOh, eh, no, go ahead!\u201d Better that junk food then myself at any rate he thought to himself. Just then, another alarm rang out, and she started to sniff a new scent; gas. Before long, she was completely passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up in the same room as before (abiet now with a large bowl of chocolate to her side), the same man in glasses greeted her, yet less enthusiastically then before. \u201cOh, hipth doc!\u201d She yelled, her mouth full with half the bowl\u2019s contents. \u201cYes\u2026 Hi\u2026 I have some bad news Ashley.\u201d \u201cOoooh, that\u2019s my name! I\u2019d forgotten about that again!\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter at this rate. What I\u2019ve come to say is\u2026 The operation had a slight hiccup. And by slight, I mean massive. It was a complete blunder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ashley looked at him blankly. \u201cReally? Because I feel GREAT!\u201d She patted her stomach, surprised to find it had now digested into a large, healthy layer of flab, creating a large love handle on her sides. \u201cYou\u2019re not pulling my chain?\u201d  She beamed at him, feeling that if something had really gone wrong, she felt too damn good at the moment to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Well, eh\u2026 Oh what the hell, you won\u2019t care anymore at this rate. We had intended to modify your genetic structure to turn you into a lean, mean biological machine, and let you loose back on American soil. Rather, all this effort and years of planning has somehow resulted in you simply getting a large appetite.\u201d Ashley again shot him a blank, confused look, and then started to smile. \u201cOh, all this hard work for me? I\u2019m touched!\u201d There was no sense of patronization in Ashley\u2019s comment whatsoever. \u201c\u2026 Indeed. Well, if you\u2019re so \u2018touched\u2019 by all of our hard work, then maybe you could help us out? It would take YEARS to develop another virus to combat the one we gave you, and we don\u2019t even know if its only affecting your appetite or also multiplying your human fat tissue and god knows what else, potentially. And really, didn\u2019t go through this much effort to simply reverse the ill side-effects of one of our enemies\u2019 most famous teenagers. So\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened, and a few of his female co-workers started to unload towering boxes into the room, until they were almost entirely surrounded. \u201cWould you mind, eh, \u2018not holding back\u2019? At all? You\u2019ll get what we mean when you start.\u201d He exited the room. \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t hold back\u2019? Eh, sure thing!\u201d Ashley replied as he left, completely stumped by what he had been talking about before these boxes appeared. She got up with a hefty push on the chair, and lowering her hefty legs onto the ground as her butt jiggled against her now even shorter skirt, she walked over to a box. \u201cOoooo, candy! Now I get ya!\u201d She laughed, before diving in with extreme wildness despite her new size into the munchies.</span></div></div>",

As her skirt clung more dearly to her wiggly ass, she went head first into another container, this one housing some huge, novelty sized marshmallows. She'd already eaten enough to fill up several dozen people at this point, yet for herself she had barely scratched the surface of stuffing her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChunks of soft marshmallowey goodness got practically everywhere, yet Ashley simply giggled at the mess. When her boots started to cut into her expanding leg fat, with great effort due to how stretched to the limit the leather shoes were, she tore each off, leaving her bare feet exposed. When the same happened to her short tartan miniskirt, she simply shook her butt until it was ripped to shreds, and went back to her girly pig out, apathetic that her panties were exposed and simply emphasized how much larger her ass was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of this, Ashley was well and truely enormous. Her girth took up just about everything around her, yet despite her belly alone being 600 pounds, she still could raise up her body and walk around with perfect ease. Her breasts sat on her morbidly obese stomach, only just contained by her bra. Her panties were another matter; her ass, more than a dozen times larger than it original was, nearly counterbalanced the huge weight of her tummy. Her thighs thrust out wildly, as wide as a truck.

I didn't hold back!\" She said ecstatically, before slowly making her way to the door, yet it opened before she reached it. \"There you are!

Are you even stuffed?\" \"Nope!\" Ashley cheerfully responded with. \"Eh... Do notice any changes?\" \"Well...

Ashley, on the other hand, began to dance...hard. Which sent her impossibly enhanced curves swinging and shaking like mad, her massive belly sweeping side-to-side with enough force to stun a rhino. His fears shoved aside by curiosity, the man took a moment to be impressed by how strong she must now be to not be anchored down by her own girth. He also tried to figure out why she was dancing...did she think this was music? That the siren was some techno song? Really? Could she really have been rendered so obnoxiously, embarrassingly dopey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" a speaker on his computer console suddenly barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yes! Yes. Yes?\" he asked it, his head tilted, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have an intruder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's...that's not good. Ideally, we would have a feral, berserk woman to unleash on anyone, but right now, the most we could expect our little guinea pig to do is dance with them. Annoyingly. Although, her belly and ass both could probably be pretty deadly if her gyrations made them whack somebody...hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should...should we do something, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...actually, no. I'm assuming that this intruder has come to rescue our guest, and really, our guest is now so heavy that she's not going anywhere, unless the intruder thought to bring an industrial crane. So...ooh! Yes! Brainstorm! I'm brilliant! Okay, actively get all guards to clear out of the way, and try to direct and lure him to our guest's cell! Here, I'll even program the door to open up for him! Then, when he comes in, we'll just lock the door behind him, and we'll have two prisoners! The room was designed to keep in a violent superhuman! There'll be no escape! And, in all honesty, having to spend an extended period of time with the enormous and irritating young woman could well drive him to suicide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming with satisfaction over his own cunning, the man waited patiently. As he did so, he stared hypnotically at the still-dancing Ashley. Her jiggling, quaking body was like a lava-lamp...lord knew most of it nearly had the consistency of one. Finally, the man almost giggled as the intruder, just as planned, stepped into the room, only to have the door, and their fate, seal behind them.

Her lower half had taken a hit too, her chubby legs and butt stretching her pants a bit, the seams holding the tight leather leggings together straining ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho...I picked up a new job for ush...\" she said, shoving hunk after hunk of the slice in her mouth. \"Turnsh out...\"*GULP*\"That a small town is being terrorized by demons suspiciously like the ones that Vergil sent after you back when you two had your tiff.\" she said, throwing the crust of the pizza in her mouth and swallowing greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sins? Small fries.\" Dante laughed, looking at the seven skulls over his chair, and the crossed scythes he had swiped from a pair of Hell Vanguards back when he had been reckless enough to run around without a shirt under his coat. \"Why tap me, Trish? Not soft enough for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute, Dante. No, I just thought I'd throw you a bone. You in? The pay is pretty good, and you know these thinks like the back of your hand.\" she asked, taking another two slices and stacking them before taking a bite.</span></div></div>",

We could have her as a bad guy behind the scenes who eats tries to eat all of the food before the protagonist (Frank) can use it to replenish his health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second is Rebecca Chang. A news reporter as fearless as Chuck (and Frank) who often dives off into her own in the mall. She is more than capable of handling herself against the deadly horde of zombies occupying the mall. However, in between looking for the first big scoop in what has caused the outbreak to obtain a chance to shin, Rebecca has trouble controlling her sweet tooth ever since putting herself under so much pressure.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Rebecca threw her mic at the closest zombie. She turned around and dashed back into the Fortune City hotel. The crew, her beloved Channel 6 Action News crew, had ditched her with a cloud of exhausted remaining from the van as the tires screeched from beyond the deadbolted gate. Whether this action was intentional or was done out of pure cowardice hadn\u2019t mattered once Rebecca felt that her days here were shortened to mere minutes with blood thirsty zombies clambering to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel lobby, which was just mild mannerly vacant moments ago, is scattered with hungry zombies here and there. Rebecca drew a quick breath and put on her brave face. Nothing a quick elbow to the jaw or a swift kick wouldn\u2019t do to get the groaning undead out of the way. Her first thoughts of her current situation were to find a place of safety and gather up some weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran into South Plaza, the one of the unfinished portions of The Fortune City Mall. There was no artificial lighting, only natural lighting coming in through the high ceiling The interior gave off a grey colored atmosphere with the walking dead occupying every corner. Plenty of construction materials were still around such as scaffolding, tools, and hard hats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOAH!\u201d Rebecca snapped out of her thinking when a zombie dove right in front of her, she whips the pistol from her pocket and plugs two bullets right into its head. \u201cPhew,\u201d she wipes the cold sweat from her forehead. A mushed groaning comes from behind her, she turns to see a good number of zombies slowly making their way toward her. Ahead, an equally sized group of zombies were approaching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip, \u201cShit! I\u2019m screwed!\u201d, Rebecca grumbled, kicking herself for not running out into Fortune Park. Rebecca backs away as time advances the means of escape start to slim with the zombies starting to surround her. Her movement stops when a cold beam touches her back. Looking up Rebecca can see part of the scaffolding above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe scaffolding! That\u2019s it!\u201d Rebecca climbed the construction, further distancing herself from the zombies who clumsily tried to do the same only to topple amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the top scaffolding, Rebecca steadies her wobbling legs as she made one step after another across, \u201cKnew it was a bad idea to climb in high heels.\u201d Rebecca slipped of her high heels and held them within one hand. These things were a pain to climb in as much as they were to run in, \u201cShould be able to put these to use.\u201d Looking down at the scaffolding, Rebecca could see something that resembles a tray of food, a pamphlet, and a bundle of firecrackers right next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then got an idea from looking at the high heels and firecrackers. She sat down, set the lit firecrackers, slid them into her shoes, and threw her expensive high heel shoes across the mall lobby. The bright and loud crackling snatched the attention of the zombies who now shuffled their way toward the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Rebecca picked up the pamphlet between her fingers and unfolded it. The pamphlet turned out to be a map of the entire Fortune City Mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. So I want to go here,\u201d she said pointing at the safe house located in the Royal Flush Plaza, \u201cThat means I have to make my way through the Fortune City Arena and the Americana Casino. Sounds simple enough,\u201d Rebecca folded the map and tucks it into her skirt pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tray from Baron Von Brathaus, Rebecca spotted a map of the mall, two hotdogs slathered with melted cheese, a large order of onion rings, and a cup filled with cola too big to fit in one of Rebecca\u2019s hands. \u201cScrew my diet, I\u2019m gonna need as much energy as I can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firecrackers wouldn\u2019t be firing off for much longer, so Rebecca really had to stuff her meal into her mouth as quickly as possible. She took the largest bites of the hotdog as possible and barely thoroughly chewed through her last bites before stuffing another bite into her mouth. The same deal went with the onion rings and the soda to which she slurped down in combination. Splatters of grease and cheese stained her outfit much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca winces at the thought of her gluttonous action and the strain she feels on her slim, tight stomach after cramming food down her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her view at the top of the scaffolding she could see the firecrackers beginning to dim out, \u201cNot much time. Gotta hurry.\u201d Rebecca runs through South Plaza both utilizing hand-to-hand combat and the pistol she held tight in her right hand. On the way down, Rebecca adds a sledgehammer and a box of nails into her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of zombies would turn their attention toward Rebecca, yet at this point she was too far away to be bothered with. So they went back to shuffling and moaning amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow entering the Fortune City Arena with a full stomach, Rebecca Chang\u2019s objective is to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peach was lounging about in her room, not knowing whether to throw another party, go-kart tournament or just get kidnapped again. By now, nothing seemed to overly interest her. She decided to walk take a stroll around the castle, looking out for anything that would catch her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing did. After two long hours of looking through every nook and cranny, she was surprised at just how unsurprising her home was. She slumped her back against a wall and started to pout, before realizing that none of her toad retainers were even in the room. \"Oh... I'll save the complaining for them to hear then.\" She crossed her arms and laid back... And continued lying her back, until she realized that the wall she'd been using to support her back was no longer there. She quickly jumped back in shock, and then crawled slightly forward to gain a better look. All she could see was a dank, murky old passage way, trailing for what seemed like eons until ending supposedly with a wall. \"Wait a second... I remember this now!\" She exclaimed to herself, before stopping herself when she remembered nobody else was in the room to share her excitement. 'Let's just hope I remember this correctly...' She thought to herself, before crawling in. Dodging the the occasional cob web, Peach's excitement continued to bubble. When she reached the other end of the passageway, she stepped back, and then, with all her might, quickly slammed her arm against the wall, before it gave way. She then proceeded to fall into...</span></div></div>",

Man, I sneaked into here all the time when I was younger! Of course, that led to me being a chubby kid, so... Now I'll become a chubby teenager!\" Obviously, the lesson of not eating unhealthy foods by years of working off that fat hadn't taught her anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunging a hand into a pile, she managed to pull out a huge packet of gummy treats. \"How I've I been living without going into this place? Gawd, this is heaven!\" Shoving handful after handful of gummy treats into her mouth, she lies back and moans. After a couple minutes of this, shoving food into her mouth becomes almost second nature: She simply lies back and lets her hands do all the work. As her dress begins to stretch due to her stomach, she begins to sink into a pile, causing pieces of food to fall into her mouth by themselves. \"Even less work! Boy, I hope I'm not eating TOO much... Still gotta get out the back way. But another hour or so shouldn't hurt!\" She giggled, and finally managing to stand up, notices that her dress is far tighter around her waist and chest region than it was before she entered. \"Well, everybody likes a girl in pink, no matter the size!\" She commented, before sticking her large butt in the air as she sank her head into a pile of chips, eating madly. \"I'm not even normally this hungry...

Common logic would tell somebody that if her breasts had expanded that much, the rest of her body would soon follow, yet Peach wasn\u2019t never a popular princess due to her pearls of wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a few minutes though\u2026 I gotta get back!\u201d She mentally told herself, realizing all of the fun possibilities she could have with this room in the future. With another dozen bags of candy and another half-dozen cans of drink, she started to dig her way to the ground. \u201cI know there\u2019s a latch somewhere\u2026 Oh, here we go!\u201d Without fully seeing what she was doing, Peach crept into the hole and wound up to a warp pipe, that led to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Royal Hall. Before she could make a mental \u2018Whoops\u2019, Peach with her new huge bloated stomach, thunder thighs and fully exposed basket-ball sized breasts, in front of several of her Toad servants. \u201cEh\u2026 Hi?\u201d It may\u2019ve not been as bad if she hasn\u2019t fallen directly onto her throne, firmly lodging her ass into the chair. Looking around at the Toad\u2019s stunned faces and feeling guilty, she suddenly remembered that she held a hellova lot more power than she did when she was just a kid. \u201cWait a second, I make the rules around here now, don\u2019t I?\u201d Peach mused to herself. Giving her ass a quick jiggle to lodge herself out of the chair (but instead sent half of it into smithereens, though she honestly didn\u2019t care any more), she trotted off without another word, other than announcing that Daisy was going to be invited over for some \u2018private business\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, wearing a somewhat larger dress in her bedroom, Peach heard a knock at her door. Knowing it could only really be Daisy, she let her in. Shocked at Peach\u2019s new state, she was almost instantly set off. \u201cPeach, what the hell did you do? Were you hit by a fat bomb or something?\u201d Starting to laugh, the blonde simply gave her a knowing smirk. \u201cEh\u2026 Wait, what? Is THIS why you brought me here Peach?\u201d Smiling more sincerely, Peach responded while pacing around her magnificent bedroom, mostly adorned with pink. \u201cWell, you know when we were little, and how we liked to explore each other\u2019s castles and\u2026 Well, You know \u2018that\u2019 room here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy\u2019s face said it all. \u201cWait, now I remember\u2026 You found THAT place again? Oh\u2026\u201d Drawing closer and lowering her tone, she started to smile. \u201cI\u2019m assuming the grub in that room\u2019s just as tempting as it was when we were little\u2026 Hehehe\u2026 Eh\u2026 Was this just a one off thing?\u201d Peach chuckled. \u201cObviously not, I wouldn\u2019t of invited you here otherwise. Rather, I\u2019m inviting you to join me; we\u2019re way older and more wise than we were last time binging in that room\u2026 If we go this time, who\u2019s going to say anything? Both of us are too powerful for anybody to dare object!\u201d Daisy started to reflect over this. For two seconds. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m definitely in on this. Though, is the grub going to be worth the huge bulk?\u201d Peach grabbed both her breasts and impulsively shoved Daisy\u2019s face in them. \u201cC\u2019mon Daisy, something that comfy can\u2019t be all bad!\u201d she said alluringly, hinting to a history the two had been desperate to keep a secret over the years even more than a secret candy room. Lifting her head up, Daisy\u2019s face had blush and a huge grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me Peach! Let\u2019s-a go!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Corridor after corridor the girls snuck, Daisy taking to hiding behind Peach's sizable ass at each corner. By the time they reached the room, they'd already been running around in circles in the dark for a good while. Creeping up to the wall, Peach and Daisy looked around; nobody in sight. With a slight thump, the wall slid away to reveal the small passage way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Daisy whispered to Peach. \"Though one thing... How're you gonna fit in? It'll be a tight squeeze.\" Peach turned around and looked at her in a mopey expression. \"Damn it, I seriously didn't think of that one... Eh... Well...\" She started to blush with an awkward smile at Daisy. \"You wouldn't mind pushing, would you? The wood walls in that corridor are old, so they should kinda... Bend to accommodate me... Heh.\" Daisy giggled a bit. \"Nah, it's okay. Anything to show off my strength!\" Peach smiled calmly back, yet added \"Showing off your strength by pushing a fat girl down a tight corridor so both can reach a magical world to binge to their hearts content?\" Daisy smiled back. \"Exactamondo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peach got into position, Daisy gave a quick heave, Peach's chubby body slowly started to shift through the old corridor, Daisy forcing her head right into Peach's butt to get her through. It was actually pretty comfy thanks to the layers of flab she'd added to her cheeks, so Daisy hardly complained. By the time they reached the latch, Peach remembered something; she'd forgotten to shut it, which wouldn't be a problem if Daisy hadn't been using all her might to squeeze her best friend's ass through the tight space.  Both went practically flying into the space, and like last time, it was nothing but piles of junk food in a large, limitless white room, which partially blinded them for a awhile due to the darkness outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both came to, Peach woke up to a muffled yell and a large object underneath her butt. She quickly shifted over and let Daisy get some air. \"Talk about junk in the trunk... You're butt get through allright?\" She sat up and shook her head a bit. \"Yep! Sorry about that Daisy, I didn't really notice at first...\" Daisy scoffed. \"No problem! Rather be sat on by you than somebody like... Wario!\" Both burst out laughing uncontrollably. \"Ahahaha, man, it'd take YEARS to get the smell out!\" Standing up and helping Peach up, Daisy looked around. \"Anyway, I'm starving! What's a seasoned veteran like you reckon we do for a plan of attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at the piles of chips, piles of candy, piles of drinks and piles of several other foods going on endlessly, Peach develops a plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remember how we couldn't find them?  We had toads searched every nook and cranny of the castle for these.

It's an old photo album from when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet!  I guess we came down with it and forgot about it.  Let's open up and take a look see.\"  They opened it up and were showered with memories.  There was a picture of when Daisy beat up Wario and Waluigi to defend Luigi.  A picture from Luigi when he caught Peach and Mario's first kiss.  A group photo of the brothers and princesses at Mushroom Land amusement park.  One of when they first found Yoshi.

Peach walked over to a long list of buttons that were in alphabetical order and found one that said wrestling.  \"everybody stand back.\"  She pressed the button and the main floor and the first five rows of seats were submerged under the floor.  In a few minutes, the hatch opened up and a gigantic wrestling ring rose up from the floor along with two more rows.  This ring can be as big as this or a mere fraction of this.  The Peach dome was designed for anything and everything sports wise.\"<br>\r\n\"That's awesome Peach.  So, you boys ready to fight?\"<br>\r\n\"Lets-a-go!\"<br>\r\n\"But please, could you two take it easy on us?  We don't want to end up needing to visit the hospital.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine my little Luigi, we'll go easy on you two.\"  They all then climbed into the ring and went to their sides, ready to fight.  \"Ding-ding, let's go!\"  They then began their little for fun match of wrestling.  If you were looking at them, you'd be amazed at how fast the princesses were able to move.  Despite weighing half a ton each, they still were as fast as their slimmer selves.  Needless to say, this won't take much time at all.  And, in the blink of an eye, the plumbers were already knocked to the ground.  Peach then walked over and pinned them to the ground with her belly while Daisy walked over to Luigi and positioned herself.  She then plopped down onto Luigi, squashing him completely with her ass.  While she was sitting their, she held down Mario and allowed Peach to do a belly flop onto him, completely smothering him in her fat belly.  \"Well, that was short, but fun.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, but Peach, I think that this shouldn't be how we do this, we could come up with a way so we all have an equal chance.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, this was way to easy.  But you have to admit, we're pretty dominant as 1,000 pound beauties.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea.  When do you think we should get up?\"<br>\r\n\"Lets just give 'em ten minutes, that should be enough squashing for today.\"<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"   They then sat and laid there and talked for ten minutes before getting up to see that each of them were stuck to their bodies.  \"Well, that's funny.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, yea, let's get them outta there.\"  They then helped the plumbers get out and they came to in a hurry.  \"Yea, that's not exactly what I meant by, 'go easy on us'.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh quit complaining Luigi, you know you liked it.\"<br>\r\n\"I...Yea, I kinda did.\"<br>\r\n\"What about you Mario?  How'd ya like Peach's belly?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it sure beats fighting Bowser any day.  But let's just do one of our normal sports please.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, we've had our fun.  How about a soccer match?

They scored three easy goals within the first minute and then another easy two with a power shot from Daisy.  \"What's the matter Peach?  You tired already?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh shut it Daisy, it's just the beginning, anything can happen.\"  So with playing nice out of the picture, Peach and Mario decided to get physical.  Mario began tripping and body slamming while Peach was belly flopping.  But despite all of this, they still only managed to score two goals.  \"Damn, this is gonna be harder than I thought.\"  Peach was getting mad, so she kicked a power shot.  In her rage however, she messed up with the power and they flew in at the speed of a turtle, resulting in the goalie nabbing every last one.  Luigi got possession of the ball and charged towards the goal.  He avoided Peach's belly flop, Mario's slide, and only had two toads in his way.  He stopped and charged for his power shot and both toads rushed him.  Daisy then leaped over Luigi and went to butt slam the two.  \"Eep.\"  She hit her mark, both toads ended up squashed and stuck to her massive ass.<br>\r\n\"Luigi, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\"  Luigi punted the ball sky high and followed it.  He hit is mark perfectly and made all six balls into the net.  \"So, that's how they wanna play huh?  Let's do the same thing Mario!\"<br>\r\n\"Okedokey.\"  Mario then got the ball at the middle of the field.  He did a flip over Luigi's shoulder rush, but sadly bounced off of Daisy's ass upon landing.  She then plopped her ass down on top of him and sent the ball flying towards the goal.  The goalie, whom was picking his nose, didn't see it coming and the ball nailed him right in the face and scored, bringing the score to 12-2.  It looked bleak for Peach and especially Mario who was now wedged in Daisy's butt crack, but she didn't care, she just kept on playing with Mario being squashed with the swaying motion of Daisy's ass.  Peach was fuming, \"GAH!!  Can I get a replacement over here?\"  A toad then filled in for Mario.  \"OK, now's my chance to bring us back.\"  Peach then got the ball and immediately launched a power strike which was exactly like Luigi's in every way and scored six goals.  \"Now that's what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n*Time skip*<br>\r\nThere was 2 minutes left on the clock and the score was 23-19.  Peach then saw Daisy playing defensive and letting Luigi lead an attack on the net.  She took this opportunity to sneak up behind Daisy and pull Mario out of her crack.  She got their and pretended to be covering her and swiftly pulled Mario out with Daisy being none the wiser.  She carried him off to the side line and woke him up from his dazed state.  \"Mama-mia that hurt.\"<br>\r\n\"You OK Mario?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'll be OK.  Now let's get out there and win this thing.\" *ding* Luigi kicked the ball in and scored once more.  Peach hurried back onto the field shortly followed by Mario.  They let one of their toad team members retire for the day, seeings as he was squashed, burned, hit by a load of shells, and on the verge of collapsing.  They made a last stitch effort  to tie or even win.  They need 5 to tie and 6 to win.  Mario was ready, he ran up, sidestepped Luigi's tackle, and this time, he avoided Daisy's mighty ass.  He was setting up for his power strike when the two opposing toads rushed him.  Just like Daisy, Peach leaped over Mario's head and in her case, belly flopped the toads.  Mario had it, it was a six shotter with great speed.  The goalie missed the first four and knew he had to stop the next ones.  He jumped and tipped the fifth, and using his tail blocked the last ball into the air.  Unfortunately, he hit his head on the top of the goal and knocked himself out.  The ball landed and was rolling towards the goal, and out of bounds at the same time.  It was headed in, but it stopped right in front of the goal with five seconds left.  Mario had recently came down from his shot and charged for it.  The goalie came to and saw this rush.  He ran for the ball at the other end of the net to stop him.  He dove and Mario slid, who would com out on top?  Mario's foot made contact, but Kritter's hand was there to stop and knock it out of the way.  The game was over and Luigi and Daisy had won.  \"Alright!!  We did it Luigi, high five!\"  Luigi had to jump up for her hand which wasn't such a bad thing since he was a good jumper.  But, in Luigi's excitement, he jumped without looking, missed, and ended up kissing her.  Both just froze there, Daisy opened her eyes and saw what happened while Luigi just laid on top of her boobs, both blushing apple red.  They didn't do anything though, they just were frozen.  But they closed their eyes and looked like they were enjoying it it.  \"Aww, look at the love birds.\"<br>\r\nThey then broke out of it and Luigi hopped off of Daisy.  \"Shut it Peach, that was an accident.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, but it looked like Luigi enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh shut it Bros., it was an accident.  Even if I do love her, an accidents an accident, I just got over excited.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, yea, whatever.  So, what now?\"</span></div></div>",

After I charged my DSi, got my computer and wi-fi set up, and got me something to eat, I tested my wireless internet with my DSi Browser. As I searched on Google (I don't know how they got it in the Mushroom Kingdom, either) for a good weight gain story, I stumbled upon this story. I read it to chapter #15, then thought, 'When was this posted?' I quicklyed checked the date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's today!\" I said to myself. So i got in my go-kart that Luigi gave me as a house warming gift (yes, the Mario Bros. are my neighbors...) and drove to Castle Peach wiht a supply of green and red Koopa shells, in case any obsticals were ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy midnight, I made it to the castle. Luckly, the seciruty there sucked and the front doors were unlocked. I was inside the castle. Sounds of the Toads sleeping filled the air. Even the guards were asleep. 'No wonder Peach is kiddnaped so often,' I thought to myself. 'And if I'm right, the secret door should be right... HERE!'And sure enough, the door opened with a muffled crecky sound (sort of like: 'Krrrrrrrrck'). It wasn't loud enough to wake anybody. I fell down into the room, using the feather (Super Mario World cape power-up) to get a cape and float down, careful not to wake the 25-ton princesses (yes, that is correct, from the 50,000 lbs.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach just sighed and sifted to the right a little. Dasiy jumped, but not awaking, while letting out a huff of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" I wispered in awe. \"They're bigger in person.\" Then it hit me. 'What if one of them wakes up?' I thought. Then, i saw the warp pipe. An idea just hatched in my head. I'll just use a cloud flower (Super Mario Galaxy 2) to jump into, but not go in all the way into, the pipe. Just enough to stay hidden. So I grabbed a cloud flower and hid in the oversized warp pipe untill moring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Yes, luigiman is a fan character)</span></div></div>",

A younger luma suddenly flew off into the Observatory's kitchen, and came out soon afterwards with a large pot with what appeared to be nothing more than bubbling sauce, balancing the somewhat overfilling pot on its small head. \"Don't worry Mama!

Then, a lot tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...is she going to explode? Into snacky happiness?\" one Luma asked another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only we do that, Carl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Then...what's she doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Rosalina rose back out of the pile, trying to wipe the sauce and star bit crumbs off her face as daintily as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for your fine work collecting all these. I am deeply grateful, and look forward to partaking of more shortly. But first, I just wanted to--...my goodness, since when was my dress this tight?...and since when was MY BODY SO BIG?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose her hands to her face in shock and surprise as she finally noticed the considerable change that had taken place in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would all of you mind closing your eyes for a moment?\"<br>\r\nThe lumas all did as they were asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a magical snap of her fingers, Rosalina made her dress vanish, so she could better examine her body. Her breasts, which were the first and most obvious sight upon looking down at her body, had grown. Considerably. She could no long properly cup her hands over them, she could only squeeze them. They had each grown to almost the size of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" she murmured, not entirely displeased with that development, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly, however, she was unsure about. Far from being the flat, firm surface it was before, it now poured out considerably, covering her view of her feet, and draping down to, it felt, almost her knees. She grabbed it in her pudgy hands, and shook it. She had to admit, the tactile sensation was rather pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered her feelings on these changes, she placed her hands on her hips as she thought. This made her realize something...firstly, that her hips were now quite wide, and also...she felt further back on herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD LORD, MY ASS IS HUGE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis declaration almost made some of the lumas open their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean!...\" she corrected \"...my...posterior...is quite sizable. Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at herself sideways, and did a little booty-shake dance (a new experience for the woman), and admired just how long after the dance concluded her buns continued to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rather surprised as just how much she enjoyed her new size. Between how delicious the star bits and sauce were, and how fun it was to just dig into the feast wildly, and how liberating it felt to feel her body as something new for the first time in so long...she felt a warm joy welling up inside her. She loved her meaningful, unique life among the stars, she loved her home, and she loved her family of lumas. But to be experiencing something so silly and new and satisfying woke up something inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also awoke in her...a desire for more sauced star bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another magical snap of her fingers, she donned what resembled  a blue bikini. A dress just seemed ineffective at this point, and she really did feel like wearing something wilder and freer. But she did not, however, want to flash any of the innocent little lumas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can all open your eyes now!\"  she called sweetly. And so, they did. And they were all quite surprised to see her new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strode towards her pile, she fixed the luma who had fixed up the sauce with a stern glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sauce you made...fattening, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the luma said nervously \"...the star bits themselves are really fattening, I mean, they're made to fuel galactic transformations, so lots of calories, y'know, and, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just answer the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the..the sauce is probably having something to do with your weight gain, too, though...yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another second or two of looking at him sternly, she stopped with the act, left her face break into a smile, and said \"Good job!\", laughingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little luma spun proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, pile...\" Rosalina said, feeling like a child (in the universe's grandest candy store) \"Here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she dug in.</span></div></div>",

A smile was plastered across her face, as she rubbed what she could of her body...which wasn't much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown...well...enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, which encompassed most of her field of vision, draped across her huge body, each of them almost six feet wide, and even longer. Her belly had taken little time to reach the floor, and had continued to spread and roll across it, minute by minute. It had the length of width of a public pool, and was almost as soft and soothing to the touch as the water of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her belly lay heavily on the floor in three immense rolls, piled up higher than she was tall, her ass had piled up behind her even more impressively. Each cheeck was bigger than her entire belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS one might guess, it hadn't taken long for her arms to become incapable of reach the food over all her huge fat, so she had taken to levitating the star bits, and globs of sauce over to her eager face with magical, sweeping arm gestures. But her arms themselves were now so laden down with fat that any gesture beyond tapping her hands up and down took a great effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" she purred contentedly, her fat face beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumas, meanwhile, were enjoying this whole time greatly. They had never seen Rosalina so enthusiastic and reckless, and were finding it a blast. And they were having plenty of fun, treating her belly as a slide, and bouncing up and down on her ass-cheeks like they were inflatable castles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling incredibly peaceful, Rosalina...</span></div></div>",

She felt around her body with a heavy arm; her fingers brushed against a silk fabric, and wiggling a bit, she realized she was wearing a dress that would be several sizes too small. Feeling around a bit more, she noticed it was cut off at the legs on one side, and her breasts were nearly bursting over the top. Before she could call out though, the lights turned on; she was on a massive walkway, and around her sat an endless crowd of applauding people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling her neck, she realized that what she was wearing was her old dress; albeit far more larger and risqu\u00e9. With still only a vague idea as to what was happening, she heard an overly eager voice come blaring over a nearby loudspeaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And presenting, for the first time ever, our new model! A multi-ton beauty from beyond the stars, this is one sassy chick that really knows how to have fun and live LARGE! Modeling off a flattering dress of her own creation, it'ssssssss ROSALINA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, nearly every spotlight focuses on her, and see gets to fully comprehend just how immense she is. Not losing a single pound in this dream, she somehow manages to stay upright on a pair of small high-heels, only just visible to the audience underneath a wide tower of fat and celluite that constitutes for each leg. On the other side of these legs her position props up her ass; it doesn't even <i>feel</i> like anything is even close to covering her dimpled cheeks. Her stomach drapes far ahead of her, yet has taken to spreading all around her rather than to scrape along the ground. Her dress herself is nearly sunken in fat, with only the chest and waist areas visible from her ever consuming blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all though, the crowd loved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be a downer in her own fantasy, she starts to strut down the walk way with surprising ease, her butt swaying from one entire side of the audience to the other, seductively looking ahead of herself as whistles and moans erupted from the stands. At the end, she crosses her arms and looks across the waves of people, before doing a one-eighty and strolling off, swaying her thighs even harder to the roars of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she makes her way back to the end...</span></div></div>",

Adjusting the angle Bowser could swear he was a \"lump\" that was in the shape of a head. Sure enough the Koopa King soon spotted Rosalina's plumped face with a look of a pleasant sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil? It's that woman! Rosalina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" questioned the child beside Bowser, not fully comprehending what his father was going on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That \"blob\" on the screen, it's Rosalina. Hahaha that woman has truly let herself go and now is just a sack of sleeping blubber...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a light bulb lid itself up within Bowser's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwahahaha! This is perfect. While Rosalina sleeps we and our forces (Bowser had several airships behind his) can easily steal the stars we need to conquer the universe and just to ensure victory we'll take the fat woman with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser Jr. leaped excitedly at his father's plan but paused as he saw another gleam in Bowser's eye, apparently another light bulb had gone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again I wonder how that girl got so fat in the first place...perhaps if I knew that I could increase her growth to the point where she'll become a threat to the stars themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it Junior, an empire made out of that woman's flab, those that would oppose us would be crushed beneath her girth. A universe of blubber with me as it's supreme ruler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior wasn't too sure of the latter plan, Bowser really seem like he was liking it a little too much, but he decided to nod anyway just to please his Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with two course of action to take, which becomes the fate of Rosalina and the stars themselves?</span></div></div>",

So, she that large blob thing over there? Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Wendy made contact onto the observatory, wand in tact. She looked around- only a few weird fat star thingies, and she doubted they'd know who she was if they noticed her. Making her way to the oozing mound of flesh, she started to think over how pulling this off would get her and her siblings back into her dad's good books. Or at least get her back into the spoiled lifestyle she used to revel so in. Climbing her way across the soft bulk with both claws, wand in mouth, she finally emerged on top, just to meet a very awake Rosalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww man, you were still meant to be asleep for this. Well anyway...\" Quickly rushing (or as fast as she could in knee deep blubber) Wendy to Rosalina face, she covered her mouth before she could call for help. \"This wand here gives me allll kinds of powers, right, and my old man wants me personally to invite you to stand by his side to help him rule the universe, or whatever.\" She faced Rosalina with a smirk. \"And you have two options; agree, and be fattened to infinity so your bulk reaches all throughout the universe stopping anything in its path, oorrr... Disagreeing, and being fattened to infinity and standing by Bowser's side anyway.\" Slowly taking away her hand, Wendy waited for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I never realized Bowser had a daughter.\" Wendy nearly instantly bawled inbetween Rosalina's massive boobs. \"Damn it damn it damn it, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?! Just because he sucks at names so he only brings out Bowserbedwetter Jr. nowadays doesn't mean I don't exist!\" Rosalina was a bit shocked, but at the same time amused. She normally wasn't manipulative, but... Well, this bratty teenaged girl seemed easy enough to trick her into her own means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no no, that's not what I meant... Eh... What I meant to say was, I had no idea he has such a... Beautiful daughter, yeah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's tantrum cleared a bit. \"... Really?\" \"Oh my yes, a shame Bowser seems to of   ignored you over the years...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he does kinda neglect me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the final plot popped into her head that spelled failure for Bowser, but still copious amounts of feeding for herself. \"Well, why not get back at that idiot by eating alongside me? C'mon, it's heaps of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked at her for a moment. \"Nobody's actually ever asked me to do something with them... Well... Um...\" </span></div></div>",

She also saw countless strange little creatures that resembled cartoony stars, some of them playing and racing, others apparently resting. But what surprised her most was a huge, quivering hill of flesh, that she first interpreted as some malevolent alien blob monster, but which she soon realized was simply a human-looking woman, fattened to outrageous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Samus asked herself, stunned by the revelation of what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming her ship's cameras in one the woman, she saw that her face was...well, downright beautiful, her huge cheeks and impressive neck rolls doing nothing to diminish her loveliness, and perhaps doing something to increase it?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Keep it together, bounty hunter.\" she ordered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's face, however, was almost hidden, obscured as it was by the immense body belonging to it.

Raised by bird-people, and pursuing the hard life of bounty hunting from an early age, she had spent most of her days either alone, or even when in the company of other people, she always kept up a wall of professionalism. Romance had never entered her world view. There was no place for it, it was alike a puzzle piece that didn't fit. But more than that, even simple sexuality had never truly lit itself within her, as it does to almost anyone else.

As she scanned and zoomed all around the woman she looked to her ships control pannel, erasing the coordinates of her current destination and keying in a new one.  As much as she enjoyed watching the mystery woman from afar, she knew that if she really wished to discover what drove these new, bizarre urges was to encounter their spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even then, what would she do when she encountered her?  Would she help to make her even larger?  The thought of this woman eclipsing her celestial castle was enticing to Samus, yet as she began to meditate on feeding her to immensity Samus began to imagine herself in the same situation, joining her in immobility and working together to reach celestial portions, floating around space and even taking orbit around a star, if possible.  What started as a ridiculous fantasy quickly consumed Samus as her ship approached the castle.  It was time to start her own growth.  But to do so, she had to find out what caused this woman to become so large...  and who she was, for that matter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus's ship landed dozens of bright creatures swarmed it, watching with apprehension as the main hatch slowly lowered ot the ground.

She figured that her powersuit might startle the poor little star creatures into comas. Plus, she didn't want anything to truly get between her and her new obsession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumas began alternately greeting her, asking her who she was, and all around pestering her. Thankfully, most of them were still asleep. Otherwise, she'd be overwhelmed by the friendly, but rambunctious little creatures hovering around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Samus Aran.\" she stated, addressing the creatures \"And I've just come to say hello to sleeping beauty here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached Rosalina, Samus was even more amazed by her size. From ground level, you couldn't even see her face, in fact, without a bird's eye view, it would even be hard to make out what was what on her. Even her enormous breasts couldn't be see from her current angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Samus said, cautiously, as she reached out to tap the woman's flesh, which now filled her whole field of vision. And upon touching her hand to the woman's skin, she was stunned at how soft it was. Licking her lips, she touched the woman harder, and found herself sinking into her up past the elbow, without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus chuckled. Something was most certainly igniting within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that the woman was still daintily snoring, despite her poking and prodding, Samus figured it was time to wake her up and have a chat. Which meant reaching her face, probably, since any other part of her body was so cushioned with tons of fat that any amount of tapping and shoving would just feel like a light tickle at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most people, scaling up on top of Rosalina would take an hour of planning and trial-and-error...she was really was a literal hill of flesh, with high walls of flab, all of it smooth, slippery, and treachorously soft. But Samus was an old hand at traversing difficult surfaces, and she mad it up to standing in Rosalina's cleavage in a matter of seconds. The lumas applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to walk, which was tricky, her legs pressing knee-deep into the woman's fat almost immediately, the woman's face finally came in view. It was certainly fat, but still looked downright emaciated compared to the rest of her. It poked out, sweet, innocent, whispering calmly in its sleep, from the fat piled around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was now no longer dancing around the issues. She was aroused beyond comprehension. She was actually nervous about saying hello to the woman...her! Samus! Nervous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well, she thought to herself. The sooner I wake her up, the sooner I can get to the bottom of this, and join her in the ranks of the immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself, Samus decided to wake her up by...</span></div></div>",

Not being one to talk a lot, Samus knelt down, wrapped an arm through her long, flowing blond hair and put her mouth over hers, passionately moving her tongue into hers. As she started to wake, Samus jumped back a bit and quickly sank into her blubber, with Rosalina no doubt being confused as to what had happened and who was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Do I know you?\u201d Rosalina asked Samus with a blank expression, curious as to why she has the strange sensation someone had just been tongue kissing her. \u201cWell, eh\u2026 No. You don\u2019t. But well\u2026 I\u2026 Look, I don\u2019t really talk to people much, and even more rarely do I get this up and personal with them. Yet you\u2019re\u2026 Well, you\u2019ve awoken something inside of me. While I used to think that love was just some alien concept up until five minutes ago, I\u2019ve suddenly seen you and your infinite beauty. Um\u2026 Maybe something about constantly exploring and battling across celestial planets, yet whatever it is, I don\u2019t care\u2026 Oh dear, that was corny, that was just plain stup-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Rosalina cut her off with a warm smile. \u201cOh. Well, funnily enough, I\u2019ve also been a bit alone and isolated throughout my life. I\u2019ve always had my friends around me, yet\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve never seen another girl since leaving my old home\u2026 I guess becoming this large was just an impulsive thing\u2026 Though\u2026 Wait, no, it\u2019s more than that! If it\u2019s able to connect two people like you and me together, surely there\u2019s something more to being colossal besides it being fantastic fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls continued to talk to each other, exchanging life stories of travelling the stars and\u2026 Well, more in Samus\u2019 case, constantly fighting for the stability of the universe, Samus began to lie forward, her head a few inches off of Rosalina\u2019s, dreamily looking into her eyes, Rosalina giggling each time Samus accidentally got submerged into her fat until all was left was her head. After an hour or so, it was undeniable. Rosalina felt just as passionately about Samus as Samus did for her, if not more so. \u201cThis really has been an amazing past few days\u2026 Well Samus\u2026 If us two star gazers are going to be together, what should we do first?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I thought you\u2019d NEVER ask\u2026 Though I should\u2019ve asked first, heh.\u201d Samus giggled, slowly getting over the tough exterior she had originally spent years developing. \u201cWell, I want the same thing you have. An enormous body fit for a goddess.\u201d Beginning to walk two fingers around Rosalina\u2019s face, she beeped her nose cutely. \u201cWell? I think it\u2019d tie us two even further together\u2026\u201d Rosalina laughed. \u201cSamus, you don\u2019t need to try and convince me! Of course you should fatten up! Maybe try and see how far that Zero Suit can take!\u201d she sniggerd. \u201cYes! Rosalina, you are undeniably the most beautiful being in existence: it\u2019s a dream come true to even get close to your size.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that announcement, Samus and Rosalina exchanged another lengthy kiss, before Samus slid down Rosalina\u2019s stomach, bounced off the end and walked towards the Lumas. With an obvious giddy tone, Samus talked to them. \u201cWell guys, think you can feed me the same stuff you fed sleeping beauty over there?\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop beaming, and the Luma\u2019s shared her excitement as they all started to dart off, looking for another hoard of starbits for a grand feast of epic proportions.</span></div></div>",

It was going to be a big day today, and in more ways then one. With such a big carnival being held in Sarasaland, there was no doubt they'd be a huge audience waiting to see her smash a few records. Getting into her best sports wear, she had a quick 'power' breakfast, and rushed off into the desert before any of her attendants could even talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far off from her palace, Daisy reached the carnival grounds by the tents were being put up. Yet before she could get far, she was approached by a worker Goomba. \"Oh, eh, Princess Daisy? We were told you wouldn't be here for another few hours...\" \"Don't sweat it, I always like being early! Say, what's been set up so far?\" The Goomba looked down for a moment, and then looked back up earnestly. \"Well, some of the food stalls have, along with some of the side-show games.\" \"Cool, I'll check 'em out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling off, she started to snoop around the different stalls. There was a great deal of exotic food being sold in the stalls, yet she wasn't really hungry. Each desperate bid by a stall owner to sell the Royal Princess some of their wares was met with the hand: \"Sorry guys, but I gotta keep my figure nice for later!\" Walking past one particular stall of cotton candy, she gave the same response. The Toadette behind this stall, unlike the others bothered to strike up a friendly conversation even after being put down. \"Ooooh, for that competition?\" \"Heh, not just one competition!\" The girl gave her a 'look', but then smiled again. \"Wouldn't of thought a princess would be so competitive when it came to eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... You have put your names down for all the eating comps after all.\" She giggled. \"It's even here in the program!\" Passing her a small pamphlet, Daisy read over it... Again... And Again... There was no denying it, as it was written right there; she'd somehow signed herself for every single eating comp there was. And there were over 60. \"Erm... Doh? Awww man, I thought these were athletic comps! Like the 100m... Dash! How's that a food competition?\" The girl pointed to the rest of the blurb. \"Oh. A competition to eat a 100m sub... Awww man, I'm going to look like a total dolt when I drop out of all of these in public.\" The Toadette's face dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, your highness-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to be all formal, sis.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Daisy... It's written by law you have to compete in every competition you sign up for in the Sarasaland Annual Carnival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy paused for a moment. \"But... But... They can't honestly expect me to go through all of these, can they? Hell, I AM the ruler of this kingdom? Why can't I just change the law?\" \"Well, maybe the threat of revolt?\" \"But... But that's... But that's <i>retarded</i>.\" The Toadette shrugged her small shoulders. \"Well, I guess your people really like competitions, because the last ruler several centuries ago to back down from a competition got cast off to sea.\" Daisy gave her a glare. \"... I majored in History.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Daisy started to mope. \"This is still completely stupid. I either become a total blimp or get kicked out by my supposedly loyal people.\" The Toadette walked out from behind her stall and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. \"Well, I can try to help.... Somehow.\" Getting up, Daisy starts to regain her confidence. \"Yeah... Yeah, I've seen worse predicaments! Alright, what's your name?\" \"Toadette!\" \"Toadette! ... That's a kinda unoriginal name... But whatever, Toadette, together we'll somehow get through this.\" \"Eh, you mean you will. The worse that'll happen to me is my dad will ground me for not watching over the stall.\" \"I doubt he'll mind in light of the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking off together, Toadette suddenly remembers something. \"Eh, you've essentially signed up for EVERY even, you know?\" Daisy nodded. \"... The first one starts in five minutes. It's an early one.\" \"Well, I can stomach one of these, but then we develop a plan...\" \"Alrighty... The first event is...\"</span></div></div>",

Finds herself licking another. And then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, her appetite is racing exponentially. Bothering to even go back and eat the parts of the lane she had dived over, Daisy alone has eaten three quarters of her lane. Finding movement a breeze, she gives a quick look behind her, some of the chain chomps are moving slowly with a sickly expression; the others are significantly larger, yet are also significantly more asleep. She swooshes around and starts to gobble up their respective lanes, completely covered in a thick shiny layer of gooey candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner is a no brainer; Daisy slowly walked up the ramp grinning and victorious, yelling out alongside the crowd. Toadette rushed through the stands up to her and nudged her thigh. \"Daisy, that  was amazing! You showed those guys how a girl can eat!\" Daisy didn't miss a beat. \"Well, I can't believe how slowly they were eating; you can't waste good food like this! Oh, and you're a complete lifesaver giving me that pill! I feel like taking on the world now!\" Waddling outside with Toadette carrying a sports bag with Daisy's change of clothes, the two started to discuss the next event. \"Alright Daisy, that's one gold medal out of 64... Now the next event for you today is... Chocolate Wrestling.\" \"Chocolate Wrestling, eh? Well, that last event is going to make that one a breeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadette stopped and eyed Daisy a bit. \"Talking about that last event... You don't seem to be that concerned over your... Um, 'development'...\" And she was right; during and after the toffee swim, Daisy was huge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet it was probably one of the most boring for one certain goomba archaeologist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sucks.\" Walking around Frankley's room, Goombella sighed. \"Why am I stuck looking after the lab for the day? Hasn't the dude heard of locks?\" Deciding it'd be better to look through a few books rather than just mope and complain, she snatches one out, and flicks through the pages. \"Lesse here... Legend of a Giant Cockroach... Tale of the Sinister Muffin People... Man, where do all these legends derive from?\" Slamming the book shut, she went back to complaining to herself. Loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she felt something... Like a gust of wind. Not knowing from where, she started to sleuth around, until she noticed that one of the floorboards in the single room house was loose. Lifting it open with her mouth, she spied a small staircase, leading into a dark abyss. \"... Well, that's something you don't see everyday.\" Guessing that technically she'd still be in the house if she went down, she... Well, strode down the gothic looking stairs. Turning on her torch, she realized she was in a strange catacomb system; the small pipe-like corridor she was in broke off into half a dozen more paths. Deciding to trust her luck, she ran down the one in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of so of rushing aimlessly down a long, dank corridor, she caught her breath... JUST as she notices a far off glow at the end of the tunnel. Deciding to investigate, she got closer... And saw a small opening to a room filled with light, just big enough for her to get through. Deciding that she was more than capable of defending herself incase anything was on the other side, she snuck in, only to find herself in a large, golden shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this stuff'll be a great find for me! Wait 'till the college hears about this!\" Yet she turns around and quickly notices the entry way is gone. \".. Crud.\" She decided to explore the place a bit, trying to work out where exactly she was.</span></div></div>",

While the walls were decked out in gold, it didn't take her long to notice the huge statue in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl, probably her age, sans a Koopa rather than a Goomba, sat down on a royal throne. She, like everything else, was made entirely of gold, yet this statue also included embedded for her shells and rings to exemplify her importance. But most significant of all was her size. Well, more the shape. Rather than just a normal sized teen Koopa... She was fat. A really happy and content fatty, but still fat. Her belly bulged far out of the sides of the throne and front, her sell riding up her back. Looking closer, Goombella noticed a huge diamond shoved into her large belly button, half the size of her head. Her mouth seemed stuffed, yet was partially grinning, her eyes also half closed in bliss.  She gazed at it for a bit, mystified and curious as to what any of it signified. Just then, she noticed a small parchment at the foot of the of the statue, at the very tip of the figure's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting scholarly instincts take over, Goombella read it aloud to herself. \"Whomever reads this ancient scroll; the ancient curse casted over this princess will be cast aside, and in return for your kindness, will be rewarded to your wildest limits.\" She stepped back a bit. \"Erm... I *maybe* shouldn't have read that out.\" She glanced up, and with a sudden shake, the statue seemed a bit less... Inanimate. Just then, she was flung to the other side of the room by a heavy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head and opening her eyes, she noticed the empty throne... And that she was on a soft, cushy substance. She turned to her left and saw the Koopa girl, just as cheerful as she had seemed earlier, pat her on the head with a pudgy hand. \"Awww, aren't you adorable! I really gotta thank you for lifting that curse. Being a statue for 2,000 years was a major bummer, I've got to say.\" Goombella was nearly speechless. \"But-but... Wait, so have I just rescued you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuhuh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I'm going to be rewarded to my limits for my kindness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The goomba girl started to awkwardly look down. \"Oh boy... Does that mean what I think it means?\" She motioned towards the girl's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, even larger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww man.\"</span></div></div>",

Bored, bored, bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she lived in the lap of luxury, with servants bowing and scraping to her every screech.  Sure, she didn't have to do chores or homework like the other girls.   Sure, she basically got to spend all day lounging around on a king-sized waterbed, munching on bonbons and watching spicy romance movies.   So what?  She wanted <i>more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing on a bathroom and high-heeled bunny slippers, she stomped downstairs to the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" she shrieked.  \"I'm <i>bored!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser, startled, dropped the pointer he was using to illustrate his latest plan of war.   \"Uh--daddy is consulting with his generals, honey, just a minute--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Iiiiiii'm booooored noooooow,\" Wendy whined, stomping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I'm done here, I'll find something for you to do,\" Bowser promised.  \"How about another date with hunky Troopa actor Robert Patternshell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no fun if you have to hold them at spear-point to get them to go out with me!\" his daughter whined.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser put his face in his claws in exasperation.  \"Look, take a magic wand.  Take it and...go wreak some havoc on the mushrooms, or something.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yanked a low-flying Magikoopa out of the air, grabbed her wand, and tossed it to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fun,\" Wendy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then make it fun!\" Bowser growled.   Sensing she was pushing perilously close to the line, Wendy skedaddled.  Bowser plopped down heavily on his throne and heaved a sigh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a sound, a sniffle, and looked up.  The Magikoopa was sobbing into her sleeve.   She was quite pudgy, the Koopa King noticed, almost as round as a ball.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now what'll I do for food?\" she sniffed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you sniveling about?\" Bowser snapped.   He wasn't in any mood for complaints from his underlings today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy popped out of the warp pipe leading to the Grassland, slapping the want idly against her palm.   She wondered what sorts of spells it could do.  It looked weird.  The golden body of the wand was overlaid with a grid and tapered on the far end, and the crystal was a heavy sphere encrusted with smaller crystals near the handle.  It almost looked like a strawberry ice cream cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaa!\" she said playfully, pointing the wand at a tree and hoping the stupid little plant would burst into splinters.   Geometic shapes burst from the end of the wand and sank into the trunk, but instead of exploding, the tree shimmered and writhed in the midday sun.   Its bark pulled away, revealing a thick, crumbly trunk, and all its leaves seemed to thicken and turn brown, then green again as something oozed over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stepped forward for a closer look.    The leaves looked almost like cookies.  Sugar cookies, coated with green frosting.   She picked one off and gave it a hesitant nibble.  That's just what they were--cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the rest of the cookie into her mouth and followed it with another, and another.  They were delicious, warm and perfectly baked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to satisfy her curiosity, she snapped off a bit of the tree trunk and tried it.  It was pure gingerbread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A cookie wand?</i>, she wondered, taking aim at another tree.  \"ZAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one's trunk twisted into a red-and-white candy cane, and its leaves burst into bushels of green sugar jelly mint leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An everything wand! </i> she realized in delight, sweet tooth aching to sink into a mouthful of those leaves.   She was happy to give her sweet tooth what it wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAA!   A lemonade stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAA!   A chocolate boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAA!   A wedding-cake cliff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy strolled on, feeling quite good about herself, talking celebratory bites out of the landscape and looking for mischief.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mycete, mushroom strongman, looked out the window of his charming fungal cottage and saw that the flag on his mailbox was up.  \"Ah, a letter for me!\" he burbled happily.   He leaped down the steps, skipped along the sidewalk, and thrust his hand into the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...pie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say!\" Sid said, withdrawing his hand and eying the dripping strawberry filling.  \"Whatever the deuce happened to my mailbox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor where his mailbox had stood, there was only a cherry pie with an oozing handprint on the side, stuck on top of a pretzal stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I improved it a little,\" said a shrill voice from behind him.  \"Nice, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see Wendy O. Koopa, vile daughter of He Who Must Not Be Named (scourge of all good mushrooms everywhere) sashaying towards him, tail swinging back and forth absolutely indecently.   She reached right over his shoulder, snapped the mailbox off at the base, and schlorped it down in one large, messy bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, now!  How's a gent supposed to read his mail?\" Sid said hotly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy giggled.  \"Not my problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid swung at her, but a mushroom strongman is only the equivalent of a Koopa weakman, and his spongy fist bounced right off her scaly hide, knocking him over backwards.  His handlebar moustache straightened with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, see here!  You can't get away with that sort of behavior, madam!  I'll notify the constabulary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther mushrooms had come out of their cottages now to see what was going on.  Many fled back into their houses at their first glimpse of the dreaded Koopaling girl.  Others froze in place, gripped by mortal terror.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody tells <i>me</i> what I can and can't get away with,\" Wendy sneered, folding her arms around her chest.   \"In fact, I might be hungry for a few <i>more </i>mailboxes.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped over Sid, making sure to dig her high heel into his side as she did so, and wandered up and down the street, experimenting with the wand.  Mailboxes always turned into pie, it seemed, but what kind of pie different.  The next one was blueberry, followed by peach, and then apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it has something to do with what kind of mail they have</i>, she mused.  And, with an attention to data that would have made her brother Iggy proud, she began opening the little doors.  Bills and a personal letter became a chocolate pie.  Just bills became another cherry.   An empty mailbox became gooseberry, and a copy of <i>Nintendo    Power</i> became a thick, chewy shoo-fly pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she had to sit down for a while and let all that scientific research settle.    She sank down into the shade of a tree and drowsed, one hand on her scaly belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missus Koopa?\" asked a little mushroom girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snrk?\" Wendy asked, blinking.   Her eyes narrowed.  Who was this puny little shroomlet who dared to approach the mighty and beautiful Wendy O.?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please just leave,\" the little shroom asked, voice quivering.  \"Everybody is sad because they can't get their mail now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough,\" Wendy muttered around a burp.  \"You have about ten seconds to run, you little brat, before I turn <i>you</i> into a pie too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid of you,\" the girl said, but Wendy noticed how nervously she was holding the teddy bear she carried.   Her little fingers had a pretty tight grip on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not tight enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got your bear!\" Wendy laughed, her claws ripping it from the little girl's gasp.   \"ZAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear turned into a bright green lump of Gummi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Mr. Rumpypootlepants!\" the girl shrieked, tears welling up in her eyes.  \"Give him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!\" Wendy said with a wicked chortle.  She stuffed Mr. Rumpypootlepants into her mouth and chewed until the bear was nothing but green curds and saliva, which she cheerfully showed off to the hysterical girl before swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him back!\" the girl cried, punching Wendy right in her soft yellow gut.  But if Sid's punch had been a minor annoyance, this one was so mild the Koopaling barely felt it.  Still--she decided to teach the little brat a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for that,\" she puffed, getting to her feet with difficulty, \"just for that, I'm gonna eat <i>all</i> your toys.\"</span></div></div>",

The little girl scowled, but led the way to a pleasant two-story mushroom house surrounded by beautiful flowers.   Wendy followed her as quickly as she could, though her stomach was so full she couldn't move faster than a waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mushroom couple burst out of the front door and scooped up the girl, showering her with kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sporina!  Don't even do that again!\" her mother sobbed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared us to death!\" her father said, tears rolling down his cheeks.  \"Getting near that awful beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy frowned.  \"Excuse me,\" she snarled.  \"I am the delicate flower of World 8, the beautiful and refined--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a quick belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--princess of the Koopalings, Wendy O.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now you're just a big fat bully who's standing in Mommy's prize tulips!\" Sporina said, and stuck out her tongue.  Before Wendy could find out if the wand worked, though, the girl's parents grabbed her and hustled her into the house.  Wendy heard the lock click shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph,\" she sniffed.  <i>Prize tulips</i>, huh?   Seized with a sudden malicious impulse, she waved her wand over the flowerbeds and quickly zaa-ed them into cupcake, which she tossed lazily down her throat one by one.  She could tell the family in the house was peeking through the curtains at her, and tossed them a sideways smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wendy had finished denuding the flower bed, she heaved herself up on the porch and zaa-ed the door.  It turned into a large chocolate bar, from which she excavated a sizable hole for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeere's <i>Wendy</i>,\" she teased, displaying sharp fangs smeared with chocolate and relishing the fear on the mushrooms' faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She attempted to push her way through, only to feel the sides squeezing in on her as it she were a cork in a bottle.    Her belly was too distended to get through the opening.  Annoyed, she planted her high heels in the chocolate and pushed herself back out again, then proceed to eat another inch of clearance around the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, with a lot of effort and no small degree of grunting, she made it inside.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your room?\" she snapped.   The girl pointed.  Up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staircase had been intended for mushroom citizens, not full-figured Koopa girls.  Getting up them was another ordeal, but she finally managed it by resting her gut on top of the bannister and scooting up.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she wheezed, a wicked grin spreading across her face, \"I'm gonna eat all your--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the girl's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-toys?\" she choked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must have been hundreds of them.  Dolls and blocks, a rocking horse, a race track, a full-sized car, and a dollhouse that made Castle Koopa look like... some sort of smaller castle.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy makes toys for a living,\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he'll have to make you new ones, then,\" Wendy sneered, waving the wand around willy-nilly.  She was beginning to regret her boast--her stomach really didn't want any more sweets right now--but she was determined to see it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaa!  Crunch!  There went a set of alphabet blocks, now giant sugar cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaa!  Slurp!  She sucked up a fruit-snack race track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaa!  Glumph!  She sat on the rocking horse, snapping it into fragments of nougat, and stuffed them down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaa!  \"Urk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the gingerbread dollhouse, Wendy stopped eating.   She hiccupped again, and a dribble of sugar-saturated drool dribbled down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that... be a...\"   She burped.  \"...lesson to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a supreme effort--she was so stuffed she was nearly spherical--Wendy hoisted herself into Sporina's bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I going to sleep?\" the girl demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy just groaned.  \"Like I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd clutching the wand, she sank deep, deep into a sugar coma.</span></div></div>",

His squishy fungal hands just couldn't gain any purchase on the slick metal.  It didn't help that Wendy, still snoring and snorting away, had rolled over on top of it.  Sporina's father put all his weight on the rod and tried to lever it out, but it didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help, if you please,\" the mush man suggested.  His wife and daughter soon joined him, all three of them hanging from the rod, but all their weight could barely lift the Koopa girl's bloated body half a millimeter, so weighed down was she by sugary sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy burped in her sleep.  \"Zuhh,\" she muttered.  There was a twinkle of magic and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...for a moment the mushrooms didn't know what had happened.  Then Wendy, still slumbering, took a big bite out of her pillow, which had turned into a marshmallow.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mushrooms watched in shock as the sugary confection disappeared in a few slobbery bites.  Now face down on the bed, Wendy groaned and muttered in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it again,\" Sporina's mother said.  \"Go on, fatty!  Say it again!\"   She poked Wendy in one bulging flank.  But it seemed that the Koopa girl was stuffed too full even to dream of eating; she just lay there like a big golden-scaled lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next few hours, the mushrooms pulled and tugged and set up blocks and tackles and inclined planes and all manner of fancy tools, while Wendy gurgled and digested.  Night passed and turned back into day, and sixteen hours on the dot after flopping into bed, the young Koopa woke up and the mushroom citizens ran screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah, what a lovely nap!\" she said sweetly, stretching the pins and needles out of her limbs.  \"Now, where was I?  Oh, yes.  Teaching this horrid little town a lesson.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still felt sluggish and a little bloated, but her stomach was ready for breakfast.   She pondered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why get out of bed for breakfast,\" she decided, \"when I can have the bed <i>for</i> breakfast?  Zaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she was lying in a thickly frosted sheet cake under a fruit-leather mattress, with a chocolate-chip cookie for a headboard and Twizzlers for springs.  She dove in face first and cheerfully glutted herself until she found herself lying on the floor in a mess of frosting and cookie crumb, the bed nothing more than another few inches around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled another belch.  \"Whoof. Getting... kinda full... again.  I <i>gotta</i> start pacing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy waddled to the door, only to find that the mushrooms had locked her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

And, through the cracks between the books, the cabinet. And wardrobe. And...second bed, probably from the girl's parents bedroom considering it was noticeably bigger than the one she'd just eaten. And dining room table with all three chairs, and refrigerator. Even things like a coffee table and a few lamps- stuff that was useless in terms of a barrier. It looked like they just piled up everything that wasn't nailed down in front of the door. She growled as she saw the two adults round the corner, carrying up their sofa and shoving that onto the pile of furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!!\" Wendy roared through the cracks and holes in the makeshift barrier, causing the toads to jump back in alarm. \"What's wrong with you- <i><b>BELCH</b></i> -morons?? Do you REALLY think a bunch of ugly interior decorating can stop ME?\" The lady toad frowned, and yelled \"Well we sure think it can slow you down!\" Wendy's eyes narrowed and she sneered, insulted by this random toad's sheer cockiness. \"Well if that's the case you better start running- And hope that you're right!\" Raising her wand menacingly. She doubted she could get a clear shot through the barricade, but evidently the toads got the message as a look of fear overtook their expressions and they ran away, leaving their rotten little pile of garbage where it was. In her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Wendy just tried to push through the barricade. She was still feeling a bit bloated from yesterday on top of the bed she'd just consumed, and it was all she could do to eat the whole door off its hinges. It was no use though, the furniture was just too tightly packed together and interlocked for her to shove aside, or even smash her way through. She groaned, clutching her engorged midsection. She could feel it gurgle sickeningly, already swollen to a dramatically oversized orb, tight with all the food packed in there already and hanging off of her body, which had become padded with a heavy layer of lard, which was thickest around her chunky thighs, bulbous rump, and squishy love handles which wrapped around her torso and formed some bulging back rolls. Her tail was sandwiched between her enlarged butt cheeks and these rolls, the size of her bottom now being enough to keep it propped up a bit at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sighed, taking a handful of flab as she gripped one of her love handles with her free hand, giving it an experimental shake, watching the way the movement rippled through her flab, causing it to jiggle slightly, and causing her big old round gut to bounce furiously, wobbling a bit even after the momentum wore off. She felt her overworked stomach protest the jolt of motion with another resounding gurgle, which caused her to let out another loud, violent, undignified belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp.\" She said, resigning herself to what seemed to be her only option as she raised the wand to the first of many obstacles, sarcastically mumbling \"Looks like my breakfast's gonna have a second course...yay for me... <i>ZAA!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Over an hour later, a very <i>very</i> bloated Wendy O. Koopa suppressed a gag as she forcefully crammed the last bite of a big oval shaped coffee cake, which WAS a coffee table before she blasted it, into her mouth. Her cheeks were bulging out like a chipmunk's, as her mouth was so full of cake that she could barely get it closed, a few crumbs tumbling out from between her plump lips. Her eyes teared up as she took a few deep breaths and braced herself, every muscle in her body tensing up as she strained her throat, agonizingly managing to swallow the mouthful of cake, somehow forcing it into her belly- her belly which was completely and totally packed full, not a single inch of room was left, even as her esophagus forced in the cake she could feel her gut stretching further, with a dangerous sounding creak. Once it was down, she sputtered a bit and gasped for air, panting as she desperately took in deep fast breaths, as if she'd just nearly drowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she'd been eating forever. It was a stretch to try and get that door down, but the barricade on top of that? More than a full hour of the repetitive grinding task. With a flick of her wand and a shout of the magic word, her obstructions turned into sugary junk food one by one. A bookshelf made of gingerbread with thick rich icing holding books like big square gumdrops, a wardrobe like a big spongey twinkie with enough cream to fill a bathtub, a cabinet made of fudge filled with a dozen different kinds of cookies, and a table like one big huge donut, and on and on and on like that, every crumb of cake, every drop of frosting, every fleck of chocolate, each single individual little calorie of the thousands and thousands that she was cramming into her gullet fistful at a time despite her stomach's increasingly vehement protest, eating so much her jaw hurt let alone her groaning creaking gut, adding to and expanding her considerable waistline more and more, her body swelling like a balloon and filling up more and more with every mawful of sugary rich junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd caught her breath, she looked up, eyes watering, moaning as she saw the large three person couch still sitting in her way. \"<i>huff...huff</i>...Lasht...one....<i>wheeze</i>...\" She groaned, raising her wand in a shaky hand and aiming it at the couch. \"Zhh....zhuh...\" She mumbled, breathing heavily. Luckily the wand seemed to count that, as a blast of colorful light erupted from its crystal and impacted the couch. Wendy moaned again as she saw it transform into a gigantic smore, huge sticky gelatinous marshmallows held between armrests and a backboard made from big broken chocolate bars, all supported on a frame of golden cinnamon scented graham crackers. With a sigh, Wendy braced herself, lurching forwards a bit, reaching out her arms to grab the couch and drag it closer to her enormity. A bit of fat hung from her arms, wobbling when she stuck them out to reach. For a moment she just stared at the oversized smore, wincing as she felt her engorged body protest. She was already swollen like a tick, she felt like she could burst. She took a few deep breaths, trying to push the pain out of her mind and focus. She shut her eyes tight, opened her mouth as far as she could make it go, straining her jaw muscles, before plunging face first into the warm gooey marshmallow cushion like she was diving into a pool. Her head fully submerged in the sugary sticky gelatin, she took a deep gulp, trying to swallow all of what got into her mouth. She could feel it get stuck in her throat- her body screaming at her. <i>No more, it's too much, we're full. There's no more room, we couldn't possibly fit anything else</i>, it yelled in agony. The clump of marshmallow was stuck in Wendy's throat. She literally couldn't swallow it fully, her belly was filled to the brim. She grunted, opening her mouth again and sticking it into the marshmallow. She used both her arms like scoops, her biceps and triceps burning as she pulled in gallons of pure melty marshmallow down her gullet, like a pump draining lakewater, tears welling up in her eyes as she defied the limitations of her capacity. She could feel it, her throat filling up, nothing more could get into her stomach. Until it filled up so much, it was at her lips. She tried scooping more in, but couldn't. She was full. Completely full. To the absolute brim- No more room at all, full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was almost blinded by white hot pain, but...she fought....fought through it...her arm shaking....she grabbed the furthest armrest...and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulled it...closer to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser...closer to her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt caught all of what remained of the cushions...pushing a tide of sticky gooey gelatinous marshmallow- the same marshmallow she'd already filled herself with to the absolute limit, clogging up her throat, dribbling out her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulllleeeeddd....cloosser.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth- her mouth was full- full of that same sticky white goo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...almost..got...it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved the armrest into her face, clumsily using both arms to feed herself. She couldn't get it in at first- there was...just no...room...but she pushed harder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>cccrrr<b>rrreeeaaaaak</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an ominous creak, like a balloon that was too filled with air, too stretched, just before it popped, Wendy felt it give. Her belly- her skin stretched, more, more- She was doing it. She went on autopilot, her arms working like pumps, shoveling everything into her mouth. She didn't stop when she heard the creaks, she didn't stop when she felt tears- she barely even registered the horror as she gorged and gorged and gorged, her jaw aching as it didn't close for a second, her throat stretched as she forced more and more and more down it, at a glacial pace, into her belly which tore up more and more, unable to hold the pressure. She ate- and ate- eating and eating and eating, gorging and glutting and stuffing, feeding herself through it all as she ate- ate- ate! Until she realized- there was nothing left to eat. Her eyes fluttered open in confusion... She stared at the empty space before her for a moment... Before her eyes rested on the wand. The wand, laying there in front of her on the ground. Among...a few loose crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's eyes widened. She looked around- nothing- a bare empty hallway. She started to cry, crying tears of complete and utter joy, pride, and relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....I did it....haha- Hahaha! Hah! I- i did it!!!!\" She exclaimed gleefully. She was enormous, gigantic, huge! She completely filled the hallway, pressing against all four walls at once, even having cracked and broken them in places. She was nearly completely round, laying on her belly, her arms, chest, shoulderblades and head were the only things protruding from the enormous orb which the corridor couldn't even fully contain. On the other side of that orb, her legs protruded from it too, along with her nice round butt and tail. She checked herself- She could feel her legs, she could even kick them, though they weren't touching the ground. Her midsection, the round part, was gigantic, her skin had stretched so much that her scales were parted along most of it, unable to hold together and contain all of her body, her stomach plates were pulled apart and exposed several feet of her skin. Her skin itself felt so thin, so sensitive, it faded from pale pink to hotter and hotter red, and was covered in angry red stretch marks. But...no tears. No rips- she wasn't bursting open at the seams...she was fine!!! She squealed in glee, kicking her legs victoriously as she stuck out her arms like she was cheering, unable to control her laughter and tears of pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!!!! I did it I did it I did it! I ate it- all of it- I ate it all and I'm okay! I can do anything! I can eat anything! I can eat anything- I can eat everything! I can eat everything!!! I can eat the whole UNIVERSE!!!!!\" She squealed in triumph, though no one was around to hear her. Her celebration was cut short, however, as the adrenaline and all that strain on her body finally became too much for her conscious mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghgnn- nyyArgh!\" Wendy suddenly felt a surge of white hot pain, clutching her chest as her vision went spotty, and she passed out, her enormous body still stuck in the hallway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was dark. It felt hot. Wendy wheezed, taking in a big gulp of air- She thought she heard some commotion then, and slowly, her eyes fluttered open- Only to shut again as she winced, a bright light shining right in her face. She groaned, still feeling pretty woozy, and blinked a few times as she fully came into consciousness. As her senses reignited, she was confused. This wasn't that toad house- she was staring up at a white ceiling with a few lights on it. It also looked like a window was open, as the room was brightly lit from more than just the lights on the ceiling. What is this? She suddenly realized she was hearing a voice, over to her right. \"....Princess.... Princess Wendy.... Your majesty- can you hear me? Princess Wendy?\" She turned her head to look- and realized a few things. First of all, there was a mask strapped to her face- a clear plastic one over her nose and mouth, with a tube running down from it. Secondly- she was <i>huge</i>! Almost all of that food she ate had digested, which made her wonder how long she'd been out, but it was plain to see that she had become enormously obese. She was laying on a bed- no- No- she was laying on three beds pushed together, and even they could barely hold up her bulk. She was just as big as she had been when she passed out, except now instead of tight and swollen and ready to burst, she was all soft and flabby, covered in hundreds and hundreds of pounds of jiggling lard, her belly was still so big that it split her stomach plates, allowing a few rolls of blubber to bulge out. The third thing she realized was that the person talking to her was a koopa- A nervous looking magikoopa with a white robe and hat who was clutching a clipboard, accompanied by a few nervous looking normal koopas and goombas, staring at her. Her head was partially sunken into her fat, which meant that her right cheek was obstructing the vision in her right eye, forcing her to squint as she turned her head and looked at the magikoopa. \"Wha...Where the heck am I? How'd I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magikoopa perked up, seeming relieved that she was okay. \"Oh thank goodness Princess- I- well- My name is Doctor Kamek K. Kambridge, I'm a Medikoopa- like- like Magikoopa but for medicine.\" He explained. Wendy furrowed her brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...right- Of course- my apologies your majesty.\" Doctor Kamek said sheepishly. \"You're in the bariatrics ward of Saint Kamella the inhumane's Koopa Kingdom Hospital. We- a paratroopa heard reports of you attacking a toad village, and so he sent for reinforcements just in case Mario showed up. But- but when they found you in that house you were so...bloated, and asleep, and they thought you were gonna pop! So they brought you here. It took eight clowncopters to pick you up once they broke down the house to get you out, and they had to bring you here on a battleship.\" He finished his explanation, as Wendy looked around and realized, yeah- She was in a hospital. There was a heart monitor and an IV hooked up to her, along with an oxygen mask and a bunch of electrodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I didn't know... shinsh when did we have a hoshpital?\" Wendy asked, her flabby body sloshing as she tried to get a good look at her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's new your majesty.\" Doctor Kamek informed her, taking a step to the right to get a better look at her face, as it appeared submerged in fat from a few angles when she turned her head. He had never seen anything like this before- Even the Heavy Troopas were only a fraction of her size. She towered above him like a golden, jiggling mountain. \"...Princess- is there anything you want, now that you're awake?\" He nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...my shoesh.\" She said, still not looking at him. He blinked, confused. \"I...what?\" <br>\r\n\"MY <b>SHOESH</b> YOU IDIOT!\" Wendy shouted, looking at him. He jumped back, alarmed, \"Get 'em offa me! My brasheletsh too- and my necklashe- it's too tight!\" Quickly, a few paratroopas and paragoomas flew up to fulfill to her demand. The golden hoops which previously hung loosely from her wrists were now tightly squeezed on there, fat bulging out around them so much that they weren't even visible. It took three paratroopas pulling with all their strength to get them off of Wendy's thick arms which seemed to surge outwards with fat once they were freed. Her pearl necklace was stretched out to its limit, and one parakoopa had to cut through the string, which caused it to burst off as Wendy's tire of neck flab billowed out, no longer held back. Her pink high heels were already barely holding together, more of her foot fat was bulging out of the stretched tops than shoved into them, and two paragoomas, nervously realizing they didn't have arms, pulled them off with their mouths, one at a time, which allowed Wendy's large pillowy feet to bulge outwards in freedom, she wiggled her large soft toes- which her pedicured claws had partially sunken into, due to how fat they'd become. \"aaahhh....now that'sh a lot better....\" Wendy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We uh... Princess Wendy, We have the wand that was found with you at the scene-\" Doctor Kamek said. Wendy looked up at him, her interest piqued. He was, indeed holding it. She took a good look at it, regarding its craftmanship once again. It really was a pretty wand, the whole ice cream cone look was cute- She liked that about it, and how it stood out from other wands in look as well as function. Doctor Kamek held it out to her, making sure it was within her reach- As she wasn't in much of a state to move around. She hesitated for a moment...Should she? She glanced down at her enormous body, with medical equipment hooked up to every other roll of fat. She'd intended to pace herself with this thing...maybe have a little fun, indulge a bit, but nothing this extreme. Should she really take it again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the wand...and reached out her pudgy arm- her arm which was almost thicker than it was long at this point. Doctor K handed it to her, her thick sausage fingers closing around the handle. She regarded it. It wasn't her fault that she ate this much, she thought. It was that dumb old family of toads. That rotten little girl who had so many toys and her even rottener parents who tried to barricade her in. She beat them though- in the end she ate everything they could throw at her. But- only because they threw it at her, not because she was greedy or gluttony or whatever. She could totally be trusted with this thing, she wouldn't let herself go. As soon as she had that thought though- she felt her belly gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How long was I out, doc?\" she asked, still regarding the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- uh- about a day. We found you in the morning, and you slept for the rest of the day and night.\" He said. Wendy thought for a minute, before looking at him with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that means I need to make up yesterday's brunch, lunch, dinner, <b>and</b> dessert before I have my breakfast today.\" The doctor just stared at her, mouth agape. He was about to say no- No that's insane, she was already dangerously overstuffed, no way were they gonna let her have that much food in such- \"Well what are you waiting for???\" Wendy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....yes, your majesty- I'll talk to the kitchen staff right away!\" He said, running out the door followed  by some of the others. Wendy smirked, saying to herself \"I didn't use the wand- I'd call that pretty good self control.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About another day and a half passed before Wendy's stay in the hospital finally came to an end. Because of her royal blood, the hospital staff was eager to wait on her hand and foot, half the nurses seemed to be in a permanent state of panicked rushing to fulfill her every request to the best of their ability. Some of her most frequent requests involved luxurious full body massages, dozens of koopas kneading her doughy flab and trying to sooth her skin around the stretch marks. She would also consistently order to have her large feet licked- An old tendency which more experienced staff members might have recalled King Koopa himself having back in the day. And, of course, even though her obesity due to extreme overeating is exactly what got her in there in the first place, her most frequent demand was for food. The doctors were always hesitant, of course, especially on days where she'd had ten full meals before noon and was ordering them to prepare her an especially hearty lunch, but what could they do except oblige? She <i>was</i> their princess after all. She would almost always insist that the portion sizes of whatever they gave her were pitiful, even if they were already giving her five times what she was supposed to be getting. She'd order that they go and get her more, a real substantial meal- bigger than whatever they just got her, without actually allowing them to take the food they already gave her so they could add to it. She'd still eat it, just want another bigger one after. Of course, it was all <i>health food</i>, some kind of foul smelling vegetable protein slop, the staff always wondered how she could possibly want to eat so much of it. But, of course, once her oxygen mask was lifted and she was allowed to eat, she'd glance around to make sure no one was watching- and quietly whisper that precious magic word, causing the gross slop they were trying to keep her on a strict diet of into something more palatable, like a little pile of pudding, or ice cream, or a warm rich chocolate mousse. The staff never caught her in the act, but it did seem odd to them that the super low calorie high fiber and roughage paste which was all they fed her didn't reduce her weight at all, and in fact she only seemed to bloat up even more during her stay. Soon, her time was up, and they'd gotten her into a stable condition, so she was ready to be sent home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Princess Wendy, please remember, make sure to keep your oxygen mask on as often as you possibly can- And don't forget to keep the pacemaker fully charged at all times!\" Doctor Kamek said, staring up concerned at his massive patient and superior, as her blob-like form towered over him like a hill. \"Mhm.\" She said passively. She wasn't even looking at him, he saw her examining the fingernails on her free hand, the hand that wasn't clutching her wand. She had received a new set of makeup as celebration of her successful treatment...which just meant that the people at the hospital gave it to her because they were scared of what she'd do if they didn't. Part of that was a manicure and pedicure- both of which were somewhat difficult to pull off due to her hands and feet having become so thickened with fat that her finger and toe claws were partially submerged in flab. She seemed to be okay with how it turned out though, considering how it took up more of her attention than Doctor Kamek trying to describe her new life support system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And- and please don't remove the electrodes! Make sure nothing interrupts the connection to them and your heart monitor, Keep the body plugged in as often as possible, it's connected directly to your defibrillator. There are five backup batteries just in case of emergencies, keep the system clean and...what else what else.... Oh! Please, maintain a strict diet, please don't eat anything too sugary or greasy, especially not in large capacities.\" That made Wendy chuckle a little, she looked down at the Doctor. She was currently being held on a large cushioned platform, being held up and carried by twenty green paratroopas. Two red paratroopas hovered by her side, holding the cabinet of computers and machines which was hooked up to her body by several dozen wires and tubes, beeping softly as a heart monitor kept tabs on her condition. Wendy sat there, barefoot, obese beyond reason. Her legs stuck out straight, fat feet nowhere near touching the ground, suspended in the middle of them. They looked like great rings of flab, so much fat resting around her calves and thighs that her legs had a horizontal radius greater than their length, and they bulged out, squishing against the ground as she sat, and against her enormous belly which sprawled out between them and forced them to spread apart, making room for it. The plates across her underbelly were still spread apart near the middle, the size of her gut enough to part them and allow for a few bulging strips of pinkish flab to bulge out. Her belly actually hung off of the front of the platform she was seated on, hanging in a few paratroopa's faces, so they had to duck to see where they were flying, and it was the part of her which was sticking right out directly in front of Doctor Kamek's face. Her monstrous gut ran up over her wide hips and thighs, a few thick folds making up some love handles which you could hide a goomba in. Her gigantic shapely rump was quite a sight too, each individual cheek on that fat ass was bigger than a chain chomp, and it wobbled like a pair of balloons filled as full as they could get with jello. The rolls of back flab which came off her love handles sat on top of her rump like a shelf, as fat around her shoulderblades bulged out and rested on those. Her arms were about as thick as they were long, sorta like her legs, and her hands poked out of the fat wrists they were partially sunken into. The fat from her arms would hang and wobble when she moved to do something with them, but she could also just rest them on her own love handles, like a pair of big armrests on a sofa. Her chest had expanded too, a pair of nice big breasts sat on atop her belly, round- but warped a bit by their own gravity as they rested on her gut. Her face was framed by a thick tire of neck fat comprising of two hefty rolls, her head sinking into them a bit, as she had a couple of big chubby cheeks, each one almost as big as her head, and a voluptuous double chin bulging out, which gave her whole face a very rotund soft look. She smirked down at Doctor Kamek through the oxygen mask tied around her head with elastic, her eyes narrowed a bit with one eyebrow raised. \"Oh, trusht me doctor, I'm pretty shure I know how to eat well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...ok...\" the Medikoopa said, hesitating as he gazed up at her. \"Have a safe flight, your majesty!\" With that, the little entourage of paratroopas grunted, lifting Wendy's enormity into the air, her fat body wobbling, before they dropped her platform off gently in the middle of the deck of her personal airship. It lifted off, all her minions running around the deck, tending to what needed tending to. Wendy sighed in relief, as she felt the warm outside air of the bright sunny day wash over her obese form, tickling the bits of exposed skin on her belly, as she flexed her toes and spread her arms, that precious wand clutched in her right hand, taking in the freedom. \"Well...\" she said, a sinister smirk forming on her face as she looked over to a nearby Hammer Bro, loyally saluting its obese princess. \"We're finally shomeplashe that shtupid Doctor can't shee me...Do you have the shtuff I wanted?\" The Hammer Bro nodded and ran over to a door to the ship's lower decks, throwing it open and yelling down \"Guys, she's here! C'mon, move move move!\" Wendy's confident smile grew as about a dozen koopas of several types all poured out from the lower deck, each one carrying as many bags of bottom of the barrel unhealthy as they come fast food, burgers and fries dripping with so much grease it saturated the bags, and to top it all off- A pair of chargin' chucks came up last of all, holding between the two of them a ten layer cake with the words 'Welcome Back To Not Being In The Hospital For Obesity Princess Wendy!' written on it in icing... it was a <i>big</i> cake, there was plenty of room for letters. Wendy's eyes twinkled as she licked her lips, lazily lounging back into her own comfy, soft flab, using her back fat and rump as a sofa and her hefty love handles as arm rests, her own bulging calves were suitable footstools for her big, pillowy, bare feet. She grinned and laughed, wiggling her oversized toes with a laugh and exclaiming \"Well what are you all waiting for? Shomeone shtart licking my feet, and shomeone elshe come get thish mask off and feed me!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy's little airship was abuzz with activity. The crew of a few dozen was a mixed bunch of Bowser's citizens, but mostly consisted of paragoombas and paratroopas, fluttering around on their feathery little wings, performing their little tasks. Of course, only about half of those tasks were related to flying the ship, as most of the crew was doting on and attending to the needs- and more importantly, the <i>wants</i>- of their spoiled swollen superior. The blobbish Wendy O. Koopa lounged in her own fat, her eyes closed in relaxation with a lazy smirk on her face. Simply opening her mouth was all she had to do to prompt a several of her paratroopas to scramble up to feed her, shoving a burger or two or maybe a couple handfuls of cake into her empty mouth 'til it was nearly overflowing. Wendy would leisurely chew and swallow whatever she was fed, not caring if a few loose crumbs tumbled out or a bit of grease dripped down her thick roll of a double chin, before she'd open her greedy maw to be fed once again- Though occasionally she'd punctuate it with a loud belch. Her heart monitor beeped softly, as a couple of koopas stood by the mobile cabinet which held her life support system, cautiously keeping an eye on its readings. After all, she wasn't supposed to be having anything greasy or sugary, let alone the vast amount she was consuming right then. But she <i>was</i> their princess, and they all knew that what she wants she gets, no matter what. One paratroopa held her oxygen mask, nervously glancing over to the cabinet, and whenever he noticed a change in activity or heard Wendy start to pant and gasp, he would flutter over and press the mask to her lips and nose, allowing her to take a few deep breaths, before her condition returned to normal and she waved him off, continuing to eat, her mammoth form jiggling with every bite she took and move she made. A pair of hammer bros were situated at the base of her enormously thick legs, one for each, dutifully lapping away at her soles. Her feet had swollen up considerably, along with the rest of her body, each of her three toes alone was nearly as big as a goomba, and a super thick layer of soft tender fat made her feet each feel as squishy and fatty as the rest of her body, and they had become so massive that they'd be considerably dangerous and powerful stompin' weapons, assuming Wendy could still at least waddle, so it was all the hammer bros could do to try and cover their whole surface with their tongues, briefly pausing to take a few heavy breaths. One of them made a mental note to suggest that perhaps it would be a good idea to get some boos to do this, as their notedly large tongues would be better suited. The other made a mental note to put in a request to be transferred to working for Iggy or Roy or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as Wendy binged her brains out on her little personal cruise, one of the paratroopas who crammed a burger and a fistful of cake into her mouth spoke. \"Uh- that...that was the last of it, your majesty.\" He told her. Wendy opened one eye to look at the nervous green shelled koopa. She munched up and swallowed the final mouthful, before loudly belching directly into his face, making him clutch his nostrils and jump, hovering back a few feet. Wendy smirked, opening her other eye and rubbing her stomach lovingly with one pudgy hand.<br>\r\n \"Aaaah....now that wash a good meal. Thoshe jerksh at the hoshpital, trying to reshtrict <i>my</i> eating habitsh? <b><i>BBRRUUUUUAAARRRRPP!!!</i></b> Inshulting.\" A murmur of hesitant agreement came from the crew surrounding her. The paratroopa who was holding her oxygen mask nervously fluttered forwards. <br>\r\n\"Uh- Princess? Now that you're not eating, do you want your mask back?\" He said hesitantly, presenting it to her. She glanced over at him, an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh- My okshagen mashk? Uhh... Shure, what the heck, jusht put it right back on me.\" She said casually. The paratroopa did just that, careful not to mess up her bow as he stretched the elastic over her head, securing the mask. Wendy took a deep breath of the clean air being pumped to her. \"aaah....thoshe shtupid doctorsh...You'd think if they were gonna give me a life shupport thingie they'd at leasht have the deshenshy to build in a feeding tube.\" The paratroopa nodded in agreement, before fluttering back and landing next to the two koopas standing near the cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's belly had grown swollen once again because of her feast, growing more rotund and taut than flabby. The pink skin bulging out from between between the plates of her underbelly each protruded a bit further, spreading them wider apart, and had turned from pink to a light red, the way it bloated up in size had elevated her fatty breasts even more, and the whole thing stuck out a bit further now than it had before. She rubbed it proudly with the hand that wasn't holding the wand, giving it a gentle slap and feeling it wobble, as it emitted a few low gurgles in reaction to the impact. She looked around, taking a moment to appreciate the view from the height of the airship. The ship was cruising along the border of a Koopa Territory and the Mushroom Kingdom. She could spot a desert with pyramids and an icy tundra with glaciers right next to each other on horizon to the right, and to the left that accursed red and white castle Princess Peach lived in...when she wasn't caged up in one of her daddy's dungeons. Straight ahead, she knew, was the castle where Bowser himself lived, along with her and all her siblings, they were headed there to drop her back off. It would be nice to be back home again. She recalled the morning she got the wand- what- three? Four days ago? She found the village and fell asleep in the girl's room the first day, woke up the second day and ate her way through the barrier then passed out, spent the third day in the hospital- and they just let her out today. So- yeah, it was four.  Well, this was certainly better than being bored in her room like she was- An adventure like this. But...well.... she thought about it. They'd just drop her back in her room again. Nothing wrong with her room of course, she liked her room. But considering she spent most of this adventure passed out or in a hospital...she wanted to cap it off before she went back to her relaxing luxurious lifestyle...until the next time she got bored. She looked over to the wand in her right hand, holding it up so the sun caught its beautiful pink crystal. She smirked to herself, how better to cap off an adventure like this- she thought- than with a heaping helping of revenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey- You! Pilot!\" She roared The blue shelled boomerang bro who was currently at the helm jumped, and turned to face his obese boss, still clutching the wheel, keeping the airship steady.<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes, Princess Wendy?\" he said, nervously.<br>\r\n\"We're heading back home right? To daddy'sh cashtle?\" She asked, most of the crew's attention was on her. They didn't want to miss it if she suddenly started to order them around, god forbid they didn't hear her.<br>\r\n\"Uh- yes, Princess Wendy. Is...is there somewhere else you'd like to go?\" He asked. The red shelled fire bro next to him, serving as his navigator, quickly pulled up his charts to make any necessary changes to the course he had plotted.<br>\r\n\"Ash a matter of fact, yesh.\" Wendy said, smirking, her eyes narrowed menacingly. \"Bring me back to that filthy little mushroom village I was found in yeshterday...and get the bullet billsh and bob-ombsh ready.\" She ordered, a wicked fangy grin spreading beneath her oxygen mask as her wand gleamed ominously.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The peaceful toad village was already paranoid, the recent experience with Bowser's bloated brat just earlier that week leaving the population shaken. Especially since she'd ended up eating so much that the Koopa military squad who was sent to check up on her had to call in a second squad to knock down the poor toad's house and carry her out. Many didn't see this, as they were cowering in their houses hiding at the time. But the few toads brave enough to peek out the windows told stories about how huge she was. They said she was the size of a thwomp, but almost completely round. A big golden sphere tinted bright red from how tightly she was stuffed, Wendy's chubby bust and bottom partially sunken into her globe of a midsection. After she and her koopas departed, the toads began repairs of their town. They threw out all the things she turned into food that she couldn't eat, and swept up the rubble of the areas she destroyed. They actually did a pretty good job fixing it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame it all had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy grinned as she looked down at the chaos unfolding past the golden horizon of her own fat form, dotted with electrodes here and there and a wire powering her implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. As annoying as the high pitched raspy screeches of a toad were to her, they somehow seemed a whole lot easier on the ears when they were screams of terror and suffering. Her cheeks bunched up as she turned her head to the side to look, the fat swallowing up almost half of her face and forcing her to almost completely close one eye. Her own love handles also sprawled out pretty far, two thick rolls of fat billowing out and pooling as they rested on even more of her fat, working in conjunction with her incredibly thick arm like two sagging monster truck tires with a pudgy sausage fingered hand poking out also blocked her view somewhat. She wanted a better look at the carnage of her revenge! If those worthless toads were gonna learn to stay out of her way she at least wanted to be there for it. Suddenly, she got an idea, her thick plump pink lips pulling into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paratroopash!\" She called out. Her voice sounded a bit deeper than it used to, and was definitely breathier as she got winded quickly while talking, even with that oxygen mask. But it was still unmistakable, and her command brought all the feathery winged koopas fluttering to a halt where they were and turning their attention to her. \"New plan, you guysh aren't gonna partishipate in the ashault! At leasht, not in the shame way everyone elshe ish...\" The Paratroopas exchanged a glance between each other, slightly confused by her statement, and honestly- a bit worried. \"I'll eckshplain in a shecond, firsht carry my ash down there, to the middle of town!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently rushing to complete their corpulent commander's order, about two dozen paratroopas crowded around the massive cushiony mattress she rested her immobile bulk on, her fat fleshy rolls bulging out in a few of their faces. A few went off to the side to pick up her life support cabinet and oxygen tanks, knowing how important it was that they remained attached considering she showed no signs of slowing her unhealthy habits. The koopas all grunted as they flapped their wings as hard as they could, even their collective strength was being tested by the 1,700 pounds of princess pudge they were hauling. They managed to get her up into the air and bring her to the ground, her blob like form sloshing from side to side and jiggling like a pile of jello on a plate as they struggled to keep her stable. The few toads who caught sight of her would see she was even bigger than the stories, and anyone who told those stories would confirm that yes, she had gotten even bigger. No part of her body wasn't enormous, a belly stuffed so full of burgers and cake that it seemed like a great balloon, the horizontal plates of her stomach scales insufficient to cover all of it. The pale yellow plates were spread apart like open blinds, and the pale pinkish flesh of her fat gut bulged out, striped by a few stretch marks. Her belly was so full and round that the way it attached to the rest of her body put to mind the image of a big spherical boulder rolling into a pile of dough which it sunk partially into. She was a mess of golden fat folds, broken by her bulbous lower body- a rump which was sagging and pooling out at the bottom due to being all fat, but retaining a somewhat voluptuous rotund shape. Each asscheek was bigger than a full sized chain chomp, and it looked like both of them combined would be able to rival her belly in size. Her billowing thighs were huge doughy rings of flab, bulging outwards as they squished up against her belly, forcing them to spread. Her calves didn't even touch the ground, they were also so much thicker than they were long that they were like rings, except they were still smaller than her thighs, so they'd partially sunken into them, her thigh fat encroaching over her calves so that they were squeezed out more a bit, the bottom part of the fat being enough so to touch her heel as the top part was touching the top of her toes. Her feet were far too large to conceivably squeeze into her old pair of high heels, growing proportionally wider as well since their new size came entirely from fat. Her pink painted toeclaws had stayed the same size as ever though, and had almost entirely been swallowed up by her round doughy orbs of toes, only their sharp little tips poking out from a fat fold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips were incredibly wide, despite being overtaken in width by her rump and belly. She had some deliciously thick love handles which proudly flared out from her sides into two big rolls of flab, which squished up against the back part of her round gut and came out to about three quarters of her thigh where they rested, hugged from behind by her powerful rump which they partially spilled onto. At the top of her butt, sandwiched between the cheeks was her tail. Despite it having grown fat enough to almost submerge the two triangular spines growing from it, it was only half visible as a nice plump set of three rolls of back fat poured over it, the size of her rump meaning it bulged out so far and so high resting on the ground that it was pushing her back fat up even higher, it encroached so high over her one big roll of shoulderblade fat that it almost touched the two smaller rolls of neck fat above it, over which a tiny sliver of the back of her head was visible, topped by her signature spotted bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't really bend her arms at all, as they were in a similar spot as her legs, just two huge tires of bulging slightly sagging flab, though her forearm was a bit higher up, positioned closer to her padded shoulder as the fat on her bicep sagged down enough to rest on her love handles. They were only discernable as arms because of her pudgy hands which had fat swallowing them up to the wrist. Her palms looked like cake decorating bags full of icing, and her fingers were big enough that her ring would've snapped off if they didn't have the foresight to remove it. In her right hand, with only a tiny bit of difficulty, she clutched the wand- her fat spreading out a bit as it squished against the handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were suitably massive, nearly as big as her calves, and the rising curve of her gut both elevating them and forcing them to sag spread out to the sides to make way for it. Between them in her cleavage, affixed to her chest, was the wire which powered her ICD. Above that was her thick, proud double chin which had overwhelmed her pearl necklace and would tantalizingly wobble as she talked or ate. Her cheeks were puffed out big as basketballs, resting on her shoulders and squishing her face between them. Her luscious pink lips were an evil smug smile behind the mask of her CPAP machine. Her lashes brushed against her cheek fat as her flawless mascara and eye shadow shone, lids lowered almost like she was giving bedroom eyes to someone, although a sinister glint was in the reptilian pupils of her piercing blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the paratroopas had finally set her heaving bulk down, her lazy overindulged form still somehow sweating harder than they were despite the hard work they just did, they nervously flew up to her line of sight, afraid they knew what she'd order next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now- hear me all membersh of my army, not jusht you paratroopash but everyone! Shpread thish meshage to anyone who can't hear me now! I want you to fan through thish ENTIRE town, shearch every houshe- every kitchen, every shtore or reshtaurant or bakery or anything you can find! Gather up <i>every lasht crumb</i> of any and all kindsh of food you can poshibly find! And ash shoon ash you get your clawsh on even the shmallesht morshel of food- I want you to bring it back here- and feed <i>ALL</i> of it to <b><i>ME!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exactly what they were expecting.</span></div></div>",

It was made very hard to do by her incredible weight. She gave up, and plopped down on the ground, causing a small tremor. She belched and ruubbed her titanic gut. \"I'm starving! If only there was somethiing around! But there's just these stupid-\" she sat up (or tried to) and took in her surroundings. A grin formed on her face. \"Hills...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She pointed her wand at the hill she was on. \"Zaa!\" A blast from the wand, then she sunk into the ground...made of cake! Wendy beamed at the enormous cake she was resting on... chocolate! With thick green icing and a lot of creamy filling. Her mouth was watering.  She looked at all the hills around her. <br>\r\n\"Zaa! Zaa, zaa! Zaa! Zaa!\"<br>\r\nShe looked at all the cakes around her. She focused on what she was resting on, then dug her face in and began biting, chewing, and swallowing. over and over. The soft moist cake was easy to compress, so she ate exponentially more than she did before. When she was an absolute blimp of food, her belly enormous and taught with flabby oversized limbs, a head, and /oh/ her boobs, each as big as her father's shell, soft and jiggly. Her massive booty. was a suitable match to her boobs, jutting out three or four feet supported by almost literal tree trunk thighs. Her calfs were flabbing out, wrapping around her ankles. Her soles were still exposed to open air, allowing them to cool in the breeze. Though, even her feet were padded by a pretty thick layer of fat, slightly restricting her abilities to curl her soles and wiggle her toes, though she could still slightly perform those tasks, as she did in place of exersise. After she'd eaten so much that she almost hurt, she looked up. She only finished one hill. she groaned and passed out.</span></div></div>",

There sat their precious little fungi tearing up amidst the ruins and crumps of her once impressive toy collection. Behind her the sticky sugar coated koopa lay snoring loudly. Quickly the couple dashed into the room to put their arms around the young sprout and comfort her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with that beast?\u201d the mother asked fearfully<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know darling, I wonder if she\u2019s a heavy sleeper\u2026\u201d the father trembled holding onto his family<br>\r\nWithout asking Sporina quickly slipped out of their embrace to prod the side of the glutted gut. Wendy let out an annoyed grumble that caused Sporina to leap back in fear but remained sound asleep. Sporina glanced back to her parents once in hesitation before stealthfully slipping up beside the large koopa girl and extracting the wand from her hand. Returning to her family\u2019s side they each exchanged glances before the father spoke out.<br>\r\n\u201cFetch the Mayor\u201d<br>\r\n===========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the entire town was lining the fence of the young couple\u2019s home and many stood in their yard gossiping. Upstairs the Mayor and several respected elders from the village stood at a safe distance from Wendy as they discussed what to do.<br>\r\n\u201cHow can we get rid of her?\u201d One of the frailer gentlemen pondered aloud<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have anywhere to hold her, we don\u2019t have a jail\u201d another chimed in<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe we should just let her leave when she\u2019s g-good ready to\u201d A fearful mushroom stammered \u201cIf we did anything to her and her uncle found out he may lead an entire army just to burn our homes down for revenge.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnless we take care of her ferr good\u201d a much gruffer elder grumbled as he leered at the sleeping glutton.<br>\r\nA short pause lapsed between the men for a few moments as they all thought over how simple that would make things.<br>\r\n\u201cNo... we can\u2019t do that\u201d The mayor sighed as did most of the men circled around him<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, what if those koopa brutes already know she\u2019s here, they\u2019ll come breaking down our doors looking for her if she doesn\u2019t return.\u201d The scared elder squawked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo not that.\u201d The Elder waved him off \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be right to take her life over a few mailboxes and some toys\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo what can we do with her?\u201d The question was raised again<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I got it!\u201d one of the younger men perked up \u201cThe reserve pound for the canal locks! It\u2019s deep enough she won\u2019t be able to climb out once we pull the ladder out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou right\u2026\u201d The mayor caught on \u201cAnd the spring thaw hasn\u2019t set in on the mountain ice so the whole thing is bone dry\u201d The Mayor held up the wand she had been terrorizing them all with just a short while ago \u201cAnd then we can give her a good lesson in humility...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess now we just have to move her\u201d<br>\r\n===========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort to wrest the softened koopa from the mushroom home. Sid along with 6 other young abled bodied fungi were able to lift the groaning bed and stuff her through the bedroom door. Wendy was still out like a light with her distended stomach putting up a lot of fuss about the heavy meal it had to process. The stairs were no longer an option but luckily the rear of the house had a small balcony on the second floor facing the backyard. It was much easier moving her through the double doors than it had been with the bedroom\u2019s but it was still a tight fit. Outside they struggled to lift her high enough to slid her off the bed and over the railing, her rotund body landing heavily on a large pad they had laid out. Wendy was still sleeping soundly enough that the short drop had not scared her awake.<br>\r\n\u201cOn three!\u201d called out a villager as a small group amassed at her side ready to push \u201cOne, two, and three, Heave!\u201d<br>\r\nThe mushrooms were able to roll Wendy\u2019s plumped body out of the yard and down to the canal, the rotating intermittent pressure on her stuffed middle squeezing out a burp every other revolution. Once there they once more worked together to push her body into the dry pit lined with mosey cobblestone. Wendy landed reasonably softly on the dirt floor and released a small puff of gas from the impact.<br>\r\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d A villager asked aloud as they all stood around the sides of the reservoir looking down at her.<br>\r\n\u201cWe should send someone to the Castle and request they send guards to assist us with the matter\u201d The Mayer nodded to a fit lean mushroom lad who typically acted as the town courier.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about in the meantime though?\u201d another scratch his head.<br>\r\n\u201cWe collect a meal for her\u201d The mayor smiled coyly \u201cAgari, take your boys down to the field we cleared out last week to plow it and being back as much of that cleared out brush and debris as you can. Everyone else return to your homes and collect your garbage. Any rubbish or clutter you\u2019d be happy to be rid of, bring it all here!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A good forty minutes later Wendy at last began to stir from her slumber. Her body felt slightly sore, she had expected her poor belly to be in some pain but all over she felt like she had been roughed up slightly. The smell of something spoiled was aggravating her smell now however and it was forcing her to break away from the alluring teat of slumber.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d Wendy groaned her body in favor of more sluggish relaxing protesting any activity \u201cOh god!\u201d She had to put a hand to her nose as the smell finally sunk in. Nearby a heap of garbage was piled up. Wendy looked around in surprise at her new surroundings; it was not the bedroom she had passed out in.<br>\r\nAs if to answer her next question a broken TV came crashing down beside the pile and made a frightening clatter. Looking up Wendy saw the mushroom\u2019s tossing junk down beside her. The broken wooden bed frame of the place she had taken her impromptu nap came down next landing awfully close to her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhatareya stupid fungus doing up there!?\u201d  Wendy shook a clawed fist angrily<br>\r\n\u201cJust making sure you had enough of our town before we let you leave!\u201d The mayor smirked from the edge of her confinement. In his hand he held the wand tapping it against his shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d Wendy looked down at her empty hands realizing what she\u2019d lost \u201cHey that\u2019s mine! Give it back right now or I\u2019ll crush you all!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be doing that!\u201d The Mayor mocked as half a couch got chucked into the growing pile. \u201cInstead I think a good dose of comeuppance is in order\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you babbling about you old geezer?!\u201d Wendy growled, her defiant demeanor quickly changed however as the Mayor lifted the wand an aimed it towards the pile. \u201cOh no! No! Don\u2019t you-\u201c<br>\r\n<i>Zaaaaa!</i><br>\r\nThe reeking pile of spoiled food and discarded refuss began to shimmer and change. Rotten fruit became steaming dumplings, used coffee grounds turned into heaps of brown sugar, soiled paper towels shifted into sliced deli meats. More and more revolting trash was zapped into mouthwatering morsels.  Broken dinnerware warped into peanut brittle, an old tire was suddenly a large gooey donut covered in sweet frosting, rusted scraps of metal were remade into soft rich fudge.<br>\r\nAbove the crowd marveled at the transformation, momentarily stopping their work to gather at the cusp of the reserve pen to gawk at the magic. Below Wendy was staring in horror at the mounting pile of treats. At least, she felt it should have been horror, really the more food that materialized before her the more her mouth watered and that was what scared her.<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s belly was still working through the overly large binge earlier but she could not deny her mounting hunger for more.  While Wendy felt the choice to indulge more was a difficult one her hunger did not. Acting for her, her body scooted closer to the pile and scooped up a sugary delight in each hand and pressed the warm soft treats into the mouth. Hand over hand she was in a rhythmic eating pace in no time. Thoughts of will power or resistance melted away with every mouthful.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s really getting into it!\u201d a young boy called out excitedly among the growing murmurs in the crowd.<br>\r\n\u201cHow can that bloated cow still be hungry after gobbling up our town?\u201d Huffed another as Wendy continued to stuff her face.<br>\r\nThe whispers were slowly drowned out by growling bellies, nearly everyone in the crowd were putting a hand to their small pale abdomen. \u201cActually\u2026 that stuff does look pretty good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAs the villagers began to lick their lips and wonder what the food that wand created may taste like a trio of young men pushed what was most of a tree that had been cut down nearby. The large dried out log was rolled into the pit before they had time to check its landing. Wendy was elbow deep into her greedy glutting wrapping a handful of beacon around a cheese burger when the log landed with a heavy splat just a few feet in front of her. The pile was flattened by the impact and a wave of frosting and cream was sent splattering in all directions. Wendy was coated in the sugary mix and caused her to pause her frenzied eating for a moment. She should have been mortified by the near miss but she just couldn\u2019t seem to care. The only new thought that entered her mind besides hunger however was a deep desire to lick up the mess around her and taste that sweet frosting.<br>\r\nAbove the villagers shared a collective gasp as the log nearly hit their captive victim but once she was safe they again began their hushed murmur about trying some of that food. The Mayor once more took aim with the wand and pointed it at the log. ZAA, the log became a very large \u00e9clair, topped in a thick rich chocolate glaze of the finest cocoa. The sweet spongy cake was moist and the inside was filled with heavy custard. Wendy and the villager\u2019s eyes grew wide just looking at it, and while the villager could only lick their lips Wendy was quick to dive on top of it chomping and tearing at the new treat. Chocolate smeared across her face with the frosting and Wendy has soon eaten her way into the center. She began nosily slurping and gobbling the custard. The more she ate the more she lost control of herself. The once prissy Koopa was now swollen with more than her fill of sweets and snorting like a pig as she rammed her face more and more into her decadent sweet.<br>\r\nThe townsfolk couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, the more they watched the more their mouths watered. The mayor wasn\u2019t any less affected so it came as no surprise to him when one of the villagers sheepishly spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026 we could use that wand a little\u201d She twisted her small foot in the dirt looking away embarrassed \u201cWe could make some sweets for ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The mayor had his reservations, the more he watched Wendy force herself to eat more and more without restraint he began to wonder if the food or even the wand itself was having some other effect on her. But his own gnawing hunger was pressing him to make a more self-indulgent choice. \u201cWe could try a little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe Mayor took aim at a grove of nearby trees and let loose the wand\u2019s power.<br>\r\n<i>Zaa<br>\r\nZaa<br>\r\nZaa</i><br>\r\nThe trees burst in bouquets of sugary junk food. Some became layered piles of bacon or ham hanging from branches and dripping grease onto the grass. Others we formed into fully cooked meals, Spaghetti and meatballs or limbs budding with pizza.<br>\r\nThe small mushrooms were awe struck by the changes and quickly rushed into the field of trees. They dove onto trunks and quickly shimmied up, sitting their tiny tushies into the branches they started picking the tree\u2019s clean. The food was everything they\u2019d had hoped it would be. Succulent juices and whipped cream dribbled down their chins. Tree after tree was picked bare as slowly swelling villager found each morsel more irresistible than the last. Back in the pic Wendy continued to force down more and more of the giant \u00e9clair, he belly was growing impossibly taunt with the endless gorging but she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to stop eating. The villagers as well began to worry they had made just a few too many trees into veritable buffet but they were just too hungry to stop or care.<br>\r\nAs the mass gluttony unfolded the heavy rumble of footsteps fell on deaf ears, they were all too blinded by stuffing their faces to notice the approaching figures.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?!\u201d a voice boomed<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At her sides were a small group of royal guards as well as one very out of breath courier.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM-miss Peach! I-I mean Princess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Mayor stammered and wiped the tomato sauce from his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe did not expect a response so quickly! M-much less for her majes-*bruuuuup*\u00e2\u0080\u009d Came a sudden expulsion and the Mayor turned beet red.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face scrunched up somewhat off put by the unorthodox greeting. Looking around many of the other villager were trying their best to stifle loud burps and other sounds of heavy binging, some even tried to remain hidden behind neighbors so they could continue picking at the tree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to stuff their faces just a bit more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just so happens your messenger encountered my royal escort through the woods on my return from Diamond City. He informed me of the incident you were dealing with and I hurried my soldiers her as quickly as we could.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peach began approaching the nearby reservoir the courier had mentioned the young koopa was trapped in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my goodness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The young princess gasped at the sight below.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOooooooh uh *Oooorp* *hurk* uuuuuuuh *bruuuuuup*\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nWendy had finally reached her limits. Her belly had distended so far she was having trouble moving forward. Her legs were weak from the frenzied gluttony and even if she could manage to push herself forward she was unable to gain any traction. The koopa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs tried to push helplessly at the ground but slid through the smeared greasy meats and smashed pastries. Not able to move she just swiped at what she could reach and licked her claws clean, everything from the original pile and the large \u00c3\u00a9clair that was less than an arm length from her was scratched clean. Wendy now just moaned in pain. Unable to get anymore she let herself relax and try to rest but the uncomfortable pressure of being on top her packed gut was like torture.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goodness get her out of there before she pops herself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peach cried out and turned to the villagers who had tried to quietly resume eating \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomeone needs to explain what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened right now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n=====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Peach was appraised of the situation. The wand, Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assault and subsequent punishment, the amazing food, all of it. As she sat and listened the guards placed boards into the pit to make a ramp and tried to roll the poor doughy girl up it. Upon flopping her onto her side to line her up with the ramp a few unlucky men were greeted with an unintentional blast of gas from the porky koopa, a side effect of how taxed her digestive system was. With a great deal of struggling the guards slowly moved her up the makeshift ramp despite creaks and groans from the wood. As with before the revolutions forced loud burps and groans from Wendy as the rotating pressure kept forcing them out.<br>\r\nBy time she was out she had developed a terrible case of hiccups she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHic\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.Hic\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Hic\u00e2\u0080\u009d in rhythmic timing. She was rolled into the back of a truck still expelling burps and hiccups. Peach confiscated the wand as well unsure what to do with it she at least knew it was not to be left with the village. Peach gave the villagers a stern lecture about their treatment of the young bratty girl but decided the long night of indigestion they all had ahead of them would be punishment enough.<br>\r\nThe guards loaded up their escort with the erupting Koopa being carted in the back of a truck following close behind. As they pulled away Peach took one last look back at her subjects and then turned her attention to the wand in her hand. She looked it over several times as her mind weighed with the events that had unfolded.<br>\r\n=====================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A terrifying growl bellowed through the halls of Bowser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Keep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKamek!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bowser roared as he kicked in a large set of heavy doors. Bowser marched into hall reserved for the magikoopa division of his army. Behind him a bloated migikoopa girl kicked and whined being carried by two guards. Bower was furious, one of Kamek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adepts had shown no respect or obedience to the king koopa. Upon Bowser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order to shut up after having her wand taken away the girl had refused and became quite agitated by the loss, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until Bowser gave her a reason to be afraid of him that she finally stopped her bawling and told him what was going on. Her story prove to be true the moment Bowser saw the state of his once proud magikoopa forces. Lazy and slothful, untrained and disobedient. The entire hall was a mess, food and trash was everywhere. Bowser cast a stern stare through the magikoopa that were present. Many were so over fed their robes were in tatters. Some weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even trained in the art of magic yet, all over the hall Bowser could see acolytes he had assigned to the magikoopa forces months ago and none of them had earned their magic robes yet. The entire discipline system of his magical forces had broken down. At the far end of the hall Bowser spotted Kamek, around him 4 chubby koopa girls dressed in gear not much unlike a sultan may dress his harem in giggled and kneeled beside The head of the magikoopa forces feeding him slabs of thick meat and a stein of frothy ale. Kamek was an obese blob, the worst of all his fellow magikoopa Kamek was leading by example. The girls around him, acolytes that had traded in their practice tunics to move up the ranks the easy way dotted and fawned over Kamek bringing him more Turkish delight to gobble up after taking their own hungry bites out of the endless parade of food.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKamek you have about twenty second to explain what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened to my magic army before I sink my teeth into <b>you</b>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her roared so hard a geyser of fire erupted in front of him and made the air around Kamek very hot. Kamek already coated with sweat began to look like he was melting from the amount of perpetration now flowing off him.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cB-bowser!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he choked on a piece of chocolate \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy l-lord! How are you doing tod-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSave it you fat pig!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He growled \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened here?! Why is my magikoopa army looking like a pod of whales?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cW-well you see Lord Bowser we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, um, experimenting with a new enchantment on our wands for some time now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kamek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face beaded with sweat and where he had been drooling over food just a moment ago his mouth was very dry now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just getting accustomed to them you see, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to let our studies slack quite so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperiment? New enchants? Kamek you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve turned into a blimp and from the looks of it not a single new recruit has been trained at all.

Once they were all in Bowser lifted a big stone statue of himself and effortlessly placed it on top the cauldron so that no one could get the wands back.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs of this moment the magikoopa forces of the Bowser army are hereby disbanded until further notice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He grumbled.

Bowser followed in and gave Kamek a swift kick to his wide read to hurry him along. Once they were all out Bowser took one last look towards the contaner of wands and furrowed his brow before closing and locking the doors to his magic hall. Something fishy was going on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But mostly, she just liked annoying the hell out of people, and to Link's chagrin, she was stuck with him. \"Man, why the hell are you soooo slow, wolfie? I can walk faster than you can run!\" As they galloped through the forest, Link shot her a mean look. \"Don't think I will though, obviously.\" Before Link could make any protest, with a slap of her brightly colored hair, she slapped his backside and sent him further running. She had a very 'hands on' approach to dealing with people. This continued for some time, with many a comment about wolf Link's slowness, and then a slap before he could do anything more. Midna simply laid back on his back with a massive grin on her face, thinking about how great it was to be in control again. It's not like she hated him either; quite the opposite, but she wasn't sure if anybody, even in the Twilight Realm, ever quite understood her brash personality. Still, working away at wolfie here would soon break him down to leave him for the picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether Link had any idea about this is a mystery. Yet after the fifty-th butt slapping and ear tickle in the past hour, he'd had about enough touching from the little minx. So, without warning, he transforms back into his human form, and pins the little imp down with his foot. \"Wha-wha wait! What're you doing!\" Link points a finger at her, yet before he can say anything, Midna quickly grins. \"Wait, nevermind-\" Link suddenly reverted back into his wolf form, and Midna hoped on, butt first and hard. \"I don't have to let you change back at all! Now, what would be a suitable punishment for you, aye Link? Seeing as you find me so uncomfortable to carry...\" Thinking hard as her hair pinned Link down from thrashing, she came to a solution. \"Maybe if I 'cushion out' a bit, then you'd find me more comfortable to tag along?\" Midna said, a huge smirk appearing across her face. As she started to stroll around Link, her hair stretching to peg him down, she sighed a bit, and felt her entire body down in front of him. \"Well, I guess I am kinda skinny. What'd you say, Wolfie? Having to carry a couple more hundred pounds of wonderful cute me punishment enough for acting like that to me? Well whatever, I don't care about your opinion either way.\" Turning her back to him, she started to ponder just how she'd managed to rack up enough weight to pin him down. Didn't matter if it didn't work in the end anyway; Midna had one hell of a self-indulgent personality anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a moment spent pondering, she decided... </span></div></div>",

Eating all of the chocolate pudding in the world without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'More... more... so... good...\" she thought as she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have stayed like that forever, and maybe she would have if she didn't hear a wet 'Splodge' and a sudden wet feeling on her midsection.

Then, all of a sudden, she gasped as she looked in the reflection of her ship. Firstly, she had changed drastically. Not that she was messy but her body. Her stomach was now big, round and bloated... it wasn't like she was bloated but it was pure fat as it seemed; round and sagging over her thighs, succumbing to the attack of gravity. Samus wrinkled her nose in disgust at the large orb attached to her front. It sloashed when she tried to move and the six rolls on her sides flapped up and down. As if she couldn't believe it, she pinched the jutting flesh underneath her zero suit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys at home won't believe this...\" Samus muttered as she lifted up her belly in order for her to see her feet. For the longest time, her boobs were the biggest part of her... obviously not the case now. \"No more eating for me... and a clean up is needed.\" she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blonde hair was drenched in chocolate, her hands and knees as well as her feet were pudding covered and her new flabby belly was just sticky. Samus tried to rub it off but as she was unaccustomed to its size, she couldn't wipe off a lot. \"That's it... seriously. I better get some excercise as I fix the ship...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as her tummy grumbled, she realized she was still hungry. Starving in fact.

Ash just ignored the look as he reached back into basket and pull out a bag fulled with cookies Misty had packed. Misty opened her mouth to yell at him, but was stopped short when Ash put one of the cookies in her mouth. Misty, now in shock, ate the moist and gooey treat but the moment she have finished it another one was waiting in front of her mouth. Misty relaxed as Ash fed her cookie after cookie, slowly she dropped down so she was resting on her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the cookies were gone and Ash pulled out a bag of Cheetos. Misty frowned a little because her sweet tooth wanted more cookies but she complied anyway. Ash's mind was spinning as they continued. Ash had always found Misty attractive but this was driving him crazy. In the six years he had her, he had never seen her like this, so vulnerable and open. She was always such a controlled person except when her temper got the better of her. Reaching into the bag only to find empty, he looked back up at her. Belly stomach was visible stuffed, it was bigger than with they had started. It was then he realize she was not the same girl that she was when they were ten. She was a woman, her bust was easily a C, her hips were more womanly, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash! Hey, earth to Ash,\" Misty snapped at him as he come out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe when chuckled nervously before said,\"Sorry about that Myst, I spaced out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just grinned at him,\"I could see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty tired to sit up, but found that she was to stuffed to do so. So she stayed on her elbows and tried to play it off as nothing. Hey belly hurt but she couldn't rub it because then she would be completely on her back. Ash noticed her breathing was heavier, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was it you wanted to talked to me about?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parent are coming home and my sisters are too busy to help me get the house ready so I was wondering if you should help out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just smiled,\"Of course, I'll help. Hey, Myst, are you okay. You look really uncomfortable.\" The pain in Misty's stuffed stomach was getting worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am fine,\" she lied. Ash gave a stern because he know she was lying. Misty avoided his gaze up until she felt his hand on her belly. She instantly turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just grinned as he began move his hand in a circle on belly. Misty face lit in embarrassment as he did this. She was going to stop him when she realize the position she was in. If she moved hand to stop she would flat on her back with him practically on top of her. She was completely trapped so she let him continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when doing you parents get here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a week?\" she replied in a whisper. It was becoming hard and hard to focus. The pain was slowly lessening. Soon Ash's other hand joined in and the rubbing turn to kneading. Ash was shock at how soft she felt. Her stomach was warm in his hands as he continued kneading her soft stomach. Misty's eyes were closed and her head was tilt back slightly. A soft, content moan passed through her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ash's mind, hundreds of alarm were going off, but continued anyway. Slowly coming to a stop and</span></div></div>",

Blinking a couple of times as her eyes readjusted to her surrounding before looking up at Ash with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting late, we should probably get going,\" he said as he offered her a hand. Misty shifted into a sitting position before taking Ash's hand. With one swift motion, he pulled her to her feet.

And with that she decided it was somehow his fault. Ash on the other hand,'Damn what the hell was that. Why the hell did I do that? grrrr,' Ash thought, smartly agreeing with Misty. 'This was a one time flux, we are friends, FRIENDS.' He thought for a moment.

Well, she had gotten an order for an absolutely insane amount of pizzas...apparently, there was some enormous party going on (that she hadn't been invited to...alas), and they had ordered enough pizza to feed an army. Because of that, Mona had hitched a small caravan of three enormous trailers to her wee little moped, each of the trailers chock full of the world's most delicious pizza. It was a credit to her absurdly powerful little moped that it still blazed past the land like a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she merrily drove, looking forward to receiving the massive payment that awaited her upon delivery (to say nothing of the tip), she began to happily sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here is Mona Pizza!<br>\r\nMakers of the world's best eatsa!<br>\r\nFresh sauce and cheese galore,<br>\r\nBrought straight to your front door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis here is Mona Pizza!<br>\r\nMakers of all tasty treatsa!<br>\r\nOur pie's crispy, crunchy crust,<br>\r\nLeaves others in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrab a hot slice and take a big bite!<br>\r\nIt's so good that you'll start a fight,<br>\r\nFor more MONA PIZZAAAAAA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she clenched her eyes shut, and rose her voice into a beautiful crescendo...managing to entirely miss the fact that there was an enormous pothole dead ahead, which she was fast approaching. So, her moped dipped into it mightily, sending the trailers crashing into the back of it, launching it ahead violently, and causing a mightily impressive crash that tumbled on for quite a while, consisting of moped, trailers, and one very startled but unharmed Mona. Eventually, they all came to a stop. Mona got up to her feet wearily, and dusted herself off as she approached her moped..which was now short one wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...crap.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surveyed the rest of the crash site. The trailers were all intact, and she could see her moped's missing wheel laying in the grass a few dozen feet away, looking rather lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" she grunted as she sat down on the ground, and drew out her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hey, Joe? Yeah, it's Mona. I got into a crash on the way to the-...no, no, I'm okay. My moped's banged up pretty bad, though. Any chance you could send someone down here to pick me up, and finish the delivery?...awesome! Thanks, Joe. How long until-?...AN HOUR AND A HALF!?...no, no, I'll be okay that long, I guess. Alright, seeya soon. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona sighed as she clicked her phone shut. This day had taken a rather amazing turn for the worse. As she sat feeling sorry for herself, she found herself eyeballing the trailers full of pizza, and she realized that she was hungry, and furthermore, just wanted some comfort food after her frightening ordeal. Surely, the people wouldn't miss just one pizza (...or two...or...) from the whole enormous order?...but then again, eating the pizza that you yourself are supposed to be delivering is a cardinal sin in the industry. What to do?</span></div></div>",

So, determined to make the order in on time, she walked to the side of the road and started to hold her thumb out. After a few minutes, a large truck slowed down, right next to Mona and her trailers. \u201cGreat! Large enough to fit the entire order!\u201d Happy she was going to be able to preserve the restaurant\u2019s rep, Mona took a peek into the window. \u201cSo, is it okay if I move these small trailers into the back of your truck?\u201d The man at the wheel turned slowly towards her and with a waggle of his eyebrows, a glance that-definitely-wasn\u2019t-a-glance-at-her-boobs gave her a toothy smirk. Or kinda toothy anyway: He lacked more than a good few teeth. \u201cSure, you little pretty \u2018thing. 18?\u201d Mona may\u2019ve been into \u2018weird\u2019 stuff, and had the hots for a guy who had the honour of being considered both the most ill-tempered and unhygienic Mario look-alike in town, but she sure as hell wasn\u2019t stupid. \u201c\u2026 Ahhh, screw the whole thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIVE EXCITING MINUTES LATER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally pushing all of the trailers far enough off the road, she started to raise up each door, grumbling to herself. *Hell, this isn\u2019t even the \u2018resist\u2019 option anyway. Why the hell did I even have to meet that creep?* \u201cNow, where were we? Oh yes, \u2018saving my restaurant\u2019s reputation\u2026 Heh\u2026\u201d She laid down and opening a pizza box, folded the entire pie into a small enough piece to fit into her mouth. \u201cGawpth thispth stutfhp is the bestpth!\u201d With a full mouth, to no one in particular. Opening another box, she started to lick her lips and took a quick grab at a piece. \u201cGawd, I didn\u2019t even realize how hungry I was! Or how addictive my own food was! Then again, I\u2019ve never really tried it myself\u2026\u201d As she grabbed at each chessy slice, she felt it collect in her stomach, which started to swell and swell. Noticing one of two dozen kegs in the current trailer she was in, she took a hose and started to guzzle it down, massaging her still inflating stomach. \u201cMan, this is the life!\u201d As this pizza binge continued, she started to find herself drifting more and more out of consciousness. And then, as she took a bite out of her fifth pizza, she fell asleep, her head laying down on a couple still hot slices, cheese collecting in huge clumps in her hair. \u201cMmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally came to, she noticed that she was lying on a somewhat more comfortable surface. \u201cHmm? I don\u2019t remember bringing a pillow\u2026\u201d As she started to open her eyes wider, she suddenly realised that her favourite, loose furcoat wasn\u2019t so loose any more. Quickly taking it off, she realised her arms were now saggy. But that wasn\u2019t all; her stomach hung out a good foot longer than it used to\u2026 Which wasn\u2019t at all originally. Her breasts now started to overflow from her top, her butt pressed tightly against her miniskirt while her panties rode up her crack like a g-string, and her thighs were half as wide as the trailer. She could literally see the dimples all over her butt and legs. Taking all of this in, a huge grin appeared on Mona\u2019s face, and before she could contain it, she burst out laughing. \u201cAhahaha, can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t see THIS happening earlier. Well, I didn\u2019t, but whatever. Man, I\u2019m a pig! Oink!\u201d She started to make a couple piggish sounds, giggling madly at her own imitations. Yeah... She definitely could see why somebody who would find themselves gaining 200lb in fat hilarious was in charge of making the WEIRD-genre games. \u201cAhh\u2026 But anyway, this isn\u2019t a problem. Besides living in a society where all people, no matter their differences are judged more on their personal value rather than their appearance, I can easily get everybody else to look like this! Or at least, everybody back at Ware Inc. anyhow.\u201d She suddenly became aware of something. \u201cThough\u2026 Who the hell am I talking to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can answer that!\u201d Walking into plain sight of the trailer was\u2026</span></div></div>",

You realize that you're fat now, right?\" She added, though there was nary a trace of concern in her voice. \"Obviously, and it's not like it's much of a big deal that I've put on some weight.\" Mona retorted, a bit unnerved by Ashley's bluntness. Ashley gave a quick glance at Mona\u2019s ballooned belly. \u201cLooks more less like \u2018some\u2019 weight and more \u2018a couple hundred pounds\u2019 to me.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing stopping me from losing all of it!\u201d Mona was starting to get flustered by the girl, even if she was only pointing out an obvious truth. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019ve cut through two pizza pies since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking herself up, Ashley started to pace, apparently oblivious that she had just missed being slammed by a very flabby arm in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re in debt for me now, though I\u2019ll think of what I\u2019ll need you for later. For now-\u201c \u201cWait\u2026 What?

She opened wide and ate, giggling as Ashley\u2019s hands stuffed all of it into her greedy mouth. Opening her mouth to thank her, she instead burped loudly into the teen\u2019s face. \u201cThat settles it then. I\u2019ll feed this entire stock to you, and you help me out afterwards.\u201d Ashley said, a small smile appearing from Mona\u2019s gas attack. \u201cWell\u2026 Alright, I\u2019ll admit you\u2019re a good feeder.\u201d Loosening her belt and taking off her fur coat, she left herself in even more skimpy attire. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hungry as all hell still.\u201d Ashley turns around and takes an even larger piece of melting pizza too Mona, who grins perkily as it makes its way to her face. Mentally, Mona felt there was no harm letting Ashley feed her. While she\u2019d normally be suspicious as to what kind of plot she\u2019d need another plump teenager for, she was damn good at making her comfortable.

Then she grabbed a bottle of soda and held it to Mona's lips. \"Eh, Ashley, I can easily hold a bottle myself.\" Ashley shoved it in anyway with a sly grin as she sat down on Mona's thick legs. \"It's funner this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mona didn't suspect anything *too* out of the ordinary... Sans Ashley getting really, really fresh with her. Letting out a quick belch as Ashley drew away an empty bottle she leaned upwards. \"So why exactly were you so eager to feed me again?\" The witch girl merely shoved even more pizza's into her mouth, as Mona's eyes went up in bliss. \"Bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, the witch girl picked herself up and eyed the rest of the trailer. \"Ugh, this is taking too long... Mona, could you open your mouth really quickly?\" Mona paused for a moment. \"W-\" The second she opened her mouth, she was thrown into the side of the trailer, a thundering amount of cheese, crust and toppings gushing into her mouth and straight into her stomach. After a few seconds, the pain knocked her out, the last thing she saw Ashley standing over her with a blank expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally came too, she noticed it was dark out. And that the trailer was empty, with Ashley nowhere in sight. Picking herself up... Wait, she couldn't even do that. She looked down to see a large pile of oozing substance for several metres in front of her, piling up on the other side of the trailer. She looked either side; her entire body took up all of the trailer, yet where she was sitting was where most of the fat was congregated. \"Oh dear...\" She craned her neck to look around, yet a wave of sweat erupted with the smallest movement. \"... Ashley? You there?\" All she could see was the tattered remains of her clothes and underwear. She heard a muffled response. \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her belly erupted Ashley's head, with a rare smile. \"You've been an excellent test subject Mona! You have no idea how long it's been since I've successfully pulled a successful spell of this magnitude! Normally it gets all fiddly in the middle and winds up failing miserably, but-\" Mona interrupted, both angry and surprised at Ashley's out of character liveliness. \"Why the HELL would you have to know how to blimp a person up? And why me of all people?\" \"Easiest test subject; you work at a pizzeria. It'd was easy to ring up a phony order of gargantuan proportions and tamper with your scooter so you'd break down... Though that creepy truck driver was entirely unplanned.\" Mona relaxed a bit- with all her anger, it was surprising just how little of it was about her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still manipulative! What're you gonna do with me now! Turn me back? I can't do anything in this size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled a bit. \"Aww, but you make a great bean bag chair! Don't worry, I'll take you back home in this trailer thing... I'm not entirely heartless afterall\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And you'll turn me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely grinned a bit. \"...

It\u2019s THAT bad.\u201d She mumbled. Suddenly, she heard the faint sound of laughter, and quickly found its source: two kids, probably about her age, a boy and a girl laughing as he ran around with her on her shoulders.

Then suddenly it hit her. \u201cRed.\u201d Caught unaware, Red quickly yelped in surprise, being easy to excite. \u201cUm, yes Ashley?\u201d Ashley paused and bit her lip, yet eventually responded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get me a boyfriend.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But I don\u2019t get what the problem is. If the guy\u2019s into the same stuff I am, I don\u2019t really care if he\u2019s popular, outgoing or active and what not.\u201d She gave Red a look which made him gulp a bit. A look of brewing idyllic mischief. \u201cI mean, it won\u2019t matter when he\u2019s locked up in my bedroom. Not much use for a boyfriend outside of THAT department.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering her broom, she stopped outside what Red told her would be the haven for her type. A video game shop. Walking in, she\u2019s greeted by aisles upon aisles of brightly coloured boxes, with boys with almost zombie like stares playing amongst the large series of TV\u2019s. \u201cWell, this should be easy. Half these guys are dressed even weirder than me.\u201d Ashley mused to herself, before strolling along. Before she could get far, Ashley felt a tap on a shoulder and looked around, having to look down. \u201cHi Ashley! Man, funny seeing you here! Or anywhere other than your house for that matter!\u201d A bouncy 9-Volt said, holding half a dozen game boxes in one hand. \u201cOh. Hello.\u201d Kneeling down to his own height, Ashley began to lower her tone. \u201cYou can help me. Which one of these boys here would be willing to\u2026 Um\u2026 Date? That\u2019s the term, yeah, \u2018date\u2019 me?\u201d 9-Volt gave a surprised look, yet then a grin formed on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I hate icky stuff like dating, but we\u2019re friends so I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d He quickly led her to a distant corner of the shop and pointed at a tall kid in dark clothing, idly staring at a game box. \u201cHe may seem \u2018tough\u2019 on the outside, but you\u2019ll find that he\u2019s actually really into geeky culture and really friendly if he trusts. Really seems your type.\u201d Ashley had a quick look around. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one?\u201d She asked. \u201cNah, most here would date you, they\u2019re really desperate, including this guy. Just that he\u2019s one of the few who won\u2019t totally creep you out. Yo, Tyler!\u201d 9-Volt called out, and the initially solemn figure became brighter when he turned around. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you! How\u2019s it going little bro?\u201d Turning to see Ashley, his smile faded. \u201cOh. Who\u2019s this friend of yours?\u201d \u201cAshley. Okay, that\u2019s pleasantries out of the way, does that make him my boyfriend now 9-Volt?\u201d Tyler stepped back a bit, somewhat confused. \u201cIs this some kind of pr-\u201c \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s just really blunt. And apparently needs a boyfriend ASAP.\u201d His face lit up. \u201cWell, the Tyler-nator is always available for a dark girl like you- WHA\u201d With the mention of the word \u2018available\u2019, quickly grabbed his arm, nodded towards 9-Volt as a sign of thanks and ran out the shop, hopping on her broom and flying off with Tyler behind her.</span></div></div>",

Unless I got the wrong impression, I\u2019m your type anyway, so just go with the flow\u2026 Tyler?\u201d \u201cUm, yeah.\u201d \u201cFantastic, we know each other so well.\u201d Finally landing at the mansion, she quickly hurries him into the main hall. \u201cWell, that\u2019s that over. Now Tyler, as a boyfriend, what do you generally do with your partner?\u201d Ashley said, slowly lying back in a chair. Everything was happening far too fast for the boy, and while it may\u2019ve been more or less a dream come true, he was still somewhat disoriented. Yet this was an opening to good to miss, if she was as oblivious as she seemed. \u201cWell\u2026 Generally, the man has some \u2018fun\u2019 time with the girl\u2026 You get me?\u201d A smile appeared on Ashley\u2019s face. Socially awkward, yet by no means stupid. \u201cOooh\u2026 Sex, right? THAT\u2019S the point of a relationship. Thought as much.\u201d Before saying another word, she quickly raised a hand and pointed at him. With that, Tyler\u2019s eyes turned blank. \u201cWell, this should be fun. Well Tyler, you know what I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Tyler had been forced to pleasure Ashley for several hours on end, even after he\u2019d climaxed. All it took was some more hocus pokus to keep him going. Finally composing herself together, Ashley got up and sat on her stairs, only now aware they had just been screwing each other all over the entrance. \u201cMeh, I\u2019m the only one who lives here.\u201d She glanced at Tyler, who simply stood there, motionless. \u201cOnly one who isn\u2019t brainwashed at any rate.\u201d She added, giggling a bit. She strolled over to Tyler and started to talk to his new, braindead form. \u201cNow, to make the next time even better, you\u2019re going to tell me what you find attractive in a girl the most. The more I match that preference, the better the next session\u2019ll be.\u201d She stood there for a few seconds, before he finally spoke. \u201cFat.\u201d \u201c\u2026 What? Specify, idiot.\u201d \u201cLot\u2019s, and lot\u2019s of fat.\u201d Ashley was taken aback, yet thought over his comment. \u201cAs in fat girls?\u201d She looked over herself and realized she was pretty damn skinny. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s what it takes, then fine then\u2026 Anything reeeeeallly specific?\u201d Ashley asked one last time, confused as to why she had never heard this come up before from Red. \u201cFat as possible. Fatter even.\u201d He said flately, still staring off into space. \u201cWell, that\u2019s it then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, she looked around the refrigerator, yet found hardly anything to eat. \u201cReeeed!\u201d She called upstairs. \u201cYou\u2019re ordering some food for me\u2026. Lot\u2019s, and LOT\u2019S of food! NOW!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of carousing filled the sea air as the S.S. Teacup pulled into the newly rebuilt Syrup Castle and unloaded her cargo. The crew was carrying gold and jewels by the cartload, along with crates of exotic fruit and barrels and casks of rum and wine. But the largest piece of treasure was a massive statue, that had to be carried by thirty of the Teacup's strongest hands. It was a strange thing, depicting a goddess sitting crosslegged, beautiful but enormously fat, bearing multiple arms that grasped various foodstuffs, and two arms that made a scoop that would serve well as a seat. It was made entirely out of gold, and encrusted with jewels. Glittering sapphires were set into the eyes, and a ruby the size of the average human head was set into the navel, possibly to represent a piercing. Overseeing the moving of the glittering behemoth was none other than the ruthless, greedy, lovely Captain Syrup. As she gazed at its golden splendor, she thought of the curious manner on which they discovered it. On the way back from a raid on a Pianta cruise ship, the lookout noticed a small island shrine that nobody had noticed before, despite their knowledge of the sea. Intrigued, Syrup set their heading there, and found the statue within the depths of the decaying stone shrine, along with a great bevy of plunder. After taking a minute to recover from the fainting spell that gazing upon such a glorious prize brought on, she ordered the crew to begin loading everything up. And now here they were. The Captain had announced a massive party to celebrate this unexpected find, and as soon as everything had been put into proper storage. The treasure went to the vaults, the food went to the kitchen and pantry, and the statue went to the spacious main hall where she intended to use it as a throne during the proceedings. Soon a great and boisterous party was set up. A great table was set, and massive barrels of every available drink were rolled out and tapped. There was no shortage of food; Captain Syrup had ordered her chefs to put all their knowledge to bear and cook up a storm of delicious dishes of every shape and size. Before anyone ate, the Captain raised a massive flagon and raised a toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AVAST, YE HEARTIES, WAIT A DAMN MINUTE. I got somethin' to say. This here is the damned finest haul ever since that giant golden statue we plundered from the Mushroom Kingdom... And this time, we ain't losin' this haul. So let's CELEBRATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone roared in agreement, as they knocked glasses and drank deeply. For one moment, the eyes of the statue seemed to gleam, but everyone was far too lost in consumption to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party went on long into the night. So long in fact, that most of the crew, Captain Syrup included, had simply fallen asleep at the table, lulled by drink and full stomachs. Syrup stirred, as the eyes of the statue began to glow...</span></div></div>",

A rather large box of a dozen donuts, with an also quite large paper cup next to it- the cup smelled like it was filled with hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? How did this stuff get here?\" Isabelle wondered out loud, before taking a closer look and seeing a note stuck on to the box. The note said 'for Isabelle, Be in soon, hope you enjoy! -from Mayor'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle chuckled to herself. \"Hehehe- aw, isn't that sweet.\" She sat down at her desk, taking one of the donuts and starting to eat as she began to get a little work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went on, Isabelle was mainly focusing on the files she was sorting through and making notes on and forms she was filling out, that she didn't pay much attention to how she was filling out herself. After finishing one donut, she'd idly take another- intending to only have two...or maybe three. After all, they were especially tasty donuts- Heavily glazed with rich frosting, large and thick enough for each one to be savored. Breaking it up with sips of hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, as Isabelle's paw reached for another one- she found nothing, and realized with a start she'd eaten all 12, finishing off the substantially sized hot chocolate to boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ohhh darn it-\" Isabelle said, sighing. Part of her was disappointed because she wished there was more, but as she placed a paw gently on her tummy, feeling that slight bloat as the waistline of her skirt hugged her a bit more snugly than before, she was relieved there weren't more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I need to be more careful not to get carried away...\" She mused, as she closed the empty box, and put it and the empty cup off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after she polished off her little treat, the Mayor arrived- running in with a big smile on their face. Isabelle immediately perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Mayor!\" She said, cheerily. \"How are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good- but Isabelle! Guess what?\" The mayor said, walking up to her desk, visibly excited. \"A brand new restaurant opened up in town!\" They announced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle blinked, a little bit surprised. \"Oh! A new restaurant?\" She looked down at her desk, quickly flipping through the papers, searching for anything about that. \"I don't remember doing the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did the paperwork for it.\" The mayor said, \"You already do so much paperwork, I figured I should take up one or two things myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle looked up, then smiled. \"Oh- wow! That's very responsible of you mayor! But, you do so much work for the town already- You don't have to worry about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know,\" the mayor cut her off. \"But, Isabelle- about this new restaurant...\"</span></div></div>",

Why not?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They still need a final go ahead from a health inspector.\" The mayor said. \"It's a relatively new safety policy. And well- we haven't exactly got anyone assigned to that position. I was thinking, do you think you could do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was taken aback, \"Me?\" she asked. \"But Mayor, I have a lot to do here in town hall, I don't know if I can make time for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that-\" the Mayor reassured her, \"I can do the work in here while you go out! After all, you have the technical qualifications to greenlight them. All you'd have to do is go out there, check that their kitchen is clean, sample some of their food to make sure it's alright, and then sign off on it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle was still apprehensive, but- she was hardly a dog to turn down a job she needed to do. \"Well...alright, if they need me to open.\" She said, getting up, fixing her skirt- which was still a bit snug around her subtly bloated looking belly. \"Are you sure you'll be alright here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course! I know what I'm doing, I'm still a legal official after all.\"  The Mayor answered. \"Thanks so much for doing this Isabelle- you'll find the restaurant just a bit south of the Barbershop! Have a nice time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do my best!\" Isabelle replied, gathering up a clipboard and pen with the appropriate documents to sign for an impromptu health inspection, and was on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went, she regretted eating all those donuts earlier- she was still fairly full, and now she'd have to do a job involving sampling more food? She just hoped they wouldn't have a menu too expansive...even though, unbeknownst to her, that was exactly what the Mayor had liked about this place, and why he chose to send her. That and the large portion sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isabelle arrived, she was able to see that the restaurant was...</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to delay her next cake feast, however, she began trying to move the box. Pushing and shoving with all her might, all she was doing was making herself jiggle and quake. But after some miracle, she finally got the cube onto the red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Took you long enough, Fatso. You look like you burned a couple calories during the practice test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'REALLY?!? THIS WAS PRACTICE' Chell mentally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry though, we'll get them back in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA table extended from the floor, revealing a creamy (and not to mention fattening) looking carrot cake. Not wasting any time, Chell dug her hands into the cake, shoving golb after glob of the desert into her waiting maw. The camera above the door behind her documented all of it, viewing her already round belly filling out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, do you think you could eat any faster?\" GLaDOS asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell didn't mind the comment, though, as she finished the last bit of the cake. She had grown noticeably fatter, her belly almost starting to form a second roll. Her derriere stuck out a few more inches behind her, the not-so-flattering jumpsuit clinging to her rump and showing off every bump and dimple of cellulite. Her thighs and hips grew along with, giving the Test Subject a nice, plump pear shape. Her breasts grew a bit, too, each orb sitting gracefully on her belly at about an E cup. Just behind her massive mammaries, her back fat had been condensed into a plump roll just above her luscious love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell sighed, leaning against the cake-spattered table, and gave her gut a smack. The impact caused, not only her belly, but almost her whole body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done yet, fat ass?\" Chell nodded her head in response. \"Good, because you were supposed to be in the next chamber 15 minutes ago. Now get your 234 pounds body into the elevator. Hopefully it'll be able to heft your lard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell walked into to the, now open, elevator. The door closed and she started going down.

Go get it, Tubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell turned the corner and saw a huge LED sign light up. \"01\". At the bottom, several warning icons were grayed out. One looked like a figure drowning and being electrocuted. Another was being shot by some sort of turret. But the only one lit up was in the corner. It was a fat female stick figure by a slice of cake. Just seeing the icon made her mouth water. But back to the test, Chell saw, in some sort of pit, a pedestal holding a laser gun thingy. It rotated 90 degrees and fired a blue bolt out the front end, landing on the far wall and making a blue vortex-like thing where it landed. She dropped into the pit, jiggling wildly as she landed, and removed the device from the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device I was talking about a minute ago, but that's probably too much for you to say, so lets just call it the Portal Gun. This is a dumbed down version. While the fully functional device can create two vortices, this version can only make one. Try shooting it somewhere, Lard Ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell stuck her tongue out rebelliously, but complied. She mounted the device on her arm and pulled the trigger. Like before a blue vortex opened on the point of impact, this time revealing a room with a circular door like before. Cautiously, she walked through the aperture in the wall, and went through unharmed. On the other side was a table with a vanilla cake waiting for her. She dropped the gun carelessly on the floor and began stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattening effects came even quicker this time, adding pound after pound of adipose with each bite of cake. Her face grew even more cherubic, her double chin puffing up. Just below, her boobs were growing, passing a couple more cup sizes. Chell's belly grew after every bite, her gut having split into rolls, and her juicy love handles and back fat filling out. Her biggest assets were in her lower half, though. Her hips grew ever wider and her thighs grew ever thicker. Her ass was huge now, the seams in her jumpsuit beginning to split. Each colossal globe of fat was just a little smaller than a beach ball, and it jiggled in her spandex jumpsuit almost constantly. Chell craned her neck mid-bite to see how much her lower body had grown. She didn't know if it was disgust or pleasure when she saw her badonkadonk, but either way, she gave it a jiggle and a slap and went back to the cake. She saw that there was also a tall glass of chocolate milk on the table. She grabbed it and started drinking. Contrary to her usually quiet self, she let out a tiny moan of pleasure. 'HOLY **** THIS IS AMAZING' Chugging the heavenly milk, she could feel her body filling with fat even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know all that is going to go straight to your ass.\" GLaDOS remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the milk and the cake, Chell felt like a beached whale. A very fat and happy beached whale. \"Well congratulations, you reached 296 pounds on the first test. I don't know of you deserve a medal or a YMCA pass. Either way get the Portal Gun and enter the Chamber Lock. If you can fit, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting her heavier self up, she bent over and grabbed the gun off the ground. A mechanical hand came from the ceiling and gave her ass a hard slap, making her jiggle and blush profusely. \"Sorry. I couldn't resist.\" A deep blush covering her pudgy face, Chell entered the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door closed...</span></div></div>",

If our hefty heroine could speak, she'd probably be yelling now. Out of fear or hunger, I'm not sure. Some time passed and finally the elevator started making noise, but instead of moving or opening the door, the panel she was standing on started receding. Left with no choice, she jumped off into the elevator shaft, knowing that her long fall boots (a concept that was DEFINATELY explained to her) would save her. She finally landed, causing her great girth to jiggle for a good minute. Looking around, she saw she had ended up in a huge, beat up room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The hell?' The room looked semi-similar to the rooms she'd been testing and feasting in, with paneling on the floors and walls, a casette camera pointed straight at her and a giant sign that said \"Test Chamber 01\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a man's voice came over the intercom. \"Caroline is this thing on? Good. Hello Test Subject! I'm Cave Johnson! Founder AND CEO of Aperture Science Innovators. And I would like to thank you for participating in this test. Not a whole lot of people signed up for this one, they all wanted to try the Wormhole Device and the Gels. But, at least you won't be incinerated, electrocuted, poisoned, crushed, stabbed, shot or eaten by rabid moles. You MIGHT explode though. Its on the waiver I'm sure you signed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who is this guy?' Chell pondered as she rubbed her belly in thought. 'He sounds like a nutcase.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok. So my assistant just told me there is no waiver, but I'm sure you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, no. Whatever this is, I'm not doing it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been using gels for awhile now, but none of us have bothered to try and eat it. That's where you come in. We're going to introduce some of our Repulsion Gel into your system and see how it affects you. We're basically just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.\" Four robotic claws came from the walls and a tube with blue ooze in it fell from the ceiling. \"And what better way to get it in your body than through a tube. The clamps are there for security reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Screw this. Where's the exit?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also been told by a subject who slammed straight into a patch of the gel face-first that this stuff tastes vaguely like cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell froze where she stood. She turned slowly and looked at the tube. Her mouth began watering at the thought of more cake. 'Screw it' she thought, as she bolted (or sauntered, I guess) to the tube and shoved it in her mouth. As she did, the claws grabbed her by the wrists and ankles, holding her slightly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you subject. You're making a BIG controbution to science and mankind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid Cave no mind, though, as the room started making noises, and the substance began pouring into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vaguely? Hell no, this tastes like the BEST F*****G CAKE EVER!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creamy ooze was pouring into her, almost instantly being absorbed as adipose. She could feel herself getting fatter and fatter with each gulp of the cakey substance. She felt the strap of her bra snap letting her breasts surge forward in a tidal wave of boob fat. Still somehow contained in ber shirt, which acted as an oversized sports bra now, they kept growing, passing the size of large watermelons. Her belly plumped up even more, each roll looking like a tire. The bottom roll extended backward to form her love handles, going way past enough in pinch an inch, but rather a whole handful of fat. Even further behind her WAS her behind, the most ponderous part of her body growing ever more ponderous. Each massive cheek was fattening way past beachball size, rivaling the size of yoga balls, but with the consistency of jiggly jello. Amazingly, her pants held on, containing both of the wobbling orbs of adipose that made up Chell's enormous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the flow of liquid stopped and the clamps let her go. 'NO! I NEED MORE! GIVE ME MORE!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, champ! That was 5 gallons of gel! This is a recording so I'll have one of the eggheads down there tell me how it went after my 2 o'clock money bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO NO NO I NEED MORE!' Chell began throwing a quiet temper tantrum, jiggling wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the facility, GLaDOS watched as our, now fatter, heroine wobbled in anger. \"Well, this is unexpected. I think I'll have some fun with this butterball.\" Gears turned in her head and the facility as she started booting up the computers from the old wings of Aperture Science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished with her temper tantrum, Chell sat and pouted at her lack of cake. After a couple minutes, however, Cave came back to the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok subject, got good news and bad news. The bad news is we're getting some moon rocks for who knows what, but they won't be coming for a few years. Turns out moon rocks are sorta hard to harvest, but good news! We've made a new gel. We called it Propulsion Gel  and that's what you'll be eating next. Head to the next chamber and we'll get you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot skipping a beat, Chell got off her fat ass and started heading for the lift. It looked way more retro than the ones earlier, and it shook a big on the way up, but she didn't care; she just wanted more gel. The rickety elevator stopped and opened up, allowing her to squeeze her fat through to the next big room. Like before, four clamps and a tube, but this time with orange gel. Cave started saying something about momentum and a great cause, but she just went straight for the tube and shoved it in her waiting maw. The clamps grabbed her limbs like before and the liquid poured in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YES!' she thought, 'This one tastes even better!' She moaned as the even tastier gel poured down her gullet. As it did...</span></div></div>",

They started going backwards through the bra sizes, going back down to F, E, down to measly D cups. Her breasts weren't the only things getting smaller, as her belly started shrinking, her beautifully round gut dropping in size to a chubby potbelly. She felt a gap between her thighs again, and her booty had gone from enormous to badonkadonk to bubble butt. Even her love handles and back fat had been shrunk. Finally, she felt her face and chins receding, looking somewhat svelte again. She'd gone from a behemoth 354 pounds, to a pudgy 152 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid once again stopped and the claws released her, a pout appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job again, subject!\" Cave's voice boomed. \"Another 5 gallons put away.

If she could devote herself to any one pursuit for more than a few months, she'd be unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis deeply troubled her father, Bass, who had dedicated his whole life to the art of wrestling. He was first of all troubled by her fickle attitude towards the sport, usually treating it as a mere hobby, or as a means to an end of some different form of stardom. But while he'd never admit it, he was also bothered by the fact that despite her not being one tenth as committed to the art as he was, she was almost as good, if not better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with her usual lack of respect for it in mind, he was stunned when she called him one day, and as if it was the most normal thing in the world, said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dad, I decided to become the greatest wrestler in the universe, ever, and forever. Got any tips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know I've been slacking off with the whole wrestling thing a bit, what with getting my modeling, acting, singing, and volleyball-playing careers going, but y'know, there are plenty of all those already, so I asked myself, 'Tina, girl, what's a truly unique niche you could fill', and so I realized, why not excel in what I've been good at all along! Wrestling! I mean, I always do pretty good in those tournaments, but I've never actually WON. And if I did, well, that'd be something special! And even aside from those tournaments, it seems like a good way to get some of that fame I do so love. I mean, hell, kick enough people's asses, and everyone's BOUND to notice, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBass shook his head. His daughter had the amazing gift of infuriating him, sometimes intentionally, but mostly accidentally. Still, even though she would change her mind, maybe in a week, maybe in up to six months, if she was going to pursue wrestling with any degree of gusto, he would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tina. My advice to you is simple. Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, REALLY listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meat is the key to wrestling greatness! But not just meat. Food! The fuel of the human engine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I like food already. You don't have to convince me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to LOVE food! How do you expect to properly kick anyone's ass without any real muscle mass? Mass means strength! And even that aside, sheer size and weight is the greatest asset a wrestler has!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina pondered this. She had worked hard to get what she considered the finest body on the face of the earth, and she was unsure if she wanted to sacrifice its shape. But...well, at the moment she wanted to be the best damn wrestler around, and she was devoted to that cause. And plus: more weight meant bigger boobs. No arguing with that, she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, daddy, thanks for the advice. I'm off to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she hung up. Bass was going to go on to tell her about all the work out regiments and training needed to ensure that the food properly became muscle, and not fat, but by the time he tried to call her back, she had left her house, and he didn't know her cell number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Tina hurried off to...</span></div></div>",

She was something of a celebrity, and the owners of the buffet were thrilled to have her dine at their humble place of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being shown her seat, Tina wasted no time in deciding to gather all the food she could. She passed by the fruits and vegetables and salads without so much as a glance, and piled her tray high with all that seemed greasy, buttery, sugary, or otherwise fattening, giving special consideration to the gathering of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was finished preparing Round 1 of her meal, the lean beauty was turning heads for an all new reason as she struggled to balance the leaning tower of food piled precariously on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owners of the buffet were starting to have a bad feeling about Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina dove into the meat first, beginning by calmly eating it delicately, but eventually getting bored , she started gnawing and tearing into it like a cavewoman. Time was a-wasting, and she fully intended to beef up as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the meat, and leaving discarded chicken bones strewn about her table, Tina moved on to the impressive collection of pasta she had, slurping it all down with blinding gusto. It was, all of it, gone in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, turning to the numerous bagels and bread she'd gathered, she busted open the sealed sticks of butter she'd taken...and Lord, did she take a lot of butter. Using it liberally, there probably wasn't a single piece of food that didn't consist mostly of a thick, messy layer of butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be mentioned that all the food was helped down by countless refills of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina whipped through the rest of her meal quickly, enjoying in particular the vast pool of syrup which had a tiny bit of pancake in it. and by the end of it, she was, indeed, getting rather full. But she was also feeling a lust for food that she'd never been able to indulge in, for fear of ruining her figure...but she had always been a sensuous person, adoring immediate, pleasing sensations. And this orgy of food was certainly pleasing her. Why stop now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to gather more food. Upon finishing that, she gathered more. And then...one more load. Each load was as big, or bigger, than the last. The buffet owners found themselves hoping Tina would explode before bankrupting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" she finally said \"...I'm done with my meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owners' hearts soared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now...\" she continued, patting her hard, full, but impressively still (for now) flat belly \"...it's time for desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owners' hearts sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina piled another tray full of all the chocolate, ice cream, candies, treats, puddings, and jell-o she could. She scarfed it down, messily, violently, and determinedly. By the end of the ordeal, she was a mess of melted chocolate and ice cream smudges. This went well with all the grease, sauce, syrup, and butter she already had on her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to get up to fix up another tray, but she was starting to feel woozy and overstuffed, so decided to be efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her chair over to the chocolate ice cream dispenser, and addressed the rest of the diners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm about to do isn't very lady-like. If any of you record me, gorgeous and famous Tina Armstrong, doing this, on your camera-phones or something, and put it up on youtube, I will suplex you into a coma. Deal?\" she winked and smiled winningly \"Glad you fine folks understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leaned her head back, opened her mouth wide, and pulled down the lever. A steady flow of ice cream trailed into her mouth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the spectators shook their heads in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, all too long afterwards, she sluggishly staggered to her feet, and approached the owners of the buffet, who were both on the verge of sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize I may have gone a bit overboard. So...\"<br>\r\nShe wrote them a check for ten-thousand dollars.<br>\r\n\"...I'm giving you this, because I plan on visiting this place as much as I can, and I don't want it closing down. So, see you people tomorrow most likely, and you just have yourselves a wonderful day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered off, rubbing her full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks would be full of visits to the buffet, as well as other sources of vast amounts of food that she deemed fattening. She enjoyed her new lifestyle so much, and was so dedicated to it, that she completely ignored working out, and she seemed impressively unconcerned by the very soft extra flesh that was accumulating on her once-toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa was excited to see her old friend Tina again. It had been six months since they'd seen each other, and Lisa had missed the wild, reckless, cocky, but undeniably fun and kind Tina. Apparently Tina had been training hard to become an even better wrestler, and since they were regular tag-team partners, Lisa was looking forward to joining her, helping her, and maybe ultimately kicking ass alongside her. In anticipation, Lisa had been working out extra-hard the past week or so, and had her body toned to perfection. She was worried that Tina might humiliate her by showing off a superior body, and she didn't want to be too outdone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lisa reached the door to Tina's huge, expensive apartment, and rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in!\" Tina's voice shouted cheerfully \"Door's unlocked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Lisa entered, and the sight that greeted her eyes made her smile freeze in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was standing there, naked, which wasn't that surprising. They were both pretty casual about their own bodies.<br>\r\nWhat suprised Lisa was that Tina was now the fattest women she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina's previously huge breasts had swollen to the size of medicine balls...miraculously, they remained as buoyant and perky as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat atop her belly, which bulged some distance ahead of her like a herald, extended past her knees, and seemed to be flirting with the idea of touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her, too, was all fat beyond any expectation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tina walked over to Lisa, her whole body shook wildly, her huge belly swaying wildly back and forth with every step. And as she hugged the limp, stunned Lisa, the poor skinny girl's body practically sank into Tina's. Weakly, Lisa attempted to return the hug, but her arms didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of reaching around Tina's girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lisa, how the hell have you been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm!...fine, Tina! Fine! And...and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think this body speaks for itself. Proof right here that hard work and dedication pays off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs emphasis, Tina grabbed and shook her belly. It clapped against her thick legs like thunder, and continued to shake and move long after she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Tina, you...you wanted your body to be like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course! Size, weight, power, and control are all key aspects of wrestling, right? Size, I got. I mean, look at me. This is size! And weight? This new me is an unstoppable 773 pounds! As of yesterday's weigh-in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..you got weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got weight! Who needs holds when you can pin someone down just by falling on them? Strategy, Lisa. Strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing on power and control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on those two. Mere matter of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Lisa, I see that look in your eyes. You're looking at me, and you see the future of wrestling, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! So, honey, I'm willing to help you. We've always been friend, and partners in the ring. So, join me! We'll be the biggest thing to happen to wrestling since...well, ever! Whaddya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stared at her enormous friend. Tina, it had to be said, had the power of conviction on her side, if not the power of logic or reason or common sense. Lisa...</span></div></div>",

Lisa had a really sore stomach and kept complaining about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh it'll go away soon enough suck it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Tina's apartment, they watched a movie.<br>\r\n\" So you want some popcorn or something?\" Asked Tina.<br>\r\n\"What? we just went into EVERY restaurant in town and I'm STUFFED and I think I can feel myself getting fatter and you're askin me if I want a snack?<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, the thing is, when you gain weight you need to KEEP eating until you go to bed at least.<br>\r\n\"O.K. fine I'll have 3 bags of popcorn\"<br>\r\n\"That a girl!!\"<br>\r\nSo Lisa kept eating and they went to bed.<br>\r\nWhen Lisa awoke the next morning, she was surprised to see that her stomach had become very large.

After that,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which place do you think is better for breakfast, Buffet or McDonalds?\"<br>\r\nTina feltvery stuffed at that point but she was determined.<br>\r\nLisa was starting to wonder if there was anything wrong with her friend.

This is what you got into, you agreed for it so I guess I'll have to choose breakfast place then. Ummmm... Here lets just go to BOTH.<br>\r\n\"Umm.. Okay.\"<br>\r\nFrankly Lisa thought she was gonna explode and Tina was kinda trying to force-feed her.<br>\r\nLisa went into her room to put clothes on and then she saw that she could easily escape out the window.....</span></div></div>",

Everyone's got their own style, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah. But...um, listen. Are you sure that your way is really going to lead to being a better wrestler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Minutes...whole, entire, literal MINUTES...of study and research went into the design of my training and diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...as long as you know what you're doing.\" said Lisa, not at all convinced that Tina what the hell she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, enough talk about training! It's been way too long since we've seen each other, let's hit the town! See a movie, go shopping, get a bite to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you HUNGRY!?!?\" Lisa asked, shocked, as she surveyed the wreckage of wrappers, boxes, and various other food packages strewn everywhere. And she had a feeling that the packages were not all that old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure. All the food you're seeing around was for today's training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate all this today!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

We really need to take you out and get you to relax. Just help me get dressed, and we can head right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour of trying to get Tina's enormous pair of jeans on, which were ALREADY too small (\"I bought 'em two whole days ago, so it only makes sense they're getting tight\") later, they were ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, they hit up the movies, where they saw a pretty good action flick, although Tina missed huge chunks of it due to her frequent returns to the lobby to get more food. She had three extra large buckets of popcorn (which were so drenched with butter that they resembled some sort of soup), four packs of nachos (mostly cheese), three hot dogs, a giant pretzel, countless boxes of candy, and untold cups of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they went shopping, which was fun, and Lisa had to admit, for her size, Tina sure could still move. They had fun shopping, and if not for the three stops to the food court, it almost would've seemed like old times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, they went out to eat at a mexican restaurant. The havoc that was Tina's meal was indescribable. And Tina also ate all the appetizers, and after convincing Lisa to get a much bigger meal than she wanted, proceeded to steal most of it. Lisa had never seen anyone eat so much, so fast, so lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was impressed, and a little frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the day was actually great fun, for Lisa and Tina, who was happily kneading that enormous belly smothering her lap during the drive home (Lisa had to drive Tina's car; Tina herself was far too big to fit behind the steering wheel, and in fact had to sit in the back seat, almost diagnolly, with both front seats pushed almost all the way up...even then, tight squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got back to Tina's place, and Lisa helped her undress (the zipper was impossible to reach, but once Lisa popped the button, her belly poured out like a river from a broken dam, and the pants exploded down, exhausted), Lisa found herself faced with a dilemma. While she definitely didn't want to be like Tina, she really did always love spending time with her, and it was kind of fun and thrilling to see just how much she could gorge. And with everything from driving to dressing herself, Tina really did need help. She could stay with her a while, as a roomate, and a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, Lisa had her own life to go back to, and Tina had plenty of other people to help her with her crazy agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?...</span></div></div>",

And on the ride down, she started licking up the butter. It was a spectacle, I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina is ALWAYS a spectacle. Um...when did she move out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'd say a little over two months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTWO MONTHS!

It was a sizeable house in a high-traffic area of town, located very close to (she noticed) many restaurants. And she also noticed, as she parked by the sidewalk outside, that there were two pizza delivery trucks, a chinese delivery car, and two more cars of more mysterious origins also parked out front. Approaching the front door, she almost knocked, before deciding, it's probably unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped in, she almost bumped into a pizza delivery man.<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me, miss.\" he said cheerfully \"I don't recognize you.

There are always at least two helpers around, trading off in shifts with others. Quite a little set up she's got!

You could look at her, and not even believe that you were looking at a human being. Human beings just couldn't be that big. She was in the league of whales and giants, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her impossible fat poured across the floor in thick, massive rolls, for dozens of feet in every direction. Perched atop the soft, shaking monument, undulating and jiggling like perpetual motion machines, were here enormous round breasts, still somehow maintaining some degree of perkiness, while also being the size of cars. Her face, presumably, was somewhere, but it certainly couldn't be seen from Lisa's position. Tina was piled so high with fat, she ended up probably being over twenty feet tall. The thought that her normal-sized skeleton still rested in the vast mounds of flesh like some now silly-seeming vestige made Lisa shake her head in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Tina's corpulence was covered in food. Crumbs, melted chocolate, syrup, sauce, debris and messes of other descriptions, littered her body, collecting mostly on her folds, or any of the relatively flat surfaces that her vast but thoroughly rounded body had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the mess on her must have happened very recently, because someone was currently working on cleaning her up, and they were obviously an old hand at it. He wiped the grime off with a sponge, and even though you could tell how lightly he was rubbing, you could still see his hand sink into her yielding flab with the lightest touch. How soft WAS she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleaner, though, wasn't the only one around. As she walked around Lisa found an angle at which she could see a woman sitting atop Tina, acting as the hand with which to bring food to her mouth. Lisa could also see that there was a ladder and catwalk suspended above Tina, which the person must use whenever they need to get on or off of her. And as the person finished feeding Tina the current batch of food, they began to ascend the ladder...and Lisa realized that the person actually wasn't sitting down. They were standing up on her. But Tina was apparently so soft, they sank down to their waist while standing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was almost stunned into a coma by the whole crazy operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHIS WAS NOT TRAINING IN ANY FORM!<br>\r\nTHIS WAS THE MOST GLUTTONOUS LIVING THING ON THE PLANET INDULGING IN PURE, SHAMELESS, FANATICAL HEDONISM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was pissed. Tina had gone overboard, and needed one hell of a stern talking to. Question was, would she take an angry stance from the get-go, or call out to her friendly-like?</span></div></div>",

They'll think you're nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've always been a controversial figure. Frankly, I take it as a sign that I'm doing something right! I don't care what they think...if they think I'm crazy, I don't care because I know I'm not, and if they call me a fatass or a pig, I'll laugh, because DUH! That's obvious! All I want is attention, and for people to have the name 'Tina Armstrong' on the tips of their tongues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. There was nothing more frustrating than talking to someone who you knew was wrong, but who either couldn't be convinced, or didn't care.<br>\r\n\"Fine, Tina. If you just want the media and the internet buzzing and talking, I'm sure you'll get it. And then some. But, how in God's name do you expect to compete? You can't fight like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, don't worry about me! I appreciate your interest and your concern, but you're competing, too! Just worry about yourself. Don't lose any sleep over what I'll do. Just rest assured, if you make it to the last match, it'll be my enormous, gorgeous ass that you'll be trying to kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa almost laughed, but her anger caught herself. Dammit all, she still loved Tina, the fat, silly bitch. Tina seemed so downright inhuman when Lisa first came in, but no...the same old cocky bombshell was still there, just bigger than ever. Lisa was still worried, but knew that there was nothing more to do, and decided to try and stop worrying. So, after chatting a bit more, Lisa said farewell, and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, time passed...and eventually, the Dead or Alive tournament arrived.</span></div></div>",

Zack first introducing some of the men competing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now let's introduce the ladies! And believe me when I say this you're going to want to feast your eyes on them!\" Zack's enthusiasm hyping the crowd even more as the women made themselves known...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina couldn't believe it although now it explained why the ring seemed that much bigger then last time around and why her dad really tried to explain things to her days ago, here was the blonde bombshell of a blob ready to astound everyone in attendance and her fellow competitors with her grand size and now that plan had gone well belly up so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery woman in the tournament was borderline as massive as she was some perhaps even more so, even Lisa had gorged herself stupidly fat! There were blobs everywhere the men looking like muscular ants compared to the girls who had fatten in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem am still Tina Armstrong, I got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde blob stated reassuring herself with her equally massive confidence and with that the tournament began. </span></div></div>",

A part of her was frustrated with the fact that she, along with the other ladies currently occupying the resort, had once again fallen into Zack's hair-brain scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tournament my ass...' she thought with slight annoyance. Well on technical terms there was a bit of a competition what with the various volleyball games to be a part of, of course Ayane was never that much of a social person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything the ninja-girl would only partner with Kasumi, after the last real DOA tournament the two had a somewhat more \"peaceful\" relationship. They weren't exactly going to be exchanging Christmas cards but at the same time weren't trying to battle with each other to the death anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the German fighter Hitomi, who befriended Kasumi when she (Kasumi) told Hitomi of her relation to Hayate, the man serving as somewhat of a mentor and perhaps love interest to Hitomi (though she kept that little detail to herself). Later Kasumi would introduce her to Ayane, the ninja girl had no real problem with the German girl despite that it seem they were more of acquaintances then actual friends. Regardless whenever she needed a fierce partner Hitomi always came looking for Ayane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyane's mind wondered for a bit and she thought of what to do next. While she wasn't to trilled to be fooled into coming to the island even Ayane had to admit that Zack always made sure that there was plenty to do once one stepped foot on his vacation resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she lifted herself up to a standing position, stretched a bit, and was a little relived to see that she hadn't gotten too deep a tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It may be cheap but that lotion does work as it should.' she thought silently before deciding it was time to get a move on.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a few sparks shot out of Dizzy's thong and and the lights at the sumo ring started to malfunctioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRITICAL ERROR!... Weight gaining subject is not human...\" the machine said through the speakers and continued trying to enlarge Dizzy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? No human?\" Chun Lee asked herself and looked confused over to dizzy. She bit her lips nervously, since she remembered her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzy was no human or something similar. She was partially a gear, a living weapon of destruction, created to fight and kill humans. But she never actually followed this path and just wanted to life a normal live. But now the sumo ring machine tried to enlarge gear matter within Dizzy's body. This caused a fatal malfunction in the body growth sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly dizzy felt really weird and she looked confused down her body. But then i happened like it was planned and yet a little bit different. Dizzy started to grow bigger, first of her belly expanded to a cuddly pot belly and grew wider and wider. Soon the rest of her body also started to inflate with fat. Her ass grew rounder and her tights plumper. On top of all her nice breasts also expanded bigger to large softy orbs. Also her tail got wider and plumper, just like her wings. But they also grew longer in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it looked like there was no malfunction, but just until Dizzy reached the weight class of Kasumi. But her gear body actually absorbed more energy and so she even surpassed her unintended. Her body grew even larger and also a bit taller. Only when her body reached the 700 pounds border and a high of 7 foot, she stopped growing. Her body seemed like sucked all of the machines energy since it shut down cause the missing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzy took a a step to the side and her entire body started to quiver. Like the others, she never was fat in her life before, but it was such an overwhelming and unknown feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is the reaction of Kasumi and Dizzy? Do they actually like being fat?</span></div></div>",

Most of the things were loot from the Jelly fish pirates countless adventures... which basically turned out as trash in the end. Still nobody really knew what was in the numerous boxes and piles of stuff. May saw a huge plank leaning against the wall and it almost looked like there was something behind it. The entire wooden thing was covered in dust, just a few spots at the side indicated, that someone moved this away recently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks interesting\"<br>\r\nMay said and inspected the plank a bit closer with a broad grin<br>\r\n\"What is it?.... it's just a plank\"<br>\r\nDizzy answered a bit confused about it. She had no idea what May was thinking, but she was most likely right. May was pretty good at finding stuff... most of all if it was Johnny whenever he was missing<br>\r\n\"Not the plank is interesting... but what might be behind it\"<br>\r\nShe added to Dizzy and suddenly grabbed the side of it, pushing it away with easy. Still the plank suddenly fell over and caused a large dust cloud to rise as it hit the ground. Both started to cough and waited for the dust to fade again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth eyes widened as they suddenly saw a large treasure chest standing there, one they never saw before. Also there was a big look on it, like the owned really wanted to stop others from opening it... obviously. May quickly placed her hands curiously on it as she saw a red label on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Johnny's chest... hands off!....\"<br>\r\nShe read and her heart made a bump from that. This chest belonged to him, so she definitely had to see what's inside. Her hands where already going for the lock, since she couldn't wait to see it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"he... May... can we really do that?... It's says hands off?\"<br>\r\nDizzy asked her surprised, since she usually never would question a order from her captain.<br>\r\n\"Of course we can! And we must!... My curiosity is killing me~ I need to know what's inside~\"<br>\r\nShe said and started to pull at the lock<br>\r\n\"But....\"<br>\r\nBefore she actually could say anymore, a part of the chest was already ripped out. The lock was solid and could stand the stress of May's inhuman strength... but the rest of the chest was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!... But now we can't back off... let's look what's inside~\"<br>\r\nMay said with a giggle and already placed her hands on the lid, ready to open it. Also Dizzy started to get a bit curious. It may be against her nature to break a order from Johnny, but like May she wanted to know more about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was inside of the chest?</span></div></div>",

Ever since she and the Brotherhood of Steel had wiped out the majority of the Enclave presence and a good chunk of the super mutant infestation, all that there was to fight were scattered raiders and mutated animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo &lt;i&gt;boring.&lt;/i&gt; Oh well, not as if there was anything else to do. She made a mental list, deciding on stopping by Craterside Supply for a few microfusion cells for her rifle and perhaps a bit of Rad-x antiradiation chems. Heading around the corner of her home and down a ramp towards the commons, she worked her way through the cluster of residents and visitors, nodding towards Sheriff Simms as she passed him, and barely containing her urge to beat down that sleazebag Moriarty, proprietor of the local bar, as he tried to once again trick someone out of their hard-earned money. The smell of crispy iguana-on-a-stick, as always deliciously prepared by Jenny Stahl, wafted across the breeze. For what it was worth, the Brass Latern (megaton's local eatery), was pretty damned good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, and she was upon Moira's store. Opening the door with a creak, she trotted inside, glancing at the security guard the ever-cheerful Ms. Brown had hired. \"Heeyyy there! How are ya today?\" the red-headed shopkeep piped up. The wanderer shrugged. \"Same old, same old. Less and less for me to do. So, you got any MF cells today?\" With a nod, Moira reached behind the counter and pulled out a few. \"Here ya go.\" Handing over the cash necessary, and a nod of thanks, 101, as she was known by the wasteland's resident newscaster Three-dog after her Vault's number, placed them in her rucksack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's the survival guide I helped you with going?\" Nearly cringing at the memories, she recalled assisting Moira with a book, being a \"field researcher\", which more often then not involved risking her neck (if she had to go into a mirelurk nest again she'd jump off a cliff) or injuring herself accidentally or (in two cases) intentionally in the name of &lt;i&gt;Science!&lt;/i&gt; (which she had now realized was different from the generally accepted view of science). &lt;i&gt;Science!&lt;/i&gt; was very much a thing the energetic Brown enjoyed. The crimson-haired merchant smiled warmly. \"Darn good, in fact, it's already sold 500 copies in the past month! It's a tidy little profit AND I'm helping people.\" Of course, the occasionally clueless scientist-wannabe was a bit misinformed, if well-intentioned, although 101 had gently nudged her in the right direction. \"Good to hear. Say, Moira, I barely ever see you outside of here, why don't I take you along to see the sights of DC sometime?\" She gestured over her shoulder with her thumb towards the door of the shop. \"Now that the Brotherhood and I have cleared most of it out, it's much safer. You could use a break, and I could use something to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand to her chin, Moira let out a little hmm. \"Well, I suppose it could be fun!\" 101 smiled a little bit, odd for her normally serious demeanor, hardened from a good year straight of fighting. \"Well then, how about after lunch? I'll just be over by the Vault for a while, Dogmeat ran off chasing radroaches again, he usually hangs around there if we get seperated.\" Her trusty canine companion had a habit of doing that, but c'est la vie. \"Sounds nifty. Deal!\" With a wave, 101 walked outside, her bespectacled, brunette self realizing that for all the people she knew, none, bar Fawkes (one of two non-barbaric super mutants she had ever met) and Three-dog, were really &lt;i&gt;friends,&lt;/i&gt; having had no time to truly make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever absentminded, eccentric, and sometimes mind-bogglingly gullible she was, Moira would would be a good friend, she mused. Proceeding out the gate of the township, she hummed along to a catchy little number about some guy named pete that gently played from her radio on her Pip-boy wrist computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like every day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind her, she heard her husband, Nate. <br>\r\n\"Did you do something to your hair?\" He asked, peering into the mirror. <br>\r\n\"Why, yes I did. I do have the best hairdresser in Boston working on my hair\", she replied, flashing him a smile. <br>\r\n\"If you say so. Now, if you're done, could I use the mirror? I need to shave\", Nate said, gesturing to his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her husband, Nora headed into the kitchen, where she was greeted by her robotic butler, Codsworth. <br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mum! Your coffee, brewed to perfection!\" He stated, placing a mug on the counter. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, Codsworth\", Nora said, taking a sip of the coffee. She smiled. It really was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the hall, a cry was heard. <br>\r\n\"Ah, looks like Shaun is awake! I shall attend to him!\" Codsworth said, heading down the hall. <br>\r\nSitting down on the couch, Nora turned on the TV. GNN blared to life. <br>\r\nBefore she could watch the news, a knock was heard at the door. <br>\r\n\"It's probably that salesman. He comes for you everyday\", Nate said, walking into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Nora was greeted by a man wearing a yellow trench coat, and holding a clipboard. <br>\r\n\"Good Morning! Vault-Tec calling!\" The man greeted. <br>\r\n\"Good morning\", replied Nora. <br>\r\n\"Isn't it? Just look at that sky...\" The man said, before clearing his throat. \"Anyway, I'm here to inform you that, due to your families contributions to our country, you have been pre-selected for entry into the local vault, Vault 111!\"<br>\r\n\"That's great. There is space for my family, right?\"<br>\r\nThe Vault-Tec rep nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course! There's room for everybody, minus your robot, of course. I just need some information. We wouldn't want any hold-ups in the event of total atomic annihilation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling out the survey, the Vault-Tec rep thanked Nora before heading off, presumably to the Vault. <br>\r\n\"Well, that's good, if the war does happen\", Nate said, who had been observing Nora's conversation. <br>\r\n\"I'm not going to make a call on if it does. Hopefully, it doesn't...\" Nora said, before Codsworth interrupted her. <br>\r\n\"Miss Nora, Shaun has been changed but he absolutely refuses to calm down. Perhaps he could use some of that 'Maternal' affection you seem to be good at giving?\"<br>\r\nNora sighed. Who knew that being a parent was so hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Shaun's room, Nora eventually calmed Shaun down. <br>\r\n\"Good work. You are a great mother, you know that?\" Nate said, hugging Nora. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know\", she replied. <br>\r\n\"Now that that's over, how about we head to the park for the day?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, the park. Because I want to get pregnant. Again!\" Nora replied sarcastically, remembering their last visit to the park. <br>\r\nBefore Nate could continue, they heard Codsworth from the other room. <br>\r\n\"Sir? Mum? You may want to see this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back into the living room, Nora stopped in front of the TV. Nate stopped beside her, a squirming Shaun in his arms. <br>\r\n\"Reports are just in... Yes, we have confirmed detonations in New York and Pennsylvania. God, it's actually happ-\"<br>\r\nThe TV cut off. Alarms started blaring outside, causing Shaun to begin crying. <br>\r\n\"We need to get to the Vault. Now!\" Nate yelled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNate and Nora sprinted out of their house. <br>\r\n\"Residents of Sanctuary Hills. If you are registered, proceed to Vault 111\".<br>\r\nOn the hill, Nora spotted a Verti-Bird landing. <br>\r\n\"The Vault's up the hill! Hurry!\" She shouted. <br>\r\nSprinting up the hill, the trio stopped in front off a gate, flanked by two power armour units wielding miniguns. <br>\r\n\"We need in! We're on the list!\" Nora gasped. She wasn't in the best of shape, as shown by her belly, which formed a layer of flab. <br>\r\n\"Adult male... Adult female... Infant. Alright, go ahead and God save you\", the officer said, moving to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the vault door, Nora bent over, gasping for breath. Beside her, Nate was barely out of breath, a testament to the time he spent in the Army. <br>\r\n\"We'll be alright. I love you!\" Nate said to Nora, smiling. <br>\r\n\"Yeah... Love you... too...\" Nora gasped, straightening up just in time to see a massive explosion to the south. <br>\r\nEverybody started yelling. <br>\r\n\"Lower the elevator! Now!\"<br>\r\nRight before the shock wave hit them, the elevator lowered and the door slid shut over their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moments became a blur for Nora. She remembered stepping of an elevator, accepting a blue jumpsuit with 111 written on it...<br>\r\n\"We need you to step in here. For... decontamination\".<br>\r\nThe scientists voice shocked Nora out of her daze. She looked at him with a blank look. <br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n\"Just step in here. And before I forget, you need this shot. It gets rid of any radiation you may have in your body\", the scientist said, holding up a syringe full of a clear liquid. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure...\" Nora said absent-mindedly, still in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the decontamination chamber, Nora rubbed her arm where the syringe had pierced her skin. Whatever was in it had made her hungry... Hopefully, she'd get some food after this. <br>\r\n\"The pod will decontaminate you before heading deeper in to the Vault. Just, relax!\" <br>\r\nBreathing out, Nora's eyes began to shut. After a couple of seconds, she had fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like a couple of seconds later, Nora awoke with a start. The door to the pod opened. She stepped forward, and immediately fell over. Alarms were sounding all around the Vault.<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Nora whispered. She had a really bad headache... <br>\r\nAnd then she remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God... Nate!\"<br>\r\nShe remembered two people, one in a hazmat suit of some kind, and the other wore a metal brace on his arm. They tried to take Shaun. Nate tried to stop them...<br>\r\nLooking into Nate's pod, a red stain confirmed her worst fear. <br>\r\nShe fell to her knees, crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Nora stood up and wiped tears from her eyes. Looking around, she began aware of something...</span></div></div>",

Everybody's dead!\"<br>\r\nThis caused Nora to back into a corner, although she didn't know why. She had seen dead people before, at funerals, but seeing her neighbours, her husband dead in a Vault, supposedly one of the safest places on Earth, was overwhelming her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What did Vault-Tec do?\" She asked, taking a few cautious steps out of her corner. After a few seconds, she jumped back into it when she heard a loud rumble. <br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" Nora asked, fear in her voice. She wasn't designed for this kind of place. Nate had always been the rugged one in their relationship, hence why he joined the Army. <br>\r\nAnother rumble. <br>\r\nLooking around the room, Nora eventually realized what the rumbling was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her stomach, which made her feel silly, for being scared of it, and slightly embarrassed, as it was echoing around the room. <br>\r\n\"Alright... Let's find some food, before I resort to cannibalism!\"<br>\r\nTiptoeing out the room as she was still uneasy about all the corpses, Nora tried to silence her stomach, which was almost roaring by this point. <br>\r\nAs soon as Nora passed through the door, she heard it shut behind. She let out a breath of relief. <br>\r\n\"Thank God...\" She whispered. \"Now, fo... Is that another room?!\"<br>\r\nPeeking in the window, she saw another room full of cryo-pods. <br>\r\nShe immediately ran through the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora halted in front of a window. She was hunched over and breathing heavily. Sweat dotted her forehead. <br>\r\n\"Oh... I'm so... unfit...\" She gasped. <br>\r\nAfter regaining her breath, she straightened up and was met with the sight of a giant cockroach. <br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Nora yelled, causing the giant roach to jump off the window and scurry away. <br>\r\nTrying to push the giant cockroach from her mind, Nora focused on finding food. She was beginning to feel slightly faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into an adjoining room, she found a security baton, which she stuck in one of her pockets, and a terminal. Sitting down in front of it, she powered it on. <br>\r\n\"Let's see... For Security Only?\"<br>\r\nOpening it, she found some disturbing things in it. <br>\r\n\"Wait... Security revolted against the Overseer? That explains the lack of any living people. Although, it doesn't explain why everybody's dead. And the giant cockroach\".<br>\r\nTurning the terminal off, she continued looking for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next room, Nora saw the giant cockroach. One of her first thoughts was \"Run\".<br>\r\n\"No. It's only a cockroach, what can it do to hurt me?\" Nora said, pulling out her baton. <br>\r\nSneaking up behind it, she smashed the baton down on the roach. It died instantly. <br>\r\n\"Thank goodness... Hmmm? What's this?\"<br>\r\nFlipping the roach over, she saw a narrow cut down its belly. She plunged her hands in, let out a groan and ripped it open. Pulling out a slab of meat, Nora contemplated wheather or not she was hungry enough to actually eat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rumble from her stomach answered her question. <br>\r\nGroaning with disgust, Nora ripped the roach meat in half and stuffed one in her mouth. <br>\r\nInitially, she hated it. She immediately thought about spitting it out, but after a chewing for a second, it grew on her. <br>\r\n\"It's not that bad... Once you get used to it\", Nora said through a mouthful.<br>\r\nSwallowing, she quickly finished it off and let out a burp. Standing up, she smoothed out her jumpsuit, which felt tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the jumpsuit was tighter. Her belly was much softer and was pushing against her jumpsuit. Her breasts felt heavier and constricted within her bra. Her hips were softer and her ass was rounder. <br>\r\n\"Right, let's find a way out of this place!\"<br>\r\nLooking around, Nora saw two doors. One led into what looked like a living space, while the other had a couple of generators and what sounded like a couple more giant roaches. <br>\r\nShe decided to head into the...</span></div></div>",

Flipping the switch next to the door, she cringed as the door screeched open. <br>\r\n\"Someone needs to fix that,\" She commented. \"Odd that I haven't seen any staff yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the open door, Nora was met with a large room, the centre of which was mainly occupied by a table with a couple of empty beer bottles and coffee cups. <br>\r\nRunning her hand over the dusty table, she did her best to ignore her stomach, which was beginning to rumble again. However, as she inspected an old terminal that had some scores for Red Menace on the screen, her stomach roared loudly. <br>\r\n\"Fine!\" She exclaimed, throwing her hands up. \"I'll find something to eat then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said than done as Nora looked around the dust covered room. Heading for the fridge, Nora threw open the door to find an old box of Sugar Bombs, and a bottle of milk that smelt absolutely rancid. Leaving the milk, but grabbing the Sugar Bombs, Nora sat at the old table, which creaked underneath her. Stuffing handfuls of the sugar coated balls into her mouth, Nora silently cursed Vault-Tec. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepared for the future? Yeah, right!\" She said angrily, stuffing another couple of Sugar Bombs into her mouth. \"I'm certain that the future involves a stocked fridge!\" <br>\r\nAnother handful. She chewed loudly, an old habit of hers. <br>\r\n\"And this experiment? How'd the government not know? They controlled Vault-Tec!\"<br>\r\nLifting the box, Nora tipped the last couple of bombs into her mouth. Throwing the box aside, she stood up and let out a burp. <br>\r\n\"Stupid Vault-Tec...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after the giant roach and the entire box of Sugar Bombs, Nora's stomach still wasn't satisfied. It gurgled loudly as she poked around the wrecked bedroom. Finding nothing, Nora left the bedroom. Before she left the living quarters altogether, she stopped by the terminal and grabbed the copy of Red Menace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the old generator room, Nora flinched as a burst of electricity emitted from one of the reactors, hitting the metal floor and scorching the ground. As she watched, one of the giant roaches from earlier crawled into the centre of the room. It was instantly hit by a bolt, smoke rising from its corpse.<br>\r\n\"Let's not go that way,\" Nora decided. She skirted the edges of the room, stopping only to crush another roach under her boot. Before moving on, she hungrily devoured the entire thing, legs and all. Only when she had swallowed the last spindly leg did she realise what she had just done. Her face scrunched up in disgust. <br>\r\n\"Don't think about it, Nora... Oh, God... Another roach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter killing and devouring the second roach, Nora finally found a member of staff. However, he, or she, wasn't what she expected.<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" She asked out loud, gently pushing the bleached skeleton with her foot. As she did, its arm fell off, prompting a yelp from Nora. <br>\r\n\"Okay, don't play with dead people,\" She said, turning away from it. Opening the door in front of her, Nora groaned as she saw two more roaches. Her stomach roared as she crushed them, cutting them open, devouring their insides, their legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the second roach, Nora let out a loud burp. She felt really odd as she entered the Overseer's office...</span></div></div>",

They established this during the end credits. I just figured I should mention that. Also, this story line is set after the events of <i>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</i>, so, spoilers for a 3 year old game if you haven't played it already.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010 months after Cyrille Le Paradox had been locked in jail, Bentley, Carmelita, and Murray had finally found Sly, with a bit of help from an apologetic Penelope. At first, they couldn't believe she was actually trying to redeem herself, but she told them that she had thought about what Bentley had said before he defeated her and decided that he was right. Unsurprisingly, they had been a bit skeptical when she tried to make up for what she had done, but eventually they forgave her. Eventually, they all found Sly and everyone was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One night, Sly, Carmelita, Bentley, and Penelope were lying on the roof of the gang's hideout and making up pictures in the stars. \"Hey, that one looks like Miss Decibel,\" Carmelita said. They all laughed at that for a while. \"You know,\" Sly said, \"sometimes I wonder how all the criminals we've ever faced are doing.\" \"Sometimes I do the same thing,\" Bentley agreed. \"As a matter of fact, I wonder how Miss Decibel is doing now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, at a maximum security prison, Miss Decibel had just passed her parole hearing and was let out. During her time in prison, she discovered how fat she truly was, and decided that she liked it. She also discovered that there were quite a few men who found her fat body attractive, despite her age. With these two revelations in mind, she decided to use her body to make a living. She wasn't sure how to do this, however, as some people would likely recognize her, and she highly doubted any BBW modeling companies would hire an ex-criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was at this point that another idea popped into her head. She had been on the internet many times in the years prior to Cyrille Le Paradox hiring her for his plans, and, on several occasions, she discovered something that she, being a classy lady, deemed rather obscene: pornography. The first time she discovered such a thing, she was disgusted by it and couldn't believe it existed. At the same time, however, she couldn't deny that she was just the tiniest bit intrigued by it. When she encountered pornography again, her curiosity got the better of her and she began to examine it. One thing led to another, and, eventually, she found she was pleasuring herself to it. She felt ashamed of herself for such unladylike behavior, but, at the same time, she acknowledged that her body had been yearning for such attention for far too long. At that very moment, something clicked in her head, something she had ignored for too long; despite being a very snooty woman, she was still a woman with feminine, bodily needs. After she had finished pleasuring herself and had cleaned up, she began to researching the different kinks the internet had on offer and discovered a variety of fetishes; some tame, some bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her mind snapped back to the present. She thought to herself, 'Could I become a porn star to make a living? Men seem to like my body despite my age, so it's entirely possible.' As she sat on a bench outside of the prison, she debated this in her mind. On the one hand, she knew from her previous research on the internet that there was a large demographic who had a kink for fat women, and she knew from her time in prison that there was a percentage of that demographic that wouldn't mind her age, although she wasn't sure how big or small of a percentage that was. On the other hand, she had doubted she would have any success getting a modelling career with her ex-criminal status, and she wasn't sure whether or not she'd run into a similar problem becoming a porn star. She ultimately decided that she would at least give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: She pursues this career on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: While she was in prison, she had been cell mates with Mz. Ruby, and the two of them had become romantically and sexually attracted to each other. And, as if by fate, Mz. Ruby is miraculously granted parole, despite being given a life sentence. The two obese women become porn stars together, as well as being a lesbian couple.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not even me, the Greatest Employee of All Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, th-thanks,\" she stammered, feeling an angry blush rising in her cheeks.   The weird thing was, he wasn't even being a jerk this time, the way he usually was.  He was genuinely congratulatory; he didn't realize he'd just given her kudos for cheesecake-popping her way to a bigger butt.   She swallowed every angry comment and comeback.  She couldn't let anyone guess she'd gone back in time, or--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm.  Back in time.  There was an idea.  Maybe she could use the time machine to trim off a little of her excess baggage.  Sure, she'd \"learned her lesson\"...but she wasn't going to kill anyone this time, right?  Just... massage events a little.  Nobody else would even care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could go back and make my past self eat better and exercise</i>, she mused.   <i>Or...or I could eat whatever I wanted now, then use the time machine to undo it!</i></span></div></div>",

That fool Shao Kahn was nothing more than a brute!\", she said angrily while stroking her long black and white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I need to think of a way to defeat my ever growing strong \"daughter\" before she annihilates me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sindel uses her long whip-like to pull an ancient book from the book shelf across the room. The book was titled \"Wizards of the Realms\". Sindel was trying to find a wizard she remembers has a very unusual set of baking skills. As she read through the book furiously, she recalls upon his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may have been over 2000 years or so, but this wizard went up against a powerful warrior queen. She was fast, strong and smart enough to become a threat to my kingdom. This wizard came to my aid and cast a spell of an endless amount of cupcakes. The cupcakes came flying at the queens mouth and she used her quickness to dodge it. As she did, another one came in and it was a direct hit! The pastry forced itself down her throat in a single gulp. Soon another dozen came flying like bats out of the Underworld! Soon her muscle toned body was fattening up before my eyes! One after another, the cupcakes caused the queen to become fatter and fatter until her armor came bursting off due to her doughy flesh. She was nude and fattened up more and more until completely immobilized by blubber! It was quite arousing, I will admit. She became know as the fattest queen of all the Realms!A total laughing stalk! I hear she's still around today, stuffing her fat self out of pure depression. Soon Kitanta shall suffer the same fate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         After laughing mechanically for a bit, she finally spotted the wizard's name. Stuffenmouf the Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"In order to summon the wizard Stuffenmouf, one must offer a subject of the female sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sindel knew immediately who to offer. Her most trusted body guard, Sheeva the Shokan! The brave and powerful ally of Sindel. She knew Sheeva has bit of gluttony side ever since she young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sindel called out for her body guard \"Sheeva! I require your aid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Moments later Sheeva walked through the enormous doors of the throne room. Sheeva tan skin, scales on back, had a pair of four beefy arms, long powerful legs, wide big hips and an enormous pair of breasts on the verge of bursting through her black and red, skin-tight leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Yes, your majesty?\" Sheeva said, as she bowed down to her queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Sheeva, my lovely protector. I am need of your help for a test to defeat my traitorous daughter, Kintana. I have developed a plan to, how you put it, immobilize her for good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sheeva began think of horrible ways to destroy Kitana! Rip her limbs off and have her bleed to death? Maybe rip her skin off and use it as a trophy? Sheeva was getting rather excited of thoughts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Suddenly Sindel shouted \"Stuffenmouf, I summon thee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sheeva was surprised and a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen Sindel, who are you summoning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will soon find out my dear Sheeva!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         A large puff of orange smoke poofed right next to Sheeva. A short humpback person in a dark orange and black cloak with hoodie covering his face in darkness. He held in his hand a long red and white walking stick in a shape of a candy cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         He spoke up, \"Ah, the queen Sindel has summoned me... are you offering a subject or are you wasting my time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sindel chuckled \"Look for yourself, she's right next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sheeva figured out that she was indeed the subject for this little shrimp of a wizard. Not to mention the fact she couldn't see face underneath that orange of his. The wizard turned to her and examined her body from her spiky head to her big four toes. Stuffenmouf began to wheeze and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Hehehe! This shokan woman is perfect! Absolutely gorgeous and powerful looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheeva began to blush. Someone actually called her gorgeous for the fist time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Stuffenmouf cleared his throat, \"Shall we begin the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Stuffenmouf raised his long staff and turned it clockwise when another orange puff of smoke appeared. A large pink and white frosted covered cake on a table. Sheeva mouth agape, began to eye it hungrily. Her stomach started to grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Excuse me, my queen Sindel. I haven't eaten all morning. I was... too busy training my fire breath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Incredible, she's hungrier than I thought!\" Stuffenmouf said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Sheeva, this overgrown cake is for you. Consider this an early retirement gift. I no longer require your assistance. You have served and protected me for many years. I even know your little secret... you can't resist good food. I have seen you devour food for an small army time and time again, but you always held back. Never truly letting go! As your queen, I demand you to get your fill, stuff your face with food, let yourself go and never be the muscle bound warrior ever again. Become known as the fattest woman of the Realms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Without hesitation, Sheeva grabbed the platter with enormous cake with her lower arms and used her upper arms to shovel mounds of cake into her greedy maw. She didn't slow down at all! More and more she continued to eat the delicious cake. Getting frosting all over her mouth, hands and large boobs. Her once tight abs began to bulge out a round soft belly. Her tan skinned belly even started to jiggle with every swallow of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Sindel began to laugh maniacally again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAHAHAHA!! Perfect, absolutely perfect! Stuffenmouf, your addictive treats shall make a hippo out of my once lovely body guard! Once Sheeva is fat enough to longer move, continue to stuff her silly until she's a blob of pure soft blubber. Never stop fueling her gluttony, but I also need to start stuffing my daughter Kitana and her allies, Jade, Sonya Blade of Earthrealm, her daughter Cassie Cage, Jacqui Briggs! Make all of those women as fat as whales! HAHAHA!!\"</span></div></div>",

She saw Sheeva was wearing her red V-shape leotard so her belly was able to poke out without ripping it and it had gotten pretty big what was once slim set of abs was now sizable belly that was hanging about two or three inches over her waist though the top part of her leotard that held her breast back wasn't doing so well. Seemed quiet a bit of fat had built up as she look to have gone up a cup size or two making her already large breast about half the size of watermelons now and was stretching the top hard she could even seeing Sheeva erect nipples pushing through the fabric of the leotard. Which made the scream queen wonder if her once bodyguard was getting off on stuffing her fat face with such fatty and grease foods which strangely sent a shiver of pleasure down Sindel's own spine, and speaking of fat faces she could see that Sheeva's face was getting much softer. She already had second chin and third one wasn't far behind and she was sure her cheeks where also more plump but that was harder to tell at the moment since they we're constantly bulging from all the food she kept stuffing into her mouth. Sindel decided to move her gaze downwards to see the damage done well and she had to say she liked what she saw it seemed the Shokan female warrior ass had lost its tone-ness and was big and blubbery thing though not as large as her stomach or tits was still quiet large at least three times as big and making the back part of the leotard into string that was sucked in by her large ass cheeks. Though that wasn't all from what Sindel could see of the front part of outfit it seemed Sheeva's pussy was also getting bigger as her bottom lips looked fat and puffy as they pushed against the confines of her leotard and it seemed Sindel was right about Sheeva getting off on her gorging and fattening body as the bottom of the leotard appeared soaked in her own juices which only turned the queen on more. Looking over the rest of the Sheeva she could see rest of her body was fattening up nice her once buffed arms and legs that once bulged with muscles was now bulging with thick layer of fat that seemed to jiggle and bounce with every movement actually that was all of her now fattening body. Which was only turning Sindel on more damn she felt so wet right now as she watched Sheeva gorge herself as her body fatten up like bread rising in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSindel hadn't felt this turned on since the first time she watched that one queen getting fatten up it was then that Sindel discovered she was into larger women. Though she did wonder was she aroused by the woman getting fatter or was it them stuffing their face or it could even be both, as she looked over at Sheeva stuffing herself as she put on more weight, yeah it was definitely both. Then again it also been many years since she had sex actually now that she thought about it the last time she had sex was with her first husband before he was killed by Shao Khan and say what you will her first husband might been peace loving man with no fighting skill set but at least he gave his wife time and attention she need. All Shao Kahn cared about was expanding his empire and lording over all he didn't make much time for the more physical things unless it was fighting and beating up someone. I mean wasn't like she wanted him to make love to her, hell she doubt their was a loving bone in that body outside of love of torturing or causing pain to someone. All she wanted a good old fuck that was it he didn't have to like it, or like her, or anything just fuck her brains out. But he was gone now and maybe now she could pursue other ways of getting her itch scratched and explore some new fetish hell wasn't like she was having a line of people wanting her and those that made it look like that wanted her our nothing more then people trying to take power of the throne from her. And she wasn't about to have that, but now that she had woman before her getting nice and fat maybe she will explore these new arousing feeling she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a tearing and ripping sound caught her ear and brought the queen from her thoughts she looked over to Sheeva to see that the warrior woman leotard and finally reached the limits as the straps of the leotard gave way letting the mostly revealing outfit to reveal the rest of the fat warrior as it fall to the ground. Sindel could see that most of been Sheeva tits as they where now bouncing and jiggling free in the air, it seemed the outfit ripping also got Sheeva's attention as she looked down at her fat body <b>(</b>But that didn't stop her from continuing to stuff her face for second<b>)</b> though she did stop using her lower arms to stuff her face. Instead she used her lower hands to go up to her now fully large watermelon size tits and start to grope and feel them up causing more frosting to spread over them and her to let out groans and moans as she played with them. After a few minutes one of her lower hands left her tits as she moved it down across her large basketball size gut jiggling and groping it before it moved down to feel her thick thighs which where now foot bigger with fat even the gaps between her thighs where nearly gone. The other hand finally left her other tit as he moved down to but this hand moved to her backside smacking her ass causing it to shake and jiggle it was large as well it looked like small shelf now as it jetted out behind her about half foot in length if Sindel had to guess. With one last large moan Sheeva raised her head up high making the queen a bit curious about what Sheeva would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I NEED MORE FOOD\" The Shokan woman yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started to use her lower arms once more to grab more cake before shoving four handfuls of cake into her mouth causing her face to bulge from all the food as she started to eat even faster then before. If the queen wasn't turned on before she was now as she watched her formal bodyguard go into eating frenzy which only caused her body to grow fatter even faster and her body to jiggle even more so now. Sindel felt sudden need to go down their and start to feel the fat growing body of Sheeva so badly right now but then again she was comfortable in her throne and was enjoying watching the woman stuff Sheeva stuff herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(</b>Ok now time for readers choice for what Sindel should do next<b>)</b></span></div></div>",

Suddenly Stuffenmouf heard voices moving over to one of the buildings he peered through the window and found his target Kitana and she appeared to be with others a dark skin woman wearing similar combat outfit to Kitana but in green that must be friend and protector Jade. Another was older blond woman dressed in military outfit with a younger blond also in military outfit next to her and both women shared similar features meaning they probably related mother and daughter if he had to guess meaning they where Sonya Blade and her daughter Cassie and finally their another dark skin woman but young and also in military outfit meaning she was friend of young Cassie, Jacqui Briggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Good, Good their they are but now how to go about fattening them up huh. I guess I could get them one at time but that is a bit time consuming and gives a higher risk of me being discovered by the others. Then again I could go about it getting them into small groups of two and three and fatten up less time consuming and lower risk of the others catching on to me. But I could always get them all at once yes much faster but always hard to get them all together in one place to eat.

She hadn't managed to find anything to eat for the second day in a row and was currently starving. Frost couldn't hear her growling stomach above the pouring rain. As she walked back, Frost lamented on why she was in the woods starving. It was because she'd been exiled from the Lin Kuei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix years ago Frost had an argument with her master, Kuai Liang about his recent decision to make peace with the Shirai-Ryu. After yelling at her master about he was unfit to rule, Frost had challenged Sub-Zero for control of the Lin Kuei with the loser being exiled. Despite her best efforts, Frost lost badly and was forced to leave. Before leaving, Kuai Liang told her that he was saddened about this had all turned out and that he was sorry he failed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost wandered through the soaking wet forest. Ever since her defeat, she vowed to become powerful enough to beat her former master. As she continued her journey, Frost realized that she couldn't hear the rain anymore but it was still cloudy. Looking around she saw that the rain drops were frozen in midair. Perplexed by this magic, she looked around and saw a bald lady with white flowing robes and blue eyes. Frost got into a fighting stance before the lady spoke with an odd yet reassuring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Do not fear Frost. I am Kronika and I am here to help you not fight you.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? Why would you want to do that\" Frost said, keeping her defensive stance. She had met more than enough people who said they wanted her to help her but secretly just wanted to use her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"This isn't what I had planned for you.\"</b> Seeing the confusion on the cryomancer's face, Kronika elaborated. <b>\"You were never meant to be exiled from the Lin Kuei my dear. After joining you were meant to quickly rise through the ranks of the clan before taking over from Kuai Liang when the time was right and becoming the world's greatest cryomancer.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that was meant to happen, then why didn't it pan out that way?\" asked Frost, having forgotten about fighting this mysterious lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I assume you heard of the defeat of my son, Shinnok, that happened a year ago.\"</b> Frost's jaw dropped after hearing that this lady was apparently the mother of the fallen Elder God, but still managed to nod her head as Kronika continued. <b>\"He wasn't meant to lose then but that insufferable Thunder God messed up all of the fates for everyone in the universe, including yours.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Help me and get your life back. Help me and I'll make you the greatest Lin Kuei ever.\"</b> Kronika held out a hand for Frost than asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Do we have a deal?\"</b></span></div></div>",

The man in question looked up from his display at the siren as she finished up another of the delicious treats in no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the rate you're eating them, I don't think they'll be any left. Besides you know Eridium doesn't exactly mesh well with us non-sirens\", Roland responded. That was the truth, but also because ever since they had opened that vault years before and set the Eridium free, Lilith had been absolutely addicted to using the stuff. Making snacks out of it was just the latest in her ideas for how to use the Eridium to make her life awesome. Roland couldn't help but smirk a little as it showed some apparent changes in the once teeny siren's body. Now Lilith was sporting the tiniest hint of pudge around her middle as her sitting position squeezed the flab in tandem with the waistline of her tight pants. Her thighs and rear end also seemed to have spread out slightly and were taking up more of the couch too, not to mention her breasts where threatening to spill out of Lilith's less than decent red shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're no fun. I bet the vault hunters would be willing to try something of mine when they get back from that mission you sent them on. I know for a fact Maya will. We're Siren sisters after all!\" Lilith responded as she smirked and caused her chin to double up. Quickly she began to devour another of the cupcakes as Roland shook his head and returned to his display. He sure hoped Maya would show some more restraint than Lilith was, or they would quickly have two butterball Siren's in the ranks of the Crimson Lance.</span></div></div>",

It didn't bother the siren she along with everyone else was used to the assassin being as mysterious as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the blue-haired woman continued on her way only pausing to vaguely acknowledge Claptrap's existence and when she felt a familiar tap on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith\" she muttered closing the book in an instant knowing that the redhead wasn't about to let her read in peace, at least not until she whatever it was that was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, how's my Siren sis doing?\" Lilith asked rather coyly she wasn't Moxxi by any means but she couldn't deny she was happy to have someone like Maya around. The woman was practically her total opposite and that intrigued Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright. Did you need me for a job?\" Maya asked her tone friendly yet professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just wanted to give you a little something. A little something that I came up with while you all were away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious Maya asked what it was? Not a moment later Lilith showed off one of the special Eridium cupcakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made this?\" Maya asked quite surprised at the thought of Lilith actually taking time to cook up something. It just didn't seem like something she'd do...then again considering what the treat was made of it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Here you can have this one. Trust me they're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya didn't have to question that having taken a quick glance at the redhead's added softness and larger breasts. Amusing she wondered if Lilith's definition of \"good\" included the fact that they were rather fattening and if she was at all aware of her new weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, take it.\" Lilith mentioned pushing the cupcake closer to Maya. The redhead was rather eager to see what the blunette thought of her new snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Maya accepted the gift not wanting to upset her siren sister. As she held the treat in her hand for a moment Maya wondered if Lilith's own addiction was what was fueling her sudden weight gain and if that was the case would she even be affected as well since unlike Lilith she had no such addiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell only one way to find out.</span></div></div>",

While it used to hang loosely around her hips, a week of Lilith's excessive baking had left said hips much wider than they used to be. As Maya attempted to suck in her now pudgy belly, she began to realize that clipping this belt was a lost cause. Throwing it down on the ground, Maya made her way over to the full length mirror to assess just how much damage Eridium treats had done to her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god I'm a whale...\" the blue-haired siren said with slight melancholy. While Maya wasn't exactly big enough to be considered the <br>\r\nsize of a whale\", she definitely was out of shape now. In such a short time, Maya's once toned stomach now hung forward in a fleshy, jiggly mass. It caused a tightness in her one-piece leotard and her ass' larger size caused a wedgie from the garment that she was getting sick of constantly having to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just horrible... how can they honestly expect me to do any missions like this?\" she wondered aloud as she cupped her breasts, which unfortunately had not taken a fair share of her added weight, which would have been the only positive of the situation. \"All I know is that if Salvador and Axton crack any jokes, their dead.\" Hitching up her pants (albeit with some minor difficulty), Maya headed out the door to meet with her comrades at the Crimson Lance HQ... and perhaps give Lilith a few choice words about her cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maya was dreading the results of her excess snacking, Lilith seemed to be taking it in stride. Long had she discarded her pants, her growing rear and thighs proving to be too much for them, and instead walked around the HQ in her panties that had been slowly turned into a thong. Lilith's usual red shirt had now become halter top status, as her hanging gut pushed it further upwards while her massive breasts barely managed to be contained by the material. A double chin had permanently affixed itself to Lilith's face as she smiled and took a bite of a Eridium-chip cookie, her latest confectionery treat that no doubt would add several extra pounds to her softened figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lil, put some damn pants on! It's getting distracting!\" Mordecai said as she watched Lilith jiggle by, her unconstrained butt wobbling as she did so. While it had been amusing at first, the fatter Lilith became, the less attractive a sight it was for the sniper and now he would pay any amount of money to buy pants to cover Lilith's fattening body up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw what's the matter Mordecai? Can't handle the hot piece of awesome I'm becoming?\" Lilith said as she finished her cookie and immediately set on eating another one. she lowered her flabby body onto the couch that was located in the HQ and the cushion almost seemed to cry as it attempted to withstand her girth. Roland just continued to focus on the holo-display in front of him, as his exes fattened ass was exactly as Mordecai said: Distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith I'm gonna have to agree with Mordecai. You need to get some pants and shirts that fit you. Handsome Jack is planning his next move for the Vault and we need everyone focused!\" Roland said sternly, his tone betraying his true thoughts. He honestly enjoyed the site of Lilith half naked and getting fatter but he was a leader and he needed to put everyone else before him. Lilith just frowned at this and finished her cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you aren't quite the man I thought you were. Finnne I'll go get some new clothes. Maybe Maya will join me too!\" Lilith responded as she slowly stood back up and left the room. her flab jiggling all the while.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't outright addicted to Eridium but it was clear what the redhead's cooking was doing to their forms and given that Lilith was already chubby at the week's start she had to put a stop to this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far away Lilith exited The Crimson Lance HQ Tannis spotting her on the way out and mentioning something or other about her weight although none of it sounded negative to Lilith, then again it was difficult to tell sometimes with her, in any case the redhead waved goodbye before heading right out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow outside Lilith was rather muffed at the thought that Roland had basically told her to cover herself up she saw no real problem with her escalating weight was it a distraction to the others possibly but that also meant she could distract the hell out of those sexually deprived bandits out there not to mention give Jack a moon of her own to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the problem, she wondered squeezing a portion of her sizable gut as it hung heavy and low. Her thoughts interrupted as she spotted someone approaching, to her surprise it was Maya! A rather chubby Maya to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she noticed the cute belly and flaring out hips that her siren sis was now sporting. Shame that her breasts had roughly stayed the same but guess not everyone could be wildly hourglass like the redhead. Still much like with her own Lilith saw no harm in Maya's new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired woman paused having taken in the sight of the massive woman before her. Truthfully she had expected Lilith to be larger...but this much surprised even her! The redhead had to be roughly twice her size and with that addiction of hers she was only going to get larger as time went on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she unaware of her weight or did she simply not care? Whatever the case Maya had to put her foot down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, I was just about to look for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith\" Maya repeated as she raised a hand cutting off the redhead, \"before that, we need to talk about our weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot her too although it appeared that Maya wasn't in a joking mood so Lilith asked what of it? Maya proceeded to point out how she was having difficulty with her wardrobe and how Lilith was literally pant-less not to mention she close if not right there to rivaling Ellie in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith didn't seem to be concerned with the comparison or with her girth in general, which puzzled and slightly angered Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith you're a fellow siren so I must be straight with you, we need to stop eating those snacks of yours and get to shedding off this weight! We are sirens not whales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her much larger hips Lilith stood silent for a moment having allowed Maya to vent out her weighty frustrations.

So how about you join me for a jog? I'm sure we'll have you fitting back into a pair of pants in no time!\" Maya said as she eyed up Lilith's massive rear. It was amazing that the red-head just left it out on display without so much as a passing remark, her confidence in her body making Maya a teensy bit jealous. At the same time Lilith's non-existent underwear made the opposite feeling occur in Maya, as she thought to her own wedgie issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you... you mean right now?\" Lilith panicked. She had agreed to workout to avoid an argument, but she had intended to blow it off in favor of more treats. She had the most amazing idea for turning Eridium into frosting and then slathering it over a whole tray of brownies with Eridium chunks baked in that she had already prepared beforehand and were currently cooling at her house. She couldn't do that if she was running around with Maya, getting all sweaty in the process. The thought of physical activity also made her cringe: just how long had it been since she actually done anything remotely close to exercise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course right now! We aren't going to start just magically getting thinner if we don't put the work in! Now come on, let's move it!\" Maya said as she harnessed a small amount of phase energy and slapped Lilith's rear in hopes of getting her moving, at the same time causing the cheek to wobble and jiggle as the force of the small strikes energy transferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooouch! Okay, okay! I'm moving,\" Lilith said as she began to break out into a jog. As she did so, every excess pound on her body made itself apparent as her breasts bounded up and down, and her gut jiggled like it was made of jelly. Behind her, Maya couldn't help but be slightly mesmerized by Lilith's bum as it wiggled from her movements. Shaking her head to break the gaze, Maya picked up the pace as she felt her own flab wobble. She sincerely hoped that this was a sensation she wouldn't have to get used to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...huff... my god... huff,\" Lilith cried out as she collapsed on her couch in the place she called her home. Maya had been absolutely ruthless in making Lilith sweat of her excess weight, even as the blue-haired Siren struggled to keep up herself. In the end they had exercised for a total of an hour and by the time they called it quits, both girls could barely stand. Maya took that as a sign that more work needed to be done and had Lilith agree to the same thing tomorrow. Sneering at the thought of more physical activity, Lilith was already thinking of ways to blow off her Siren sis by the time she had collapsed at her residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the worse! I can feel myself wasting away already! I'm going to need to 'bulk up' if Maya intends to force me into working out more...\" Lilith remarked as she heaved herself up from the couch. Her stomach was growling mightily and she had seemed to find enough energy to move in her hungry state. After all she had that tray of Eridium brownies that just needed to be frosted and she was eager to find out just how delicious the whole set would be when happily digesting in her flabby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the feeling this is going to be delish.\"</span></div></div>",

As if losing complete control of herself, Maya shoveled the rest of the cupcake into her mouth, crumbs adorning her face as she wasted no time in peeling the cover off another one. In a few mere bites, that cupcake too met it's demise at the hands of the pudgy blue-haired women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a craze that lasted a good 30 minutes (Lilith had left Maya A LOT of cupcakes), she found herself sitting her flabby rear on the ground of her kitchen, wrappers and crumbs everywhere to provide evidence of the cupcake massacre.

Just how much did I drink last night?\" she pondered as she began to feel the sensation of her bare butt on the cold floor. Looking around, all Lilith saw was several empty alcohol bottles and empty tins with filled with crumbs. It was at his point Lilith looked down to see her enormous, flabby gut that had surged forward past her spectacular cleavage, and sat between her juicy thighs as she had her legs spread out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I might've gained a few pounds,\" she chuckled slightly, realizing that she had passed the 'few pounds' threshold ages ago. Heaving herself up off the ground, something that took a ton of effort due to all her muscle having long been replaced with fat, Lilith stretch slightly and couldn't help but hear what sounded like a couple of popping stitches. Her read top that used to cover almost all of her was now struggling in vein to contain her massive breasts, as they jiggled and wobbled for freedom. Lifting her chest with her hands, she was thrilled at their development as her weight had steadily climbed upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moxxi better watch out! She's not the only buxom beauty around here anymore,\" Lilith said as she chuckled while making her way to her bathroom. She was thinking it was time to dust off that scale and see just how much she weighed now. Racking her brains, Lilith remembered she had weighed about 135 pounds before she had starting all her Eridium snacking. She was eager to see just what she tipped the scales at now!</span></div></div>",

Finding things sure was easy in Pandora when most of the time it was marked out for you. Scanning the current area on the map proved useless however as the green diamond indicating their target was pointing to a different section. Deciding to get a better view of the situation, Maya changed screens to find just what exactly the quest was dictating for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Where have they taken all my stuff?\" Lilith asked impatiently as she crossed her arms under her massive breasts, causing a swell of cleavage that seemed like it would end her red top soon if she kept gaining weight or made the slightest puff of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the quest description is less than nice. It calls us 'fatties' and makes remarks about your lack of pants...\" Maya said as she felt a small bit of rage at the inanimate quest screen. She was used to it creating dumb jokes or sarcastic titles by now, but never had one insulted her personally. Then again she had never been so chubby before too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't caaaare Maya,\" Lilith whined. \"It can call me queen of the fatasses! Just where exactly is it telling us to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty far away. It looks like these bandits have taken up shop in what was once home to the Bloodshots. If we start walking now, we can get some decent exercise in and be there in no time flat,\" Maya said as she closed her holoscreens down. Lilith stood there with a tired look on her face, her chubby cheeks and double chin adding to her apparent weariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we already walked all the way here. Can't that be enough exercise for today? Enough walking!\" the red-head remarked as she began to make her way to a conveniently located Catch-a-ride machine. She was eager to sit her plump rump down in some wheels and go cruising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith...\" Maya said in an exasperated tone. She really thought some more walking would do them good but she didn't want to make an already horrible situation for Lilith worse. She may have been her polar opposite, but she was still Maya's friend and a fellow Siren, a bond that very few could share. Maybe driving wouldn't be so bad just this once. She would start them on a proper diet tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh I like this color!\" Lilith remarked with a grin as the machine materialized a car with Scooter's voice shouting 'Catch a Riiiiiiide' during the whole process. Lilith had chosen to go with the compact runner model with a bright bubblegum pink skin. As Maya eyed up the tiny vehicle and compared to their less than small frames, she worried whether or not they would fit in it comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You drive, I gun!\" Lilith said as she hopped up into the turret and prepared to sit her bare bottom into the gunners seat. Maya proceeded to walk up to the drivers seat, and with some slight pushing and squishing of her flab (a sensation she was less than pleased with), she was packed into the car and ready to drive off. Her hips were squeezed tightly however and she could feel her love handles press against the inside of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready Lilith?\" she asked as she began to start the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just... hmmmph! Give me a sec!\" Lilith replied as she tried to lower her bulging booty down. The combined size of her rear end and the overhang of her flabby gut had made for a hard time fitting into the small turret seat. Lilith attempted to mold her fat, and squeeze her flesh to allow her to sit down but instead it was just making her feel winded and out of breath. Resigning herself to have her ass and gut sticking out of the cramped space, she urged Maya to start driving, all the while the blue headed Siren wondering just how ridiculous they must look right now. </span></div></div>",

You'd think those jerks would come right at us and shoot the hell out of the car. Plus we're not exactly small targets either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring how true the weight comment was Lilith wasn't exactly lying about they'd been driving around for the past hour or so without anyone attacking them head on. Sure there was wild skrags about and thankfully a lack of a obnoxious threshers but nothing human for miles. That didn't sit well with Maya as they approached the location belonging to the bandits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it in!\" cried Maya doing her best to assist the bloated redhead out of the seat of the turret!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think I'm doing?!\" yelled back Lilith her outburst and face matching her fiery hair color. The two struggling for sometime longer until at last the heavier woman popped right out nearly collapsing atop of her blue-haired \"sister\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a hand up Lilith did her best to dust herself off especially her incredible-sized backside, afterwards arming herself with one of her trusty SMG's. Maya doing the same only in her case the woman brought out a sniper. While she wasn't at Mordecai's level she was a decent enough shot, phase-locking help as well, and if anything it at least allowed her to scope out the place on the chance they were walking into an ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Maya found it odd that there was no resistance the entire camp site seemed empty devoid of life for what seem like weeks. That is until she spotted a smoke trail coming from further within and that location was the quest marker's. Was that where Lilith's stolen clothing was? She couldn't be sure and the quest info wasn't helpful either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess they had to take the chance, switching on over to an SMG Maya explained that they should head for the area ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was sure that smoke trail was the flamed remains of her clothing and if that were true soon those bandit fools were going meet the same end. Maya telling Lilith to calm down they were bigger so less stealth involved however she still couldn't shake this nagging feeling, something about all this didn't feel right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? That's not my stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough it wasn't Lilith lost clothing what stood before them and made all that smoke was a grand feast!

Clearly Lilith was just shy of the weight limit for the flimsy furniture as her flab hung over the sides. Lilith ignored all this however as she began to shovel food into her mouth as fast as she could. Maya just stood there dumbfounded, not only at Lilith's lack of restraint, but at the fact that she just had started eating without even a second thought at if the food might be dangerous or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith!\" Maya hissed between her teeth as she caught the attention of her rotund friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya don't worry!

Eridium just makes it yum!\" Lilith responded as she wasted no time in moving on to what appeared to be a steak with little Eridium bites in it. Maya just sighed and took a seat (the chair groaning a bit due to her weight as well) next to her friend. She supposed there was little harm in maybe just a few bites. Besides if this was a trap, it would been sprung by now. Maya lowered her guard enough to bite into the wing... and immediately her eyes lit up at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that's amazing!\" she exclaimed as she quickly devoured the rest of it and moved onto another wing. It seemed like both Sirens had fallen to the spell of the Eridium enriched food, as time went one while they stuff their fattening faces. It seemed like there was no end to the buffet in sight, even as Lilith cleared another 6 plates piled high with different food stuffs, Maya not far behind with her own 4 plates. Soon enough Maya took a bite of skag ribs and her belt had had enough as it burst open and her flabby, stuffed gut surged forward slightly. The blue-haired siren wanted to scream at this but instead a thunderous belch was all that escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Excuse me..\" she replied sheepishly as she dug into a burger that was dripping in grease and fat. Lilith just giggled at this all and was thankful she wasn't wearing pants: meant more room for her to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the impressive amount of food found it's home in the bellies of the stuffed sirens, both girls leaned back in their chairs (the creaking getting worse) and let out their own respective belches. Maya rubbed her swollen tummy, so full of food that would no doubt add more inches to her waist and rear. Lilith just wished that there was more to eat as she still was feeling just a bit hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they set up another feast a little bit farther on?\" Lilith asked aloud as Maya dealt with a mix of stuffed ecstasy and shock at what her friend had said. There was no way that Lilith could still be hungry... could she? </span></div></div>",

The sun was shining, the Rakks were currently attacking a Skag, an unlucky bandit tried to fight Terramorphus and was now an unrecognizable stain, and the people of Sanctuary were planing on how to end Handsome Jack's reign of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, pretty normal day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one person in Sanctuary was a bit peeved off. That person was the blue-haired Siren, Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Maya had come to Pandora to learn about Sirens so she could better understand what she was. So, when she learned the Firehawk was in fact the red headed Siren Lilith, she was quite happy. She could finally get some answers from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get any answers, though. Instead, she got fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the week since Maya started hanging around Lilith, she had gained about 80 pounds. Her breasts had blown up considerably, now about 2 cup sizes bigger. Her belly had begun to tear her top open, and made it hard to button her pants. Speaking of which, her butt wasn't helping in that regard either, ripping the back of her pants and giving her a constant wedgie. And she had lost any muscle tone in her arms and legs, replaced with jiggling fat. She even had the beginnings of a second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, she was becoming a butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part was, she knew the problem, but couldn't do anything about it.

After using it for the first time, Maya did learn something: Eridium did power up Sirens, but had different lasting effects. In Liliths case, she was addicted to it, needing \"pick-me-ups\" every so often to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Maya's case, though, it was her appetite. While she didn't devlope a addiction to Eridium, it had thrown her appetite into chaos. At first, she only got a little peckish, having a small snack. But as Lilith insisted on her testing the Eridium, Maya got more and more hungry after every use. Now, she could only go a few hours before needing to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as Lilith kept saying, her Siren powers were stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the two Sirens were in the main Crimson Raider's building. Lilith was leaning against a wall, and Maya was sitting at the Pandora map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Maya began. \"I'll admit it is cool that I can Phase-Lock 4 enemies at once, and that I can use your Phase-Walk, but I don't think I should use Eridium anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Lilith said. \"You're powers have gotten way more awesome then before. I don't think a little fat is going to ruin that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little?\" Maya asked, now annoyed. \"Every time I sit in a chair, I'm worried I'll break it. I need to eat about 10 pounds of food before I'm full. That Eridium has made me a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lilith could say anything, Maya's stomach growled loudly. \"Oh, damn it!\" Maya said. \"We'll discuss this later.\" With that, Maya got up and left to go find something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith watched Maya wobble out of the room. \"She'll calm down after she eats.\" She says.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nLater that night, Maya tried to sleep, but was having trouble. Even though she had eaten earlier, she was still very hungry. Frustrated, she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I fed you already.\" She said to her gut. \"How can you still want more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she got was a growl from her gut. Sighing, she got up and headed for what counted as a kitchen on Sanctuary. When she got there, she looked to see what there was to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One little snack, and that's it.\" Maya said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut can Maya have only one snack?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe she thought Maya needed the extra energy. Or maybe Lilith just started cooking and wanted a taste tester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, Maya could have certainly done without being fed so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was currently night, and things were winding down in Sanctuary for the most part. Axton and Salvador were testing some Corrosive weapons Marcus had \"come into possession of\" (best not to ask where), Gaige and Krieg were in Three Horns Valley slaughtering Psychos by the dozen, Zer0 was doing... something, and Maya was just finishing the 7th plate of cooked Rakk meat that Lilith had put down, only for said red-headed Siren to place an 8th down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, I appreciate the meals, I do, but I'm seriously getting full. You mind letting up a bit?\" Maya asked, trying to sooth her overfed gut by rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last plate, don't worry.\" Lilith replied. \"Though I get the feeling you could fit more in there if tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked at Lilith. \"Was that supposed to be a compliment or a fat joke?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little of both. Mostly a compliment, and the joke wasn't an insult.\" Lilith said. \"Roland needs me upstairs. Apparently he's located a shipment of Eridium that Jack's trying to get. It's coming in from Lynchwood. Taking that shipment would really screw that masked asshat good.\" On that, Lilith walked out of the room with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya groaned and stared at the plate of Rakk meat, then at her swollen gut. It was thanks to Lilith's constant meals that Maya was 80 pounds heavier then she was when she first arrived on Pandora. She was worried that if this went on, she'd be of no help in fighting Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya sighed. \"Tomorrow, I really need to start my workout routine again.\" She said, before digging into the meal in front of her. If anything, cooked Rakk meat actually wasn't too bad.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Maya lumbered her way up to the map room Roland had set up. She just knew that she'd gained more, but right now she couldn't think on that. Roland needed everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the map room, she saw that Axton, Salvador, and Gaige were there, along with Lilith and Mordecai. Krieg and Zer0 were nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Maya.\" Roland said. \"Hope you slept well, we've got some missions lined up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for anything right now.\" Maya replied. \"Might help me shed some of this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Roland said, before walking up to the map of Pandora. \"Here's what we've got. Ellie wants someone out in the Dust to help deal with the clan war between the Zafords and the Hodunks. I figure Salvador could help with that. Axton, I picked up a distress signal from the Bloodshot Ramparts. See if anyone's hurt, or if it's a trap. Maya, I need you to head to the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve. Apparently Tannis wants some research notes from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with Maya.\" Someone interrupted. Maya saw that the interrupter was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within the manor overlooking Lake Ilinalta, a loud yawn could be heard breaking the morning tranquility, followed by the sound of wood creaking under strain. The sounds originated from the sole occupant of the master bedroom of the manor, Aela, a woman once called Aela the Huntress of the Companions. She had mostly given up that life a while after a certain special someone had joined the Companions and quickly shot up the ranks to become Harbinger, helped the Companions through one of their darkest times, and had even let the former Harbinger rest easy by fulfilling his final wish to be cured of his lycanthropy. It had turned out that the whelp was the Dragonborn of legend, destined to save the world from the threat of the World-Eater, the dragon Alduin. It had come as a bit of a shock to Aela, when the Dragonborn came to her and asked for her hand in marriage shortly after their ascension to Harbinger. Having seen their strength of will and character, Aela had accepted and they were married shortly thereafter. After their marriage, they continued to travel together, but always returned to their home together as they built it together till it had become the sprawling manor it was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of her love still caused Aela some pain in recent times, as the wandering spirit had never quite left the Dragonborn, even after the final battle with Alduin, causing them to often head out to seek new adventures from time to time. Aela would normally have gone along on these journeys, but she wasn\u2019t quite up to traveling as much anymore, now being over three times the size that she used to be. The story of how she had came to be like she was started like many others, it started with the Dragonborn. During their travels together, Aela found herself being given far more food that she was used to by her new spouse. Despite the near constant exercise she undertook, Aela soon found herself gaining weight, not much at first, but enough to be noticeable. Despite her efforts, these actions continued, till after confronting them about the situation, she received a shocking confession: the Dragonborn was purposefully plying Aela with an excess of food so that she would gain weight. After a long and drawn-out discussion, Aela had eventually accepted the situation on the condition that she would have the final say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that Aela grew to enjoy the circumstances nearly as much as the Dragonborn did, and her body grew to match soon enough. Eventually, it was decided that Aela would remain at home more often, her weight becoming a bit too much of a hassle for delving through ruins and spending so much time on the road. This resulted in her weight increasing even faster, much to the enjoyment of both Aela and her lover. As of now, Aela had ballooned substantially, a thick layer of fat burying the warrior woman she used to be. Thick curls of red hair cascaded around her plumped face, now devoid of her formerly signature face pain, chubby cheeks spilling into a double chin, as well a third forming. Her plump and firm breasts had taken more than their share of her new fat, expanding out and sagging a bit under their weight. They rested atop the temple to gluttony that her trim belly had become, an orb of soft flesh that nearly constantly hungered to be filled ever further, and pulled on her back fat causing deep rolls to form. Her muscular arms and legs had not been spared either, more and more fatty tissue wrapped around them till she found that movement didn\u2019t come easily to her any longer. Even now, she strained to accomplish the formerly simple task of even getting out of bed. Aela wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her life though, the looks and feelings she got from her spouse was more than enough for her to want to continue on her present course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally rising to her feet, she took some time to steady herself, before moving to the door and greeting the day. Little did she know that her love had returned, and was waiting for her in the main hall. She gave a cry of joy at the sight of the\u2026</span></div></div>",

There is only one solution to this,\" she coldly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel raised her hands, conjured up large fireballs, and sent them flying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... to a pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confection was instantly baked to a golden brown.  Toriel smiled.  \"That is much better.\"  She put on oven mitts and carried the pie from the stove in her kitchen to the dining table in her living room.  There were already five pies on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six butterscotch-cinnamon pies,\" Toriel declared as she set the latest one down on the table.  \"One for each of the...\"  Her voice trailed off, and her eyes grew misty.  She looked away from the table.  \"This is silly, even for an old lady,\" she mumbled to herself.  \"Nothing will bring them back.  Why am I doing this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's eyes came to rest on the easy chair beside the fireplace.  Every single day, Toriel would sit in that chair and read a book aloud, pretending that one of the humans was listening beside her.  That always made her feel a little less lonely, at least briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel turned back to the six pies on the table.  \"... Well, I suppose that this is not much different,\" she smiled.  She sat down in one of the dining chairs and began cutting out a slice of the nearest pie.  \"Now, be sure to clean your plate,\" she said, pretending that she was talking to one of the humans.  She lifted the slice of pie to her mouth and took a big bite.  \"Mmm...\"  Her butterscotch-cinnamon pies were tastier than she had remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite as tasty as her snail pies, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel finished the slice in a few more bites.  She then grabbed the knife, ready to cut out another slice... but she then realized that those young humans probably wouldn't have had such good table manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she lifted the entire pie to her face and started to snarf it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel giggled as she felt butterscotch smearing over her face.  \"Oh, you are making such a mess of yourself!\" she smirked, still pretending that she was talking to a human.  It was a large pie -- big enough for its size to intimidate a human -- but, within only a few minutes, the pie tin was licked clean... and Toriel's face was covered with butterscotch.  She smiled as she slurped some of it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finished that right up!  I suppose that you really liked it, young one?\" she asked the empty room.  \"... What was that?  You want another?  Well, I do not see why not.  Who am I to deny food to a growing boy... or girl.  It is so difficult to tell what gender humans are.\"  And so, Toriel began eating a second large pie... then a third pie... then a fourth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was having so much fun, giggling at the way butterscotch got all over her face, that she didn't notice that she was steadily growing fatter.  Her broad torso developed a round pot belly, forming a noticeable lump underneath her blue dress.  Her hips and buttocks grew wider, beginning to sag off of either side of the chair.  Her chest also swelled, distorting the royal emblem on the upper part of her dress.  Her arms thickened within her white sleeves.  A double chin was starting to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Toriel finished the sixth pie, she was nearly unrecognizable.  Her belly was a swollen mass pushing up against the table's edge, just barely big enough for her dress to cover it all.  Her hippo hips and buttocks sagged off of the chair more than halfway down to the floor.  Her chest was so large that it tugged her dress's neckline down, exposing a bit of her fluffy white cleavage.  Her flabby arms fit snugly in her sleeves.  Her face cheeks were chubby like a chipmunk's, and even her stubby horns and long floppy ears looked thicker than before.  Her double chin was now downright prominent, and was accompanied by a thick neck roll behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel contentedly sighed, leaning back in the chair, which loudly creaked... and then broke into splinters underneath the heavy load that was Toriel.  Her broad rump crashed to the floor with a loud BLORP, and her entire flabby body jiggled like gelatin.  Toriel deeply blushed.  She had been enjoying the eating so much that she did not notice her own growth.  She bashfully rubbed over her broad belly.  Toriel felt so embarrassed by the way she had let herself go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... then she looked around the empty room, and realized that there was no one there to see her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel gave a depressed sigh.  Pretending that she had company again was nice while it lasted, but it never lasted long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Or could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel looked at the six empty pie tins on the table.  Her eyes lit up.  \"How could I forget?  I did not make anything for my first two sons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but steadily, the big gal got up onto her feet, her big body wobbling all the while.  Her broad hips shimmied a few inches to the left and right as she waddled towards the kitchen.  She needed to turn sideways to get through the doorway.  She lumbered up to the fridge and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chara, you always enjoyed snacking right out of the fridge, no matter how many times I told you not to... And Asriel, snails were always your favorite snack.\"  She reached into the fridge and pulled out a huge bucket full of snails.  \"... Just like your mother.\"  She grabbed a pawful of snails and stuffed them into her maw.  Then another.  Then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bucket emptied, Toriel expanded.  Her behind bloated until a good part of the back of her dress bunched up in the fold between her back flab and the top of her tush.  This caused her dress to ride more than halfway up her rear, exposing most of those huge white cheeks and thunder thighs.  Similarly, much of the front of her dress disappeared into the fold between her burgeoning breasts and bloating belly, leaving most of that white, fuzzy, globular gut exposed as it dangled a bit below her knees.  Her swelling chest tugged the top of her dress more and more, leaving a promiscuous amount of her bigger-than-ever cleavage in view.  She developed a triple chin, and two thick neck rolls bunched up against the back of her head.  Her face cheeks, horns, and ears swelled to a downright comical size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Toriel grabbed the last pawful snails in the bucket and shoved them into her mouth.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back; she finally bloated enough to rip her dress to shreds.  Her armfat tore through her sleeves.  Her back flab and wider-than-ever hips shredded the back of her dress, leaving her wrecking-ball-sized buttocks on full display.  Her chest made short work of the front of her dress, her huge breasts (each bigger than her head) finally fully exposed and sagging atop her grand gut, which sagged a few inches above the floor and bloated enough to get wedged in the fridge.  Toriel deeply blushed, held onto the freezer for leverage, and popped her belly out of the fridge.  She was not used to her new weight, and the sudden movement sent her staggering a few steps backward.  Each step shook the walls and made some pebbles fall from the cavern's ceiling right outside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face cheeks still a bright crimson, the naked Toriel started awkwardly waddling out of the kitchen.  She turned sideways, but her belly and behind still got caught in the doorway, her flab bulging out into both the kitchen and the living room.  It took a few minutes to squeeeeeze herself out.  She then lumbered toward her bedroom.  Luckily, the doorways on either end of her foyer were much wider than the one between her kitchen and living room... but Toriel was so wide that her hips just barely cleared the foyer's doorways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel lumbered along, feeling sluggish.  She was so obese that each of her buttcheeks jiggled separately with each ponderous step of her thick thighs.  Her hips shimmied at least half a foot to the left and right as she moved along.  Her belly occasionally bounced low enough to slap the floor, making her chest moosh up into her chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was so heavy that she was winded by simply moving from the kitchen to her bedroom door.  She opened the door, turned sideways, started lumbering inside, and promptly got stuck in the doorframe.  A few minutes of squeeeeezing later, she was in her bedroom, and ready for some well-deserved rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to her bed and sat down on it, making the bedframe loudly creak.  She then lay on her back.  Even though her bed was large -- definitely bigger than a twin -- the right side of her gut and butt bunching up against the wall while the left side sagged off the mattress and onto the floor.  The bedframe survived the immense weight for a few seconds, then was smashed to pieces, leaving Toriel lying on a flattened mattress atop a pile of wooden debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel sighed.  Her loneliness was getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure... the next time that a human fell into the Ruins, Toriel would not let them leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to, she would sit on them.</span></div></div>",

Sure, the Queen, my older sister, can be...\"aggressive\" at times, but...\" Morgana retorted, where she then squeezed her puffy arms around Mila's round abdomen a bit in reassurance, as she then continued, \"...You did what you believed was right, and I'll stick by your choice, WE'LL stick by your choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mila then turned herself around to face the chubby feline Morgana, where she soon proceeded to wrap her plump arms around the tubby princess with a hearty loving embrace and said, \"...Thank you, Morgana.\" But suddenly, Mila's stomach then began to growl aloud, causing the fat tan feline to blush profusely in slight embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Morgana giggled a little from such an embarrassing action of the body. \"*giggle* Well, it sounds like a certain feline I know is starting to feel famished.\" Morgana chirped, lightly patting Mila's pronouned belly, which made Mila blush just a tad more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after the blooming romance between her and the plump Princess Morgana, how could she say no to someone so loving and kind? In response, Mila displayed a loving smile upon her plump cherubic face and said, \"On that, Morgana... I couldn't agree with you more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the two fat felines planted a brief but passionate kiss upon one another's lips, where they then proceeded toward the Captain's Quarters for some \"personal\" time with each other.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was shining out over a beautiful day on the Wumpa Islands, with the perfect amount of puffy white clouds in the sky and all the lush wildlife in full, beautiful bloom. Of course, not that Coco'd know that at the moment, or care too much. She'd been cooped up inside for almost a week straight, lounging around the cozy little house near the beach which she, her brother, and their mystical mentor- Aku Aku- shared with one another. Why should she get out and enjoy the tropical paradise she was lucky enough to live in anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd go outside when she felt like it, eventually, and she had all her stuff in here! Her laptop was always plugged in, so she didn't have to worry about it dying, and she had a TV with five different gaming consoles hooked up- It was a necessity, after all how else was she gonna play all the exclusive games? She also had a slightly larger, more powerful PC- which she would use for coding, running more intensive programs than her laptop could handle, or...playing other, different games. Also, a VR headset! She even had a small collection of drones, and little robots with extendo arms which she could- and often would- have bring her snacks and things when she didn't feel like getting up. Having picked up a lot of her technological equipment and skills on adventures thwarting mad scientists who could've taken over the world if it weren't for her and her brother, she'd accumulated some pretty advanced stuff after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand, well, there being no particularly powerful or threatening mad scientists popping up lately, Coco hadn't been getting much activity recently. Crash still loved to go out and run around the island, busting up boxes and jumping on natives and all this other stuff he liked to do, even when he didn't have an end goal in mind. But Coco was a bit more...practical. She was perfectly content with her sedentary lifestyle, laying there on her bed or on the couch or in her big cushiony computer chair, playing some videogame or fiddling around with new machines she was building or eating cheap snack foods. Staying up super late, taking frequent naps, forgetting to shower, graduating from three to six meals a day...it was inevitably starting to show on the spry young marsupial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>bruUUurrrp</b></i>- Crash? Hey, Crash!\" Coco called out, alerting her brother- who happened to be inside, trying to master some kind of yo yo trick. Coco was on her bed, where she'd been since she moved there from her computer chair yesterday after dinner, stayed up playing games until 4 am, passed out, woke up, had breakfast, and was currently trying to program a functional physics engine to go with the modeling software she'd made a while ago. She was....portly. Her pink shoes were kicked off and laying near the door, where they'd been for weeks- She hadn't changed her outfit once, the slightly yellowish tint and visible dampness of her white T-shirt and tight, dirty socks (which had a few holes in them) showed that off. Her hair was in a ponytail, like usual, but it was messy- a few strands loose and some bedhead which she'd lazily mitigated by brushing through it with her greasy fingers. She had an inch thick layer of pudge around her body, more than an inch in places- With the bit of skin between her chin and neck filling out with fat, it was at the point where it bunched into an undeniable double chin when she looked down at her screen. The sleeves of her T-shirt dug into her upper arm fat, which folded around her elbow like pudgy fleshy water wings. the one strap of her overalls which was buttoned was being pushed into a bit, digging into her chest- which suddenly had gone up a few cup sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her you could see the crossed part of the straps pressing similarly into her back fat, with her butt protruding especially far. As she lay on her side, her hip rose a good foot or two into the air. The denim of her overalls' legs was tight around her own, which probably gave her squishy fatty thighs more definition than they would've had on their own. She also didn't smell particularly good, you could liken her body odor to a pile of extensively used gym socks, fresh ones. Also her breath had a sort of saccharine funk, the result of excessive consumption of sweets without the necessary...teeth brushing. Once Coco got her brother's attention, she held up an empty box of mini powdered donuts- As if it wasn't painfully obvious enough why it was empty, she still had the sugar around her lips and on her fingers. \"I'm out of snacks- Do you think you could run down to the store and get me some more? Remember, you can use the warp pad to get to the place they sell this stuff.\" She said, remembering how the first time she asked this of him, Crash couldn't find a store on the island, so he collected her a bunch of berries and nuts. She still ate them of course- It was sweet- but he needed reminding of some things. \"Just normal stuff- Chips, donuts, candy, soda, microwavable stuff...You know, whatever you can get your hands on.\" Coco said, idly adjusting her overalls over her utterly massive belly, sprawling out in front of her as she laid on her side, pulling her overalls as tight as they'd go, even oozing off the side of the bed a tiny bit. \"Just don't keep me waiting too long, or I might get hungry enough to have to have dinner early!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrash was a simple bandicoot-He liked to run around in the jungle, pester some of the natives now and again (which was sometimes a little justified-They had tried to sacrifice him more than once) and, if all else fails, he'd simply take a nap. Maybe there was more to life than that, but if there was, Crash didn't care...or rather, he didn't know about it. Thinking wasn't always his strong suit, although he had Cortex to thank for messing up his brains into the state they were now-however, Cortex hadn't shown up for a long time now-last Crash or the others heard of him, he and Uka Uka had been sucked away into a portal or something. With all this free time on his hand, Crash had gotten....well, even more antsy than usual. He had grown so used to having to fight off mutant Tasmanian Tigers, Dingo Crocodile hybrids, and a plethora of other baddies spanning countless planes of realities and worlds that the stagnant lifestyle he had was starting to get to him. Sure, he didn't mind snoozing or relaxing now and again...but his impulsive nature had begun leaving him feeling bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Coco had called for him, he had to restrain himself from smashing through the wall of her room in excitement-he'd wave over to her with a smile, although he did wrinkle his nose a bit when he caught a whiff of her serious BO. When WAS the last time she bathed? Crash didn't pay it much mind, although he was already aching to get on the road. Coco had told him to run down to the store and buy some more snacks, Crash giving a nod of understanding before hurrying back out the door. Along the way, he ended up tripping over Polar and Pura who were cuddled up on the carpet in the living room. The loud din he created attracted his mentor's attention, Aku Aku floating down from his perch and raising an aged, wooden brow at finding Crash with his tongue being bitten by Pura as Polar had him pinned down, the bandicoot giving an embarrassed cackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pura and Polar untangled themselves and walked off to find a new place to sleep that would hopefully keep them out of range of Crash's destructive bumbling, Aku Aku would press Crash about what on earth he was in such a rush for. A bit of gibberish and babbling was Crash's reply, although the words 'Coco' were intermingled within his otherwise unintelligible explanation. \"Already? Crash, didn't she send you out on a grocery run earlier today?\" Crash rubbed his chin in thought, the Bandicoot trying to recall the events of his day-he had remembered getting some Wumpa Fruit, then after that he remembered running into some of the islanders who were still a bit sore from Crash accidentally knocking over their canoes. Then he saw a bird. Then he saw-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crash, I think it's about time you admit to yourself Coco's laziness is getting out of hand...\" Aku Aku remarked, cutting Crash's train of thought short.
