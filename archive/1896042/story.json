Now I'm nearly a half an hour late!\" you exclaim as you weave through the crowd towards the Domino City dueling arena. Dodging a hotdog vendor, you see that you are on a collision course with a woman pushing a stroller. Not wanting to run into the stroller you force your board to the right and off of the path, causing you to wipe out. \"Man that was close.\" you say as you pick yourself off of the ground, only to notice that your deck holder had been knocked off. \"Why did this have to happen now?\" You ask to no one in particular as you scramble to find your deck. After several minutes of searching and having no luck, you contemplate on giving up and heading home, only to hear a voice behind him. \"Young man, is this yours?\" Turning around you see a white haired man with a red suite on holding your red and black deck box. \"Yes thanks I wouldn't be able to take my rating test without it, which reminds me. I\"M LATE!! THANKS MAN!\" You yell as you take off running towards the arena, leaving a trail of dust and a chuckling man behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Domino City arena a large amount of duels were just finishing up, \"Congrats number 2001 on winning your duel and let me be the first to welcome you to the Obelisk Blue Dorms, Miss Julie .\" a teenager in a blue trench coat said to a girl who was about 5'8, with dirty blonde hair, and a body any women would kill for. Julie just bowed respectfully to her proctor before heading back to the stands to continue to watch the other duels in progress. 'Where the hell are you (Insert your name)?' Julie wondered as she sat down, her duel didn't take very long thanks to her fairy deck. As the proctor reached the three thousands. \"Hey Julie I didn't miss my match did I?\" You ask your best friend as you sit behind her, causing her to jump in surprise. \"No but you were cutting it a little close don't you think?\" she said, while looking around to make sure no one else noticed your late arrival, seeing that  no one did she turned back to you, missing the glare that a certain professor sent you. 'Slacker' the man thought when he noticed your late arrival. <br>\r\n\"Well sorry, I was up most of the night getting my deck ready, and then my Sportster broke down so I had to ride my board here.\" You say as you notice the look that she was giving you. \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You better be serious, cause last time you said that you didn't change a thing except add a single card.\" She said <br>\r\n\"A, well it was still enough to beat your fairy deck.\" You said with a smirk. Before she could come up with a come back the loud speaker boomed, \"Would number 3369 please report to the dueling field for your exam.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, wish me luck.\" You say as you walk down the stairs.<br>\r\nBack at the proctors table one of the Obelisk's was about to get up only to be forced down by the professor beside him. \"I got this one.\" The professor said with an air of arrogance and a feminine sounding voice, as he slid a deck from his pocket into his custom duel disk. \"Uhm, Professor Crowler aren't  you going to use a test deck?\" one of the Student proctors asked.<br>\r\n\"No this boy shows the same amount of confidence as Jaden did, though his test score were on par with one Atticus Rhodes. So if I don't take him seriously from the beginning, I won't know what his true skill level is.\" Professor Crowler said as he walked onto the field. As you waited for your opponent to arrive you began to mentally go over your deck, a very powerful Dragon beat down type which contained:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonsters:<br>\r\n3x. Blue eyes white dragons<br>\r\n3x. Lord of D.<br>\r\n3x. Prime material dragon<br>\r\n3x.

As the coin lands you see that it landed on tails meaning you could chose first or second. \"Well I might as well get this show started.\" You say as you drew your five cards before drawing your sixth Looking at your hand you see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Inside was a large luxurious room, with two big beds, equally big wardrobe (from this perspective), two computers, two bathroom, each looking fully stocked, other various things like furniture and cupboards, and a Julie. She had already gotten changed, she was now posing in front of a mirrior, in the obelisk blue uniform. \"I've got to say, that suites you.\"<br>\r\nShe turned around, \"You mean that?\" she asked feeling flattered. \"Yes, you do look cute in it.\"<br>\r\nShe looked extremely happy, \"Come on Froslad, lets see you in your,\" she said jumping in joy, and pointing a box on your bed.<br>\r\nA faint smile formed, but it was not to last, I opened the box, I was shock stiff, embarrassed and unable to move. Julie laughed.<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do!?\" You ask offended and confused.<br>\r\n\"Put it on,\" she stopped laughing to say, before breaking out into laughing again.</span></div></div>",
