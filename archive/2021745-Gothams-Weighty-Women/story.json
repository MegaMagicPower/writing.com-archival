Inquire within the chapter choice for more specifics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman, Kate Kane, is the daughter of an Army general. She uses her family\u2019s money and her father\u2019s resources to fight crime. Sometimes it\u2019s because she was inspired by Batman, sometimes it\u2019s because of a similar drive to his and nothing more. No matter the depiction, Kate Kane is almost always depicted as an avid lesbian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna Zatara, real name (right?), is a magician. Like, a <i>real</i> magician. She has access to actual magic, saying her spells backwards to whatever effect that she so pleases, just like her father Zatara. While she\u2019s technically mobile in her operations, Gotham has a long history of supporting the Zataras and she has teamed up with Batman more than a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Huntress, Helena Bertellini, is a mob bosses\u2019 daughter. But she fights the mob, so she\u2019s cool. Not a lot of people approve of the way she does things though. Helena has a nasty tendency to shoot her perps in the face with a crossbow. Does not play well with others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More on that at 5.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The recognizable voice of Vicki Vale droned on the tv. Barb (Barbara Gordon) was drinking coffee, working on here exam report while her room mate Kate longed on the couch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are baffled by the sudden increased weight in the female population of Gotham. Some say that it is lack of governmental restrictions, others say it is just a new fashion trend, few even blame it on the new coffee shops in town. All we do know is that the general public don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem too worried and some openly embrace it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vicki had been clear evidence of this new trend as her belly had started pushing against the buttons of her pants suit and she had to have gone up one cup size at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe half the thing they say on the news any more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate mumbled when she changed the channel to Gotham crimes a show about the Batman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meany fights. Barb didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care for the show as it was really just a joke to the real events. Barb not wanting to watch the show stood up to get some coffee from \u00e2\u0080\u0098A Cup Of Gotham\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which was just around the corner. She grabbed a pair of pants she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out in sweats. As soon as she pulled them up she knew it was going to be a battle the felt snug all around and when she tried the button it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get close. She sucked it in, she tugged and pulled until sweat dripped from her forehead then with one last pull it was done. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I really need to cut back on the sweats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Barbara thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going out to get coffee you want anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barb asked at the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, could you please get me a couple of their bear claws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate perked up at the thought of their pastry. Barbara looked at her friends gut which stuck out from under her shirt and thought that Kate didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need any more sweats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure Kate what ever you want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Barbara walked down the street.

And Barbara hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been called for duty in months maybe she would never be called up again if crime kept going down like this.

In an unexpected way. In just a few days, Barbara began to notice how some of the female students have rapidly gained an absurd amount of weight in such little time. And boy, the female students aren't too pleased with having a bigger waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this looks like a job for Batgirl! But when her investigation leads to her former friend/former flame, Harleen Quinzel AKA Harley Quinn, this leads the Batgirl of Burnside to stumble upon a cream-filling conspiracy of fattening proportions! Can Batgirl prevent the whole of Burnside's female populace from wearing burgeoning bellies for good? And will she stop this blubbery conspiracy without herself succumbing to such bloating temptations? Who can she rely on for aid? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTune in to find out!</span></div></div>",

Despite that, she\u2019s actually quite friendly and donates quite frequently to charities. No superpowers whatsoever. She just <i>really</i> likes to steal things. And cats. She also likes cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up the rear is Talia al Ghul, real name, who is a woman kept young and beautiful for hundreds of years through the use of Lazarus pits, like her father Ra\u2019s. She\u2019s mysterious and deadly, and has a whole legion of assassins at her beck and call.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Why did they even bother to host these things anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, in a place like Gotham City, the annual Policeman\u2019s Ball could have never ended well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWayne Manor\u2019s chandelier lighting cast an eerily upbeat glow on the whole scene. Gotham\u2019s bravest men and women huddled under tables or hugging the floor, praying softly to themselves in their finest clothes that they would make it through the night alive. Tables had been toppled and almost every window in the whole room had been shattered. Armed guards held the officers captive, holding them back in a nice semicircular formation. Fortunately Gotham\u2019s favorite son, Bruce Wayne, had escaped just in time to avoid most of the action. That poor girl in the middle, however, wasn\u2019t so lucky\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker had crashed his fair share of parties before. With his penchant for multiple counts of homicide and his not-so-harmless gag toys, imposing himself on the (mostly) good folks of the GCPD was hardly worth tacking onto his rap sheet. Holding them up at gunpoint even, courtesy of his veritable army of grease-painted thugs, was nothing new. The fact that he had made his entrance by popping out of a cake, completely naked except for a pair of purple gloves and a sash of caution tape, was something entirely unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, his interest in the new transfer from Keystone City was more troubling than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Officer Sennett, I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on you.\u201d the Joker rasped, pacing back and forth in front of the woman as she sobbed quietly into the tiled floor of Wayne Manor, \u201cEver since you got off that bus and wandered into Gotham City, for whatever reason, I just <i>knew</i> that you and I were going to get along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer in question was an average looking woman. Blonde hair, brown eyes, and a slightly taller build than most. Officer Mackenzie Sennett had just transferred from Keystone a few weeks ago, straight into the GCPD\u2019s Major Crimes Unit. She\u2019d put on her pretty blue dress and thought that she might go out and enjoy a good old fashioned party after the hard time she\u2019d had adjusting to the grim atmosphere of Gotham City\u2014maybe meet a nice guy, go out for a few drinks afterwards, and really just try to forget the past few days of costumed nonsense that plagued the people in her line of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, that wasn\u2019t happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d she whimpered, looking down at her knees as the naked psychopath paced in front of her, struggling against the rope restraining her hands \u201cWhuh\u2026 What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a <i>good</i> question, Mac. Well we all know Christmas is just around the corner, so maybe you and the boys and girls in blue could all chip in and get me something nice. A new suit. A pony. One of those little boxes from Hillshire Farms with sausage and cheeses in it?\u201d his inhuman smile grew wider as he let out a roaring laugh, \u201cBut no, tonight isn\u2019t about <i>me</i>\u2014which explains why it\u2019s such a lousy party\u2014but rather, tonight is about <i>you</i>! Everyone in the old Gee-Cee-Pee-Dee but, more specifically, <b>you</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice lowered to a hiss as the final word left his lips. Poor Officer Sennett looked up, terrified and confused. Back in Keystone City, back home where she should be right now, Mackenzie had heard horror stories about Gotham City. She never took much stock in it\u2014which was odd, considering how weird <i>her</i> home town got sometimes, but why should she have? What city allows a psychopathic killer clown to run around and torture people for his amusement? How could any of it have been real? They were just horror stories back then; ways for Johnson and LeBarbara to tease her. Just horror stories for cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t even know you\u2026\u201d she whimpered, \u201cPuh\u2026please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now, you don\u2019t have to get all teary-eyed about it!\u201d Joker roared, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really, just a little \u2018welcome to the force\u2019 gift me and the Missus put together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2026 the missus?\u201d Mackenzie bawled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right, I almost forgot!\u201d Joker slapped his head dramatically, \u201cI never introduced you two! See you\u2019re still new to town and so you <i>might</i> not have heard of my lovely assistant.\u201d His voice returned from falsely apologetic to energetic as he faced the sea of goons holding the officers hostage, \u201cCome on out, Harl! And make sure to smile, after all it is <i>her</i> party!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his insistence the crowd of grease-painted thugs parted slightly to reveal Harley Quinn, his number one henchwench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow's Harley looking these days?</span></div></div>",

A pale, spritely woman with two pigtails\u2014one red and one black\u2014sauntered past the party guests hugging the floor. She was dressed in a curious combination of clothes, all red and black, that hugged her lean figure and exposed her ghastly white skin. She had a big blue box on her back, held by two leather straps over her shoulders, and something big and powerful. Lugging all that around looked to be too much for the slight slip of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Puddin\u2019!\u201d she announced with a thick Jersey accent as she struggled with her load, \u201cJust\u2026 gimme a minute\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">woof this thing\u2019s heavy</font>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Joker\u2019s woman made it over to them. Now that it was closer, Mackenzie could clearly see that the big powerful part of her \u2018present\u2019 was very similar to a handgun in design, just made much larger. The barrel was exposed over the top half, and made with wire framing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Sennett meet Harley, Harley meet Officer Sennet.\u201d Joker said with a smile, \u201cHarley, <i>this</i> is the woman that we went to all that trouble of making our little gift for! Now, you\u2019ll go with me on this right? Doesn\u2019t her name sound\u2026 <i>familiar</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Harley dropped the big gun on its butt and leaned up against it, touching her white chin with a black glove, \u201cYa know, I think you\u2019re right Mistah Jay! Her name does sound familiar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stood there for a second, making contemplative noises as the crowd watched in delayed agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it: <i>A Noise from the Deep</i>, that old movie from 19-whatever!\u201d Harley snapped her fingers excitedly, her baby blues widening with deceptive innocence, \u201cAnyone ever tell you you got the same name as that old comedian Mack Sennett?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d Mackenzie sobbed, \u201cPlease, I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Joker barely tried to hide his malevolence, despite his chipper tone of voice, \u201cAnd, tell me again darling, <i>what</i> was that old duffer famous for again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please, I just want to go home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistah Jay, I\u2019m surprised at you!\u201d Harley put her hands on her hips playfully, her head tilting to the side in mock disappointment, \u201cMack Sennett was the guy who made the pie in the face gag!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker smacked his forehead again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh darling I do believe you\u2019re right!\u201d Joker said in incredulous shock, \u201cSilly me, how could I forget? Such a timeless classic\u2014think about it now, Officer. You\u2019re at this party right, when suddenly some guy dressed up as a clown pops out of the cake and throws a pie at your face! It\u2019s so <i>delicious</i>ly funny I can\u2019t even begin to think how such a thing could even come to be\u2026 oh wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley and the Joker laughed, throwing their heads back in obviously staged laughter that devolved into malicious maniacal giggling. It frightened the whole room. A whole ballroom filled with seasoned cops and veterans on the force, feeling their hearts skip a beat at the sound of two people dressed up as clowns (rather, undressed in one case), completely helpless to help their newest partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, like all the classics, I\u2019m going to give you the gift that keeps on giving, dollface.\u201d Joker turned his attention back to Officer Sennett, \u201cHarley and I worked <i>really</i> hard on your present. So you\u2019re going to have to lie and tell us you like it, even if you really don\u2019t. So-ree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re that couple.\u201d Harley stuck out her tongue as she dropped the big blue backpack to the floor, \u201cJust gimme a minute sweetie, I\u2019ll be right with ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley bent over, giving everyone in the room a good look at her tight toned ass, as she rummaged through the backpack. It didn\u2019t take long for her to return to the conversation, coming back with a pie tin with a plastic lid over the top. She removed the container\u2019s top half and took a deep whiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm! Banana Cr\u00e8me!\u201d she said dreamily, \u201cMistah Jay and I spent <i>weeks</i> slaving over a hot rocket launcher while those stupid chemists spent <i>weeks</i> getting threatened by a hot rocket launcher to get this recipe <i>just</i> right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley picked up the gun with surprising ease (the backpack must have been the heavy part) and rested it on her shoulder. With her free hand, she placed the pie on the wire barrel and pulled back on something on the handle\u2014apparently loading the strange device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s tears only grew hotter and thicker as they rolled down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look Poo, Mack here likes it so much she\u2019s crying!\u201d Joker guffawed, \u201cWell, if what those brainiacs told me was true, you\u2019re going to like our little gift so much, <i>that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be able to think about</i>!\u201d Joker whipped back to Harley, \u201cGive it to \u2018er, girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d a little scope popped out of the side as Harley lined her sight with it, \u201cI\u2019d say hold still, but\u2026 y\u2019know.

Mackenzie Sennett was knocked onto her butt, landing on her hogtied hands behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker roared with laughter, slapping his naked knee as he watched Officer Sennett struggle to make her way back up to a kneeling position. The crowd of police officers, reduced to little more than sniveling onlookers of his most recent prank, could do little more than avert their gaze as the naked Clown Prince of Crime slowly walked his way over to his latest victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Harley, I\u2019m starting to doubt as to whether or not Mack here liked our little gift.\u201d Joker said in feigned remorse, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell with all this cr\u00e8me on her face, but you do understand what I\u2019m saying?

They took longing looks at one another, desperate for an answer in their sick improv act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more wittle try?\u201d Harley coochy-cooed the wriggling officer from a distance, incoherent mumbling her only definitive answer, \u201cI\u2026 think that\u2019s a yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough for me!\u201d Joker announced, \u201cWhaddaya say, Harl?

The cause? A small, bat-shaped projectile was lodged in the chassis. Little sparks of friction flew as the gears still attempted to turn, causing the machine to grow steadily hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot tonight, Joker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemed to come from nowhere, yet at the same time seemed to emanate from every wall in Wayne Manor. It was dark and heavy, \u2018Joker\u2019 may as well have been the most disgusting word in the dictionary. The crowd looked around, temporarily broken from the trance of fear that the Harlequin of Hate had placed them under. Even Harley couldn\u2019t help but whip her neck back and forth in hopes of gaining the upper-hand against her most persistent of foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who didn\u2019t seem fazed was the Joker himself, who stared piercingly towards the chandelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just <i>knew</i> you\u2019d come!\u201d Joker answered lovingly, \u201cIf I know one thing it\u2019s that there\u2019s not a party in town you don\u2019t want to leave your <i>guano</i> all over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuddin\u2019, what should we\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Quiet, you\u2019ll ruin our back and forth!</i>\u201d Joker snapped at his henchwench before returning to the matter at hand, \u201cI figured you might show up, you ol\u2019 spoil-sport, but you\u2019re too late, Batman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadowy figure drops from the chandelier to the floor, rising to reveal...</span></div></div>",

She emerged not long after, lunging at a pair of goons fist-first and knocking their heads together. Thanks to her training, Batgirl managed to outmaneuver the Joker\u2019s firing squad and their shaky hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Joker had made his daring escape, kicking over Officer Sennett and making a mad dash for protection amidst the commotion, leaving Harley alone to defend herself. She had been wrestling with the batarang lodged into the chassis of her pie-rifle, trying to unwedge the little thing\u2019s wing from the gears before the friction caused it to overheat. After a few minutes of struggling she managed to pop it out, and the machine slowly came to life again. Stepping over Officer Sennett with one of her long white legs, Harley happily announced her arrival into the ensuing battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay to crash our party, Brat-girl!\u201d Harley huffed as she plopped her launcher over her shoulder, lining her sights with the ever-moving blur that was Batgirl, \u201cHey hold still, ya little shiksa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley pulled the trigger, sending a pie towards her henchmen and target at high velocities.

She had pulled all of her men onto fighting Batgirl, leaving none to make sure the cops weren\u2019t making a break for their guns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParty\u2019s over, Harley.\u201d The Commissioner said flatly as he held he held her at gunpoint, his arms outstretched and the barrel of his pistol pointed right at her, \u201cYou\u2019re going back to Arkham Asylum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, Harley looked around for anything she could use to help aid her in this situation. She hadn\u2019t planned on her Puddin\u2019 bailing on her, so she hadn\u2019t brought her giant hammer. The only thing she had with her was pies! Slowly, Harley reached down and grabbed the last of her banana cr\u00e8me arsenal\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarleen, I <i>will</i> shoot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014and made a mad dash for the Commissioner, roaring as she ran towards the mustachioed man holding a gun at her. Her black and red pigtails bobbing behind her, the ghostly white woman ran as fast as she could towards him, practically able to see his trigger finger twitching, before suddenly being kicked to the side, sliding across the floor after the impact of two yellow bat boots knocked her right onto her tuchas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Harley, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s allergic.\u201d Batgirl said with a smile as she sauntered over to the pie and picked it up off of the floor, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with these things anyway? You seriously did all of this just so you could throw pie in some people\u2019s faces? There are <i>way</i> easier ways of rebelling against authority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowled redhead walked over to Harley, holding the pie in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how you like a taste of your own medicine, Harley\u2026\u201d she said with a little smirk as she tipped the tin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 please, no!\u201d Harley\u2019s eyes grew wide with terror, \u201cNot the pie, anything but tha\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!</span></div></div>",

Her men may have had bigger guns, but Gordon\u2019s had a better shot. It didn\u2019t take long for everything to settle back to normal\u2014or at least as normal as anything got in this city\u2014as some of the other cops who hadn\u2019t been able to attend the Policeman\u2019s Ball made their way to the scene. Even Bruce Wayne managed to show back up, once the danger was over of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommissioner Gordon stood next to Harvey Bullock, a large unshaven man who often reeked of alcohol. Tonight was no exception. Despite the fact that he hadn\u2019t been invited to the event, which meant he was probably drinking on-duty again. Everyone was taking statements and giving their account of the events while Montoya helped Harley into a pair of handcuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it, Commish.\u201d Harvey scratched his greasy head as he looked over the destroyed ballroom, \u201cWhy would the Clown pull something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does he do <i>anything</i>, Harvey?\u201d Gordon let out a sagely puff of exhaustion from underneath his ginger mustache, \u201cA room full of cops, and we just allowed ourselves to be taken hostage like this.

At least now that my face is all clean, anyway.\u201d Officer Sennett said through a mouthful of cr\u00e8me, a big dollop of the stuff still left on her index finger. The blonde woman placed it in her mouth and suckled on it dreamily before releasing it, somehow astonished at the expressions on the two incredulous veterans of Gotham City. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you <i>nuts</i>, Sennett?!\u201d Harvey bellowed, \u201cHow could you eat that? From what I hear, you should be the <i>last</i> person in this room who could go for some pie right now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Bullock, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Officer Sennett rolled her eyes, \u201cSo your little clown guy threw a pie in my face.

Gordon outstretched an arm and put it across Harvey\u2019s chest stoically, his head hung low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet it go, Harvey.\u201d Gordon said, raising his glasses to pinch at the bridge of his nose, \u201cLet\u2019s just be thankful that this was one of his <i>harmless</i> days\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

They were done too tight, causing the white skin around her wrist to swell slightly over the cuffs as she tried in vain to wriggle them out.

Arkham Asylum was a good way\u2019s away from this side of town, meaning that they had at least a good forty minutes of awkward cop/criminal silence ahead of them. What was worse, the cold weather and Christmas season were upon them, meaning that traffic was particularly impossible today of all days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley let out several disengaging moans as she rolled her head against the back of her seat. Her face was starting to swell up thanks to Batgirl and her stupid yellow boots; there was a big purple lump on her cheek and a matching bruise on her shoulder that bore the faint outline of a bat just below the shoulder blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuugh.\u201d Harley whined as she stared up at the ceiling of the car, \u201cAre we <i>there</i> yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Montoya took a slurp of her coffee, \u201cQuiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuugh.\u201d She moaned again, her head rolling disinterestedly, \u201cThis is so <i>boring</i>. Can\u2019t we at least turn on the radio or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said quiet, Quinn!\u201d Montoya barked before promptly going back to ignoring her perp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley huffed and rolled her big blue eyes, blowing a puff of air to move the strand of black hair from in front of her face. She glanced out the window\u2014nothing but bright lights and honking cars. The window was cold against her forehead, and she let out the most pitiful sigh she could muster as a million thoughts raced through her head.  How was she going to get out of this one? Where was her Puddin\u2019? How could Brat-girl have taken down an entire squad of mooks like that? How many polaks did it take to screw in a lightbulb? Her mind was a complicated mess of emotions as she stared out into the city\u2014however everything came to a close as a tell-tale sound broke the awkward silence between the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRGLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley winced as a powerful pain pinched her from the inside out. It took her a moment to register what had just happened, but upon realizing that her stomach had just rumbled, Harley\u2019s eyes widened with noticeable terror. She immediately hung her head down to look at her stomach as another disconcerting groan escaped her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Harley whispered with genuine fear, \u201cNo I\u2026 I thought I hadn\u2019t\u2026 Batgirl\u2026 I couldn\u2019ta\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I said <i>quiet</i> Quinn!\u201d Montoya leaned back around to look at Harley through the protective glass separating the front and back seats, \u201cYou won\u2019t like it if I\u2019ve gotta come back there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley squinched her eyes shut as another painful hunger pang overcame her, her stomach crying out in agony as the toxin she and the Joker had created began to affect her. Surely she wasn\u2019t being affected by her own creation, right? That chemical bath she\u2019d done had given her <i>lots</i> of immunities to poison\u2014surely this was one of them, right? Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came in the form of a particularly bad hunger pang, one that caused her to fall over onto her side in the back seat of the car. She lay on her red pony-tail as she began to salivate, watching enviously as Montoya took a slurp of that fancy, sugary coffee from the Starbucks down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026\u201d Harley moaned just under the enormous sounds her stomach was making, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 feel so hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn?\u201d Montoya glanced into the rear-view mirror, \u201cHey, answer me Quinn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley\u2019s noises sounded an awful lot like she was dying. Like something was going to burst right out of her chest\u2014and it a city like Gotham, Montoya had learned that just about anything was possible. Despite the fact that she was a crazy clown killer, Montoya didn\u2019t need a dead perp on her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey!\u201d Montoya turned around to see the drooling, moaning harlequin in the back of her seat, \u201c<i>Madre de dios</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMontoya grabbed the police radio from her console and pressed the button on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Officer Montoya calling in an 11-41 at the corner of Lincoln and March, I repeat this is Officer Montoya requesting an ambulance on the corner of Lincoln and March. I\u2019ve got a passenger back here having some kind of breakdown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery Latina woman cut the corner through traffic and pulled herself out of the mess of cars, rolling off of the highway and coming to a sudden jerking stop. Surely enough, she was at the corner of Lincoln and March Street, a popular spot on her route. Renee hopped out of the car and rushed over to Harley\u2019s side, pulling open the door and bending down to check on her transpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuinn?\u201d she asked, grabbing Harley by the jaw forcefully, \u201cHey, stay with me Quinn. What the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley\u2019s stomach made another painful-sounding grumble, enough to take Officer Montoya back a little. The cinnamon-skinned officer winced at the horrible sounds Harley\u2019s body was making\u2014it was hard listening to something like that. And with her history with the Joker, who had a background in just about every awful thing that anyone could do to another person, he could have done literally anything to her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley?\u201d Montoya asked softly, \u201cAre you\u2026 are you gonna be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two-toned tart looked up at Officer Montoya with bleary blue eyes, still wincing at the pain she was experiencing. She recoiled slightly at another pang, causing Montoya to move her grip from Harley\u2019s face to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose\u2026 damn pies\u2026\u201d Harley whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPies?\u201d Montoya repeated, \u201cBack at the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Harley struggled to answer, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the officer shook her slightly, \u201cHarley, come on you\u2019ve got to tell me what you put in them so we know how to help y\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKA-RACK!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley\u2019s head suddenly shot up, cracking across Montoya\u2019s nose like a ball meets a bat. The Hispanic officer fell to the snowy ground clutching at her face while Harley slithered her way out of the car. The hungry harlequin gasped as she fell to her knees, the pain in her stomach keeping her down on the ground for a bit longer than she intended. Harley struggled to stand under her own power, legs wobbling under the strain of having to support herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha ya\u2026 ya putz.\u201d Harley wheezed, snatching Montoya's keys from the snow and unlocking her handcuffs, \"Good thing ya called an ambulance, Monty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of an approaching ambulance came within earshot, Harley shakily made her escape, leaving Montoya to deal with a severely bloodied nose...</span></div></div>",

A surprising amount of the equipment was still usable after a good dusting and a little maintenance work. About a month ago the Joker had settled on the old Happy Pie plant and decided that it would suit his dastardly needs perfectly and moved right in; quickly rounding up a few goons, coercing some scientists, and procuring the proper equipment to ensure a properly delivered punchline on Gotham City\u2019s waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was sure that her Mistah Jay had fled back to their love-nest when he made a break for it back there at the party. Her Puddin\u2019 wasn\u2019t exactly the bravest guy around, but he was definitely one of the smartest. He had to have some kind of back-up plan ready, just in case things went south\u2026 which they kinda had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toxin that Joker and Harley had those scientists develop was designed to increase hunger and cause cravings for sugar, both of which Harley was feeling intensely after such a long walk without so much as a granule of sugar in her. So naturally she and Joker planned on launching them world-wide out of the factory, that way people would get hooked on the newly revitalized Happy Pie Baking Company\u2019s shipments and they\u2019d pay out the nose for it, and Officer Mackenzie Sennett was just going to be their first \u201ccustomer\u201d. They\u2014or at least Harley hadn\u2019t\u2014never planned on what would happen if one of <i>them</i> got hooked too\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe factory doors erupted in a rusty creaking as Harley used the last of her strength to force them open. The night air flooded in behind her, outlining the pony-tailed Pagliacci as she struggled to remain on her feet. She was doubled over, the intense pains in her stomach having now caused throbbing headaches as her hearing began to give way to a distinct ringing sound. Her painted eyelids grew heavier and heavier, her bright baby blues dimming as her vision grew blurry. Thanks to her chemically-unbalanced appetite, Harley wouldn\u2019t have much longer before she passed out right there on the factory floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Harl\u2026 almost\u2026 there\u2026\u201d she grunted as she struggled to totter inside the factory, \u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 get sleepy yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker had made sure that his facility was as state of the art as it could get without attracting any unwanted attention from a certain clan of pointy-eared do-gooders. Lots of computers, lots of machinery, all of it really fancy and most of it over Harley\u2019s head. All she knew was that this was going to be their big break\u2014a joke that would make them both billionaires, after all this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why it was so shocking to find the place as dead as two \u2018o clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026wha?\u201d Harley mumbled stupidly as she struggled to take a step forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had come in expecting to hear the low purr of machinery as the scientists tested and experimented, or maybe the clunky cacophony of mooks as they lugged all that heavy junk around. But instead she had come home to find nothing\u2014no scientists, no mooks, none of that fancy machinery. It was as empty as the day they had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had. The Joker had managed to have the place picked clean in the measly few hours it had been since the whole ordeal had hit its snag. Harley shuffled further into the factory, her vision blackening as she heard her heartbeat thumping behind her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said\u2026 he said this was gonna be our\u2026 big break\u2026\u201d Harley whimpered, her bottom lip quivering as she fell flat on her tuchas, \u201cI... I can\u2019t believe he\u2026 that no good\u2026 fakakta\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley fell to her side as her voracious hunger overcame her mid-sentence. She clutched her poor white stomach as she struggled against the intense pain she was feeling deep inside of her. Heartbreak and hunger were especially painful separate, but now that her boyfriend had abandoned her, Harley had effectively drained so far that not even her mania could perk her back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll just lay here\u2026 fer a minute\u2026\u201d Harley said sleepily as she succumbed to starvation, \u201cKick his\u2026 cute little ass later\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light behind her eyes threatened to flicker out, Harley spotted something that lit a fire in her on the production line\u2026</span></div></div>",

The notion of it alone was enough to make Harley rise with a woozy haste as her voracity took gear. Her mouth began to grow thick with saliva as she stupidly stomped through the factory, her grace and elegance sacrificed for lack of energy. As she closed in on the remaining morsel, Harley barely noticed the scrap sheet of paper taped to its clear plastic lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore into it, using her hands to grab globs of banana cr\u00e8me and stuffing them into her face, and breaking up the flaky graham cracker crust with her fingers before scarfing them down like Santa on Christmas. Harley had finished her pie in mere minutes, having missed more than a little banana cr\u00e8me as it splattered across her red and black leather ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, huffing dramatically as she slowly came down from what she had experienced, when she noticed the slip of paper on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly more energized now that there was some food in her stomach, Harley reached forward and drew the paper from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dearest Poo\u2014<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Thought you might be getting hungry right about now, so I had the boys leave dinner in the fridge</div>. <br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">See ya soon, <br>\r\nUncle J</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harley read over the note, her clarity slowly began to come back to her. She could think just a bit clearer now that the hunger pangs had eased off slightly, which only meant that she could begin to realize the implications of what had just happened. She was so hungry she had just scarfed down that whole pie without so much as a second thought\u2014what was she gonna do if there was no cure?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCriminy\u2026 Yer in it real deep this time, Harley.\u201d The hungry harlequin moaned as she worked her way up to a standing position, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve gotta find Mistah Jay.

Not as badly as before, but enough to make her double-take. Surely having eaten a whole pie not even two minutes ago was enough to get her through a cursory trip through Gotham City, right? She had to find the Joker\u2014he was the only one who could help her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026\u201d she moaned as another tummy grumble overcame her, \u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere like this\u2026 there\u2019s gotta be something in here that\u2019ll fill me up enough to get me going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around for any kind of help. What did that note her Puddin\u2019 left her say? Something about leaving dinner in the fridge? But they didn\u2019t have a fridge, all they had was\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Freezer!\u201d Harley exclaimed to no one in particular as she made a mad dash for the giant walk-in freezer that had come stock with the Joker\u2019s little real-estate investment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when the Happy Pie Company was a legitimate business, they used the walk-in freezer to keep the pies cold before they all got put on the truck. In a lot of ways, she figured, things had more or less stayed the same. Mistah Jay had kept all their pies in waiting in the storage freezer so they didn\u2019t get all gross before they could ship them out\u2014there had to be some still left in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley wrapped her slender white fingers around the handle on the walk-in freezer and yanked it open, finding more than a plethora of pies just sitting there in the cold\u2014all lonely and abandoned, just like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can have just one more, right?\u201d Harley asked herself aloud as she fought back her instincts, \u201cJust one more pie...Right?\u201d</i></span></div></div>",

She had definitely been opposed to the idea, but at the end of the day, she was a part of a TEAM- and a tight-knit, unabashedly and unarguably formed team.  So, when she had been voted onto \"Bakery Duty\", she wasn't going to protest, but she CERTAINLY wasn't thrilled about it.  So BORING!  There were rumors about Ra's Al Ghul coming back for the fifteenth floating around, and she was off searching for some... \"Custard Crusader\"?  Because that CERTAINLY didn't sound like, oh, the dumbest thing in existence.  And yet, here she was.  Besides, stakeouts were \"one of the most resourceful tools in a detectives workbook\" or whatever.  Fine.  Again, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was pretty boring, for about 3 hours, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I repeat, we have a break-in at Davey's Donuts, I repeat, Davey's Donuts, their alarm has been triggered along with two calls-\"  Batgirl cut off the comm unit and swung down from her perch among one of the more prestigious banks within Gotham, overly eager at the idea of attending an actual break-in... Even moreso if it was the so-called \"Custard Crusader\", which, if it was, she was going to have a word with him or her about how terrible her name was.  After all, while BatMAN was pretty quiet during his busts, BatGIRL was anything but- and as a young adult, she was more than enough levels of cocky for the two of them... At least, in her head.  And Davey's was quite a bit a way from her original perch, so she employed a few unnecessary acrobatic acts of flips and spins as she made her way across the several blocks of city streets, before arriving at Davey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Davey's.  It followed the Walmart standard, IE: it was huge.  Way too big for a simple pastry shop, and yet here they were, flaunting their size on one of the more \"rush hour-esque\" intersections of Gotham, which didn't come at a pretty penny- in fact, Bruce had investigated, on the side, of course, their numbers, only to deduce that they were in fact a legal business, even if they weren't financially viable.  Still, that was hardly Batgirl's problem as she eagerly swung in front of the store, hands naturally forming into knuckles before she even entered the store.  But as the door opened, she hesitated.  Despite the lack of employees, the store was eerily silent, no sounds of a robbery in site... That is, until she heard a rumble from below her.  And as she waited...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>Ssssssolomon...</i></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what?\"  Batgirl muttered at the offending noise.  Curious, she dropped down in a defensive position, crawling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Ssssolomon... Grundy...</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears figuratively perked up at the sound, straining to hear what was causing the ruckus below her feet.  Inching forward tactically, she heard the sound of sirens in the distance.  \"Crud, I gotta wrap this up, and soon!\"  Inching forward in a slightly more aggressive way, making her way towards the only available entry to the basement, Batgirl paused as she felt a rumble beneath her feet.  \"Oh, da-\" She began, before the linoleum erupted underneath her, scattering various pastries that adorned the countertop all over the ground.  \"Are you kidding me?\" She gasped as the deadened villain erupted from the ground.  \"C'mon, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking white figure paid no attention to her outburst.  \"Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday...\" He uttered in his monotone, gravely voice.  Charging towards Batgirl, his dead hands flailed wildly as she dodged, their nerves mostly dead to the world.  \"Christened on a-AUGH\"  the re-animated monstrosity screamed in his bass-ridden tone as Batgirl flung several 1-second timed charges in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do too much damage, since this guy can't die.\"  She muttered, mostly to appease her own doubts as she utilized her acrobatics to flip over his blinded, angry punch.  Still, it was enough to slow down the (somewhat) innocent giant, enough to deliver a painful two-punch kick directly into his forehead, which immediately knocked him straight onto his ass and knocking him out of the party.  \"Know, to see who the real culprit behind this is- Grundy doesn't really strike me as a sweets guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding confidently, yet quietly into the basement, Batgirl felt her jaw drop... and while she was well aware of it, it didn't stop her from letting out an audible gasp.  There, in front of her for the first time in... What, a month?  Was the head of Harley Quinn, the queen of comedic (and harmful) crime, but she looked... Pretty out of place.  \"Quinn?  Please, don't tell me that you're the infamous- well, not quite infamous, but somewhat well-known- 'Custard Crusader' ?  Also, when did you and Grundy become best friends?\"  She could tell it was her from the top of her headdress-esque top, which had the signature \"Harlequin\" bobbles.  And yet, as she saw more of the infamous girl's body, it became obvious...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she saw more of the infamous girl's body, it became obvious that Harley Quinn wasn\u2019t exactly in prime physical shape these days. Barb had caught Harley bending over, fiddling with the shipping boxes. Her butt looked pretty broad in her old red and black outfit, stretching the spandex so that a clear chiseled outline of her panties was on display. As Harley stood and turned, it was evident that there was a distinct softness around her middle. The squared pattern on her costume was distorted, with the lines between red and black dipping into curves. Even her face looked a little plumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl watched as Harley leaned onto the boxes and wiped the sweat from her brow, reaching into one and pulling out something that looked awfully prepackaged for a business that promised \u201cFresh, Hot, Now!\u201d as their slogan. Harley munched happily on her donut before a batarang clanged against the brick\u2014clipping the edge of her snack and causing a good bit of apple-filling to ooze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harley shouted indignantly, whipping around with a lethal pop gun in her other hand \u201cSome of us are tryin\u2019 to take a Lunch here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl dove instinctively to her right, covering corner behind a few boxes that Harley hadn\u2019t gone through yet. Harley let out a few surprisingly loud shots before scanning the area with her big blue peepers. She may have actually seen Barbara\u2019s hand peeking out from behind her barricade if it weren\u2019t for the filling oozing further down her hand, causing her to panic and start slurping it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026 that\u2019s the stuff.\u201d Harley sighed orgasmically before taking another chomp out of her donut, \u201cListen Bat-Brain, just leave me alone! A girl\u2019s gotta eat, and I\u2019m just tryin\u2019 to keep my belly full! I\u2019m a tragic villain, or whatever, just get outta here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl peeked over the boxes as Harley went back to her work. She was taking boxes and loading them up onto a dolly. Larceny. <i>Petty</i> larceny. That was new. No gimmick, no jokes, no Joker... what was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Harley, but in all good conscience, I <i>can\u2019t</i> let you eat all that.\u201d Batgirl toppled her cover dramatically, \u201cIt\u2019ll go right to your hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce had never really approved of Dick and Barbara\u2019s showier tendencies in the field. The Bat-Family was supposed to be quiet, smooth and efficient. Not to say that they <i>weren\u2019t</i> those things, but Dick\u2019s flare for theatrics could upset the deathly silence that a Bat was supposed uphold. But Barbara had learned, in her time partnering with Nightwing, that sometimes talking helped. It made them mad. Made them sloppy. And sometimes it even got them to divulge some information that, otherwise, might have gone unsaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB\u2019grl!\u201d Harley swallowed, her red and black brow furrowing as her face twisted angrily, \u201cWhat are <i>you</i> doing here? Haven\u2019t you done enough to me already?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley let loose a few shots, Batgirl ducked and rolled out of the way. She rose and instinctively threw a batarang at Harley\u2019s lethal prop, knocking it out of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are <i>you</i> doing here squeezed into that old outfit?\u201d Barbara quipped as she leapt atop the hill of shipping crates, \u201cIt\u2019s so nineties\u2026 and not in a good way, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley made a break for it, eagerly snatching up what meager morsels she could manage to hold and starting through the maze of crates and boxes. She was slow. Clumsy. Obviously Harley had been neglecting her training regimen for the last month or so\u2014was she this slow the last time they fought? Was she this <i>fat</i> the last time they fought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl dove on top of the husky harlequin and brought her down with a nasal scream. Harley wasn\u2019t finished, and there was still plenty of leg power beneath that pot belly. Barbara did her best to hold Harley down by the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy have you been robbing bakeries and pastry shops?!\u201d Batgirl did her best to sound like Batman in situations like this, most would attest to its success, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Joker planning?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNerts to you Brat-girl! I\u2019m not just a pretty face!\u201d Harley snarled as she worked her legs under Batgirl\u2019s torso, \u201cI\u2019m capable of running my <i>own</i> show!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Harley kicked the lighter redhead off of her, sending her soaring into the boxes and crates that cluttered the basement, while she scrambled towards the stairwell that led back to the main part of the store. Batgirl eventually recovered from being tossed aside into some very heavy boxes and went after her. Harley was a lot slower than she used to be, but then again she had a head start\u2026</span></div></div>",

But, fortunately for Quinn, Grundy was back on his feet.  \"Go get 'em, killer!\"  Quinn said happily, spraying crumbs all over the place in the process.  Procuring a massive duffel bag from God knows where, Quinn got to work, slamming boxes of pastries into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna end up -hup- with nothing but crumbs, Quinn!\"  Batgirl shouted, narrowly dodging a heavy punch from Grundy.  She really needed to get Harley before she escaped, but the second she turned her back on Grundy he'd undoubtedly pulverize her, so he was the current priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ya know, yer right!  I should be a bit more careful...\"  Quinn pondered out loud, slightly decreasing the amount of force she utilized to place the boxes inside the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I meant because you're-\" Batgirl fell on her back as Grundy lurched towards her, before delivering a massive two-footed kick into the giant's face.  \"-Going to jail!\"  However, despite delivering a blow that would've concussed the strongest boxer, Grundy was no less of a threat- he was just pissed, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it, sistah, but I don't think that's happening!\"  Harley paused to cram several more boxes into her bag, pushing down with a grunt on the overburdened bag.  \"Shoot, I really shouldn'ta done that.  Ah, well!  They'll be fine, I'm sure.\"  The wobbling harlequin looking girl swung the bag over her shoulder, letting out a long puff of air at the weight.  \"I'm outta here, have fun with Grundy, and the men in blue!  Tootles!\"  And with that, the red and black beauty ran out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, well, that coulda gone better.\"  Grundy proceeded to throw a punch at Batgirl's head, which she dodged, causing his fist to get lodged into the wall.  \"C'mon big guy, you gotta calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Harley's robbing bakeries?  I guess that isn't too big of a stretch...\"  Bruce muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the only thing that was stretching was her suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, she got chubby.

But I figured you'd wanna know.  Also, I put down Grundy for the hundredth time or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took down Grundy?\" Bruce asked, letting his surprise seep into his voice.  Batgirl nodded happily.  \"Well... Nice work.\"  She grinned all the way home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as things go, the Bat family ended up getting bogged down with some high level crimes- meaning a few more robberies went down in the meantime, but what could they do about that when the entire world is being threatened?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bruce lived in his mansion, Dick lived in <i>his</i> mansion, Jason was a wanted mercenary, Tim lived in Titan Tower in New York, and Damian lived with Bruce. Nobody else really had any day to day concerns besides the whole \u201csuperhero\u201d thing. It was kind of nice knowing that underneath her cowl, Batgirl was still Barbara Gordon. With her own family, her own friends, and her own responsibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the fact that she would really have liked to keep these things separate, sometimes Barbara had to admit that being in the right place at the right time had its advantages\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to that new bakery in the mall after this, you wanna come along?\u201d she heard the distinct pre-class prattle of a biology major in her class<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no bakery by the mall.\u201d Another student guffawed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah there is, it just opened up!\u201d the biology major said affirmatively, \u201cHappy something, I don\u2019t know.

Why do you wanna go to a <i>bakery</i> so badly, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been assigned \u201cCustard Crusader\u201d duty for the past few weeks, the word \u201cbakery\u201d was beginning to sound awfully silly to Barbara. But she had learned to pick it out in most conversations, hoping to catch onto a lead that would lead her to Harley Quinn. Chubster or not, she was still a deranged lunatic. And it was her job\u2014apparently\u2014to catch her and bring her to justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, all the stuff there is just\u2026 really, <i>really</i> good.\u201d The Biology major gushed, \u201cThey sent out some free samples in the mail and everything is just\u2026 <i>mmm!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends laughed at her while Barbara did her best not to look like she was eavesdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright alright, I\u2019ll go.

People with returns, people with gift cards, and people who just wanted to shop at the mall but had to deal with the people with returns and the people with gift cards. It probably would have been easier to grapple through the building as Batgirl, but that would have attracted too much attention. For now, Barbara Gordon would have to suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in her warmest winter coat\u2014a down purple jacket with a matching hat and tight jeans.

Hey!\"  The wide woman behind the counter shouted out the second the four girls walked through the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb's training kicked in, and her entire body locked up, her muscles seemingly run through with a coursing electricity, before she remembered where- and <i>who</i>- she was right now.  Tentatively, she approached the counter, remaining behind her friends with her head pointed downwards, hoping to keep attention way from her face- why, she wasn't sure yet, but her training made her constantly alert of any threats- and someone shouting is usually a threat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't look at your feet dear, look at me- I'd recognize that hair anywhere!  Barbara!\" The voice behind the counter said jovially.  Barbara slowly looked up, until she was face to face with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Sennett?\"  Barbara gasped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true, it was one of her father's old colleagues- that would explain how she recognized her right from the doorway, Barbara's hair was pretty unique among the kids in the GCPD ranks.  However, even with her keener sense of perception than most girls her age (or most people any age, for that matter) she still most likely wouldn't have pegged the woman behind the counter for the Officer Sennett she used to (barely) know. If she recalled correctly, last time she had seen Sennett, she had been sitting down, tied up, with a creme pie to the face- but even sitting down, and even with her focus on Harley and the Joker, Barb knew that Sennett wasn't quite as... Large.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman behind the counter, wearing a bright red and black sequined dress, was about three steps above \"average\" and one step below \"fat\".  Her chest surged forward, displaying more than a smidgen of cleavage through the top of the dress, while her stomach protruded below her breasts, exposing an indent for a belly button that was blatantly visible despite the shimmery nature of the dress- and this woman's thighs were massive!  The swell of her hips was wider than her shoulders- a definite far cry from how the woman looked back on the squad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm no officer anymore!\"  The woman laughed, before grabbing a tray loaded with four plates from the window into the kitchen and distributing them to the four teens before her.  \"Go on, sit down! Please!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls did so, and Barb's four friends began eagerly chatting away with each other while Mackenzie talked eagerly with Barb.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that Joker scare, I had a nice sit down with the captain, who offered me a pretty steep pension plan- that is, if I wanted it!\"  Barbara scowled, her father had never mentioned any of this to her- although, why would he?  It would probably just scare her, in his mind.  Still...  \"Well, I was hesitant at first- Police work has always been in my blood, you know?  But... Well, I guess they just don't have that many... <i>Incidents</i> with the Joker where... Let's just say my situation was unique.  So, with my first pension plan, I started to work on what I soon learned was my hidden talent- Baking!\"  Mackenzie gestured with a flourish towards the multiple boards suspended on the upper wall behind the bar.  \"I made all these recipes myself!  Turns out, I'm a natural!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb stared, mouth agape, at the several boards littering the walls.  Despite the... Incriminating decor, nothing on the menu seemed overly offensive or dangerous, and the custard pie/chocolate cake/cookie sampler sitting before her looked pretty darn good, all things considered.  Still, she wasn't going to get dragged into a potentially dangerous scheme just because Sennett <i>seemed</i> fine... This stuff needed to be tested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just incredible!  It's sad that you had to leave the force, though...\"  Barb said with genuine regret, but Sennett just waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, sometimes you just don't know what your dream really is until it falls right into your lap!  Or your face, in my case!\"  And with that, Mackenzie let out a belly-shaking laugh, one that went on a bit too long...</span></div></div>",

She had been notified by the intercommunications system in her cowl, and quickly grappled to the situation. They were three big guys\u2014though hardly as big as <i>some</i> of the guys she\u2019d fought off\u2014who thought it would be smart to knock off a Mom and Pop computer shop after the holiday season. When they saw it was Bat<i>girl</i> who had attempted to stop them, they more than welcomed the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dBatgirl.\u201d</i> a gravely baritone sounded, <i>\u201dI\u2019m analyzing the evidence you sent me.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really a good time!\u201d Batgirl spoke back as she dodged a punch, courtesy of one overmuscled mook that would regret not keeping his guard up, \u201cWhat\u2019d it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dI\u2019m still waiting on the toxicology report. But I\u2019ve detected a number of unidentified toxins present in the samples you sent me.\u201d</i> he continued, unphased by the sounds of violence coming in from Barbara\u2019s com, <i>\u201dIt\u2019ll take time. But I\u2019m getting some reports of activity in the Old Industrial District\u2014I think you should check it out.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl flipped the man on his back and kneed his arm out of its socket. His two partners thought it a good time to sneak up behind the trained vigilate, only to be met with a cloud of smoke as the pointy-eared crusader dropped a smoke pellet in the crevice left by the screaming mook\u2019s legs. While they swung blindly, Barbara slipped out of the cloud and into cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld Industrial\u2026\u201d she whispered quietly, \u201cI\u2019m kind of in the middle of something and that\u2019s all the way across town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dAnd?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just\u2014\u201c Batgirl threw a blunt-edge batarang at one of the men as they flailed in the smoke, beaning him in the back of the head and knocking him out, \u201c\u2014Y\u2019know, can\u2019t Dick do it? Or Tim, what about Tim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dTim\u2019s with the Titans, and Dick isn\u2019t answering his com.\u201d</i> Batman corrected sternly, <i>\u201dI\u2019m currently working on an antidote to Scarecrow\u2019s latest fear toxin. Go to the Industrial District. See what it has to do with our case. Batman out.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara let out a dissatisfied puff of air as she rolled her bright blue eyes, pulling out her bolo and throwing them at the only remaining man\u2014terrified out of his high-school drop out\u2019s mind\u2014and knocked him off balance as it wrapped around his ankles. He hit his head on the ground, out like a light while the first guy slowly blacked out in the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPff.\u201d Barbara sighed, \u201cTim\u2019s <i>always</i> with the Titans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notified the police and grappled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl sat crouched on one of the older warehouses in Gotham City. They\u2019d mostly been left to rot after a big industrial accident meant the Cobblepots had to pull out their investments way back when, but they were certainly in good enough shape to withstand a good stake-out. Barbara had jumped from rooftop to rooftop on most of these old places looking for anything out of the ordinary for almost two hours now. She was about to give up when she happened across one out of the bunch that seemed a bit more lively\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy Pie Baking Company\u2014the Batcomputer had a few key notes on it, but nothing too incriminating. Old plant. Founded in 1954, shut down in 1984. Owner had plans of making it a chain but nothing ever came of it before the accident, and then everything went to hell around it. According to the files, it had been abandoned ever since. But the lights on and the distinct sound of machinery turning below suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara also recognized more than a few of Joker\u2019s favorite recruits\u2014dressed in black suspenders and red overshirts. They looked like they were standing guard, but\u2026 for what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out.\u201d Barbara thought to herself as she reached for the handle on her grapple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t very well just come in through the front door\u2014Batgirl had to be just as crafty and clever as Bat<i>man</i> was after all\u2014and that meant avoiding the guards. They were armed, which suggested that something far from legal was going on inside that factory. One look at anything in a cape with pointy ears and those guys would blow her brains out. Stealth would be her tactic of the night, as she slunk around in the shadows surrounding the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loading bay was open. A large truck with a happy-face licking its lips for a logo was currently docked in the back as three guys oversaw the delivery of\u2026 whatever was in those boxes. They were big and wooden\u2014too big to be pies, and judging by the way those guys were struggling to get them started on the hand-trucks, too heavy too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell hello, what did she have here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those men weren\u2019t like the others. Scrawny and sweaty looking; real white-collar kind of guy. He wasn\u2019t wearing the same uniform as the others either, and he was holding a clipboard while he went over all the shipping labels on the boxes. Barbara may have found someone who could give her answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl quickly collapsed into an inky black shadow on the floor, catching everyone off-guard. They weren\u2019t armed, meaning that they probably hadn\u2019t expected being caught. It made her job so much easier when they didn\u2019t use guns. Barbara was a machine, falling into the combat like it was second nature to her. Every time the sweaty little guy would go near the alarm, she quickly knocked him off his balance a side-swipe to the legs so she could deal with the other, brawnier guys at Harley\u2019s disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after all her other distractions were taken care of, Batgirl stomped over to the guy crawling on the ground and yanked him to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re working for Quinn.\u201d She said using the deepest, brownest voice she could manage, \u201cTalk. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d he sniveled, \u201cP-Please\u2026 I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour warehouse is painted red and black with diamonds on it.\u201d Batgirl did her best not to let her sarcasm drip into her interrogation technique, but sometimes it was just too easy to pass up, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you nicely before I start breaking things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m just a\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Harley putting in the pies?!\u201d Batgirl swung at the scrawny little guy, causing him to cry out in pain, \u201cI <i>know</i> you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t, I\u2014\u201c another punch, this time in the gut, caused him to start wretching, \u201c\u2014I\u2026 f-fine\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d She was starting to get good at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley\u2019s\u2026 Harley\u2019s been having us load up her pies with some kind of \u2026 toxin, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He gasped, \u201cIt makes people go crazy. Makes them hungry\u2014amplifies their appetite. She and the Joker made us make it a few weeks back and\u2026 I thought\u2026 I thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d Batgirl\u2019s fa\u00e7ade faltered as she watched the meek little lab rat shiver where he stood, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here. But I need to know everything I can about what Harley\u2019s been putting in this new food she\u2019s had you guys making. It could save lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d he said, composing himself, \u201cThere\u2019s something else you should know. Besides the toxin we all made, there\u2019s\u2026 something else in them\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From there, the scrawny businessman then pulled out some papers from a file in a storage bin as he hesitantly explained, \"She... Sh-She put a drug in the bakery sweets that releases large amounts of Dopamine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Meaning whoever eats them becomes highly addicted to it.\" Batgirl flatly answered, looking over the notes on the few sheets of paper in the process. In her mind, such a revelation was certainly not good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I'm... I-I'm not entirely sure where she gets the stuff, but whoever eats the sweets from here, th-they'll certainly be p-packing on the pounds.\" The nervous businessman retorted, his eyes swiftly looking left to right out of sheer nervousness, as if he was about to have a nervous breakdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to calm the man down from unintentionally exposing her position to the armed thugs outside, Batgirl placed a gauntlet hand upon his shoulder and said, \"Take it easy there. I won't let them hurt you. Just answer one more thing for me, and you can go. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, the scrawny man nervously nodded yes several times in response, as Batgirl then calmly spoke toward him and asked, \"Have you seen...THIS woman, by any chance?\" From there, she held up her portable PDA toward him, which showed a mugshot of Harley Quinn upon it's screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the scrawny individual nodded repeatedly then replied, \"...Yeah, I... I-I've seen that woman b-before. Only... she's not that skinny anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" She asked, as the man then answered, \"She...

I-I only caught g-glimpses of her every now and th-then, but when she c-comes here, she's sometimes eating a pie or two, then he-heads off to who knows where.

Crummy bars like the Zero Hour with old fatback TV's hung overhead blared in the signature sound of GNN's introductory tune. Screen all across Gotham City welcomed the sight of Jack Rider behind the desk, his arms folded professionally as he welcomed the audience back from their commercial break. Living rooms and tiny televisions, even some mobile phones shone against the backlight as he did his fake little smile and dance to Gotham and its neighboring city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome back everybody to Gotham News Network, so happy that everyone's back.\"</i> Jack flashed all his pretty pearly whites to Camera 1, <i>\"We're, uh... we've actually got a treat for everyone today, pardon the pun.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's right, Jack, today we'll be interviewing... well, we've scored the interview of a lifetime here today folks.\"</i> Summer Gleeson's newscaster voice was spot on, <i>\"Former costumed supervillain Harleen Quinzelle, better known as Harley Quinn to you cape watchers out there, has done what most would... well, what most would have considered impossible.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well said, Summer.\"</i> the two hid their disdain for each other well as the camera panned back to feature both of them in the shot, <i>\"It seems Dr. Quinzelle\u2014am I right on that, she's a doctor?\u2014has turned her luck around and hung up her tights for good, choosing instead to\u2014get this, folks\u2014open up a <u>pie factory</u> right here in Gotham City.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You heard it here, folks.\"</i> Summer chuckled, <i>\"Vicki Vale, live on the scene with Dr. Harleen Quinzelle, founder of Happy Pie Baking Company.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight feedback on the microphone as the Gotham City symphony of cars and pedestrians flooded the airwaves. Onscreen was star reporter Vicki Vale, dressed in her finest winter attire. Her blonde hair came down just to the collar of her trench coat, her neck wrapped in a fashionable scarf. Ms. Vale was once a very slight woman, with camera-friendly good looks and dazzling blue eyes that made her a promising addition to the GNN billboard. However, in recent weeks, Vicki had been filling out noticeably. Her middle had softened oh so slightly into a troublesome little pot belly. Her face had widened, as had her arms her chest and, most unfortunately for her wardrobe, her butt. She'd taken off one of her gloves in order to avoid getting glazing on it\u2014Vicki had been in the middle of sampling yet another free giveaway from the HPBC as the feed cut to her, leading her to duck the half-eaten pie sheepishly behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, good morning Gotham City!\" little flakes of sugar dotted the corner of her mouth, \"I'm here at the Happy Pie Baking Company in Gotham's Industrial District, where founder Harleen Quinzelle\u2014formerly known as the costumed criminal Harley Quinn\u2014has decided to give back to the community that she so often terrorized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feed cut yet again to another blonde woman, the stylish vector lines edited into the shot read \"Dr. Harleen Quinzelle\", but you would have had a hard time finding anyone who believed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley Quinn had become a big name villain in her own right. Lots of people knew Harley Quinn\u2014she was practically a household name among cape watchers and superhero fetishists. Her skimpy outfits and her crazy devotion to one of the sickest, most deplorable men in Gotham City easily made headlines. Up until about a year and a half ago, after a failed attack on the GCPD Building, most assumed that she had been taken care of like so many loose ends in the Joker's life. Her fans mourned her, the Bats were left quietly scratching their heads, and her friends waited for the day when she would make her eventual return\u2014after all, it wasn't like anyone <i>stayed</i> gone in this town, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one, <i>no one</i> would have ever guessed that Harley had gotten fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman inside the newly renovated factory was officious looking as she was enormous. With small cat-eyed glasses balanced precariously along the bridge of her nose and her blonde hair in a tight little bun, her swaddling chins and chubby cheeks looked that much bigger than they were. The way she sat, Harley looked to have no neck as her ring of white neck flab crested against the pillowy cushion of her fatty chest. Her red business suit must have been tailored for a hippopotamus; she was a sea of burgundy and black, with her arms filling the sleeves of her blazer to maximum capacity. It was to the point where everyone could clearly see the fold where her arm fat began to sag over her elbow. And her gut, that <i>gut</i>, rested comfortably on the desk in front of her. The only hint that it was Harley at all was the color scheme and the pale white skin that her little chemical bath had left her with\u2014otherwise, no one would have guessed that this humongous hiefer was once the Clown Princess of Crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Vicki, for that wonderful introduction,\" she said in her most professional-sounding voice. Her accent was tapered and her mind clear, \"And thank you, GNN for allowing me to formally announce my plans\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, everyone who had ever witnessed one of Gotham City's criminals make their agenda known on television instinctively cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014to open up my factory doors.\" Harleen continued, sighs all across the city sounding, \"I started this factory as a chance to give back to my hometown, and what better way than to help decrease unemployment by offering steady work for the good people of Gotham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think you've given back plenty to Gotham City, considering.\" Vicki laughed on the other side of the screen, \"Tell me, what made you decide to give up on being Harley Quinn? And what's more... why a pie factory? If you don't mind me asking... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">they're really good...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've all gotta grow up sometime, don't we?\" Harley said warmly, not affected at all by the question, \"Besides, I think it's well past time for me to hang up my tights. It's a younger, <i>thinner</i> girl's game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Harley lifted up her pale white belly, cloaked beneath her black blouse, and gave it a good squeeze that threatened the integrity of her buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, well said.\" Vicki laughed, \"And, again, <i>why</i> a pie factory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kiddin'?\" Harley's accent slipped a little, \"Who knows more about pies than someone who used to be a clown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicki laughed again, this time a bit more uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is, my Ma used to make these when we were kids.\" Harley composed herself a bit more, \"I asked her for the recipe one day and... well, the rest is history.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't believe it!\" Catwoman said as she watched the humongous Harley fill her TV screen. \"What did that jester do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mpph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush you,\" the cat thief said to the man hogtied below her feet. Emptying the remains of the jewelry store strongboxes into her bag, the cat thief hoisted the whole sack over her shoulders and turned her attention back to the tiny television that the jeweler set up in his office. The quality of the picture was grainy, but it did little to hide Harley's incredibly wide smile as she turned to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand if many of you out there aren't willing to trust someone who played second fiddle to the Joker for so long,\" Harley sounded out the Clown Prince of Crime's name with a hint of venom but continued on with her statement. \"But with the Happy Pie Baking Company, I hope I can convince Gotham that I am a changed woman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly have,\" Catwoman commented, taking note of Harley's button-straining cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that, through this company, we can all grow and change together for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Miss Quinzelle,\" Vikki finished off, not even waiting for the cameras to switch off her before she brought out her pie again. \"This is...<i>nom</i>...Vikki Vale for the Gotham News Network, back to you in the studio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman's brow furrowed as she made her way out the back door of her latest heist. With the Dark Knight away on Justice League business, Catwoman was making out like a literal bandit in Gotham, and she knew that there wouldn't be another night as good for thieving as this one in a while. Still, she couldn't shake a feeling of concern for the hippo-sized harlequin. She and Harley may not have been buddy-buddy back in the day before she blew up like a parade float, but they at least shared a mutual respect for one another, and was always there for Harley when she needed to get away from that wretched clown for a while. Was she really going to put her crime spree on hold to check up on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my bleeding heart,\" Catwoman sighed, planning out the fastest route from her safe-house to the pie factory as she ascended the side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The GNN people have left the building, Miss Quinzelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness, I'm FAMISHED,\" Harleen said, undoing her hair bun and letting her blonde locks fall to the sides of her chipmunk cheeks. Her old accent came back a little bit now that she was off camera, but it still carried an air of refinement to it now that she was a big businesswoman, in every sense of the word. \"We got a lot to get set up for tomorrow and I can't work when I'm hungry. Go ahead and bring in the cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, the doors to Harleen's office opened as a pair of aides pushed a heavy cart loaded down with an insane amount of food, probably enough to feed a dozen normal people adequately but just a simple meal for the newly minted owner of the Happy Pie Baking Company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got baby-back ribs, fried chicken, honey-baked ham, buffalo wings, pot roasts, mashed potatoes, and corn-on-the-cob with extra butter for you today, ma'am,\" one of the aides read off a list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit on the light side but it'll do,\" Harleen nodded approvingly. \"And dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single flavor of pie we have,\" the second aide said, gesturing to a second cart entering after the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Harleen said, her mouth already starting to water. \"I'll let you know if I want a second course, you may go now.\" The aides obediently left, and Harleen lifted herself from the chair and started to waddle over to the first cart before she stumbled; her fashionable high heels had snapped from her moving too quickly at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again,\" Harleen grumbled, kicking off the ruined shoes and finishing the trip. \"I'll need to switch to flats from now on.\" Undeterred, Harley picked up the largest drumstick she could find and tore into it, all anxiety about the big opening day and replacing her footwear fleeing from her mind as she stuffed chicken and ham into her piggy little mouth. The joy of giving into her gluttonous urges was something that Harleen discovered long ago, back when she had that little accident with the pies. The chemical that made her want to stuff her face probably worked its way out of her system long ago, but by now Harleen didn't need it to gorge herself daily anyway. When she was sitting and stuffing her face until she was too full to move, the world just made sense again; her worries melted away and didn't seem to matter anymore, not the police, not Batman, not even her once beloved Joker. Yes, even the Clown Prince of Crime had taken a backseat to Harley's new mad love and grand obsession; eating like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley loved to eat, and she loved the effects that all of that eating had on her, from the mental to the physical. It was unnerving at first, watching herself gain weight at such a pace, but in time Harleen grew proud of her girth, seeing every extra pound split seam, and bursting button as Harleen taking control of her life at last. The skinny little nymph who pined after the homicidal dirtbag of a clown was long gone; in her place was a big beautiful woman in charge of her life at last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Harleen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarleen lifted her head up from the ham she was messily chewing in alarm, letting out a soft burp. Turning around sharply, her expression lightened at the sight of Gotham's favorite cat burglar at her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selina, it's good to see you!\" Harleen said gleefully. \"Pardon the mess, a girl's gotta eat you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that,\" Catwoman said, pushing open the window and slinking inside. \"Harley...what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner,\" Harleen burped again, moving to the corn on the cob and eating it like a typewriter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean...why the pie factory, what's your end game here?\" Catwoman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean why am I so fat, don't ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina turned a little red upon being called out. \"Well, I didn't want to say, but...you've grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley laughed. \"It's fine, Catty. I'm proud of being this big anyway.\" Catwoman, briefly surprised, gave herself a moment to breath as she drifted to the other side of Harley's food cart, glancing at the tears appearing in her smart skirt as it started to fail in containment of her thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...proud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm! I've finally taken control of my life, Selina!\" Harley declared through an unhealthy amount of mashed potatoes. \"I'm striking my own course and I'm happy with the choices I've made. Nothing has made me happier then just eating as much as I wanted to, and every pound I gain means I can just eat more and more. And I want everyone to experience that feeling, Selena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman was so perplexed by this change she didn't realize that Harleen had picked up one of the pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Harl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These have a little bit of the same substance that made me what I am today, Selina,\" Harleen said, a dangerous expression on her face. \"How would you like to be a changed woman too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm fine, thank you,\" Selina said hurriedly, backing towards the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Selina,\" Harleen pleaded, lifting up her belly and letting it plop over her knees, knocking loose a button or two. \"Don't you want one of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stay in shape to be a thief, Harley,\" Catwoman stalled, her eyes planning an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I can convince you otherwise!\" Harley announced, getting ready to hurl the pie in Catwoman's direction.</span></div></div>",

Her green eyes widened as she met her creme-y demise of Harley's design, head recoiling backwards as a loud SPLAT filled Harley's office. Catwoman fell backwards, landing on her tightly toned rump, as the pie tin fell from her face and into her open, shaking palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you...\" Selina's voice broke into a quiver, globs of yellow goo falling from her hair and face, before her tone hardened, \"<i>What did you do to me, Harley</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had already settled back into her overexerted office chair, one hand resting on her proud gut while the other worked towards feeding it fuller. The great white whale that had once been Gotham's second-most hated harlequin smiled contentedly, her black lips parting into a toothy grin that dimpled her chubby cheeks. Her eyes, blue and piercing, were perhaps the only dead giveaway that somewhere beneath all of that blubber remained the mind of a dangerous supercriminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a snack.\" Harley purred, fingers pressing into the top of her stomach as she massaged its contents lightly, \"A little somethin' to whet your appetite before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that I'm...\" Selina struggled to stand, suddenly finding herself weak, \"I-I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish her sentence, Catwoman collapsed back onto the floor. She felt weak, like her body couldn't support itself. Her knees knocked together, a ringing had begun to play in her ears. Even as the creme fell from her eyes, Selina's vision was blurry. Her arms and legs may as well have been made of lead. The femme fatale sunk forward, her head hanging low as she struggled to maintain a peculiar balance on her knees. As the ringing grew louder, an awful emptiness roared from inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...rley...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what happened. But the smells of Harley's smorgasbord of rich, decadent food was enough to make her stomach turn. The back of her throat clenched, threatening to spit up stomach bile. She'd never been so hungry in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she saw the pie\u2014or rather, what remained of the pie, sitting in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Selina collapsed onto the floor, grabbing globs of banana creme with her gloved fingers. She shoved them into her mouth, sucking the residue from her leather safe crackers like her life depended on it. It may as well have. She was so hungry, she honestly felt like she might die! Poor Catwoman made grunting, desperate sounds as she sucked down the second-hand dessert, literally licking her fingers as she tore the crust from the pie tin in an attempt to abate the intense, <i>visceral</i> hunger that had overwhelmed her senses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen-sized clown looked on at her handiwork happily, remembering all too well the feeling of weakness that came from being put in such a sorry state. A state she vowed that she'd never be put in again. Powerless. Empty. <i>Hungry</i>. Watching someone else go through the same thing was... oddly satisfying! Certainly enough to work up an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, first one's always the kicker.\" she said with a belly laugh, her plush hand now moving in concentric circles along the surface of her stomach, \"You shoulda seen me the first time, rollin' around, stuffin' myself with pies til I felt like I would pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bite, this time from a chunky chicken breast that had been slathered in oils and butters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was kinda hot, honestly.\" Harley hummed as she took another big girl bite, \"In a 'oh my god, I think I might die' kinda way. Which, I think we both know, is <i>literally </i>the best kinda way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna... kill you...\" Catwoman winced as she struggled to a standing position, faltering as her right knee threatened to buckle, \"I swear to God I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but it won't be til <i>after</i> dinner.\" Harley dabbed at the corners of her mouth with a pretty white napkin, before she snapped her fingers, \"Which, coincidentally, is <i>just</i> big enough for two. Comparatively. It's really big enough for like twenty, but why split hairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley collapsed into a pasty white pile, her whole body wobbling as her super size settled in her seat. The seat in question was at her own private dining area, located in a door just off to the side of her office. Behind her, an aide carried her discarded high heels that had snapped under pressure. Her chubby white toes clenched in delight as her feast, and feline-themed friend, were escorted into the room behind her so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I am outta shape.\" Harley said with a happy heft of her stomach, \"But you probably already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley... please...\" Catwoman begged, her cowl and goggles now fully removed, \"I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you'll feel <i>much</i> better after you get some food in ya.\" Harley had already resumed eating, the entirety of her course now transitioning from cart to the dinner table as aides serviced their boss with expertise, \"I would know, wouldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Catwoman wanted to protest, and as angry as she was with her long-lost friend and cohort in crime, it was <i>really</i> hard to focus on anything other than the delicious hock of ham that was being brought in from what was presumably the kitchen. Or the entire turkey that had already had its drumsticks ripped off by Harley. Or the bowl of rich, buttery mashed potatoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was drooling. She couldn't take this anymore. She had to <i>eat</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go!\" Harley cheered Selina on as she watched her grab food by the handfuls and ravenously shove them into her mouth, \"Now you're gettin' it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman ate with desperation. She was so hungry, she could barely think straight. Nothing mattered more to her right now than stopping the aching emptiness inside of her stomach. Not her career as a thief, not her dalliances with Batman, honestly not even Harley. Selina's nerves were fried and she felt like she was running on empty. Her body was running almost entirely on autopilot. She wasn't even tasting the food that Harley had served her, just eating it. Devouring it. Literally shoving it into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, I knew that stuff was potent, but I never took you for a lout, Kitty.\" Harley's second chin wobbled as she laughed, \"We got forks an' knives for a reason, y'know. I thought you were one of them house-trained cats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman paused, however briefly, and took Harley's advice for the cutlery. Her hands made a mad dash for the silverware and she went right back to attacking her meal, no less slowly than if she'd been doing it bare-handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don'tcha feel a little better?\" Harley said from across the long table covered with food, her attendants bringing out more and more courses in light of special occasions and circumstance, \"Maybe thinkin' a little more clearly now that you've got something on your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... mfph... the hell is... nom... wrong with you?!\" Selina panted between bites as her assault slowed, however briefly, \"Why\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just like I said, I want everyone to feel just like I do\u2014big and beeee-youtiful!\" Harley held her wobbling arms wide, hanging low in the sleeves of her black business jacket before crashing down into pillowy puddles of pudge against her sides, \"That's why I laced each an' every one of my products with an eensy-weensy little dose of what I got. Sorry, what <i>we</i> got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An...\" Catwoman managed through a mouthful of mashed potatoes, \"Antidote...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I go an' do a dumb think like makin' an antidote?\" Harley snorted, ripping off a chunk of turkey and slamming it between two pieces of bread, \"I'm crazy but I ain't stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's green eyes grew wide in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I dosed ya <i>juuust</i> enough to get ya good and used to eatin' 'til ya start to pack it on the old fashioned way.\" Harley sneered\u2014it was somehow more effective now that her face was broad and wide, the jowls really helped sell her superiority\u2014at her feasting feline friend as she bent over her tray, \"Than maybe you'll start t'see things my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Harley let out quite the evil laugh. She'd clearly been practicing since her days as a hench wench. She threw her head back as Catwoman continued to gorge herself helplessly on the food that Harley's aides kept bringing her. She was helpless, a prisoner to her own amplified appetite. The humongous harlequin rolled her head back onto its neck roll, boisterous, belly-shaking laughter echoed throughout the office as Selina kept eating and eating and eating and eating...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina ate well into the night and into the wee hours of the next morning. A time that, normally, would have been spent cracking safes and pilfering precious jewels had been spent stuffing herself to max capacity. Even as the spread got smaller and her stomach distended painfully out in front of her, it was all Selina could do to keep eating. Her pace barely faltered and her pounces into each plate never grew any less vicious. She was completely consumed by whatever Harley had dosed her with, and it was clear that her affliction was only just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her descent, Selina was miserable. Her stomach domed out in front of her, a grotesque gut that was literally packed so tight she felt like she might explode. Her leather catsuit had to be unzipped far, <i>far</i> below her stomach. Her tanned Italian flesh bubbled out from the opening, sloping in front of her and hard as a rock. The teeth of her zipper felt like they were piercing her skin, drawn drum-tight by the capacity of what she'd eaten. Harley's aides had had to walk her, shakey-legged and stupid, to where she was going to stay for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully just for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go, all nice an' cozy.\" Harley thundered towards her friend, gasping like a fish on land as her belly towered over her bedbound frame, \"Well, cozy probably ain't the opportune word here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was horribly stuffed. Her tight athletic body, and her stupendously stuffed gut, were shiny with sweat as she lay helplessly on a bed in Harley's living space above the factory. She dare not turn too far over, lest she accidentally roll onto her side and feel the burn of sheets and blankets against her skin. It felt like knives were being pulled in and out, in and out of her stomach over and over again. The fiery pain of being stuffed to the limit, her body recoiling in such an enormous undertaking of eating such a stupendously sized feast, was almost more than she could bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Look at you.\" Harley cooed, folding her hands on top of her billowing breasts. \"Starter gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending one hamhock arm, Harley reached out and <i>ever</i> so carefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina wailed, writhing in pain at Harley's touch. The humongous harlequin smiled appreciatively at the sight of her friend and former criminal cohort in such a state. Is that how she might have looked, all that time ago, when she was laying on the factory floor of this very building? So weak and helpless, shallow panting while her belly domed out on top of her full of pie? Ripped out of her costume, pie crumbs sprinkled across her cheeks, pale white gut shiny and hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's free hand rubbed her blubbery belly, reaching so far out in front of her that it caught on Selina's bed. Watching her poor widdle kitty cat in such a state, too full and fat to even roll around in agony of everything that she'd eaten that night, made the massive sadomasochist more than a little pleased with herself. She bit her bottom lip longingly as her own feats of gastronomy churned and squelched beneath all that blubber. A husky purr rumbled from deep within her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're probably spent for the night.\" Harley finally said, coming back to her senses, \"I should let you get to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body wobbled, the floorboards of the factory creaked as Harley waddled away from her overfed friend's fate. She noticed, with no small amount of additional satisfaction, that the sides of her stomach and the rolls of her hips caught the frame of the guest bedroom's doorway. Another small purr of arousal as she touched her tummy appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...arley...?\" Selina whined, writhing in pain, \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, still up?\" Harley turned over her meaty shoulder with a chunky smile, \"Well get snoozin', Kitty Cat. Breakfast is only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her acres of breast flesh and whipped out her phone, sweaty and hot from its time smooshed under Harley's heaving chalk-white hooters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six hours away!\" Harley tsk-tsked, \"We do things <i>very</i> efficiently here at Harley's Happy Pie Baking Company\u2014you'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trickle of drool rolled down Selina's cheek as she fought for consciousness. She barely had the strength to hold her head up, let alone finish this conversation. She was a stubborn woman, but her willpower was fading. Poor Selina could barely speak in such a state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, seven hours.\" Harley slipped her phone back into its marshmallowy prison, \"But only 'cause you ate aaaall your veggies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley blew her charge a kiss as she lumbered out the doorway. It took a few steps at her size, her wide waddling gait was hampered by the inadequate size of the doorway. She made a mental note to call up that Carpenter girl, see if she'd be down to make some more adjustments. At the rate she was going, Harley was gonna get to big to fit through half the doorways around her factory\u2014couldn't have that now, could we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hungry, manic look flashed across her pale white face as she hefted a handful of her stomach, jiggling it appreciatively as her dinner digested beneath all the hundreds of pounds of hot, heavy blubber... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Selina, night-night now!\" Harley said in a hurried voice as she hip-checked the door with a slam, \"Mama's got a date with a magic wand and she <i>ain't</i> gonna miss it...\"</span></div></div>",

Even given the <i>extenuating circumstances</i> that this week had brought her, it would take a lot more than Harley's forceful gourmandizing to dull those reflexes of hers. She'd been catting around Gotham for so many years that she could practically see how it could be done\u2014with enough speed coming at the sixty degree angle of the rooftop that sloped down her room's window, landing with a roll onto the lower level of the factory's shipping yard, then down to the parking lot. It was second nature to her, pouncing from here to there; escaping from hopeless situations like this was practically her superpower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason that she couldn't make it was the giant stomach she'd been lugging around for the longest week of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never seemed to go down, constantly stuffed hard and taut full of food that would make even the most rich and wealthy Gothamite green with envy. Harley had kept her stuffed at every waking moment; either by her own hand or through the chemical that she'd dosed her with on her first night in the factory. Selina couldn't stop herself from eating everything in sight, even when she was painfully full. Her whole week had been spent in a fog. Her mind was cloudy and her senses were dulled. No way she'd be able to make that jump with a stomach full of food and getting vertigo just from looking down. Forget the cutesy cat metaphors for a moment\u2014there was no way Selina would land on her feet. She'd be street pizza in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way she was going to stay a kept cat. Not by Harley, that much was for certain. That humongous harlequin had gone off her rocker for real this time, and she was going to take Catwoman down with her! All Selina had wanted was to check in on her old friend out of concern for her stark, sudden, <i>super-sized</i> public reappearance after a year of silence, and this was what it got her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of violent, intense stuffings at the hands of that pie-peddling Pagliacci, Selina could tell that the effects of her dosage had mostly waned. It took a lot of effort, but she was beginning to be able to think more clearly now. The fullness of her stomach still commanded a lot of her attention\u2014the squelching, bubbling belly that still stuck hard and full against her inner thighs as she crouched down on the floor of her room\u2014but her honed survival instincts were beginning to come back to her. For years she'd been cracking safes and picking locks in search of rare jewels and fine diamonds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the sweetest gem of all was freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof, that was cliche.\" Selina burped into the lock, \"I really have been cooped up here too long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week's indulgences (to put it lightly) had done some damage. The nimble Catwoman was sluggish. Slow, and logy. The distended stomach that pressed tightly against her boyshorts left her rocking unsteadily towards the floor. She felt so heavy and out of sorts. Even with the toxin working its way out of her system, she felt its presence lingering. Her sore muscles begged her to lay back in bed. To wait until morning. Breakfast was coming soon, and that sweet rush of serotonin that came with stuffing herself to absolute capacity would follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver persistent, the cat burglar picked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her rifling, she'd found a bobby pin. Then she'd found another one. It wasn't much, but for these old factory locks, it was just enough. These were some of the first ones she'd learned to pick, back when she was just a street kid. Maybe, even in her sluggish state, she'd... be able... to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Purr</i>fect.\" Selina smiled, one step closer to freedom <u>and</u> one successfully delivered cat pun richer, \"Now to get downstairs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley might have given the building new life as her base of operations, but the Happy Clown Confectionary warehouse was just an old Gotham City warehouse. It had been up since before gentrification of Old Town, give or take a few super villain fights. Under normal circumstances, that wouldn't have been much of a problem for a master thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a week like the one she'd suffered at the hands of Harley Quinn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CREEEEAKKKK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" Selina winced as her newfound heaviness caused the floorboards to whine, \"Shit shit shit shit shit...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ignoring her better instincts, the small hairs on the back of her neck tingling and the sense of dread that loomed over her, Selina kept crouching forward. Slowly, steadily, and with great effort to not make a single sound, the crafty Catwoman eeked her way out of what had been her bedroom for the past week. Her spread wide so as to balance her still-stuffed center of gravity, Selina slowly reached under the door and pulled it to. Just enough so that it would shut. Couldn't have one of Harley's goons see that she'd gotten herself out on one of their routine rounds. With any luck, she'd timed this <i>just</i> right, and she could get on with the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the soft sound of the lock clicking, Selina breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up a little early, aintcha Kitty Cat?\" Selina's blood ran cold at the sound of her former friend's voice piercing the silent factory floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her wooziness, Selina whipped around to see her captor. She was dressed for bed, if you could call her \"dressed\" at all. Harley's big white gut rolled untucked from her black pajama bottoms, clogging the hallway with her gargantuan size and whiteness. It hung so low, out in the open like this, crashing against her pillowy thighs and knees. Up top, she'd dressed in a frilly ruffled red tank top that barely managed to cover the bigness of her breasts. Her arms puddled to either side of her as she held a box of pop tarts in one hand, a trail of discarded silver wrappers behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up for a midnight snack?\" Harley smirked as Catwoman fell flat on her rump, \"I know I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley...\" Selina stuttered, slowly struggling against her turgid gut to bring herself to a standing position, \"Think about this. It doesn't have to be this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... lemme think about it.\" Harley tapped a finger to her blubber-buried chin, \"Yeah it does\u2014GUARDS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're wanting to widen the doorways, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna Duffy did her best to keep it professional. She'd gotten out of the hench wench game a long time ago, leaving her life as The Carpenter behind so that she could pursue her life's ambition of... well... being a carpenter. Lower-case C and everything. She'd even done her best to avoid some stupid on-the-nose naming convention like Wonderland Carpentry (\"prices so good, they're a wonder!\") to avoid any undue temptation. She was the one who'd helped Harley refurbish the old factory a while back, and they'd stayed in touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moving factory equipment through these things?\" Jenna did her best to keep her eyes on the clipboard, and not on her client, \"Pallets, forklifts, that kind of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only thing industrial size movin' through these doors is my tuchus.\" Harley's whole body wobbled with laughter as she slapped her old friend on the back, \"Gettin' outta the game does a real number on your figure, huh Jenna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" the Carpenter laughed uneasily, her round cheeks reddening, \"It's not easy to keep the calories off once your workout doesn't include running away from a guy with pointy ears in long johns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacked tight in a pair of extra large overalls, the belly-built brunette was another victim of \"going straight\". The swell of her gut was visible in the outline of her denim covers, fat little arms bulging at the sides as she made notations on her clipboard. She had put on a good sixty pounds since she'd hung up over overalls for... another, larger pair of overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't all bad though.\" Harley's hand rubbed up and down her stomach, snacking liberally on one of her prepackaged pies that she'd pilfered from the production line, \"You want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puh-<i>lease</i>.\" Harley dismissed, handing her fellow former hench wench a pie, \"I insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you pay me in cookies again.\" Jenna snorted, unwrapping an apple-filled sweet that was admittedly better off the line, \"Never again, or you'll have to roll me out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna used her free hand to run her thumb underneath the band of her overalls, pulling them as hard as she could. They were tighter than harp strings, holding her belly up like a hammock. She made a disgruntled, but not unfriendly face at the even fatter philanthropist that had thrown her so much work in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna, baby, darling, are you <i>implying</i> that I would do something so underhanded as to add a highly addictive chemical to my product as some sort of larger agenda?\" Harley snorted, \"Because that sounds like something that someone who hadn't gone <i>entirely straight and narrow</i> would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I... didn't say any of that. But alright.\" Jenna rolled her eyes, \"Weirdo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley cut her eyes at the curvature of the Carpenter's figure. She'd gone and gotten good and fat since the last time Harley had seen her. She'd had her doubts that the comparatively small amount of chemicals in each cookie might not have had a strong effect. But it was clear as day that Jenna had gotten hooked just like Harley wanted. That big belly in that tight little denim number looked so cute and squeezable, it took all of Harley's (relatively lacking) self control not to just snap those straps and get a handful for herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the second floor will be done in a few days.\" Jenna said, her mouth full of pie, \"You gonna be okay staying in a hotel until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding? It'll be like a little vacation.\" Harley waved her hand dismissively, \"And the bars on the windows? Extra strength locks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All part of what you paid for.\" Jenna nodded sagely, taking a swig from her Coke before taking another bite of apple pie, \"This place will be impregnable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In or out?\" Harley raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In or out.\" Jenna smiled, \"You're <i>sure</i> you've gone straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight as I ever was. I'm actually thinking about... hrmm... <i>expanding</i> my horizons.\" Harley purred, resting her hands on her billowing stomach and kneading her fleshy belly folds idly, \"New factories, new warehouse facilities, the works... Why don't we head to my office to talk turkey? I'll hook you up with a couple boxes of our new cupcakes. You'll love 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the carpenter formerly known as The Carpenter left (thousands of calories richer and desperately fumbling to undo the latches on her overalls) Harley could rest more easily. Luckily, during her first few trips out when they were originally renovating the factory, Harley had been smart enough to have the upper floor soundproofed. She'd said it was so that she didn't have to hear the machinery whirring, but it also came in handy for certain <i>other</i> reasons. If she'd heard Selina Kyle\u2014Catwoman\u2014stuffing herself stupid at Harley's behest, there was no way she would believe Harley had gone straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing she needed was bats in her belfry. Well, literal bats in her belfry. The metaphorical ones kept her company enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're gonna have to move you to another part of the factory for a few days.\" Harley clicked her tongue as she watched Selina stuff herself voraciously, \"But somethin' tells me you won't mind that too much, wouldja Kitty Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had tripled the dosage of Selina's initial pie to the face. The results were impressive\u2014no outward rebellion, no probable cause for worry. All Selina did, all she <i>could</i> do was eat. Just eat and eat and eat. No thoughts of escape, no snarky remarks, only food. For now, anyway. Harley would have to keep a close eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA <i>very</i> close eye, Harley corrected as a familiar tingle ran through her spine, watching her skinny friend viscerally pack it away without so much as a pause...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina lost all sense of self when the obese jester dosed her with that concentrated coconut cream pie, but she came back intermittently, getting flashes of what was happening around her. A burger stuffed into her cheeks, pancake syrup running down her chin, fistfuls of French fries. There was even the briefest memory of Harley making a second appearance coinciding with a painful sensation of being overfilled. The moments became more and more connected, until Selina finally managed to shake off the drug-induced stupor and endless hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolently wrenching a liter of some fuzzy fruit drink out of her mouth, Selina took a deep shuddering breath as she collected herself. A few hunger pangs and a weird sensation in the back of her head encouraged her to keep drinking, but she resisted. No more drugging for this cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept maybe some antacid, Selina thought, letting out a sickly belch as she tried, and failed, to get to her feet. Groaning, Selina made a second attempt and at last rose, stumbling around unsteadily. If she was ungainly before, she was ten times that now that she was under that drug's influence. The once lithe and dexterous cat burglar felt big and bloated, and unlike last time her stomach wasn't the only culprit. There weren't any mirrors in this place, but Selina wasn't looking forward to seeing the damage done; her face felt thick and heavy, and looking down she could see how far ahead of her a bloated, overstuffed belly hung. Rubbing her eyes, Selina even felt her once thin athletic arms jiggle side to side, bingo wings threatening to take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta...get outta here...\" Selina grumbled deeply, her voice thick and coarse from a long period of muteness. Taking one ponderous step after the other, she didn't bother to be as sneaky as before. If she could make noise to alert the guards back then she definitely would make noise now. Finally reaching the door out, Selina tried to open it up, and miraculously it did! Evidently, Harley had overestimated how much her formula would be able to keep this cat caged, which was good because she doubted her chubby digits would be able to work a lockpick at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubly fortunate was that it was apparently in the early hours of the morning. All the better to avoid unwanted guests. Selina meandered through the officers, her step lightly jostling nearby objects, before she spotted an open office. It wasn't Harley's office, since there wasn't nearly enough food wrappers lying around, just some faceless corporate mouthpiece, and importantly for Selina, a corporate mouthpiece with a desk calendar. Picking it up and counting backwards to the day she remembered breaking in in the first place, horror crossed her face when she finally got how long she was under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWO MONTHS?\" she shouted. \"How could I have been asleep for two months?\" More importantly, Selina thought, remembering that she still should keep her voice down (whoops)...how big did that make her after so many months of that? She was too groggy to figure out how big she was exactly, and frankly she preferred that. No more nasty surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course there was Harley, Harley and her crazy plan to fatten up Gotham. What had the jester been doing for the last few months while Selina was drugged out of her head? Again, she almost didn't want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though; Selina was a free woman, for however long it lasted. It was time to find-</span></div></div>",

After all, who knows what could have happened in two months; Harley could easily have done something to make Selina stick out like a sore thumb and end up getting grabbed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, whoever owned this workstation got lazy and left their computer on, password logged and everything. Selina immediately pulled up the GNN news website and the headline of the day immediately sprung into view, demanding attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Justice League and Great Ten Clash With Braniac in Taiwan: Millions at Risk of Displacement</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that explained why the Batman didn't arrive to save her before now and put an end to this, Catwoman thought bitterly. Seemed like all he ever did when things went down was wander off to a foreign country with the Justice League. No wonder he had so many kids in green shorts running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina scrolled to other news stories on other news sites, bouncing between the big national papers, the small local ones, and even some of the criminal networking sites to see what was up. In the midst of her searching, she instinctively picking up an opened candy bar and casually shoving it into her mouth before realizing what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Selina, you're not hooked on eating anymore,\" she chastised herself. \"Focus on the news!\" Grumbling to try and hide her stomach making the same noises, she kept on cycling through articles. It was all mostly puff pieces, but her keen eye did spy a couple similarities. For starters, crime actually seemed to be falling in recent days. The most recent scuffle had been with the Ventriloquist a week back but for Gotham things were oddly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, of course, was that people seemed to be getting steadily bigger as the days rolled by. It was subtle and hard to pick up on if you looked at each photo on its own, but Selina could see the unmistakable signs; clothes were looking tighter, bellies bulged out over waistbands, faces were well-rounded and sporting new chins. And of course a lot of food was involved. Especially in the last month, most of the photo subjects were eating or about to eat, and a good portion of them had suspiciously familiar packages adorned with the words \"Happy Co\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd some people were being hit more then others. Officer Mackenzie Sennett, that poor girl who was introduced to the Clown Prince of Crime shortly after arriving in Gotham, had an article that implied her retirement was due to not being able to fit into a squad car anymore. On one villain correspondence page, Lady Shiva led a discussion on sumo fighting styles after her old techniques were apparently \"becoming difficult\". Selina even got an enjoyable chuckle out of seeing a court illustration of Poison Ivy struggling to fit into a prison jumpsuit thanks to her plush figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is a silver lining...\" Selina grumbled, logging out of the computer and straightening up, her back aching from the weight of carrying her heaving, bloated bosom at an angle. God she was out of shape. \"Ugh...time to make my exit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it'd be a little cliche to drop the line about curiosity and cats, then?\" said someone behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina spun around, eyes widening in shock as she saw-</span></div></div>",

Or rather, could manage about a couple hundred pounds ago. She didn't turn around, but when the computer screen turned black Selina caught a glimpse of the crimson red helmet reflected in the blank monitor, and the silver object aligned with the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures you'd be the other one trying to break in,\" Red Hood mused. \"If you're after more snack cakes you're on the wrong floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too Jason,\" Selina cooed. \"How many more Robins are running around tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Hood snarled at the mere idea of being Robin again. \"Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't peg you right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it matter that I was kidnapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina saw the silver reflection in the screen lower somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidnapped? By Quinn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And gifted with this...figure,\" Selina grumbled, lifting up her double-rolled belly and letting it flop back down with a wet slap. Turning around when she heard the gun being holstered, she held her arms out, presenting all the rolls and folds pouring off of her outstretched limbs. \"Me and my bleeding goddamned heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood glanced off to the side, apparently considering something. A few months ago this would have been Selina's chance to pounce, land a good blow and dive out the window before John Wick Junior here could collect himself. Glancing down at her chubby digits and padded palms, Catwoman felt that this was unlikely to turn out that way. If anything she could maybe get a sluggish swipe in and scuff up the helmet before she collapsed into a sweating, messy heap. How on Earth did Harley think being like this, getting so large that you're unable to even move around properly, was a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should come with me, the others will want to know what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain, the alarms will be switching back on soon,\" Red Hood remarked urgently, checking his watch. \"There's a giant sun window in the stairwell East of here that I think you can fit through, I got one of Bruce's new grapple guns that can probably support your weight, but I brought a few more just in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Red,\" Selina interrupted. \"Are you seriously going to lower me out the window like I'm on a goddamned crane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes,\" Red Hood said matter-of-factly. \"Unless you want to take the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer poor beleaguered legs twinged at just the thought of climbing down from this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce trained the second Robin well, Selina thought with begrudging admiration as she stewed in the backseat of the decrepit old van Red Hood hotwired to get her blubbery butt out of danger. It couldn't have been easy trying to escape a facility like that one with a boulder-sized pile of blubber formerly known as Catwoman, but he managed to make it work. She couldn't see out the grime-covered windshield from where she was, but judging by the quality of the roads worsening they were heading out of the city proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're headed to the Batcave?\" Selina asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the old entrance, yes,\" Red Hood grumbled. \"This piece of shit can't make the jump into the waterfall with you jammed in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry me being kidnapped and fattened up is such an inconvenience to you.\" Selina crossed her arms, struggling past her own bingo wings for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you're not even the worst one that we had to deal with.\" Red Hood turned the van sharply, bouncing an unable-to-be-seat-belted Selina gently off the inside door and sending her wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this we anyway?\" Selina asked, a bit more forcefully after having been manhandled by her own girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much anyone with a bat close to their name that's not in Taiwan or whatever,\" Red Hood recounted. \"And me, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to know the skinny people are still out helping the rest of us,\" Selina mumbled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Hood made a sound close to a scoff. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina didn't bother to even move until the former Robin got out of the car to help her. Pulled out by the arms, her rump briefly got caught by the door before she was tugged free. Selina, surprisingly, found herself stumbling into the somewhat familiar setting of the  Batcave, as dark and dismal as it always was on the rare occasions she caught a glance of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oracle!\" Red Hood called out. \"You're gonna want to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina waddled past the van to get a glimpse of the former Batgirl, propped up and typing away in front of a wide array of computer screens and...</span></div></div>",

The pacifism of those mentally unable to function cohesively with the rest of Gotham City has become muddled with merely trying to contain these so-called supervillains, leaving treatment for those with more traditionally damaged psychoses severely lacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s more is that most of the \u201cinmates\u201d at Arkham Asylum, those being held at the Asylum for lack of a better prison to hold them and their peculiar abilities, have the lowest retention rate of them all. Every other week, it seemed that one of their high-profile patients had found some way to make their way out of the asylum. Be it Two-Face with his connections on the outside, Victor Zsasz fashioning a shiv to stab the guards out of seemingly nothing, or the Joker somehow fashioning a great escape out of a paper clip, a rubber band, and two Dixie cups. These people are a poison to those around them, and their mere presence dissuades any actual growth in their fellow patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Jeremiah Arkham, the current director of the Asylum, sought outside assistance in an effort to treat the problem\u2014an unconventional treatment for an equally unconventional prognosis. Dr. Hermann Gilman, one of the best minds in criminal psychology, was brought aboard as soon as the director contacted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new approach towards patient pacification was highly unorthodox, and it was no wonder no other credible institution had permitted him to test his hypothesis before Jeremiah Arkham contacted him. His theories on the correlation between mental health and physical health weren\u2019t so out of the ordinary; it was how he intended to abuse these theories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Arkham wasn\u2019t exactly a credible institution anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being brought aboard and formally promoted to Head of Patient Rehabilitation, Dr. Gilman was given a lab and several assistants, along with all the equipment he would need to test his hypothesis. The only missing component to his little test was a subject\u2014a new inmate, one of these \u201csuper-criminals\u201d, preferably without any superhuman abilities that might alter the course of his experiment. But where, in a place like Arkham Asylum, was he going to find someone who fit all the criteria? Most of the high-profile cases had at least some form of super-human abilities that stemmed from a cellular level. One of the very few that fit the bill was the Joker, and he was warned very explicitly that it would <i>not</i> be wise to conduct experiments with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was perfect\u2014the result of a chemical bath and completely insane, but otherwise with no superhuman abilities to muddle the process. The Joker was the perfect candidate for Dr. Gilman\u2019s experiment, and if he could cure <i>him</i>, just imagine what credibility that would lend to his methods? However, despite the great power and authority bestowed upon him, Dr. Arkham was very adamant that the Joker was a very special case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Gilman was literally just about to settle for a lower-profile character, Roxanne \u201cRoxy Rocket\u201d Sutton, when the answer to his prayers came kicking and screaming through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, GETCHER HANDS OFF ME YA MOOKS!\u201d came the shrill nasal whining of their most recent readmittance through the security monitors, \u201cI\u2019VE GOT RIGHTS, YA KNOW!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarleen Quinzelle\u2014better known as Harley Quinn\u2014was of a similar makeup to the Joker, with whom she was usually romantically involved with. Similar skin bleaching, abnormal hair color as a result of a similar chemical bath (red and black to his green) and of a comparable insanity fueled by inherit sociopathic tendencies and a desire for Joker\u2019s affections. She, like the Joker, often committed crimes dressed up as a clown and had a penchant for using lethal gag-themed weapons. If his information was correct, she used to be a doctor at Arkham Asylum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her on the surveillance monitors and instantly knew that she was perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile slid across Dr. Gilman\u2019s face upon the arrival of his newest subject. He immediately had her ordered to\u2014</span></div></div>",

I'm not able to fully promise you anything right now, but I think I might be able to remove her 'mad love' of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilman was given a sympathetic chuckle in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the first time a doctor's said they could cure these people Hermann.\" The warden reminded, \"You only have to look at the very woman you wish to experiment on to see what regularly happens to those with big aspirations.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilman stopped his rebuttal after last sentence. He never did consider what would happen to himself had he started the experiment. There were thousands of Joker horror stories alone. The mere thought of what would happen if he tried people like Pamela Isley or god forbid, Jane Doe, nearly convinced the poor guy to peddle back, maybe try a different career. But Gilman's fear was a weak toxin, effortlessly destroyed by one thing, determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If something does make me insane,\" Gilman promised, \"You'll have every right to put me down. But I need to at least try my idea sir. Most if not all of the therapy methods here have been dominated by the use of hostility whether they be from Dr. Crane or Mr. Bolton. Maybe we should tray the opposite of fear and torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't name too many people that gave me permission to kill 'em should things go wrong.\" Arkham admitted, \"Alright, you got your file on Quinzelle. It'll be at your office within ten or fifteen minutes. Anything else you need of me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could tell the men apprehending her to postpone her arrival at her cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure? Don't tell me you're already starting the treatment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? The residents here like to plan ahead right? Best to get this going before someone like the Joker can screw it up, in my opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. I wish you luck, Dr. Gilman. You're really going to need it.\" Jeremiah said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of chemical preparations and cooking, Dr. Gilman had received Harley Quinn's file. It was of fairly average size, maybe a touch wider than most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Dr. Gilman said to an assistant while opening the file, \"Odd. There seems to be a few pieces of black paper mixed in with the regular white papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are Batman's reports sir.\" The assistant explained, \"If you want, I can take those out and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just flat out ignore info that comes from the man who's interacted with Quinn more than myself?\" Dr. Gilman scoffed, \"I'm not sure why, but I have a feeling in my gut that says it'd be wise to read these papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so Doctor.\" The assistant said before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilman read every single sentence of the file, twice. He made sure that he caught every single detail, he needed to know everything about this woman before he tried his new method out. As he finished reading, Gilman received a call from one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, Ms. Quinzele is getting very reckless here.\" The guard said, \"Can we please take the lady to her cell now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we're ready for her now.\" Dr. Gilman said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---------------------------------------------------------</div><b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell are you always lookin' at that clock?\" A wooden puppet asked, sitting opposite of Harley at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Countin' the time.\" Harley said, which wasn't exactly a lie. She just wasn't just counting for pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been thirty minutes before the people at Arkham were finally able to shove Harley into her cell. It wouldn't have been more obvious if they flat out told the woman \"We're just keeping you here until the trap is fully complete\".  Quinn had to be alert, she knew something had to be going down. She just didn't know <i>what</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, the slender clown was about to be moved from the absolutely lame-o-roni recreational room. That place had nothing but dumb books, lame games, insufferable fellow patients, and a sorely out of date television. Several of the more \"interesting\" patients were often banned from even stepping near this place so that destroyed the possibility of her hanging out with her best friends. With one notable exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought that Clock King was og-sessed wit' time.\" The puppet continued as the quiet man holding it looked straight ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you anxious ta know anyway?\" Harley asked with irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just askin' a koo-estion.\" The puppet said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, leave me alone will ya?\" Harley asked, \"I'm focusin' on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing oo-ill distract ya huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, I'm totally up and alert.\" She answered, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>Harrrley</i>! It's ya uncle J!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little great caused Harley to look over at the entrance as excitement filled her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puddin', is that you?!\" Quinn asked with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she continued to gaze at that direction, excitement turned into suspicion as the slim jester turned back towards the quiet man, this time with a small childlike grin on his face. Harley wasn't amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha haaaaaaaa...\" Harley sarcastically laughed before a little smile took over her lips, \"I have ta say though, ya really did nail Mistah J's voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How Shocking.\" The Puppet snarked, \"A guy that's good with th-oices is good soundin' like anotha guy's th-oice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup.\" Harley said defensively before a group of guards approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Quinn,\" The man said, \"Your cell is ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later Arnie, you too Scarface!\" Quinn waved before being pushed out the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes, Harley Quinn was finally in front of her old cell. She tried to do as much decorating as she could to make it her \"home\". After all, if she's gonna get dragged here all the time, might as well personalize it a little. As the guards gently walked Harley in the cell and uncuffed her, Harley daydreamed about immediately snapping the guard's neck and running away. The other guard with a taser dissuaded her from pulling the stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harley was alone in her cell, she almost crash landed on her bed before something caught her eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a medium sized plate with a generously sized sandwich on it. Harley looked at the meal sitting on the floor for a few seconds. It <i>did</i> look delicious, but then again that's exactly the kind of thought these people would want her having. Just then, a shadow loomed over Quinn's cell as she turned to see Dr. Gilman standing right in the center, staring at Quinn through the observation glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy it.\" The doctor said, \"I didn't know your favorite dish so I just made a simple sandwich.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" She snarked, \"Hate ta break to ya Doc but I'm already taken.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I wouldn't <i>dream</i> of breaking you two up. It's just a new courtesy for all patients who enter Arkham, returning or otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you pour in the sandwich?\" Harley asked bluntly, she was ditzy, not stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermann put on a grin and walked closer to her, soon he was so close he could breathe on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ketchup, mustard, a little bit of pickle relish.\" The doctor quipped, \"Nothing I'd personally put on a sandwich but I'm not really a condiment person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley Quinn walked to her bed and sat down, looking at the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't want to eat it?\" She asked, eyeing Gilman carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll take it out and store it away for a few hours before it's time for dinner.\" Gilman answered, barely changing his expression, \"I just thought you'd want something to eat to heal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Harley asked, \"That's supposed to heal me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from what I understand you've been very busy out there. Always running, jumping, fighting, moving, that takes a hard toll on your body. I wanted to make sure you rested and got some nutrition in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess you're right.\" Harley admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, what if Joker needs you for something? Surely it'd be easier to help him with a full stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley then fell silent once the Doctor mentioned her Puddin'. Harley remembered all those times she found it hard to participate in Joker's schemes without at least eating an apple. And hell, when <i>did</i> she eat last? As much as this Gilly guy was suspicious, he wasn't wrong. And then Harley remembered that a certain flying rodent would never any allow doctor at Arkham to seriously harm the patients. It seemed very likely that this Doctor was simply nice, hopelessly naive for sure, but still nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ms. Quinn?\" Gilman asked, \"Are you going to eat the meal or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley thought it over for well over a minute before she turned the Doctor. She had made her decision. </span></div></div>",

The worst of the super-criminals like the Joker were for once safely locked away in Arkham, the usual gangsters and hoodlums kept their heads down in fear of the shadows looming overhead, and with the recent news that a whole slew of villains had been defeated by the Batman and his allies, it looked like the good times were here to stay. For once, Gotham slept soundly tonight, with one small exception working furiously in an abandoned chemical plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One part adrenobooster, two parts...no, three parts...limizion 12? No, 13, it's...uh....shucks, this is harder then it looks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spritely jester attempting a mad science experiment while bedecked in a lab coat and goggles hastily thrown  over her black and white checkered outfit furiously went through pilfered chemical textbooks as the large basin full of bubbling green compound began to stew. Indeed, while times were good for the good people of Gotham, things were rough for the criminal populace, especially Harley Quinn. When she heard the Joker had been taken back to Arkham a while back, she had tried to think positive, using the absence to strike out on her own and get away from her rep as 'the Joker's main squeeze', becoming her own woman and all that jazz. It worked well at first, and she had some fun knocking over mob banks with Two-Face or museums with Catwoman, but without the special spark of the Joker's zaniness, Harley began to struggle. Her technique became tired, and more then once she had to be saved by an erstwhile ally, and thanks to their last encounter (the aforementioned supervillain battle that she only narrowly escaped), those erstwhile allies were few and far between nowadays. What she needed was a new gimmick, something with a fresh coat of paint that'd really knock the bat-socks off of Batman and Batfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thanks to a fit of inspiration, she had her gimmick. Since she was known as being the Joker's second fiddle, Harley reasoned, what would be the best way to surprise Batman and company? Why, arrive with another villain's playbook in hand! At first she considered finding some of Scarecrow's fear toxin or Mad Hatter's mind control gizmos, but since her usual modus operandi was all about being funny and clever and playing mind games, it made sense to go in the other direction; sheer, raw, power. And luckily it was easy to sneak some Venom away from the deadly mercenary Bane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was the easy part. The small sample Harley yoinked wasn't nearly enough for personal use, so she decided to copy the formula and make some extra herself; Harley Quinn Home Brewed Steroid Juice! She managed to figure out how the stuff multiplied cells and augment physical ability pretty easily, but having them target the right place was the hard bit; Harley had been struggling all night to find the answer, and she was so close when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, got it! That should....oh?\" Harley blinked as the bubbling green compound suddenly turned a murky deep blue. \"That's...odd...but the book says that Ilihan-5 should help it target the right place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley considered this for a moment, then with a triumphant smirk she tossed the textbook over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the book sez, then the book sez!\" she insisted as she started scooping out the formula into vials that can be inserted into injection guns. \"And to think High School thought I was a D in Chemistry. Show's what you knows, Miss Applebottom!\" Harley blew a raspberry at the imagined teacher as she finished loading up the chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I gots my Venom,\" she mused. \"Now it's time...\"</span></div></div>",

She had always considered herself lucky to be one of the few champions of plant-life to go unmutated. the Floronic Man wasn't nearly as pretty to look at as she was and Swamp Thing... was called Swamp Thing. Not Handsome Creature from the Swamp. While she mostly disassociated with humanity, the fact that she had achieved her ecological enlightenment without so much as a scar on her pretty face was something she took no small amount of pride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, what good was having the ability to control pheromones if she didn't <i>look</i> the part of a seductress, right? Poor old plain Pam Isely would have never gotten the chance to live like Poison Ivy did\u2014all frumpy and mousy. Now that she had been granted a rebirth through the green, shouldn't she live a little at the expense of the meatbags she so willfully exploited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, Ivy had been in a particularly irritated mood for the past week or so. She felt drained, her leaves were wilting and her skin was paling. She had been hiding under a hood, laying low where she could by squatting in old boarded up crack houses, long abandoned in a silly game of musical chairs. For six days she hadn't seen the sun, or the Bat, after her latest attempt at Ecological Emancipation had failed. She had been <i>so</i> miserable, and the only thing that could bring light to her life was this precious little daffodil growing through the crack of the Gotham City sidewalk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then some <i>jackass</i> in a gas-guzzling Hummer hopped up on the curb and ran over it\u2014ripped it up, right by the roots! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-skinned guardian of the green was <i>so</i> upset, and <i>so</i> disheartened by the defeat of such a precious underdog daffodil that she followed the Hummer driver home to his penthouse and ripped up <i>his</i> roots a little. She had finally found an outlet for her terrible outlook, and it came in a tight v-neck, smelled like Axe body spray, and lived on nothing but Monster energy drink. Once she'd had her fun, convincing the neighborhood plants and the mold in his drains to strangle him for a few good hours, Ivy decided to rob the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause why not, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow she wound up staring into his refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Ivy licked her lips at the sight of a red and white aerosol can, \"Whipped cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Ivy wasn't much of an eater. She had a trim figure to keep, yes, but there was so much work to be done when you were planning the Roundup Revolution on behalf of the plant life around you that kept one from enjoying a particularly indulgent meal. The craving struck her as odd but, hey, she'd just liquidated a guy. Why not indulge a little, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she extended one long green pointer finger along the nozzle, and aimed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmm~!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poisonous person's heart fluttered as her green eyes rolled into the back of her head. Soft, fluffy cream of sugar hit her tongue and at once she felt the throbbing in the back of her head go away. She had had this headache for so long that she'd almost forgotten what life was like without it! Her mouth filled with the stuff, foaming out of the nozzle with a high-pitched hiss that went on and on and on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm! Oh my...\" Ivy blushed, wiping a dollop of whipped cream from the corner of her mouth, \"Danny Danny <i>Danny</i>... you sure do know how to please a woman, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to the withered, emaciated husk that used to be Danny, the Hummer-driving jackass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you used to.\" she snorted, dipping back into the fridge, \"But then, judging by that Ed Hardy t-shirt, I doubt that you've ever that at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ivy knew it, the can of whipped cream was gone. Disappeared into her tight green stomach. But she had never felt better. Not once in her life. She was so full of energy, if not a bit thirsty\u2014maybe this douchebag kept some mineral water somewhere? He looked like the type to ironically carry a bottle\u2014and though she had no way of knowing, the color was swiftly returning to her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>may</i>\u2014just may\u2014be back for some more of that stuff, Danny.\" Ivy said to the husk as she closed the fridge door, \"I mean, it's not like you're going to need it, right? Or that watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the credit card or the tablet or the car...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who are we kidding?\" Ivy said with a smile, twirling the key around her finger and reaching back into the fridge, \"I'll just take one for the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why, but she was drawn, almost magnetically, to some of the sugary crap that Danny had in his cabinets. Whipped cream (probably doing whippits or huffing the aerosol\u2014he had a lot of it) and the coffee creamer he kept. But also the cake frosting that he had in the cabinets, and some of those twinkies that he had stashed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a cheat day, I suppose.\" Ivy said in a dismissal sort of tone, barely thinking anything out of sorts as she loaded up the passenger seat of Danny's hummer with sugary sweets. \"Ugh, look at me. Binging. Driving a Hummer. I make myself sick sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't need the car long. Just long enough to get to...</span></div></div>",

Ivy devoured what must've been a five-pound steak in minutes, her stomach eagerly awaiting more. She reached over for a leg of turkey, tearing into the rich meat and savoring every morsel that touched her tongue. All of Harley's dishes went much the same way, and before I've knew it, the table had been thoroughly emptied, with most of the foodstuffs formerly occupying its surface now resting in her taut and turgid tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*BUUUUUUURP!*</b> Excuse me...\" Ivy moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no sweat, Red.

Normally, this would be the point where Batman would swoop in, defeat her evil plans, and lock her back up in Arkham. But he was nowhere to be found. Ivy wasn't surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she had managed to take over the entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough months of extensive training and use of chemicals, Ivy had managed to grow her powers immensily, and proceded to take over Gotham with her plants. Her vines destroyed or completely covered the buildings, her pheromones had permanently taken over the minds of everyone in Gotham, and most importantly of all, she finally managed to defeat the Batman. After that, she spread her powers to the rest of the country, and then the world. Everyone fell under her control, and she finally achieved her goal of returning the world to it's natural state. She was now ruling like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had no opposition (she gave a whole island to the other Arkham villians to do as they see fit), she spent most of her days in the Gotham Botanical Gardens, which she made her palace. Aside from giving orders, she mostly just lazed around and absorbed sun and water, having no need for actual food. But much like food, the sun and water had a noticable effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she still had other duties that day, Ivy frowned and got up from her throne, taking a moment to look down at her green skinned body. In the months since she had taken over and started lazing around, she had gained a considerable amount of weight. She guessed that she weighed around 300 pounds now. While her breasts did grow to about F-cups and she had a fairly large belly, most of her weight had settled in her hips, thighs, and butt, which had ballooned incredibly. Her hips jutted out to about a foot on each side, and her thighs were as thick as her vines. But her butt was her now biggest feature. Each cheek was the size of a basketball, and it jiggled with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy felt proud of her new figure, as it reflected on her new life as the ruler of the planet. And besides, the Earth was massive, so why shouldn't she, as \"Gaia's Avatar\", as she often called herself, be the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swinging open pulled her out of her thoughts.

Catwoman had indeed been richly rewarded for her loyal friendship with Poison Ivy; not only had the Goddess of the Earth spared her from mind control, the cat burglar had been gifted much of the French countryside as her personal estate (with a green-powered jet to help her get around, of course), turning it into a massive cat sanctuary, as well as all of the world's greatest treasures and gemstones which Ivy had no interest in keeping once she had taken over. If Ivy was a goddess, then Selina Kyle had become a queen, with all the luxuries she could ever want and a legion of mindless servants to til the land and provide her with the finest wines and the most splendid meals one could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last bit, naturally, was why Selina had to be squeezed into the elegant dress she wore nowadays. Like Ivy, Selina's new lifestyle bred laziness and she had also gained quite a bit of weight. While weighing slightly less then Earth's new goddess, Selina more then made up for it with her monstrous rack. Propped up on Selina's belly like prize trophies, they were a delightfully round pair of G-cup straining cleavage that Selina could not, or did not bother to, completely cover with her dress. Sure she had no chance of catching up to Ivy and her ability to hog a sofa to herself with those hips, but the way they gently swayed with each step Selina took and challenged her own definition of massive beauty made Earth's goddess feel quite jealous. Moreso when the ex-cat thief reached into her cleavage and pulled out a large datapad she had been keeping stored in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know if you planned to do anything about the Green Lantern Corps snooping around,\" Selina asked. \"I've spotted a couple of them scouting my area, and I imagine they're still pretty sore about what you did with some of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am unconcerned. Individual Lanterns may be upset, but the Guardians will preserve the status quo,\" Ivy said dismissively. \"Earth belongs to me now, and they won't try to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but the Guardians are not the only ones out there, Pam,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right, but the longer they wait, the more my control grows, Selina,\" Ivy said, a confidently wicked grin spreading across her chubby cheeks. \"Every day I become more in tune with the green, drawing in more of Gaia's energy and expanding my control more and more. Soon not even the New Gods or the forces of Apokolips will be able to unseat Gaia's protector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In more ways then one,\" Selina commented, glancing to the throne that Ivy was close to filling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Pam,\" Selina reassured her. \"I'm just pleased things are going well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Ivy's dominance of the Earth complete and her transformation into the bloated Avatar of Gaia well under way, it seemed like all hope really was lost. The heroes were all dead or under her control, and even Superman and the Justice League had retreated from the planet, taking however many innocent people he could find to settle them on a new world. And with no outside powers willing or interested enough to intervene, it didn't seem like there was anyone left that was powerful enough to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that stopped a few enterprising individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the fall of Batman was devastating for Gothamites and in time the world, it was business as usual for Barbara Gordon, otherwise known as Oracle. She had helped to keep Gotham safe when the earthquake devastated the city years ago without Bruce, and while she faced an uphill battle and an enemy more powerful then anyone in No Man's Land, she was prepared to do whatever it took to save the world from Pamela's wicked tendrils. Her new base of operations may be small and secretive, but she had a small legion of drones and robots and years of supplies to help fuel her war against the new and improved Poison Ivy, so she wasn't about to give up just yet. Even if all those processed foods she was eating (Ivy would know if someone was eating the fresh produce that her babies produced) were starting to have a dramatic effect on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the biggest mistake Ivy made during her conquest was to placate the villains she once aligned herself with, rather then drive them off like the heroes. Most of them were content to live in their fiefdoms and fortresses granted to them by Ivy; Talia al Ghul was not one of them. Talia had suffered greatly under Ivy's conquest, losing her beloved Bruce and seeing her Father go down fighting trying to stop Ivy's takeover of the planet. She had lied and told Ivy that their sacrifices were necessary, and perhaps told herself that too, indulging in hedonistic fantasies in her palace to fill the hole left in her heart. She would have gone on like that, had Ivy not found and dragged her beloved son Damien, the last of Bruce left in this world, and took his mind from him. It was the last straw, and the push Talia al Ghul needed to bring back the League of Shadows and begin her plot to overthrow this new tyrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, some had less noble and altruistic problems with the new regime. Harley Quinn for instance had been one of Ivy's greatest allies, and had been richly rewarded for that loyalty with everything her heart desired. She traded dingy backalley warehouses for a grand mansion, filled with all the video games and comics she could find, a brainwashed staff to look after her and make the biggest and tastiest meals in the world, and above all, her darling Mr. J at her side, given a brainwashing by Poison Ivy to be the doting, kind-hearted love that Harley deserved. She had just about everything she could ever want, and by the time a few months passed, she realized it kinda sucked. There was no one online to play games with anymore, all her favorite comic book and tv show storylines remained uncompleted, and the only people she ever talked to were mind controlled, lifeless imitations of real people. The only thing to break up the boredom were the impressive feasts that her staff served to her, and even those were beginning to get sort of stale (though Harley gobbled them up all the same). It didn't take long for Harley to consider that maybe Ivy's takeover of the entire Earth was seriously screwing with her leisure time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the question is, who's going to be the one behind the plot to overthrow Ivy's big fat butt?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Ever since Ivy had become this fat goddess, it has been very difficult on Talia al Ghul, losing Bruce and her own father to this, talia had to let herself go, growing tubby, her stomach stuck out of her clothing, her face had begun to poof out and a second chin was swell on its way, her thighs had thickened, butt inflated, and breasts begun to sag. She weighed somewhere around 180lbs, she needed to make a plan and revolt against ivy before it was too late and she was too fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAnother day on this hell of a planet and that monster still has my son, under her influence and I\u2019m setting her getting fat\u201d she said. She looked down at her stomach, her biggest feature and problem at the moment, \u201cI must bring what\u2019s left of the league together, to defeat ivy, but I want to be the one that ends her\u201d Talia said in anger, she slammed her hand on the table and sent a shock wave through her body, and then it hit her, \u201cI will rally what\u2019s left of the league and we can act as Ivy\u2019s personal bodyguards, and when the time is right, we\u2019ll kill her\u201d she said. Talia thought this was a great plan, \u201cIt probably won\u2019t work tubs\u201d someone said, Nyssa her sister walked into the room, \u201cIvy relies on her plants to be her bodyguards and too many of us would be suspicious, and your quite frankly not fit enough for this\u201d she said. \u201cI am too fit, just cuz I\u2019ve put on a few, doesn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t complete the mission\u201d Talia said. Her stomach started growling,\u201d It sounds like your stomach did the talking for you\u201d Nyssa said, Talia grunted and put her hands on her stomach, \u201csister you\u2019re practically unfit now, you\u2019ve gained weight, just like ivy, you\u2019ve gotten lazy on us and it shows\u201d Nyssa said patting her sisters stomach, \u201cwell where\u2019s the toned abs you once had?\u201d Talia replied. Nyssa too had started getting lazy and small pot belly stuck out, \u201cI\u2019m just bloated\u201d she said. \u201cSister we have to do something... we can\u2019t live like this anymore\u201d Talia said, \u201c look what it has done to us, we\u2019ve practically gone soft and have lost everything\u201d Talia continued, her stomach still longing for food, she got up and grabbed something to eat to please her stomach. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it would work, I\u2019ve seen the size of ivy, she\u2019s huge, and her friend is just as big\u201d Nyssa said. They both sat in silence while Talia ate her food, her top was really starting to get tight on her, her stomach was showing a little bit more now, \u201cWe must do something sister, we\u2019re both bloating outwards and we\u2019ll just as big as them if we don\u2019t stop this\u201d Talia said, Nyssa looked at her sisters stomach, \u201cif I don\u2019t do anything soon, Talia will be useless and too big to do anything\u201d she said in her mind. Talia got up and Nyssa got glimpse of Talia\u2019s backside, she noticed how big her butt had gotten and her back fat, \u201cdefinitely gotten lazy\u201d Nyssa said in her mind. Talia went to go get another snack, food was the only thing that could comfort her. \u201cNyssa you want anything?\u201d Talia asked her, \u201cSure\u201d Nyssa replied. Talia then brought back the snacks and the two sisters started eating. \u201cMhmmm\u201d Talia said, rubbing her belly, Nyssa\u2019s own pot belly was starting to turn into a muffin top, \u201cthe food is indeed good, but we\u2019re just getting fat\u201d said Nyssa, Nyssa had self control where her sister did not. Talias top has gotten to tight, it started to come loose, \u201cmy my sister, seems you\u2019ve gained too much weight for your top there\u201d Nyssa said as she watched her sisters top come undone leaving her in a bra and showing a full belly. Talia then quickly as she could tried to put it back on, \u201clet me help you with that\u201d Nyssa said as she laced it back together and not tight like it used to be. \u201cThank you Nyssa, I URRP would\u2019ve failed getting it back on\u201d Talia said, \u201cyour welcome, try not to get any fatter, since your bursting out of your clothes now\u201d Nyssa said. Talia then gave her a smirk and walked away towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Once Talia arrived at her room, she fell backwards onto her bed, her fat jiggled, \u201cI must think of a plan to rid of the fat witch, she\u2019s made all of us fat, I\u2019ve got to stop eating so much, I look like I\u2019m about to pop\u201d Talia said, she then laid in bed trying to think of a plan to end this. Talia had a hand resting on her belly, rubbing it, feeling how soft and squishy it had become. She fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, so where exactly does this leave...?\" Ivy asked expectantly as her pointer finger darted between herself and Harley, who stared blankly at her with bright blue eyes. Her naivete (or psychopathy) was definitely showing. \"...us? Where does this leave <i>us</i>, Harl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's blank expression brightened a bit, as if she suddenly understood the problem presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Red, I... uh... I really didn't think that there was a 'us'...\" Harley half-laughed with flustered red cheeks, averting the piercing green gaze of her chloropathic roommate, \"I mean... well you know! I'm on rebound--I'm allowed to 'speriment a little before me an' Mistah J get back together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe criminal comedianne sensed the tensity growing behind Ivy's eyes, which narrowed slightly upon the honest admission of her feelings. An anxious squeak escaped her, her smile becoming much less apologetic and much more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I mean you an' me have done this kinda thing before, y'know? I-I-I just thought that you... I mean not that I don't <i>like</i> what we do. You do. To me. Probly not tonight, but maybe later?\" Ivy's gaze sharpened before her very eyes, making the masochistic mistress of mayhem recoil in anticipation of a slap across the cheek, \"N-Nevah mind just I'll just uh... oy vey Harl ya really screwed the pooch this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An <i>interesting</i> choice of words, all things considered...\" Ivy looked sharply into the other room before pressing on the upper bridge of her nose with her forefinger and thumb, \"Look just... tell me <i>why</i>? After everything I've done for you lately, <i>why</i> you thought you could just... sleep around on me! And how are we <i>NOT</i> in a committed relationship?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I 'unno.\" Harley answered with a shrug, \"We nevah go out, we nevah go see movies, ya don' pick me flowers like ya used to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't take you out anymore because you're a WANTED CRIMINAL!\" Ivy threw her hands up, \"And for that matter, so am I! We're in HIDING. And, while we're at it, I'VE NEVER PICKED YOU FLOWERS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe that's part of the problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's attempt at humor was met with a low growl from her girlfriend, who hunched and straightened her arms in anger. Her lip curled into a slight snarl, causing Harley to bounce right off the bed. A thud as Harley's toned tuchas met the floor, Ivy's head falling between her hands as she sounded a deep sigh. There was a pause as Harley worked her way into criss-cross applesauce position on the floor, looking back up at Poison Ivy with her pleadingly big blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm really sorry, Red.\" she said quietly, \"I mean you've been real swell lookin' after me since me an' Mistah J... went on a break. I guess I shoulda been more clear with my intentions an' whatnot before I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Ivy said flatly, her hands falling from her face as they fell between her knees, not a puffy eye between them as she looked back at Harley on the floor, \"It's my fault for getting attached. You're right, we've done this before and we'll probably do it again. I guess I just thought <i>this</i> time you might have started to see me as more than just your rebound girl. Apparently I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's heart sank as her head ducked down, making her look all the more pitiful on the cold hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should... probly just go.\" Harley said sadly as she shambled to her feet and started for the doorway, \"I mean, don' wanna make things any more awkward than they already are, right? I undastand if ya never wanna speak to me again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just... wait.\" Ivy turned slightly on the bed, arms folded now in an attempt to sequester herself from the situation, \"If I turn you loose now, you won't be anywhere but Arkham by tomorrow morning. I guess... if you <i>promise</i> to keep a low profile... you can stay here. With me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's eyes, in that instant, looked much softer and younger than any time Harley had ever known her. The sternness and callousness that naturally came with being an evironmental terrorist seemed to melt away. She looked almost innocent, a genuine sadness glistening behind her eyes as she looked up at Harley from the bed. Not that it mattered, but it was very easy for Harley to forget that she had a body-count longer than her arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Red, I knew ya couldn't stay mad at me!\" Harley erupted as she bounced back over to the bed and locked her roommate in a hug, \"I promise, ya won't even know I'm here! I'll be as quiet as a church-mouse! As silent as a statue! Just paint me black an' white an' call me a mime! I swear I'll--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, enough!\" Ivy called out for the second time that night, this time fighting back a slight smile that threatened to break across her dark green lips, \"I get it, you'll be quiet. It's not like I even believe you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at one another, Ivy nestled slightly between Harley's small (yet perky!) breasts. A long red strand of hair the only thing between her lips and the soft creamy skin of Harley's right tit. She could hear her heartbeat in the silence that followed Harley's outburst, both of them seemingly realizing how awkward the situation they found themselves in truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... who's gonna tell Selina to hit the bricks?\" Harley asked, breaking the silence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" Ivy answered, her tone darkly energetic, \"You can just watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Ivy's room was considerably more natural in design (natural meaning overrun by out of control botanical creatures over varying normalcy) Harley's room had a much more ecclectic feel to it. She'd only been living in Ivy's safehouse for a week now, and hadn't had the time she'd liked to have had to make the room truly hers. no giant teddy bears or any pretty pink wallpaper, but a large enough collection of stuffed animals... only half of which contained firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina Kyle, alias Catwoman, sat in her pajamas with the bottoms of her feet together atop Harley's fluffy comforter set, her knees out butterfly-style while she folded her hands across the canyon made by the arches of her feet. She smiled knowingly at the ultimatum she had been given, and had predicted she would find herself in a situation not unlike this one before the night was over. She could still see the regret flickering in the back of Harley's mind, both for doing the act and letting Ivy loose on her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't bother her, of course, because she had a <i>much</i> better idea on how to work all this out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have a <i>much</i> better idea of how to work all this out.\" Selina said finally, that cutesy smile on her face as Ivy stared daggers at her, \"And I think it'll make just about everyone involved happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza party?\" Harley asked, one blonde eyebrow raised inquisitively <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm gonna love this.\" Ivy rolled her eyes, \"Alright Selina, what's your alternative? Not that I'm not going to <i>enjoy</i> throwing you out in the rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lanky catburglar reached over to the side of Harley's bed and grabbed her purse, which shared her taste for black leather. One hand plunged inside and, not a moment later, returned with a fat stack of hundred dollar bills held together with a hair band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could start paying rent?\" Selina said, her smile much more knowing and her eyebrows raised expectantly, \"I'm looking for a little down time and you girls have a real eye for real estate. I figured since you're already letting Harley stay here rent free, you could use a little extra scratch around the house. That is, assuming Bud and Lou aren't just your emergency food supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay the wad of green on the bed and let it sit for a moment before Ivy picked it up, ran a thumb across it, and tucked it into her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a generous mood this evening.\" Ivy questioned, \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That</i> was more than enough for groceries.\" Catwoman pointed to the wad of cash that pressed against Ivy's bra, \"And if you're asking how much I <i>made</i> well... a girl never kisses and tells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked at Harley, whose sheepish smile returned upon their collectively judgmental gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not asking for us to be besties.\" Selina stated with her hands in the air, \"I'm looking for a place to crash, you girls need the cash. It's a win-win situation. With any luck, I'll be out of your hair and out of the game forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever?\" Harley piped up, \"That musta been some haul you pulled in, Kitty-Kat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina purred slightly as she stretched, \"Well I've still gotta fence some stuff buuuuut... yeah, it was a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I get a place of my own?\" Catwoman rolled onto her belly, her feet kicking in the air as she propped her head up with her hands, \"That all kinda depends. I need to lay low for a while, sooo... a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman punctuated her point with her grin turning sly, she crinkled her nose slightly as she made direct eye-contact with Poison Ivy. A silent challenge issued, daring the chloropath to start something. Harley was not immune to the friction, taking one big-girl step backwards to let the two of them figure it out amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's hands shot up like rockets in celebration, a decidedly too-soon \"yay\" escaping her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't get any funny ideas.\" Ivy continued, looking back and forth between the two criminals, \"My house, my rules. Don't make me spray Miss Kitty with the hose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina hissed, playfully pawing at Ivy as the green-skinned gal made her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the money from her bra and counted it, heading back into her humid den of botanical delights. With any luck, she might be able to put most of tonight behind her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy had been grown accustomed to squatting in Gotham City\u2019s surplus of abandoned something-or-others since she began her villainous streak. The experience was hardly ever pleasant, given their tendency towards dilapidation and lack of functioning modern conveniences like running water and electricity. It had never particularly bothered her to go without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer latest home had been an abandoned brownstone in the bad part of town. Its involvement in a series of murders and some structural concerns meant that it was more or less unsellable as far as any real estate agency in Gotham was concerned. Fixing it up would have been the optimum solution, but the costly improvements would have been too much of a risk for an investment that would sit within walking distance from Crime Alley. Ivy had taken it upon herself to unboard the door and make herself comfortable on the second floor, and had been living there quietly for weeks before Harley showed up on her doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust two days after she had taken Selina in, all her efforts to stay off-grid and out of sight were put into jeopardy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod <i>air</i>!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley fell to the floor, landing directly underneath one of the now functioning air vents. She shut her bright blue eyes as a chilly breeze pushed against her face, sighing appreciatively as it cooled her sweaty brow and blew her blonde pigtails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod <i>hot water!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley shut herself in the bathroom and turned the pressure on full heat, ignoring the scalding temperature out of sheer love of having it available. She had shouted loud enough for Ivy to hear her on the other side, even through the hiss of the jets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod <i>my room has a dimmer switch!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fingered the dial, watching with a maniacal grin as the light dimmed and brightened corresponding to how far she turned it to the right or left. She stood there in her doorway for a full two minutes, marveling at her latest frivolity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod <i>ca</i>\u2014eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had plopped down on the old beat-up couch left over from the brownstone\u2019s previous tenants, the rinky-dink television sitting catty-cornered next to a mostly empty bookshelf and an old computer desk without the computer. The overstimulated siren grabbed the clicker and pressed the power button, only to be rewarded with the sound of jittery static instead of the familiar melodies of her favorite cartoons. Harley flipped the channels up and down before she huffed and crossed her arms irately, her enthusiasm effectively ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what gives?!\u201d Harley whined in her nasal accent, \u201cNo cable?! How am I supposta eat cereal in front of the TV on Saturdays when there\u2019s <i>no cable</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Came a familiar silky tone as Selina Kyle, Catwoman, slung herself over the back of the couch with acrobatic ease, \u201cI got the power and water turned on like that\u2014\u201c she snapped her fingers \u201c\u2014but the cable guy won\u2019t be here \u2018til Monday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the earliness of the hour, both of the costumed night-owls were still dressed comfortably. For two people whose hours of operation were mostly shrouded in darkness, eleven was pretty early in the morning. Selina\u2019s loose-fitting flop clothes consisted entirely of a black tank top and a slightly darker shade of pajama bottoms, while Harley had opted for the more direct and casual approach, wearing a Supergirl t-shirt and an old pair of panties with the Warner Brothers logo on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d Harley stuck out her lower lip as she sunk into the couch, pouting, \u201cNow I <i>wish</i> I was back at Arkham\u2026 \u2018least there they\u2019ve got Dish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at the rate our new roommate is going, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re both going to wind up back in our cells pretty soon.\u201d Ivy\u2019s surly tone poured suddenly in from the hall, \u201cSelina, I left the water and power off for a <i>reason</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, I know; off-grid, save the planet, don\u2019t go back to jail, yadda yadda.\u201d Catwoman rolled her eyes as she clicked off the television, \u201cBut come on Ivy, what\u2019s the point of all three of us hiding out here if we have to do it without showers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy walked a little further into the second-story living room, her hands crossed tersely over her breast. She had been awake longer than either of her two roommates, and their combined lackadaisical attitude (plus the exact nature of their relationship, as vague as it may be) was beginning to grate on Ivy\u2019s nerves. Getting the utilities turned back on and jeopardizing their anonymity was more than enough to cause duress as far as Ivy was concerned, but she seemed to be the only one who understood that laying low was essential in staying under the GCPD\u2019s nose\u2014how was she supposed to do that with a power bill every month?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, just relax green beans.\u201d Selina said, turning to face her fellow rogue with a confident smile on her face, \u201cI\u2019ve got this taken care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Really.</i>\u201d Ivy raised a bright red eyebrow at the notion, \u201cSomehow I doubt that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina hopped up on the back of the couch, much to the amusement of Harley. Her state of undress was anything but modest. A black tank top and yoga pants were hardly the attire of a woman who had a plan. She whipped something out from behind her back, tucked into the waistband of her bottoms, and held it proudly in her slender olive-skinned fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ivy snatched it away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the deed.\u201d Selina purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>The</i> deed?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>The</i> deed.\u201d Selina snatched it back before Ivy had a good chance to look at it, \u201cPhoned up Gotham City Realty and told them I\u2019d pay whatever they wanted for it. Took them about five minutes to get me everything I wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bought this place?!\u201d Ivy\u2019s elevated tone was a mixture of surprise and anger, \u201cHow did you\u2026 how could you\u2026\u2014?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you already: big job, got away, lots of payout, now I\u2019m rich!\u201d Selina smiled widely in response to Ivy\u2019s vicious scowl as she hopped off the back of the couch, practically towering over the shorter redhead, \u201cNothing illegal, nothing that\u2019s gonna bring Batman or even a Robin down on us. Just me and my roomies crashing in an old brownstone that I just <i>happened</i> to have the money for. See? Totally legit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy looked up at the statuesque Italian woman before her, her nose crinkled and her brow furrowed as she made the most dissatisfied face she could manage. Ivy and Selina had never exactly been unfriendly towards one another before, but the past few days and their mutual relationships with Harley had done more to sour their comradery than any truce or encounter had in the past. It certainly didn\u2019t help that Selina was so beautiful. Tall and slender with prominent chiseled features\u2026 not green. Certainly Ivy held a high opinion of herself, but she couldn\u2019t help but believe that if Selina had been a shorter, dumpier woman than it would have been so much easier to feel more comfortable with the new situation she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d a sly smile crept onto Selina\u2019s face as she stretched out one hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense pause between the three of them as Ivy looked her up and down again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYeah, we have a deal.\u201d Ivy grumbled, taking Selina\u2019s hand and squeezing it firmly, \u201cBut if you mess this up\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014I\u2019ll turn you into mulch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley squealed as she kicked her legs, giggling girlishly at the prospect of her two besties settling on an arrangement that would allow her to stay in the promisingly cozy brownstone. The celebration was interrupted by the now-operational buzzer. Selina smiled knowingly and sauntered over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Selina asked warmly, much to Ivy\u2019s chagrin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dPizza!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on up!\u201d Selina purred before fishing another fat wad of cash out from her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ordered <i>pizza</i>?!\u201d Ivy hissed, \u201cSelina, we <i>just</i> said that we were going to lay low!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll be okay if we order a pizza.\u201d Selina rolled her eyes, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just a little treat. Think of it as a housewarming present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina plopped down next to Harley, a freshly cut slice of pepperoni pizza with pineapple and extra cheese greasing her fingers. She exchanged glances with a jostled Harley, who\u2019d decided two slices ago that she\u2019d more than had enough to eat, and laughed out a little apology for jostling her. The sticky-fingered filcher got comfortable, resting her head against the arm of the couch and slinging one long elegant leg over the back while lowering the slice of pizza into her mouth decadently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026this is good pizza.\u201d Selina said contentedly, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want anymore, Harl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2014urp\u2026\u201d Harley touched two fingers to her lips as the burp inflated her cheeks, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore for me then.\u201d Selina chuckled flirtatiously as she took another indulgent bite, her belly swollen and rounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women had gathered around an open stack of Meat Lovers specials that was three boxes high. Ivy would admit to it being a nice gesture. A good way of breaking bread between the three of them, and a decent effort at possibly apologizing for taking the reins on her hideout. It certainly helped that Ivy had been surviving on canned goods and bread since before she started squatting in her latest hobble\u2014making sure to pick the mold off of the crust so it had a chance of surviving in a cruel mammal\u2019s world. Her palette had been reduced to far less refined than pizza; what was the harm in letting Catwoman pay her dues?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026 I still don\u2019t understand how you can eat pineapple on your pizza.\u201d Selina smacked her lips, picking off a piece of juicy yellow fruit from atop the cheesy morsel, \u201cGuess you really <i>are</i> nuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Pineapple is a perfectly legitimate\u2014URP\u2014pizza topping!\u201d Harley huffed, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it then give it back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you were full?\u201d Catwoman purred teasingly, taking another big bite, \u201cIndian giver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa didn\u2019t seem to mind last night when I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy made a noise from the back of her throat, inaudibly expressing her desire that their particular train of conversation was to be put down immediately. It wasn\u2019t quite clearing her throat, nor was it a cough, but it was almost like a growl\u2014perfectly fitting, she figured, for a woman who fashioned herself after a cat and another who willingly associated herself with hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>If</i> we\u2019re just about done with that, what are we going to do about rooms?\u201d Ivy asked suddenly, moreso out of a desire to steer the conversation towards a topic that didn\u2019t make her grossly uncomfortable, \u201cThere are only two beds on this floor\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing a problem.\u201d Catwoman purred seductively as she ran one foot up Harley\u2019s leg, \u201cYou just leave all that to me, Red.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy\u2019s brownstone\u2014now technically Selina\u2019s\u2014had seen better days. Out of the three stories to choose from; the ground floor, the second floor, nor the third floor were in particularly desirable shape. Long-term abandonment in a place like Gotham City meant lots of things for a building after all; broken or shattered furniture, boarded windows and doors, strange stains and smells to accompany the overwhelmingly bleak atmosphere as well as the knowledge that they were still cowering in a forgotten dump, despite it being a <i>legally owned</i> forgotten dump made for an impressively depressing environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much deliberation on the matter, it was decided that each woman should be given a floor to herself to do with as she saw fit; Harley was on the first floor, Selina on the third, while Ivy stayed sandwiched between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an arrangement that seemed promising enough. Everyone found something about their floors to like. Ivy was already firmly rooted (if you will) in the second floor, having lived there long before either other girl showed up, and appreciated the fact that she wouldn\u2019t have to move her meager possessions or relocate her precious plants. Selina found that the large skylight over the master bedroom on the third floor was both beautiful and practical\u2014the view was amazing, and it made for an easy access escape route should she feel the need to scamper across the rooftops of Gotham City. And Harley\u2026 had a big bathroom\u2026 which was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mac, ya might wanna lift with yer legs.\u201d Harley punctuated her blas\u00e9 perspective on the matter with a big bite of her jelly donut, \u201cYa keep doin\u2019 like that and you\u2019ll throw out yer back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can handle my\u2014<i>ooh</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToldja.\u201d Harley said pleasantly as she pushed the remainder of her breakfast past her lips, one cheek bulging with the masticated sugary mush, before sticking her head out into the stairwell, \u201cHey someone get Macho Comacho here some IcyHot, will ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbly blonde bounced back into the second floor living room, watching as burly men lumbered in and out of the various rooms carrying heavy boxes and the like. There were about five or six guys on each floor, meaning that there would be no peace and quiet for this clown. She plopped down heavily on the couch, throwing herself over the back and landing on her perky bum, another donut in her hand as she indulged herself in a little cable TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>supposed</i> to be watching these guys. Making sure that nothing got broken. Or stolen. Or stolen, then broken. Or stolen, but she caught them stealing it so she chased them down the stairs and they fell down the stairs and then it got broken. But how was that going to be any fun? Nobody was stupid enough to try and screw with Poison Ivy. Or Joker\u2019s number one gal (could she still call herself that even though they were on a break?). And the last guy who stole anything from <i>Catwoman</i> got his face all scratched up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mac.\u201d Harley\u2019s blonde pigtails fell over arm of the couch as she leaned back, \u201cYou weren\u2019t thinkin\u2019 about stealin\u2019 anything, were ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?!\u201d the man in orange overalls grunted as he clutched at his lower back, \u201cG-Goddamn\u2026 no I wasn\u2019t\u2026 argh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d Harley\u2019s head reeled back in, bobbing left to right contentedly as she kicked her legs, \u201cJust makin\u2019 sure. Now pipe down, my shows are on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're completely okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sitting pretty as a kitty with it.\" Selina purred as she leaned on the doorway of Ivy's new boudoir, \"I have no doubt in my mind that we'll all enjoy having a <i>real</i> roof over our heads for once.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIvy couldn't help but make a face at her old friend. Technically now, her landlord. Selina had always been so level-headed. In a room with a psychopathic hench wench dressed up like a clown and an (at times) sociopathic eco-terrorist who talked to plants, it said a lot when Selina could bring out the best in both of them. But ever since they'd come into contact with her just last week, she seemed... different, somehow. Ivy couldn't quite put her finger on it, but Selina seemed almost too eager to flash all of her cash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're still upset you didn't get the rooftop?\" Catwoman clicked her tongue, putting her hand on a full hip as she struck a pose in the doorway, \"Your plants will get plenty of sun in the second story. Besides, my kitties need exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy noted the suspicious width that had come to haunt Selina's new figure. Apparently her cats weren't the only ones wanting for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, it's fine.\" Ivy said dismissively, \"Selina... I want to talk to you. Are you... okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better.\" Catwoman crooned, smiling devilishly at her half-plant roommate, \"Why do you ask, Pam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... this is an awful lot of money. Not going to a charity, not going back to the animals or the wildlife.\" Poison Ivy narrowed her green eyes at the master thief in hiding, \"Are you sure you wouldn't rather... I don't know, give some of this to save some... esoteric endangered cat somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know by now that my girlfriends are my <i>favorite</i> charity cases.\" Selina smiled, touching her friend on the soft green arm, \"We're the Gotham City Sirens... remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy thought for a moment, only to dismiss it. Of course, they were friends. This was just her giving back. She was being overly cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take offense to the term charity case.\" Ivy smiled, her mind at ease, \"But I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, no plant metaphor?\" Selina teased, \"You're slipping, Ivy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe viridian vixen watched as Selina's full cheeks sashayed out the doorway, a more provocative bounce to her booty was noticeable. The suspicions that Ivy had dismissed returned, however briefly, before she shook her head. She was just imagining things. Selina wouldn't let herself go just because of one job. Certainly not so quickly, anyway. She'd best not press the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ordering takeout\u2014meat lover's special for you?\" Catwoman looked over her shoulder, back down the hallway of Ivy's bedroom, \"I know Harley wants Chinese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust living it up a little. Definitely.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d had them specially designed by an old friend of hers in the business, one that owed her more than a few favors. All it took was one big \u2018o\u2019 across the surface, go through it a few more times, and then attach the suction cup on the left palm before easing it out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think that the Jade Dragon, one of the highest commodities on the market right now\u2014some went so far as to say it was <i>beyond</i> priceless\u2014could be so easily \u201cmisplaced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat burglar eased the big ugly lizard out of its case and tugged on the her grapple, set to automatically reel her back in on her two-tug command. The ride up was agonizingly slow, due to the added weight of her scaly green friend. Eventually she made it back through the skylight, set her prize down on the rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked magnificent in the moonlight. It was so beautiful. Every scale was detailed enough to be rough on her gloved fingertips, and the teeth sharp enough to pierce the latex on her costume. She smiled wickedly at her latest acquisition. It would fetch a pretty penny, no doubt. But then again, so would all the other stuff she\u2019d stolen from the museum that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sense in just throwing it out to the highest bidder now. She\u2019d better wait a while, let the heat die and let people stop looking for it. That way she could take it home and enjoy it a little first. It wasn\u2019t exactly as pretty as, say, a Jade <i>Kitty</i> would be. But there was something about this ugly Asian lizard that she couldn\u2019t help but admire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she could just\u2026 keep this one? As a souvenir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s an ugly little guy?\u201d Selina whispered as she stroked its hard unmoving beard, \u201cYou are. Yes you <i>are</i>. You\u2019re <i>my</i> ugly little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up on her feet, Selina bent back over to tuck the Jade Dragon under her arm. It was a heavy thing. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be running rooftop to rooftop tonight. It was too big to fit in her bag\u2026 and her bag was too full to fit anything else inside of it anyway. She\u2019d certainly hit a big haul tonight, but maybe there was such a thing as <i>too</i> much loot. At least when she was hauling all home herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she corrected herself with a shake of her head, that was ridiculous. She would just have to find some other way to carry everything back to her apartment. She couldn\u2019t risk two trips out. The cops would be all over this place once the guards realized what had happened. They\u2019d probably check the roof and see her Jade Dragon just sitting there, all by his lonesome, and put him back in that case. Or worse\u2014what if some random two-bit common crook just swooped by and took it for themselves! That would be terrible, someone snooping in on <i>her</i> big score!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Catwoman placed her two weights down on the roof in front of her. One Jade Dragon, one sack of jewelry and art. Both equally heavy, both equally stolen. Both equally hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 what to do, what to do?\u201d she tapped her exposed chin with a pointer finger, \u201cOn one hand, I take the Dragon home first and get him out of the way. On the <i>other</i> I get all these pretty jewels. Maybe I could <i>wear</i> some of the jewels while I\u2026 no, Selina, that\u2019s stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman would sit there much longer than she probably should have\u2014debating on what to do with her catburglaring conundrum. She was so enthralled in her decision that she barely heard the faint muffled cries of the guards below her, just now discovering that their client\u2019s most priceless piece was missing on the last leg of its tour. Selina looked down through the skylight irately, her expression forming a flirtatious pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d She hissed, \u201cGotta figure this out fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her heartbeat accelerate, Selina\u2019s eyes darted back and forth between her two targets. If she left now, there was no chance in hell she\u2019d get both of them. At this rate she might not even get home without a certain Bat or one of his little do-gooder partners busting her tail\u2014and then she\u2019d lose <i>both</i> marks. Sure the Dragon was more expensive, but the jewels were so <i>pretty</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it.\u201d Catwoman huffed as she bent over and picked the dragon up under one arm and worked the handle of her messenger bag over the other shoulder, \u201cNo way am I losing out on what\u2019s <b>mine</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, deep in the outer regions of space, a tiny trinket floated aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Ookara\u2019s sudden and unexplained implosion had robbed it of a master, the Orange Ring of Avarice had been sifting aimlessly throughout the fabric of space. It was hunting a new ring bearer, guided by the supreme will of Ophidian the Tempter, and carried the potential power of an entire Lantern Corps inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had searched, listening to every corner of the universe, and had finally found someone worthy of wielding its light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout provocation, it shot off into the distance, a little orange blur behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman fell to the snowy ground of Gotham City with a thud, her knees threatening to give under the immense pressure that her newfound acquisitioned provided. It had taken her too long to shimmy down the pipes and make the small, necessary jumps to avoid breaking her legs. And even then, the trip down had proven dangerous enough despite her precautions. The museum guards were now very aware that someone had come in and cased the joint, and that meant that the GCPD weren\u2019t that far behind. Which also meant that a certain pointy-eared guy in a cape was even closer than they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her prizes\u2014an ugly green lizard worth more than Selina would ever see in her lifetime, and a sack full of jewels and art and crowns and bracelets and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman dashed forward, confident that she was making the right decision. Her footsteps were loud and clumsy, but she was agile enough for it to balance out against the great weight of her loot. If she was lucky, she might just make it home. Put this big ugly bastard on her mantle and stare at it all night, sipping wine while she worked out a few contacts with her fences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt!\u201d a sudden voice caused her to look up, \u201cPolice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShots rang out as Selina ducked behind the building, bullets clipping the brick and sending powder into the air. She pulled the statue a little further into cover, hoping to shield it from any damage it might have otherwise suffered. As more black and whites screeched to the scene, police lights illuminating the alley in a sea of red and blue, Catwoman could only grab the statue and hold it facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what you\u2019ve gotten us into?\u201d she whispered to the Jade Dragon, \u201cHow am I gonna get out of this one when you\u2019re so heavy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another passing glance at the sack of other works of art, and then made direct eye contact with her shiny lizard companion. Was all this really worth it? Getting shot at, possibly turned in for yet another act of grand larceny, and maybe even losing her life\u2014for a big green dragon and a bunch of shiny rocks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman stared deeply into the Jade Dragon\u2019s eyes as more and more policemens\u2019 voices filled the opening outside the alley before nodding in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. What was I thinking?\u201d Selina said affirmatively as she reached to tuck the monster underneath her arm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an orange light shot down from the heavens, going unnoticed by any of the officers present. It hid behind the alley, and hovered some feet off of the ground in front of Catwoman as she huddled with her precious cargo. It was a little ring. Looked like something out of a cereal box. It was bright orange, and glowed with an unholy hue about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSelina Kyle of Earth, you have been chosen.\u201d</span> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For what?\" Selina asked, a little confused at the floating ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Selina, you have displayed a great aptitude for Avarice. As such, you have been chosen as the new Guardian of the Orange Lantern Ring and Battery\"</span> She heard the ring say in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was about to protest, but the voices of the police were closing in on her hiding place. \"Can't really afford to be picky here.\" She muttered before grabbing the ring and putting it on her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of orange light blinded the cops briefly. Once they regained their sight, they were met by an unexpected site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from her hiding place was Selina, but she was now in a different costume. She now had an orange corset on with the Orange Lantern symbol on the stomach area, an orange thong, orange thigh high boots with high heels, and elbow length orange gloves. She also had cat ears and a tail made from orange light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was just as surprised as the cops, but after just a moment of confusion, the cops drew their guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" The cops shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what now?\" Selina thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"With the rings power, you can form whatever you can imagine.\"</span> The ring replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, Selina put her right arm up. Instantly, an orange bubble was formed by the ring. The cops fired, but the bullets bounced harmlessly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Selina dismissed the bubble and formed two giant fans with the ring, one in front and one behind. Using them, she blew away the cops. Dismissing those, she then formed a ramp and took of running on it, making sure the Jade Dragon was still under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce safely away from the cops, Selina dismissed the ramp. \"That was incredible!\" She said. \"I think I can get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's next for our empowered kitty?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina smirked a bit, loving a sense of power that she was getting from the Orange Lantern ring as she breathed a bit heavier due to her out-running the cops; it had made her quite peckish, a bit more so than normal, but Selina thought that she had earned the extra meal considering her score. Placing a hand on her belly, Selina sat perched on a roof-top, looking for a place where she could crash and consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking a bit, Selina saw that there was an Italian restaraunt that was just shutting up shop and, as soon as she saw the owner lock-up and leave, Selina used her agility to bound from her current location to across the street, landing, skillfully, on the roof of the Italian eatery. Considering her skills as a thief, it was almost too easy for Selina to enter the Italian restaraunt through the air-vent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the food hit her, somehow, the place was packed full with food for her to eat, for some reason, Selina felt like she was ravenous, a desire to just eat and eat and not stop; she wasn't sure where it came from, but she instantly dove over to the big pot of sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I could eat all the food in Gotham!\" Selina groaned out, being overcome by the effects of the orange lantern ring that she wore on her finger, not realising how it was corrupting her. Grabbing the entire pot of sauce in both of her hands, Selina simply turned the pot on it's side, opened her mouth as wide as she could and, with a little unknowing assistance from her Orange Lantern ring, Selina slurped down the entire pot of pasta with wild abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more!\" Selina looked around, her eyes wild and crazed as she threw the now empty pot on the floor with a huge crash, but Selina's mind was being overtaken by the need to eat and eat and never stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rampaging beauty even hissed in the manner of an angry cat as she was getting more frustrated that she couldn't get to the food, it was like nothing mattered but her need to gorge herself. The ring increasing her want for food to a seemingly insane level as Selina's frenzy of greed continued as she barged her way into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, come to momma!\" Selina purred as she saw the sheer amount of food on offer, bowls after bowls of sphagetti and pasta, towers of pizzas of so many flavours as the crazed, Orange Lantern influenced Catwoman got a bit of encouragement from the orange lantern ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"If you can't decide what you would like to eat next, Ms. Kyle, it would be logical to try everything?\"</span> the ring responded, firing up the already gluttony drunk young woman, who's stomach was seemingly a bottomless pit, not that Selina really realised how much she was actually eating or how her figure was expanding, especially around her belly, her hips and her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to become the Fattest Cat in all of Gotham!\" Selina boasted as she, at a slower, more lumbering pace than before, headed over to continue gorging herself as she slurped the pasta down with a crazed gusto, ate the pile of pizzas with such ferocity that her pretty face was now a mess with grease and sauce stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>2 hours later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"BUUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous, powerful belch erupted from the Italian eatery as it actually shook the entire building, there were piles and piles of empty bowls, plates and pots as the bloated and stuffed full Catwoman just leaned back admist the wreckage of the Italian restaraunt, that 'light snack' had just turned into Selina going wild and eating every single scrap of food there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that hit the spot!\" Selina weakly groaned out as she was on her back, her increasingly big body heaving with every heavy breath as Selina didn't really seem to register how much she'd eaten, or, if she did, she didn't really care. As she seemed quite proud of herself, she got hit with another urge that caught her off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is she feeling?</span></div></div>",

Batman and his team of fellow superheroes work day and night (mostly night) to fight against the inherit insanity that seems to flow beneath Gotham City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, such a setting has plenty of gorgeous women that a lot of people would love to see put on considerable amounts of weight. Talk about crazy, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interactive based around the idea that one or several or all of Gotham\u2019s resident women will gain weight. A little, a lot, or an abundance of weight for as many women as you see fit. The hows and whys don\u2019t matter much, so long as they\u2019re well-written, and the how-comes matter even less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything you need to know is right here: Women in Gotham are getting fat, and it\u2019s up to <i>you</i> to decide what to make of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Here are a few basic rules:</b><br>\r\n\u2014only characters based in Gotham City will be the focus of the story. <br>\r\n\u2014only characters over the age of eighteen will be permitted<br>\r\n\u2014no instantaneous weight gain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d like to stay away from the DC Animated Universe and the Arkham series of games, but feel free to incorporate <i>elements</i> of whatever continuity you see fit\u2014even if it is those. Anything goes: Pre-Crisis, Post-Crisis, Pre-New52, Flashpoint, New52 and beyond (talk about continuity porn!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo put on your bat-gauntlets and iron your cape, because we\u2019re going to Gotham City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">all DC Comics characters in this interactive belong to DC Comics, and as such I claim no right to any previously copywritten character that I may write about</font><br>\r\n</td>",
