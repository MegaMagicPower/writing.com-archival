            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning James was groggy as the sun shined in through his window. He remembered the stressful time he had with Aaron's inability to hold up to anything he agreed to. Sighing to himself, he got himself ready for the day. He worked a part-time job at a Starbucks just down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he had a bit of a rude awakening when he tripped on an empty bag on chips as he entered the living room of the apartment. Aaron was still lazily sitting on the couch. Stretching out some of the aches from the fall, James slightly limped over to Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You couldn't at least pick up the empty bags? You're acting like this is a garbage dump\" said James, trying to be as stern as he could without yelling. Aaron nonchalantly looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll straighten things up later, but if it really bothers you just throw it away.\" he replied, turning back to the TV. James could take a lot of crud from Aaron, but he was really pushing his boundaries now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, As usual I throw away your crap. You're lucky you live here with me. You can't do anything by yourself\" said James. That got Aaron's attention as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound just like my mother,\u201d Aaron says laughing, \u201cAnd I would be just fine without you.\" He says, \"I doubt it.\" James replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument went back and forth after that, slowly rising in noise level as it did. Aaron threatened to really leave, but James doubted it. Even Aaron knew that he didn't have the income to live on his own for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time went on, James needed to get to work. With one last remark, he slammed the door behind him, still limping a bit from his fall from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, things didn't improve that day. That argument stayed on James' mind and he was irritable all day. It caused him some trouble at his job when he acted a little harshly to some fellow employees. The only good thing out of this was that he only got a warning because he was generally a hard and generous worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate afternoon came by, and James was walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, a totally cruddy day, and I still have Aaron to deal with when I get back\" he sighed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was so stressed that he didn\u2019t look where he was going and bumped into an old man in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d James says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is quiet alright my friend. I get bumped into all the time in this city, though it is nice to get an apology.\u201d The man says laughing as he straightens himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection, James notices the multiple layers of mismatched clothes. He instantly knew the man was homeless but didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Yeah people can be pretty rude these days.\u201d James says trying not to give any indication that he knew the man was homeless. \u201cSo where you headed?\u201d James asks the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe park, or maybe the bridge on 5th and Jefferson.\u201d He says cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh that\u2019s\u2026 nice.\u201d He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to talk about it son, times are hard these days.\u201d He says smiling. \u201cBut enough about me, I\u2019ve been around long enough to know when a man has something on his mind. Care to talk about it?\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing, just my life.\u201d James says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that can\u2019t be so bad. I see you\u2019ve got a job, and I\u2019m guessing a roof over your head, and maybe a girlfriend?\u201d he says smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiles at that. \u201cWell two for three isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019ve never been really good with women, or most people for that matter.\u201d He says depressingly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you\u2019re a good guy with a big heart.\u201d He says placing his hand on James\u2019 shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but as far back as I can remember people haven\u2019t really been interested in that.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sounds to me like you are too concerned with the physical. That problem is taking its toll on your spirit. Try looking at life from a new perceptive and see what you find.\u201d The old man says. James really didn\u2019t understand anything he had said about the physical or spirit but he felt sudden warmth in his heart when he heard it. He tried his best to downplay it though. He would be incredibly embarrassed if anyone else knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m headed this way,\u201d the man says walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh hey thanks for listening, and ah... I know it\u2019s not much but...\u201d James says, reaching for his wallet. However, the old man just smiled and gestured for him to put the money away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d He says as he vanished into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames continued home to find the same mess he had left that morning and Aaron passed out on the couch. He was still annoyed but thanks to the old man\u2019s words found it easier shrug it off and call it a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that old man did, but maybe talking about it relieved me a bit\" James said to himself with a smile as he closed the door to his room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night James went to bed as usual, thinking about his day. He supposed that it could have been worse. At least that old man was really nice. James couldn't help but think of the weirder part of his words though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, who knows what he was talking about,\" He grumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, as James was out like a light, his digital clock struck midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, what felt like fire seemed to be born inside of him. At first, the conscious part of his brain thought nothing of it and continued sleeping. However, after about 15 minutes, the fire seemed to blossom, as if it was intensifying and spreading inside of him. James hadn't felt like this since he got the flu when he was 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from his sleep and breathing heavily, James slowly got himself out of bed, walking towards the bathroom, which wasn't exactly easy, he made it inside. He was thankful that there was a bathroom connected to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames poured himself some water and drunk it down heartily. That seemed to help somewhat, although the feeling of illness was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(cough) Maybe I worked too hard or something.\" muttered James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't feel like throwing up, as he was thankful for that. Part of him did wonder though how something like that would flare up so fast like that. Well, James was no medical expert, so he would just have to wait until morning and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went back to bed, he had no idea as to what other things happened to him, masked under the heat and fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning was a completely different story, if anything he felt better than he had in years, as he walked to the bathroom he began to think that the flu like symptoms were nothing but a bad dream, until he noticed something was off about his walk. And as unusual as it sounded in his head it felt as though something was missing. But he decided he just slept wrong and he just needed to stretch his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he makes it to the bathroom he takes off his shirt and starts the shower. But as he looked down at his pants he couldn\u2019t help but notice that something seemed different. So he began to remove his underwear only to reveal that something very important was indeed missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What the heck?!\u201d James exclaims as his hands went straight to his groin. Where there was supposed to be something was instead nothing. What marked him as a man was gone. All there was a small slit that James could identify from his high school health class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Why did this happen? No! How did this happen?\u201d asked the frightened young adult. \u201cBut when?! Wait! The random flu, was it gone before or after?!\u201d James tries to remember but his head was so messed up that he couldn\u2019t quite think clearly. How in the world could he explain having new \u201cwomanhood\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was speechless and dazed from what had just occurred. The loss of his manhood would shock anyone. However, he didn't get a lot of time to think about it, because the silence was suddenly broken by a knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey James! Are you alright in there?\u201d Aaron asks from outside the room, likely having heard the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow under normal circumstances, James would probably have just said everything was fine and Aaron would have just gone back to his room. But given the shock of losing a man\u2019s most important appendage, still in shock, James slowly staggered to the door. He then opens the door with a pale expression on his face and simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Aaron looked at him like he was crazy. James didn\u2019t really look like he wanted to talk about it but to break the silence Aaron responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what\u2019s gone?\u201d he asked with a concerned look on his face for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy.... ah\u2026\u201d James stuttered, having trouble finding the words. Though, he did gesture between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was confused since, for starters James did not look like he was joking and even if he did this wasn\u2019t his kind of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. Are you saying you don\u2019t have any balls?\u201d Aaron asked. James reluctantly nodded his head in agreement; somewhat embarrassed by the way Aaron phrased it. <br>\r\nAaron then busted out laughing, \u201cWow nice man! I needed a good laugh\u201d said Aaron, thinking it was all a joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron turned around to go back to his room, still laughing to himself, James finally snapped out of his shock in reaction to Aaron\u2019s stupid insensitive response to this very serious situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here!\" said James, a little more forceful than he usually talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to Aaron, turning him back around, and lowering his pajama pants to show him what was wrong. This act, for obvious reasons, embarrassed James even more, but he hoped that Aaron would eventually get serious about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY SHIT! What the hell is that?!\u201d exclaimed Aaron, jumping back in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look like?!\u201d James asked rhetorically, pulling his pants back up before his face could become any more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a recent thing, right?\u201d Aaron asked in his classic immature response to a serious situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes in exasperation. \u201cAaron! This is not the time for jokes!\u201d James almost shouted. For once, he needed Aaron to be serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry. It's just stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! However, as you can see, I\u2019m missing something pretty important, and I have something I definitely shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d said James in an almost louder voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Aaron noticed something else that was different about James.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James then paused and looked straight at him. \u201cDid you shave this morning?\u201d Aaron continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Why?\u201d James asks, raising his hands to his face. James runs his hands over his chin, cheeks, and neck. A baffled look took over his face. He hadn\u2019t shaved in a few days but there wasn\u2019t a single hair on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay man, this is getting weird. Look at your arms.\u201d Aaron said, holding up his own to show him that men traditionally have hair on their forearms. James then quickly looked them over. To his surprise, they were both hairless. He then quickly lifted up his shirt and, as he feared, it too was hairless as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can cut it out man.\u201d Aaron said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut what out!? Do you think I\u2019d shave my entire body and somehow hide my\u2026 ah!\u201d James replied, annoyed that Aaron would think he would joke about something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s take a deep breath here. When was the last time you had\u2026 everything?\u201d Aaron asked. James pauses to think back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I went to the bathroom last night before bed and everything was fine. Then I felt sick and\u2026\u201d James said, pausing to think for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re sick?\u201d Aaron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was sick last night, but I felt fine this morning.\u201d James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait. What kind of sick?\u201d Aaron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it felt kind of like the flu.\u201d said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you feel fine now?\u201d Aaron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, In fact, until I noticed all this, I felt great this morning.\u201d James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, it can\u2019t be the flu. That normally lasts about a week. I\u2019ve heard of a twenty-four bug but nothing that comes and goes that fast and leave you feeling better after.\u201d Aaron said, actually somewhat serious for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. It doesn\u2019t make any since but it happened.\u201d James said defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey calm down, none of this makes any since.\u201d replied Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then laid down on the couch. \u201cOkay so the majority of your body hair is gone, and your ah\u2026 manhood is missing?\u201d Aaron asked to clarify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cYeah, the hair part yes, but the other part isn\u2019t just missing. It was replaced.\u201d He said, embarrassed to be saying it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what are you going to do?\u201d Aaron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d James yelled in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow chill man, that\u2019s not helping anything.\u201d Aaron said.

Since this is far from normal, I'd say it's reasonable to ask. Are they really just random or could you be\u2026 turning into something\u2026\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it! I don't want to hear it!\" James almost yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, I\u2019m just saying. You don\u2019t have any body hair, you just lost half a foot, and you don\u2019t even have a\u2026\u201d Aaron said until James interrupted him before he could go any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, breakfast was eaten in silence. James didn't want to hear another word from Aaron about what was happening to him. Although, what Aaron was implying was on James' mind. As much as he hated it, he began to wonder if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a weird day indeed.</span></div></div>",

Of course, his current situation was hardly something normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal people don't just lose their manhood and body hair overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James considered this, he closed the door behind him and stripped out of his sleep clothes. After that, he quickly got the warm water running and stepped into the shower. The water managed to somewhat calm his nerves allowing him to think about a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid someone put estrogen pills in his drinks or something? No, probably not. That could explain the skin and lack of body hair, but no pill could give him a woman's reproductive system. That would be more like magic <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is that even possible?\" wondered James as he grabbed the bar soap and began washing his now smooth body. He slightly winced, as his skin seemed to be a bit more sensitive now. He sighed and continued onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if....UGH!\" grunted James as a fierce feeling invaded his face, making him drop the soap and lean against the shower wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat burning sensation spread through his face. Not enough to make him scream, but enough for wince in slight pain. James couldn't tell what was going on, but it felt like his cheekbones were rearranging, forming higher on his face. As his lips were together, he felt as if they were puffing up or something, like how he felt during the allergy season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, the sensation spread across his jaw line, seemingly crunching it together and making it smaller and softer. The tissues in his nose seemed to shrink, suddenly is vision became temporarily blurry as though his eyes were changing shape. A tickling feeling came as James could feel something growing on his eyes, likely eyelashes. The same shrinking feeling also spread to his eyebrows, as he felt them become smaller too. Finally, a weird sensation went to his ears as he felt them shrink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" said James as he quickly paused the shower and grabbed a towel for the moment. He ran over to the mirror, looking in horror as the face of a rather beautiful woman looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" was all he could think of before getting the rest of his shower over with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And to make things worse Aaron was right, there was no denying it now, he was turning into a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He steps out of the bathroom to escape the sight of his new face in the mirror. Unfortunately for him he finds himself in front of his closet mirror as he feels another change coming on. He was frozen in place with his eyes fixed on the mirror to see his towel fall to the ground revealing his entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were first drawn to his hips as they began to expand while his waist began to shrink along with his stomach. Next his back naturally arched forcing his chest it began to expand as well into perky C cups. He didn\u2019t know what to do or say as before his eyes he became more feminine with ever second. His new heavier breasts weighted his chest down forcing him to bend over, at which point he felt his thighs begin to tingle as they began to tone up. The feeling then spread to his butt which began to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally over James was speechless, staring at his now naked completely female body in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then quickly snapped out of it and rummaged through his closet to try and find something to cover himself up. He tried to put on a pair of blue jeans but he couldn\u2019t get them past his new butt. So he had no choice but to put on a pair of baggy sweatpants, which weren\u2019t so baggy anymore with his new lower body. And since he was never one for oversized shirts, even his largest shirt fit him a little too tight around his new chest. But it was something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You lean closer to her and she beams at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does a beautiful single mother manage to do it all? I hope I'm not rude in asking.\" she inquired. \"Well, Erin is a handful, but we have been okay.\" you reply. \"You are incredible to raise a child on your own. You have my deepest admiration!\" she stated. \"Thank you!\" you whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were caught unawares as she kissed you. You quickly kiss her back, feeling her soft lips against you. You silently thank the magic man for his gift. She breaks away, blushing. You take a moment to check on Erin, before taking her hand. \"We have to be quiet!\" you whisper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been 3 weeks since James became Jamie Thompson, sexy single lesbian mother. In those 3 weeks, Jamie had become involved romantically with Sandy Johnson, one of her sexy neighbours. Meanwhile, Aaron was stuck at home, pouting as her new babysitter talk on her Smartphone. She hated being treated like a child by the college student Jill Bixby. Jill looked like Laurie Prange from the Incredible Hulk. Jamie entered her apartment with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill beamed at Jamie as she waved to the babysitter. \"So how was work?\" she asked. \"Fantastic! Sandy and I got the proposal before the boss and we both got a raise! And she finally decided! She is moving in with us!\" exclaimed Jamie with a grin. Erin frowned, watching the stupid Dora the Explorer. She hated the show, yet she could not turn herself away from the screen. \"And how were the two of you? Was Erin a good girl?\" asked Jamie. Erin managed to tear herself from the TV to glare at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was good as gold! She did some colouring in, ate her afternoon tea and watched Dora!\" revealed Jill. Erin pouted as she turned back to the television. It was torture for her, being babysat by this beautiful woman. Every time, Erin would deliberately drop a crayon, Jill would bend over to pick it up. As she stared at Jill\u2019s cut-off shorts, she thought of all the hot girls she had been with back when she was a man. A particularly terrible thought struck her. What if she never became a man again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all good and gravy for Jamie who was getting laid regularly. Jamie also had a new awesome, high paying job. Meanwhile Erin was stuck going to bloody kindergarten! She considered trying to prove her intelligence, but she never paid attention in school when she was a boy, so she was unable to do her timetables. So she remained stuck as a child. \"Here, take this for a job well done!\" offered Jamie. Jill's eyes grew wide as she looked at the money she had just been given. \u201cMs Thompson\u2026this is way too much! I can\u2019t accept $200!\u201d she confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie pushed her hand back, refusing to take it back. \u201cI know my little girl. You deserve every penny. When are you available next?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell I can come back tomorrow! Thanks again, Ms Thompson!\u201d declared Jill as she left. \u201cSo Sandy\u2019s moving in, is she? Great, I have to pretend to be a little kid full time now!\u201d pouted Erin. \u201cErin, you are a little girl! Besides I got you some chocolate cookies, your favourites!\u201d remarked Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin suddenly threw down the remote. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore! You get a great job, body and girlfriend! Meanwhile I\u2019m stuck as a little girl! I\u2019m a man! I want to be a man again! Please help me, James!\u201d she screamed, tears running down her face. Jamie ran up to her, patting her on the back. Erin calmed down, relaxing against her new mother\u2019s chest. Jamie gently put her back on the couch, handing her a cookie. \u201cWe have to make the best of our new perspectives, remember?\u201d she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my perspective sucks! And\u2026\u201d \u201cYoung lady, you will apologise this minute! I will not have you using such language!\u201d interrupted Jamie, her eyes fierce. \u201cSorry!\u201d responded Erin, hating these \u201cMom\u201d moments. \u201cSorry what, young lady?\u201d enquired Jamie, firmly. \u201cSorry, Mummy!\u201d answered Erin, loathing those moments. \u201cIt\u2019s 6 pm! That means it\u2019s time for bed! Do you need me to dress you?\u201d asked Jamie. Erin shook her head, stating \u201cNo thank you, Mummy!\u201d \u201cOk, get dressed, brush your teeth, then I will read you a bed time story in bed!\u201d declared Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mummy! Thank you Mummy!\u201d answered Erin, politely. She knew better than to misbehave. Last time she did, Jamie made boiled Brussels sprouts, broccoli and peas for dinner and no dessert. She was also denied the chance to go see Ant-Man on opening night. She saw it the next week. She put on her pyjamas, hating how cute it looked. She was a young man in her twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at herself in the bathroom mirror, she only saw a child. In the space of 3 weeks, she had gone from a cool guy who had many girls to a little 5 year old with bedtime and picking up after herself. If Jamie hadn\u2019t bought her a Play station, she thought she would go mad. The apartment was spotless now; and Erin knew that Jamie didn't want to go back to being James again. She finished brushing her teeth and made her way to her bed where Jamie was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts left her as she heard the story of Cinderella. Perhaps, just perhaps, she deserved this terrible punishment. She contemplated how much she was like the ugly stepsisters, mistreating James/Cinderella. She closed her eyes and the world was gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, you need to wake up!\" came a loud voice. Aaron wakes up, groggily. He looked up to see a policewoman glaring at him. \"W-what?\" Aaron managed to stammer, a loud ringing in his ears. His head felt like it was under assault. \"You better leave, sir! We don't allow people to sleep on park benches, here!\" she declared. \"W-what? S-Sorry what are you talk...Wait did...did you call me, sir?\" he asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you prefer, man?\" she retorted. \"I'm a sir! I'm a man! I'm not a little girl anymore!\" he exclaimed, before clutching his head again. \"I think you should leave, sir!\" she warned him. He nodded, thanking the policewoman. He looked down at himself, he was dressed in his shirt and jeans. He ran over to the lake and looked it. It was clear and he saw he was himself again. \"YES! I'm free! In your face, magic man!\" he declared, running at full pelt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself back at his apartment building, ringing the doorbell confidently. \"Yes, who is this?\" came a man's voice he did not recognise. \"Sorry, sir, I was ringing for Jamie Thompson!\" he explained. \"Well this was her apartment, but she and her daughter moved in with her girlfriend 2 weeks ago!\" he revealed. \"2 weeks ago? Sorry, where is she now?\" he asked. \"Sorry, they left no forwarding address. Good luck finding them!\" he said, hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was stunned. James was still a lesbian single mother. And he or rather she still had a daughter. What was going on? \"Confused, Aaron?\" Aaron spun around to see the mysterious old man again. \"Where's James?\" he demanded. \"He is enjoying his new life as Jamie Thompson-Johnson. They flew to Boston to marry one week ago. It took 5 weeks, but James got the life she deserved. And you Aaron now have the life you deserve!\" the old man stated, before changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman appeared before Aaron. \"Who or what are you?\" he cried. \"Erin Grant, a powerful witch. I was a born a worthless man called Aaron Grant before I ascended to the superior gender. Since you wanted to live as an inferior, consider your wish granted! Now you are Aaron Taylor, homeless and jobless! Good luck fending for yourself for a change. Enjoy your new perspective!\" she finished with a sneer. She disappeared before his eyes, leaving him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked into his pockets. He only had a wallet; no phone, no passport, no keys. Inside his wallet was ten dollars and a driver's licence. He checked it and the address given was his old family home. His parents had moved to California, 2 months ago. His heart fell as he realised his predicament. He had no money, home or job! Jamie and his parents weren't there to take care of him. He needed to find a homeless shelter! He cursed his luck as he walked the streets of the town.</span></div></div>",

It affects the way people treat us as well as the way we see ourselves, whether we become confident or arrogant, sociable or shy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is about two very different people who are somehow transformed so that they can get a different perspective on life and themselves. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like a transformation freaky Friday.
