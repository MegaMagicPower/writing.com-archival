At first, she had been a woman dedicated to her job, a woman driven to train and keep healthy all those who came to her side, seeking help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the Gym grew, and she found herself in the need of doing management more than training, her drive soon ceased to be as strong as before. Naturally, she had employees who were driven just as she had been, but she felt herself heartbroken when she realized she hadn\u2019t anymore those same motivations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, she saw this plump young woman entering her gym. Instead of the common clients who usually came in there to grow buff and strong, this woman seemed driven to grow as thin and fit as possible. Jessie found herself fascinated by this girl, so much so that often she found herself training beside her, under the disguise of being a new client and not the owner of the place. Her employees helped keeping the ruse, they had noticed the lack of motivation from their boss and, seeing as she seemed to be gaining back her old driven mind was a boost for their confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few months of training together, Jessica had learned quite a bit about the girl with which she was training. They had soon grown closer, under many aspects thinking alike, and so a friendship started although, Jessie hadn\u2019t revealed herself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was a plump young woman, she had just abandoned her studies at her college, deciding by herself that her dream of becoming a teacher was just that\u2026a dream. Returning to her home stead of Whitesands she found a small job as secretary in one of the local companies and she maintained herself there but, sitting down all day long had started to have a negative effect on her waist. The freshman fifteen, which she had been found herself under, began to grow becoming soon the freshman thirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo slow down or, maybe, even change the trend she joined the local gym and began doing some light exercises all by herself. Soon enough though, as weeks passed by, she often found herself training near a girl which she could only describe as an Amazonian goddess. The girl seemed to be an expert on the fitness side of things, and, under her tutelage, Susie began to grow healthier and toned than she ever was. As months passed away, the two of them began to be close friends and, although, her friend was a tad intimidating at times, Susie knew she could trust her with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed their friendship grew as well, until Jessie couldn\u2019t hold her secret in anymore. She had to tell the truth to Susan, especially since she considered her one of her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, as the gym was pretty empty, and only the two of them were there, Susie came out of the shower stall, clean as a whistle and with her wet hair still enclosed in some towels. As she entered the locker room, she saw her friend Jess, sitting on a bench, looking rather down and sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess? Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazonian trainer sighed once more, before turning a sad smile toward the girl which she had befriended so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey Susie\u2026It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s alright. Everything is\u2026who am I kidding? Look, can you\u2026could you sit down here for a minute, will ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, increasingly getting worried for her friend, quickly sat beside her, caressing her shoulder with a hand as she waited for her friend to tell her what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Susie\u2026All this time, all these months\u2026I\u2019ve been a terrible friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying? Now, Jess don\u2019t say anything like that. You know it\u2019s not true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is. Look, I\u2019ve been lying to you all this time and I can\u2019t keep the ruse up anymore. I just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie said that she rose from the bleachers and stood against the locker, both hands against it as her head hung down in shame. Susan was getting worried, what could have happened to let her usually strong and fiery friend to feel this ashamed. Still, she silently waited for her friend to open herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie, stood silent for a moment and then, breathing deeply, she turned toward her friend getting everything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie, have you ever wondered why we were able to stay so late here in the gym? Haven\u2019t you ever noticed that nobody seemed to be interested in the two of us, not even the trainers? Didn\u2019t\u2019 seem strange to you that I haven\u2019t once used my card to come and go from the Gym?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth, Susie, is that I lied to you. My name\u2019s not Jess Burgess. I\u2019m Jessica Horowitz. I\u2019m the owner of this gym\u2026and\u2026in all this time\u2026all I did was lie to you. I was feeling lonely, training didn\u2019t seem to be that much invigorating for me, anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I saw you coming in, the way you tried your best, the attitude with which you passed each day here to try and train yourself from scratch\u2026That got me all fired up. But I was afraid. I couldn\u2019t come to you, revealing myself to be the owner, and expect you to treat me as a normal training buddy. So, I lied. And I kept my real identity secret to you for all this time\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t keep holding this within me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I\u2026I\u2019ll leave you alone now\u2026I\u2026I know I shouldn\u2019t have lied to you but\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished speaking, seeing that Susie was still staring at her in shock, Jessie turned around and began to slump away, but as soon as she had turned her back on Susan, the same stood from the bench and rushed forward, hugging Jessie from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think you lied to me? For all this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Jess, I\u2019ve always known you were the owner. Well, maybe not the first time we met, but after then, I saw your picture hung up on the reception wall. I may not be the smartest gal around but, I\u2019m not that dizzy yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why would you even try to lie to me? Do you really think that I would care for something like that? <br>\r\nCome on, you know me better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Partner, why don\u2019t we go out tonight. Let\u2019s close this issue with some beers. Nothing better than cheap alcohol to close this kind of situations\u2026what do you\u2026*oof*\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Susan was finishing her speech, Jessie closed on her and hugged her with all her might, as the other girl simply shushed her and soothed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then the two made of it an habit to have one night a week of meeting up in pubs and wasting themselves away on alcohol. In a few months, though, as their friendship grew closer, something happened that would mark a turning change in their lives. It was their cheat day and they had passed the whole evening wasting themselves until they both reached a point where they simply couldn\u2019t stand anymore. In their drunken state, Susan joined Jessie in her flat, and they passed the night there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the two of them shared the same bed and as the night became morning, they soon realized that they didn\u2019t simply sleep together, but did so much more. The more shocked of the two was Jessie, she couldn\u2019t believe that she had done it again. She couldn\u2019t remember much but, she thought of having forced herself on her friend and this, once more, brought her down. But when morning came, and Susie rose from the bed, joining her in the kitchen, Jessie didn\u2019t know what to expect from the girl standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was the second big change in their life. Jessie and Susie weren\u2019t anymore only partners in the Gym, now they were also lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs months passed, their relationship grew more and more official, until they decided to finally start living together and, since it was much roomier and not rented, but owned, Susie moved in with Jessie. Soon their life together started to become a routine, during the day Jessie would stay at home, or at the Gym, cleaning the house or keeping an eye on things at the gym, even though it wasn\u2019t really necessary since the place run almost by itself thanks to her employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie spent her days into her office cubicle, working at her secretarial desk, until late afternoon, then she would meet with her girlfriend and together they trained in the gym, returning both to their home where they spent their residual energies on each other pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time passed, another change began to approach itself in their lives, something that had the potential to turn everything around for both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as Susie just got back from office, Jessie noticed that her lover was looking rather plumper than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she seemed perturbed by that, and already was thinking on how she could approach Susie about that but, as the day passed and they entwined together in bed for the night, Jessie realized something about her she had never imagined. Their night together was astonishing for both of them, Susie couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling, all the following day, thinking back to the passion that Jessie had shown to her all night long. While Jessie found herself rather uncomfortable in knowing that she had loved that squishy, softer, feeling of Susie\u2019s plumpness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazonian girl began, in the following weeks, to widely fantasize about her Susie but at bigger sizes. Finding herself deeply aroused each and every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could she tell her about this desire within her? How could she even dare to ask her lover to let herself go, when all she wanted was to get as fit and ripped as she herself was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next six months their relationship grew stronger than ever, but Jessie still kept that secret hidden deeply within herself. Taking any opportunity, she was alone to fantasize about a fatter Susan, imagining any scenario in which her lover could grow fatter and fatter, growing so big she wouldn\u2019t be able to move without assistance. Jessica was truly getting mesmerized by these dreams and yet, she had to keep them only as fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Susie had already gone to work, they had a brief talk together and Jess knew she had an occasion which wasn\u2019t going to re-present itself again any sooner. That morning Susie had asked Jessie\u2019s help in her diet. Susan had finally noticed that, although they were training together almost every day, she still had managed somehow to put on a couple of pounds. Nothing really visible but, as she dreamt of Jessie\u2019s figure on herself, she asked her assistance on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll morning Jessie debated with herself on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could help her girlfriend shed those few pounds, but then her dreams, her fantasies would never become reality. She still lover her Susie but, she felt that she could love her so much more if only\u2026there was much more Susie to love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she could help her or\u2026she could \u2018help\u2019 her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her knowledge and the trust that Susan had in her it couldn\u2019t be too hard to have her lover to gain a few more pounds and so, have her become much more similar to what she dreamed upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she debated within herself, she finally seemed to have reached a decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that her course of action was decided she felt way calmer and more relaxed. Still, she couldn\u2019t simply enact her dreams right at that moment. She needed to have Susie addicted to it, or not realizing she was gaining weight. In order to achieve this, she planned on the long haul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a starter she had to change her lover habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo do so, she began preparing herself. Every day they started their day with a normal looking breakfast, made up of mostly healthy food. This, for Susie had to change. But it wasn\u2019t to be an immediate change, instead she planned for a gradual increase of the quantities, while keeping the same, as it was possible, calorie count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day, Susan noticed right away that there were a few changes in their schedule, her meals seemed to take more time than usual, although the calorie count remained unchanged. Her lover seemed way more passionate than ever, which was undeniably a plus, but still, she felt as if something had changed within their lives together. Still, unable to point out what the change was, Susie soon forgot about it and rolled with it. She completely trusted her fianc\u00e9e, knowing full well how expert she was on these matters.<br>\r\nFor the most of six months Jessi had steadily inflated the quantities of food at any meal they shared together, making sure that Susie got used to the portions and started to see them as the new normalcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this Milestone was reached, Jess began to slightly increase the calorie count of all of her lover meals, slowly raising the level a months passed, all the while pushing her as they usually did in the gym, this way Susie was growing used to the bigger portions of heavy caloric meals, but no real poundage was being gained as they still performed training each and every day. This trend continued for almost one year and a half in total. At the end of that period, Jess knew that her Susie was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, Jess woke up early, leaving the sweet embrace of her still sleeping lover, as she went to the kitchen to prepare Susan breakfast. As she cooked and prepared, she barely could keep her excitement in check. As she began to fill the table with a hearty breakfast only for Susie, she checked, and double checked everything.  In the past months she had made sure that Susie was able to withstand a large breakfast but, this morning, she was giving her a large, and caloric, breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susan entered the small kitchen, she smelled something delicious and looked in surprise at the spread that was on the table. Still she quickly greeted her lover with a peck on the cheek and sat, preparing herself to eat, before turning an inquisitive gaze toward her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready Jessie was sweating bullets, she began to worry to have been found out, that Susie was aware of her plan and wasn\u2019t going to allow it, that she was going to break up with her, that she\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo tofu, this morning? Thank god! I honestly hate that stuff\u2026Don\u2019t know how you can stand it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susie said that she began to eat her breakfast, using her cutlery to bring morsel after morsel within her lips, fully enjoying how tasty everything was. She didn\u2019t seem to worry about her meal, but that was simply since she wasn\u2019t really aware of what she was consuming. She saw the eggs and the turkey bacon, she saw the white rice and the sausages, she then noticed the shakes and the bowl of cereals but, as she had got used to larger meals she simply thought it was Jess cooking abilities to have increased, not that what she was eating was fried eggs with turkey bacon, or fried rice with fried sausages. Or that her normal energy shake had been replaced with a most simpler gainer shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as Susie had gotten used to these portions, she quickly cleaned all plates of food, without worrying about a thing, after all, she always ate that much at breakfast. As Susie stood from the table, Jess could see that her belly already had bloated up quite a bit, yet, she knew that one meal alone wasn\u2019t going to change much. Still, it was a start and, when Susan went to work, Jess began to move forward with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she restocked the house, she made sure of purchasing all kinds of high calories snacks, while quickly changing the container with similar products with less calories, or by modifying the labels on it, making them appear to have less calories. Then she began to stock on Susan clothes, making sure to get the same models but in larger sizes, while also keeping them with the small size tag. For a start she decided to change only the breakfast food, taking it slow, making sure that Susie would get used to it before changing anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more months, as Susan got home for her lunch break, she noticed that Jess had prepared quite a spread for her but, as always, she wasn\u2019t particularly concerned. Apart from the fact that everything seemed tastier, she didn\u2019t notice a anything else. <br>\r\nThat particular day, for example, Jess presented before her quite a large lunch, yet she dug in without a worry, complimenting heavily her girlfriend for her culinary skills. She did briefly notice that her middle seemed to be more bloated than before but, she didn\u2019t think too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, Jessie! You\u2019re really getting good at this. The ravioli was perfect! And the ribs\u2026oh god, the ribs\u2026it really seemed to be the real deal and not the tasteless cardboard tofu we usually have\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, babe. I want only the best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie kept her work up, upgrading all of Susan meals with richer and richer food, always getting her used to the new meal, before upgrading the next. Still, although she was eating more and more, Susan still was going every day at the gym with Jess, and so even though nine more months had passed, there wasn\u2019t any real change in Susan weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that Susie wasn\u2019t losing any weight but, she also wasn\u2019t gaining any. Jessica, having finally brought her lover to enjoy full day massive meals, had to step up the game and the only way to do that was to resort to her major knowledge of the fitness world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jess took the chance and began laying down her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jess? What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed that lately, you have seemed to have reached a plateau in regard to your weight? I mean, we weight ourselves each night right after training and yet, your weight isn\u2019t changing that much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I noticed. I actually wanted to ask you about that, because I don\u2019t get it what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did a bit of research and I probably figured out what the issue is. You see, each person has its own metabolism, this body mechanism is managing the way your body react to calorie consumption and storage. Usually, to speed up your own metabolism, one need to do plenty of exercises and eat less, forcing its own body to reduce the intake of energies and manage with what little it receives while keeping the body fit.<br>\r\nBut, in truth, it\u2019s not always like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. There are a few cases where the body will not speed up its own metabolism even though more exercise and diets are carried through. That\u2019s because, the body tries to keep its own balance by slowing down as a result of an increase of activities. That\u2019s seem to be your case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jess, as she kept explaining, knew perfectly well that all this discussion was a boatload of crap, still, Susie had never been the smartest of girls, and in some regards she was a bit of a derp, and Jessie just loved her more for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in this particular case, she was truly exploiting this weakness of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m getting at, Susan, is that we can try to slow down a bit on your exercises, while having you load up on energies and getting you hydrated. This way we can try to force your body to reach its ideal balance to get you out of this plateau, then we will steer it toward speeding up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie nodded a few times. She hadn\u2019t really much knowledge in this field but, if Jessie said it, it had to be true. She was, after all, a known fitness guru so she surely knew what was going on and how to address this kind of situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, love. So, what should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters, I would suggest you stop exercising every day, just do it one or two times a week. Then I\u2019ll arrange your meals so that you can manage to get a bit more of energy from each meal. Oh, and you can start having a few of these each day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that she brough forward a one-liter bottle of homemade shake, Susie grabbed it gingerly and tried to get a sip out of it. As soon as she tasted it, she couldn\u2019t refrain herself from moaning in pleasure. After a few, quite long, sips, she managed to let go of it and turned her tare toward her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so good. But, are you sure? Wouldn\u2019t be better to just drink more water, throughout the day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, that is true. In this case, there\u2019s a chance that water wouldn\u2019t remain long enough in your system to let your body metabolize it, and without any metabolization, your body would still try to overcompensate, despite your efforts. The shakes, instead, will remain longer within your system so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my body will have more time to make sure that is hydrated, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled at that, even though she hadn\u2019t understood much, she was still happy of all the support Jess was giving her with this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! To the speeding up of my metabolism!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Susie had been integrated completely into the plan, Jessie knew that her dream girl was one step closer to becoming real. All she had to do now was to let her gain weight and, keep her in the dark about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the easiest of tasks, but, doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from that day Susie meals grew larger and more filling, often Jess encouraged her to have seconds, and in rare occasions even thirds, and Susan did her best to comply. In truth, as days turned into weeks, and her meals kept growing longer and larger, Susie was starting to actually enjoy this kid of diet. It wasn\u2019t only her meals that were getting bigger, though. In those days that she usually went to the gym, Jess pushed Susie to simply stay at home and laze about, having quite a few snacks to help her in her \u2018loading up of energies\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, these snacks were only a few candy bars and, maybe a couple donuts but, as time carried on and Susan get used to those, she herself began to give herself more and more snacks, until she almost had some mini-meals, right before dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to hammer down Susie\u2019s growth, Jessie made sure that throughout the day, whether she was at home or in office, Susie kept drinking no less than nine or ten of those shakes, just to be sure she kept herself hydrated. Moreover, even though once a week they went together to the gym, Jessie made sure that Susie would pass most of her time sitting down on a bench, slurping down shake after shake, having her do only a few basic exercises, and even those for just a handful of minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie, in truth, was enjoying all this a bit too much. She knew it was just a temporary thing and, for this exact reason she swore to herself that she would just enjoy it until it lasted. She couldn\u2019t imagine the consequences of her own free enjoyment of this different diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie dreamed about the perfect Susie, she soon realized, that she wasn\u2019t dreaming anymore, she was just remembering how the last weekend had gone with Susie stuck in the apartment with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs memories flooded back, so did her arousal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessie had just finished preparing everything for her growing lover, as the new diet had been issued, Susan had started to wake up later and later on the weekends, something that Jessica loved, since it gave her time to prepare all the food she wanted Susie to have at breakfast. Jessie was right about to call her girlfriend for breakfast when she heard the loud thumps coming from down the hallway, signaling the coming of her lover. A few minutes later a slightly sweaty and short breathed Susan appeared at the doorway, the girl was getting downright huge under the influx of those massively caloric meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she appeared with a slight double chin, which seemed to grow wobblier each passing day, her face well rounded up, with quite hefty cheeks. Her breasts also had grown massively, losing their perkiness but gaining already a couple of sizes, growing from a small B cup to the quite large D cup. But what took mostly the toll was her middle. Her belly had literally exploded with fat, already starting to divide itself in two hefty belly rolls, which did nothing to cover her expanding hips and ass cheeks. Poor Susie wasn\u2019t really understanding what was going on, her clothes still fit, but she just felt so large and heavy. Still, whenever food was around all her focus moved there, making her consider secondary anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved through the doorway, which Jessie noticed with glee seemed to be getting narrower each day, she waddled slowly to the table until she finally plopped her large form onto a couple of chairs expertly placed there by Jess. Finally seated, although short of breath, Susie looked with glee at the spread in front of her. Jess had made sure that there was plenty of everything, from pancakes smothered in syrup and butter to honey glazed bearclaws, from small mountains of bacon strips to fried chicken pieces. Then there were short cakes and pies, hamburgers and hotdogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word Susie began to dig in, grabbing items from here and there, shoveling pieces of bacon and fired eggs in her mouth, adding to it bites out of cakes and pies. Jess could only look in guilty pleasure as she saw her once training buddy gorging through a literal mountain of sweets and breakfast junk food. The girl kept at it without a remorse, cleaning plate after plate until all remained on the table were empty plates and few crumbs. Susie then burped loudly as she massaged her bloated gut, as it pushed against the confines of her PJ\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though she had cleared everything from the table, Jess tried to push her a bit more. She moved forward, giving Susie a peck on her cheek, just as she brought forward a couple of pitchers of her own gain shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, Susie\u2026don\u2019t forget to keep yourself hydrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ourp*\u2026Oof\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 if I can\u2026Jessie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, babe. Don\u2019t let our effort go to waste. You need to keep yourself hydrated\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she felt full, Susie grabbed the first pitcher of shake that Jessie offered and slowly brought it to her lips, starting to gulp down its content, feeling as it sloshed heavily into her already tight gut, still she managed to empty it out and, before she could think about it, she also took the second one swiftly emptying out too. As she groaned in pain, she lumped back against the chairs, right as Jessie began to slowly massage her overstuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, Susie. You\u2019ll see\u2026 a few more days and you\u2019ll be ready\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, it was months since Jessie repeated that lie, yet Susie was too enthralled by her own growing gluttony to really mind about anything, except resting. Helping her stand up, Jessica quickly brought her to the couch in the living room, letting her stay there to rest and digest, watching TV and, leaving at her side quite a few bowls of snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Love. Just rest and recover\u2026and have a few snacks if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, even though had just finished a huge meal, even though felt her belly ready to pop, since food was nearby, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from having a go at it. Still, seated, as he r focus was on the television screen, her hand moved o its own accord and grabbed a handful of those bite sized chocolaty treats, bringing them into her mouth. Susan moaned in pain and in delight as she kept eating all morning long, stopping only when Jess called her out to let her know that lunch was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly stood up on her own, ignorant of how her own weight was trying to drag her down and assuming, instead, that she was simply lacking nutrients and energies as Jessie often reminded her. So, with effort she began the arduous task of waddling from the living room toward the kitchen, where she plodded once more at her seats, drooling at the sight and smell of the humongous meal that was awaiting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie could barely restrain herself as she presented her the full doze course meal she had slaved around all morning, to her growing out girlfriend. As usual she presented int under the pretense that Susie lack of breath and strength, was simply meaning that she wasn\u2019t eating enough. But as Susie had grown used, and addicted, to this lifestyle, there was barely the need for her to keep repeating herself. Once more, the poor girl found herself almost forced to dig in, pushed onward by her gluttonous stomach, gleefully cleaning out dish upon dish, until she simply had no more strength to continue on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was at these moments that Jessie intervened, she quickly took position beside Susie and began feeding her, pushing forkful after forkful, spoonful after spoonful, in her ever-growing lover, until she literally couldn\u2019t eat a single bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie looked at her bloated girlfriend, she barely could contain herself, with each passing meal Susie was becoming more and more like she appeared in her dreams and yet, for Jessie, it still didn\u2019t seem to be enough. Helping her stand once more, Jess assisted her lover until they reached their bedroom, once there she would let her sleep for a while, and then she would wake her up for a quite fulfilling, for both girls, lovemaking session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second nap, Jessie was usually waking Susan up again at around the 5:00 PM, feeding her a mid afternoon snack, letting her then graze the residual afternoon in front of the television once more, until it was time for dinner. It was at this time that Jessica removed all her brakes and went full out on Susie\u2019s waistline. Piling more and more caloric food into her girlfriend body, feeding her to stuffing point and, then, pushing her to keep eating, to continue filling up. Generally, she would stop only when midnight passed, and would let her Susie sleep only after another fulfilling night of passion together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these calories pushed on her, and with almost no exercise to rein it in, it was no wonder that Susie began quickly to grow larger and fatter. At first, nothing seemed to happen but, as more calories were pushed on her and no outage of consumption ever came, her body began to store this excess as fat tissue on her body. For quite a while Jess plan seemed to be working pretty well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie ate like a machine, almost gorging throughout the day and night, whether at home or in the office. Growing hungrier and lazier as days began to pass by, she seemed to be soon growing bored of even going to the gym, even to check her own weight, as they had started to do at first. And yet she didn\u2019t seem to realize anything about her growing body. Especially since her clothes were still fitting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t know that Jessie was swiftly replacing each dress she had with larger sizes as soon as she noticed that Susie had outgrown something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on one day, as six months of this brand-new diet had passed, something suddenly threatened Jess plan to collapse in its own.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That morning seemed to be a morning like all others. It was Saturday, Susan had no office to go to and Jessica had already prepared another massive multi coursed meal under the pretense of being a simple breakfast. That morning, though, as Susie slowly arrived at the doorway, she looked completely wearied out. Still, at the notion of food, Susie tried valiantly to enter the kitchen, only to find herself jammed in the doorway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a few minutes to realize that, even though she was trying to move forward, she wasn\u2019t moving of an inch. Jessi immediately realized the risk she was facing. If she didn\u2019t find a way to distract Susie, she would have realized that she hadn\u2019t lost any weight, but only grown overly massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Jessie rushed to her side, while sticking a whole bar of butter in her girlfriend mouth, as she used a second one to try and get her out of the doorway. Susan did notice that something seemed wrong but, as she tried to voice her doubts, Jessica pushed something in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deliciously filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing only on the taste, Susie began to make quick work of the butter, just as Jessie managed to get her out of the doorway and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026Jessie\u2026that was\u2026delicious\u2026what was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026uhm\u2026It was some kind of \u2026err\u2026Health bars that I\u2019ve grabbed at the market the other day. Was it good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie nodded as she licked her lips in pleasure, while massaging her globular gut, still rumbling out in hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll try to get a few more next times I go. Now, sit down and enjoy your meal\u2026you truly need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie once more nodded, making her now three chins wobble heavily but, just as she seated and as she grabbed her utensils, she turned toward her girlfriend, observing her for a minute, enjoying that toned body of hers, the definite six pack, wishing that soon she would have looked the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie was getting nervous as she saw that her fattening lover hadn\u2019t yet touched a hint of food and grew even more nervous when Susie told her: \u201cHave you been washing my PJ\u2019s in hot water? They have grown tighter since last time I used them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica suddenly realized that she had done everything to perfection except one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t replaced Susan pajamas that week. No wonders she did find them tight. Under Jessica guidance Susie had grown from a slightly plump 143 pounds, to the almost 400 pounds behemoth that now sat in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026I wanted to let you know but, I forgot\u2026I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled throughout this as she replied with candor in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is\u2026 nothing to be\u2026 ashamed of, it may\u2026happen to \u2026any of us. <br>\r\nAfterall, you\u2019re taking\u2026 such a good care\u2026 of me, helping me\u2026 out with\u2026 this diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I truly\u2026 think\u2026 you\u2019re the most\u2026 amazing girl\u2026 I know, Jess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susie said that she quickly began to delve deeply into her meal, quickly focusing herself only on the food in front of her. But that words had caused something to shift in Jessie\u2019s mind. All of a sudden Jessica realized for real what she had done to her lover. <br>\r\nTo the person she loved more than anything else in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie stood speechless as Susie words rang in her head, as flashes of Susan fattening up sprang in front of her eyes. Jessie suddenly found herself weak in her legs, almost falling on a chair and, again she was surprised by her girlfriend reaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last few months, Susie had developed a single mindedness toward food. Whatever was happening around her, if she had food surrounding her, she would focus only on it. Even her clothes had ripped, or buttons had popped from her pants, if she was eating, she had simply ignored these events as if they had never happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as soon as Jessica almost fell on her chair, Susan stopped with her gorging right away. Quickly trying to assess if she was feeling ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess!? Is everything alright? Are you feeling well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie had never expected that Susie could muster enough force of will to actually stop her gorging, but she seemingly had managed for her. This event sent even more anguish and shame in the wannabe feeder\u2019s hearth. As Jessie began to crumble within herself she saw right away as Susie began the arduous task of standing up on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any exercise to build up muscles, with all the time spent lazing about on the couch, usually she wasn\u2019t able to manage it without external support. Yet, be that Jess seemed in pain, be that adrenaline was somewhat coursing through her vein, Susie managed to stand and began to waddle to her lover, until she hugged her with all of her, very little, strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie, come on. Tell me, what\u2019s going on? Do you need me to go and search for help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jessica wasn\u2019t feeling so down, she would have laughed at the irony of this situation. Susan, the one who had been fattened up without her knowledge, was trying to support the amazingly fit and trained Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocking back tears, Jessie forced herself to calm herself and recover, while hugging back her lover, squeezing her a bit to let her know that she was ok. Even though she wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m..I\u2019m okay, Susie\u2026I\u2026I need to confess you something though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie, exhaling a long breath had managed to sit more comfortably on a chair as she resumed grazing her food. She was still focused on Jessica but, as she had been used for the last months, she just couldn\u2019t stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Jessie was torn between personal desires and love for her Susan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom one side she wanted to keep things as they were, fattening her up till she reached immobility and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other side, Susan was the woman she loved, the woman she had opened up to for the first time and which had accepted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did she do to her? She betrayed her trust, she lied to her and destroyed her dream of becoming toned and fit like she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just as the first time she had seen her, at that time she had only lied about her name. This time though she had lied to get her fat. To satisfy her own animalistic urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No\u2026</i>\u2019Jessie thought \u2018<i>\u2026I don\u2019t deserve her. And I cannot keep her in the dark about herself. I need to tell the truth\u2026Even though she will hate me for it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie\u2026Susie, listen to me for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jessie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got\u2026something to say to you. I\u2026I\u2019ve done terrible things to you\u2026So terrible that I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t keep going like this. I have no excuses. No way of redemption out of what I\u2019ve done to you. I only beg of you to not hate me too fiercely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan knew that this moment was going to come. She had rehearsed it a few times within herself already and, although she had hoped to see it happen sooner, she still waited for Jessie to carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie I\u2026How can I\u2026? There is no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan saw the pain that was wreaking the, wonderfully built, amazon apart. She knew that Jessie had realized what she had done, and that she was mentally tearing herself apart. Still, although all that had happened, Jessica was still the woman that she had fell in love with and seeing her in such pain was too much for Susan to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fattened me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess stopped herself. At first she ignored that phrase, expecting a furious accusation, expecting a hateful remarks. But Susie instead had simply stated the fact with a common tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, you fattened me up to massive proportions. But, yes. I knew it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly stood and waddled again toward her loved one, hugging her and keeping her close to her heart, slowly caressing the amazon hair with quiet gentle strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think that I would simply believe to that crap you sprouted a while ago? I checked on internet and verified your information\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remained speechless and yet she started crying since this was even worse in her mind. Her Susie had known what she was doing to her. And she, blindly had thought of being the one in control. But Susan voice took her out of her reveries, bringing her back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, I tried to imagine why you were trying to get me to gain weight. And after a while I got it. As more weight piled on, I did notice that you were getting more and more passionate during our sessions together. And so, I realized that you were more physically attracted by a larger me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered why you hadn\u2019t told me any of this, why did you tried to keep it a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you had done the same when we met the first time. So, it simply was that you were feeling shame in asking for it. So I kept your game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I waited for the moment when you would have come out clear handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, at around 250 pounds I wished you would just tell me but, at some point I simply let it go and enjoyed the flow. I knew that some day you would have told me the truth behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here we are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, still feeling her lover embrace around her, her soft, heavy hands on her head, stroking her hair, was unable to speak for several minutes, until she finally managed to choke back some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026But why haven\u2019t you\u2026stopped me\u2026earlier? I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie\u2026 You really need to be more confident in yourself and in your needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trust you. I know that you loved me, I had proof of it with every pound gained. I knew you weren\u2019t doing it for a need of controlling me. And I love you back, you silly. You\u2019re my beautiful amazon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goddess down from heavens who loves me with all of her hearth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, for some reason, is into fatties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Susie chuckled a bit, but she still kept Jessica within her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could I deny what you needed? What you wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust, please, Jess\u2026don\u2019t think less of yourself. Don\u2019t feel ashamed\u2026You\u2019re a wonderful woman\u2026the only one who still hasn\u2019t realized it yet, is you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Jessica couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. She hugged her lover back and cried all of her shame, all of her sadness away. As both girls were now feeling a bit more secure and calm, Susie let go of her beautiful amazon, slumping back once more on her two chairs, a teasing smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026woe me\u2026\u201d she said with a hint of teasing in her voice, as she stared deeply into Jessica\u2019s eyes. \u201cAll this commotion\u2026completely left me\u2026spent of energies\u2026I wonder...who will help\u2026little \u2018ol me to\u2026regain it with\u2026tons\u2026of food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie, unable to stop herself almost choke back a laughter from coming out, as she turned toward her lover, bringing toward her a forkful of heavily buttered pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ok with this, Susie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-mmm\u2026I\u2019ve got you at my side, can just laze about all day on the Week\u2019s end\u2026and think to the stupefied faces of those around us as we will stroll into town? The perfect amazon and the fat tanker. It will be priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...are you going to be my savior\u2026or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie smiled widely as she brought the fork down, within her lover lips, smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, aren\u2019t I your goddess? It is my duty to make sure that my servants are\u2026\u201d at this she grabbed a hefty belly roll, shaking it teasingly as she brought her lips closer to Susie\u2019s. \u201c\u2026Well fed and taken care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished speaking the two shared a long, full kiss, and enjoyed the rest of the meal together, as they should have done since the beginning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">As its said in the brief description this interactive means to collect stories related to weight gain in the life of normal couples. Although not really my kind of cup of tea, gay stories ( as well as lesbians, ofc) are accepted as long as they keep the focus on the weight gain situation. both male and female can gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Apart from that is basically free territory, although I've got to have some ground rules to be placed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Decent grammar and decent sized chapters. Chapters composing of only two or three lines will not be accepted, except for special cases as the need to list for multiple choices( if in doubt send me a note and we will see).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No Scat, Poop and any other related fetish involving dirty activities with urine and feces and /or similar, unless is in a <b><u>VERY</u></b> mild manner . A general Slobbines can be accepted but, again, only in a generalized way. <i>Sorry, I\u2019m a devious man with many fetishes but, even I\u2019ve got my limits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There is no limit in growth/gain/stomach capacity/\u2026 as far as I\u2019m concerned but, please, put some effort into it. Don\u2019t let the main character ( or whoever else) gain hundreds of thousand pounds in just one sentence. I\u2019m the first that prefer quantity over quality, but even I describe the action, a little bit at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Leave always a choice, it is an interactive after all. Do not force the reader to follow your path, give always a way to change or twist the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The laws of reality don't apply here. There can be magic, weird ray guns, little aliens and whatever comes to your mind (as long as it doesn't break the previous rules), just put some effort into it, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sex is allowed, just try not to be too graphic about it or to focus too much on it. No gender limitations either, just give a warning if things are going to be Hot in the chapter ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No underage sex, all persons engaging in sexual activities will have to be 18+<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kids can be included, either if considered as a couple or the sons and daughters of said couple, and can gain weight as well (as long as it doesn't break the afore mentioned rules)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not the least, have fun, enjoy and write on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy! </td>",
