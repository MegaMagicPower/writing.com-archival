But your sister loves it.  Your sister, Melody, always goes to those stupid conventions and dresses up like a character.  You think it's really dumb.  But then one day you say something wrong about it.  Lets recap shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, why do you insist on dressing up for that stupid convention\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun, you should try it\" Melody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's stupid and I would hate it\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you like Pokemon, maybe a character from that, tell you what, come to the con tomorrow and I will be able to convince you\" Melody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll bet you can!\" Evan said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then since you are so sure you won't be convinced..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets make a wager.  If I can convince you I get to choose your costume\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!  There's no way in hell you can convince me anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the end, she did.  Being a 15 year old boy with raging hormones and the scantily clad girls convinced you that maybe the con wasn't that bad.  So in the end she won.  You are now sitting in her room waiting for her to unveil your costume.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry it up Mel!  I want this over and done with now!\" Evan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just getting the final parts together!\" Mel screams from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks back in with something behind her back.  She pulls the costume out.  It is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she did that you sat there, thinking how far she would take this.  About 20 minutes after when she finished she rushed you into the shower and had you rub a special cream on your arms and legs that got rid of all your body hair.  Then you got out and walked back to the chair and she handed you a bra and panties.  The bra was a poke ball bra and the panties were togepi panties.  You almost laughed at the irony.  Then she turned around while you put them on.   Next she gave you the tank top, then the shorts, then the suspenders and finally fit the wig on you.  Then she did your makeup, by making you look slightly girly, though your face had always looked slightly girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?  </span></div></div>",

You recognize them as your sister's friends, all dressed in assorted costumes, some of which you can't tell.  You see Kelly, your sister's best friend, Veronica, another of your sister's friends and Rebecca, you have had a crush on Rebecca since you were little but you were always afraid to tell her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel!

You pass many booths when Rebecca pulls you aside to talk with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to sound mean, but why the hell are you dressed like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a bet with Mel.  I thought I'd win\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, never make a bet with your sister.  No one ever wins those.  But I do like that you took it like a man and went along with it.  That's real manliness, being able to show your feminine side!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a hug and you start to walk with the group again.  Your sister seems to be having fun, maybe this isn't so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhats next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keenly observant of Lance now, you couldn't help but feel more than a little anxious; inwardly, a battle raged between two dragons. One, of the opinion you needed to tell your secret now, out in the open. Leaving him no longer within the dark, and spilling it out so that a future kiss would no longer be nearly so likely. The other dragon was of the opposite opinion, positing that, while such a thing could be beneficial in the short term, such brutal honesty might be best eased into. Amidst such thoughts, however, the world continued to turn around you, various folks in costumes were rather insistent in brushing past you and your friends and farther into the convention floor. Some turned into the vendor room, stacked wall to wall with vendors of various goods, others going to the entrance or even into the Artists' Alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever they were going, it hardly mattered; what truly caught hold was Lance, dressed in his girly costume, gently nudging you with an elbow and speaking. \"Hey, Eva? You alright?\" A quick glance over and your stomach churned, seeing the genuine look of concern on his face. It was insanely difficult now to just..spill the beans out, letting and getting everything in the open. Thoughts wracked in your brain, fighting for the right to be heard. Instead of speaking, you give him a nod and that seems to assure him, for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance goes back to discussing various topics with the others in tow, laughing and chuckling at a few apt jokes, and otherwise having a splendid time. Somehow, they made it even harder. Gently drumming your fingers on a hip, the convention itself seemed of less concern, more and more, your thoughts zeroed in on this one, difficult proposition. Was there another answer, another way? If so, there wasn't much forthcoming your way. <i>How can I break it to him?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a simple, questioned thought, but still so difficult to answer. You couldn't do it publicly; besides the embarrassment, there was no telling just how he'd react. And then, a sudden interruption of your thoughts came into vision, as a hand held in front collided with your face, eliciting a 'Ouch!' from your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" The familiar voice of your sister, Mel, rang inside of your eardrums, \"Aren't you paying the least bit of attention, Eva? I asked you a question!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you uttered, \"sorry. I spaced out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding!\" Mel exclaimed; the others laughed and tittered, grins popping up on their faces, \"so, like I asked; what did you want to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well, I dunno. What're you gonna do?\" you asked, looking at her curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna head back to the room for now,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we!\" The girls with her chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna look around some more. You're welcome to come with me, if you'd like.\" Lance flashed a smile your way, and it had the opposite effect; instead of washing away all your troubles and soothing your soul, it only made things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, uhm. I was going to look around the vendor room some more, maybe...\" you answered, and to your dismay Lance's face seemed to light up; the girls' did as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Lance exclaimed, \"if you'd like, you can come with me.\" The girls tittered and watched, interest sketched on their faces as to your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....\" It took a moment for you to answer, as your eyes danced around the group before you nodded, \"sure.\" And, just like that, a great dispersal; the girls made their goodbyes, Mel and Rebecca giving a wink to you before leaving while Lance's smile remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then; to the Vendor room!\" He declared, and you nodded and followed along, keeping in step with the boy. Yet still, it bothered you that spilling the beans wasn't coming out so easily; it was..hard. Just being keenly aware of him, watching him all smiles and laughter. The resolve came later on, after buying a few choice items of your own -- figurines of Misty, Ash and the gang, as well as some unknown anime figurines, an Japanese-lettered storyboard book on Ghost in the Shell, and volume 1 of Kaze Hikaru -- before you finally decided to spill it all out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance,\" you started to say, the white bags of figurines and books swaying gently as you walked, \"uhm...I need to talk. You know...importanty stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh came from his throat, \"Importanty stuff?\" that sent a blush to your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!\" you protested, a light pout on your lips. Before he formed a proper response, however, he seemed to take more interest in the various cosplays on display; A decent Kenshin Himura, a more-than-acceptable 11th Doctor, Deadpool and a very well-made Maka Albarn costume, complete with a great Soul by her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking pictures and otherwise getting things on camera, you eventually pulled his attention away enough to get him focused. \"It's really important!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. What do you wanna talk about?\" he asked, a curious expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here,\" you said, quickly surveying the area, \"somewhere a bit more private?\" His face took on an even more intriqued expression and he gave a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Uh..I think there are a few empty rooms around here. I know of one...\" he said, and you nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That works!\" And then, after a serious of long hallways and ccorridors bursting with activity and people, the two came upon several sets of double doors, colorfully marked, as well as more gray and blandly marked one's. Lance eventually decided upon a relatively unoccupied one, and the two stepped within. It was a rather dark area, aside from the projection displayed on the far north wall, though it only showed, well...a white screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to talk to me about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Finding that courage, held deep within the pit of your stomach, you began, \"I have a..confession to make.\" When his face took on an expressed interest, you felt emboldened and continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...uhm...I'm not really...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh. \"You're not really Misty? I couldn't have guessed!\" When that didn't elicit any laughter from you, his expression soured and a hand grazed the back of his head, gently rubbing it. \"Sorry..guess it wasn't as funny as I thought it'd be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the situation and subject matter weren't so serious, you really would've been thankful for the brevity. Alas...\"Look, okay, I'm...uh...\" He leaned in, paying every bit of attention to you as anyone possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several moments after, you were silent, and such silence remained unbroken until he let out a cough. \"You're...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Evan!\" You blurted out, \"I'mnotreallyeva!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response from him seemed shocking. His face flashed an.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your limited experience with anime provided a rather lackluster set of expectations; hell, perhaps expecting such things to result in similar circumstances and similar outcomes was naive. Regardless, when you saw the look on his face, your breath hitchedi n your throat. His hands clenched tightly, enough that the knuckles whitened. Even in the most feminine, he clearly looked angry, and for a moment, hurt. Without saying a word, he caused you to flinch slightly and dread the words to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deafening silence was, perhaps worse. It only amped up your anxiety, fingers curling and clenching tighter around the handles of your purchases. Only the sound of the running projected seemed to reverberate about the room, its' gears whirring and gently pervading the air. At least, until Lance finally spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His head made several half-movements, a hand outstretched and finger extended to point at you. Several times it shook, mouth parting and pursing without a word, before finally a sound; the sound of a frustrated grunt. \"You're Evan, huh?\" he said, in a fairly unkind voice. You could only nod slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he laughed mirthlessly, shaking his head. \"Why didn't you say this earlier? You know, when I stood up for you against Jerry? Or..I dunno...anytime?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno...\" you responded timidly, and he laughed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dunno? Or maybe you just wanted to trick me. Haha..all one big, fat trick on Lance! Get him to kiss the girl and then reveal; tada! It's actually a boy!\" In the best impression of a stage performer, the boy pantomimed and made exaggerated motions, the end of which had him outstretching his arms and curling his lips into a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you wanted to catch me on candid camera!\" And this continued mockery had him mock-holding a camera, peering at Evan through a fake lens, \"get Lance on camera kissing a girl that's not a girl! Maybe a little blackmail, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that!\" you protested, but his only response was another sharp laugh, an act that made you flinch in response and step back a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? It isn't, Evan? Maybe your sister just wanted to get a few extra bucks outta me, eh? Even better! Get the idiot in drag, extra blackmail!\" A frustrated sigh later, and you held back biting commentary. It was better to be placating here, instead of confrontational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No. It wasn't her; Mel had nothing to do with this,\" you spoke out, \"I'm...I'm the only one apart of this, okay?\" His posture returned to normal, though his expression retained the anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you?\" he asked, peering over at you. You gave a firm nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. Great..great trick you played on me. Really good. Once in a lifetime!\" he spoke, laughing -- though, discerning the raucous enjoyment within it would be impossible. That required enjoyment of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Got nothing else to say?\" He asked; when you offered nothing but silence and pursed lips, his expression soured considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me!\" He said, and stepped forward menacingly. You stepped back in retaliation, an act that further spurred him on, until you hit a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?\" he asked, standing between you and freedom, \"just playing a little prank.\" He leaned in, close to your face, \"after all, you like pranks, don't you? You like toying with hearts, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" he said, and you flinched. Minutes passed, and no action on his part. Until he breathed a sigh, and stepped away, turning on the balls of his heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going. Maybe I'll see your sister on the way out, but whatever. Have a nice one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lance, I'm...\" And, just like that, he was gone; the sound of a door opening and closing indicating his departure, \"...sorry.\" Then, there was nothing but the broken projector to keep you company. Instead of departing straight out, however, you went to an empty seat and sat, your head swimming with thoughts and emotions. This wasn't like you were used to, being so readily brushed away and it..well. Strangely, it hurt. A lot. A knot had formed inside of your thumping chest, and fresh tears had welled within both eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grip on your items loosened, until they fell to the red carpeted floor, gently gathering at your feet in a pile. And, for the next hour, that was all that happened. That was, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last name you were desirous to hear, especially after what he'd done earlier. Instinctively, you'd spoken out, \"Go away!\" before you had even thought of what to say. The rapping of his knuckles against the locked door continued, seemingly unfazed by your quick rejection, this time harder and louder. You'd hoped this would alert some authority figure -- a guard, like earlier who'd come and check to see what the problem was, or perhaps a nice con-goer, hearing an obvious disagreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was little more than a dream, sitting on the cold, hard checkered floor of the bathroom. Well-furnished and well-maintained, you had no worries about how clean your clothes would be after getting up off of this floor. There would still be dirt and other nasty little things to cling to your clothes, but at least the possibilities would be limitedi n scope. But, such as it was, Lance would not let you dig yourself deep into a reverie of your surroundings or go too deeply into your mind to get away from this situation and pretend it wasn't happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it seemed, he was determined and adamant to be heard. \"Look,\" he began, \"just..let me in, okay? I promise I won't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" you shouted again, your eyes momentarily lifted to the door in question. It occasionally rattled from the force of blows hit upon it, insistent as Lance was, but thankfully it didn't budge or move much, too resistant to allow him in. Lance, from where you sat, could easily be head breathing a frustrated, perhaps angry sigh, followed up by another noisy bang against the door. Thankfully, his knocks seemed ot stop altogether, and footsteps could be heard echoing, going away from it. Whew...one disaster averted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as you sat here on the bathroom floor, your mind started to drift towards what'd happen just moments ago. Your head half-shook, mouth twitching. It wasn't something you expected from Lance. Was he really that angered by the comparison to Jerry? Hell, in your opinion now, he was fast approaching 'worse than Jerry' tier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, you never recalled Jerry forcing himself on someone like that; sure, he'd often forced himself near people, pushed them around, verbally abused you and Mel a lot after the break-up..but he never really closed the distance and kissed Mel when she didn't want to be kissed. At least, to your knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was something worth discussing with Mel, after this whole trip was over with. Even without that, he was still just as bad, and you'd felt..scared. Your heart had been beating, up until now, rather rapidly with adrenaline pumping through to every pore and every vein, but that adrenaline high was coming down now. You were hardly calmer, or felt safer, but at least Lance was gone. For now, anyways. What'd made him turn so against you, anyways? Was it really just the revelation? Wasn't it normal for some guys to dress up as girls at these conventions? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly seemed like an exception, yet he seemed so angry and hurt and...everything. Gently brushing a single tile on the checkered floor, you'd lightly tap it a few times, thoughts racing about this whole mess. Would it be wise to go ahead and risk going out? Or..what? Stay here, wait a little while longer before attempting it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....what if Lance was out there? Just..waiting? For all you knew, he could be. You certainly thought he'd left, and there were no more footsteps outside of the door, no more discernible, human sounds beyond it. Yet, deep in the back of your mind, you could not help but entertain the possibility, a possibility that rapidly asserted itself in the forefront of your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you go out and risk it, or..wait a little while longer? </span></div></div>",

Perhaps to get an explanation, perhaps some answers or closure or... or something approaching reasonable discourse. That, however, would need to wait. There was no way you would confront him about it alone..or at least, fully alone. You'd need Melody and Rebecca nearby, just... just in case. You may be a man, but Lance was, or at least seemed to be, physically stronger than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a confrontation happened, you didn't know the outcome, but weighing the likelihood of victory, you reluctantly concluded you would be a non-issue for Lance. This presented a problem, which was thankfully solved by the idea of numbers. Nearby numbers, a gang-up, some back-up..whatever to help, just in case. Would it come to a physical confrontation, or would it not? You'd no idea how the situation would be resolved, but..well, there was no use standing around here, just thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, you set off down the hallway, eyes peeled for any sign of Rebecca or Melody. You doubted they were around here, judging by their lack of presence, well... anywhere near here. Perhaps they'd gone back to the convention, or maybe went off to get a bite to eat? Both good possibilities, after all. Moving down a set of hallways, you eventually came upon an elevator, that went up or down, and pushed the button to call it. The call took a few minutes, then the sound of a soft ding entered your ears and the metal doors slid open to reveal an empty but polished metallic box. In you stepped, and pressed the door to the ground floor. It wasn't long after that you were out and about, looking for any sign of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what, upon glancing at your watch was nearing an hour, you'd searched and searched the hotel and surrounding area and found nothing. It was a shame, but... unfortunately expected. As you headed out back towards the convention, just a few blocks away from the hotel, you'd caught a glimpse of a certain individual heading your way, though thankfully he lacked the appearance of Lance. No, instead it was... Jerry, a smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he greeted kindly, \"what's a pretty lady like you doin' out here all alone? Need some company?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove off,\" you'd retort, lips twisting into a frown. Immediately, Jerry held up his hands in a defensive, open-palmed posture for a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so hostile!\" he'd say, \"anyways, you were at the con right? With uh..that nerd group or whatever, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspicion entered your thoughts immediately, but you'd cautiously nod your head affirmatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seen Melody around anywhere?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you responded, \"in fact, I've been looking for her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

You weren't attending this year, and Mel didn't force you to, since after last year, she knew that you had a good reason for not wanting to go. Her and her friends however, were getting costumes together, this year planning to be the Sailor Scouts from Sailor Moon. They had jokingly asked you to be a part of it, as with only four of them, they were missing a Sailor Venus, but you had politely declined. Rebecca was a little bummed out, but she of course understood, after what happened last year, it was better to err on the side of caution. But, sometimes plans don't go as intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about two weeks before the convention when Lance contacted you. You reacted with shock at the email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Mel asked as she poked her head into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance emailed me.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does he want a ticket to a really expensive con?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. Read it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved aside so Mel could read the email. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Eva(n),<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it's been a while, and I haven't taken you up on that offer for a con ticket. How about another way to pay the debt? So, that picture we took together, none of my friends bought that I actually knew you and figured you were some cosplay girl I took a picture with. That I could live with, but then... well... my friends are planning on going to this year's anime convention, and a girl in our group dropped out and we were planning on a group cosplay and... they want me to get you for it, to prove that I actually know you. We bought tickets in advance so that's covered and I can send the costume, you look like you're around the same size as the girl you'd be replacing. And if you aren't, you can get it altered. At least consider it. It'd be a big help, and make up for what happened last year. What do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nLance</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, she looked at you and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny! I can't do this!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only for one weekend. You've already done it once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you remember what happened? Jerry, and when Lance found out Eva didn't exist, it was terrible. I'm telling him no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep on it, decide tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'm not changing my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next few hours debating, weighing the options. He's in a bind, and it means you don't have to buy him a ticket, but it also means that you have to dress as a girl again, and around Lance's friends, who don't sound like the type of guys you want to be interacting with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide?</span></div></div>",

The doorbell rang and you answered it, finding Rebecca standing there, in costume with a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Evan.\" she said. \"I thought you gave up cosplay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I.\" you said. \"What's in the bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Rebecca said as you let her into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked together to Mel's room, as she set her costume out on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky! You're here! I was so wrapped up I didn't here the door open,\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I've got the stuff you asked for.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Well Evan, it's time for Eva to come out to play again.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get it over with.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay first, go shower and shave your whole body.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for? I'm wearing the catsuit! They won't see my legs or arms!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember last time? You weren't in costume the whole weekend. We have to be sure. There will be a lot more scrutiny from Lance's friends.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you said and walked into the bathroom to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerged ten minutes later clean and hairless. You suddenly had flashbacks to the depilatory that you had used the previous year. You had a towel around your waist, and your hair, at Mel's insistence. You were immediately handed a pair of black panties, which you slipped on, out of view of the two girls. Then you walked back in and you were sat in the chair at Mel's vanity again. Mel started grooming your nails, cleaning them up as she had done the previous year. Though this year the clear nail polish dried with a bit of a pink tint. Rebecca also started shaping and polishing your toenails with pink nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that necessary?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just think it looks cute.\" Rebecca replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's next?\" you asked, after the polish had dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, last year we could suffice with stuffing the bra, but this year we need to upgrade.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we got these.\" Rebecca said, pulling out two prosthetic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that too far?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dressing up as Black Widow at an Anime convention as a favor to a guy you met as Misty last year. I think too far passed a while ago.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should just let this happen.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey glued the breasts to your chest and then Rebecca helped you into a bra, which was B-Cup they said. Then Mel started attaching hair extensions to your relatively short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was using a wig, and these are my normal hair color.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but after last year, if you need to take the costume off again, we don't need to be scrambling, plus your hair's shorter this year.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems fair.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey braided your hair and put it under a wig cap, after which they put the short ginger wig on your head. The only thing left was makeup and actually putting on the costume. Mel and Rebecca didn't do that much makeup, but they softened your face and made you look more feminine, and then it was time. You suited up, pulling on the catsuit, boots, belt and glove and crossed your arms as you looked at Mel and Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/50/79/81/507981c20ce318ac5a4591421564ee08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" Mel said. \"You're stunning.

You stared at them in petrified mortification, aghast that anyone but your sister should be made to witness you in your miserable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mel, he's SO cute!\" Janet from across the road coed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get him to do it?\" Sophie queried, trying to stifle her mirth by placing a hand in front of her giggling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you have the little sister you always talked about wanting.\" said Katie the red-head with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a face resembling the rising morning sun, you turned about to make yourself scarce. But as you tried to made a run for it from this excessively humiliating scene, 4 pairs of delicate hands clutched you back. You felt like a sack of feed being frenzied over by a pack of harpies as you were wrestled into your sister's office chair and made to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, little brother. Just where do you think you're going?\" There was an ominous glint in her eyes that foretold grim foreboding. Whatever she had in her mind, it certainly didn't spell good tidings for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?!\" you raged, cherry faced: \"You didn't say anything about anybody seeing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, little brother. You'll be going outside soon enough. A lot of people will be seeing you anyway. I don't see what you're moaning about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't sign up for this!\" you struggled; but it was a forlorn futile exercise as the girls held you down. They were all between 17 and 19 years of age; fully grown and tall as the clouds from your point of view. You on the other hand have yet to even fully start puberty's growth cycle; and as a result was exceedingly tiny for your age group, as well as the smallest in your class. You were petite in structure and androgynous in face, and was bullied for it by your sister for many moons. Often she would mock you about not being a boy; and when you declared red-faced that you were, she would ask for proof in terms of arm hair, something you could not offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you did, little brother. You had agreed to wear anything I chose to the convention if I won our bet. You lost and now its time to collect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it! You can't make me do it! I'll tell mom! Let me go!\" A flash blinded your eyes and made your vision go white. When the blur subsided, you saw your sister in front of her computer uploading something from the digital camera she held in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truimphant smirk crossed Melody's lips: \"Let him go, ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a prisoner having his clamps released from the torturer's table, you jumped up in relief. The other 3 of Melody's friends just laughed at you.<br>\r\n\"Fine then, little brother. Go. I'm not stopping you. There door's right there.\" Melody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh oh. Melody was known never ever to just let something go if she wanted it. You could barely believe she would just let you walk off unscaved after she won a bet. You looked at her in fearful suspicion; wondering what new trick she had up her sleave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before you go, come and take a look.\" she motioned to the screen. You approached with mistrustful trepidation, knowing that bad news was about to befall you. Then you saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you saw yourself, looking quite rediculous being cross-dressed. Worse still was that the unflattering pictures of you were made an attachment to emails, all primed and destined to your best friends' electronic addresses.<br>\r\n\"Go...and I send.\" Melody gloated. The blackmailing witch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glowered at her as you fumed smoke out of your ears; knowing full well to disobey Melody would be social suicide. You'd be the laughing stock of the school till and after you graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekly you begged her: \"Please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you behave now, little brother?\" she asked imperiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you do anything and everything I tell you to for today? And wear whatever I tell you to, when I tell you to?\" Melody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just glared at her with molten fury. Seeing your deviant look, she hovered her finger over the enter key, the same way a suicide-bomber would threaten police about to take him in custody with his finger right over the trigger mechanism.<br>\r\nSweating and knowing full well that Melody was fully capable of actually doing it, you kept yourself humble and swallowed your pride: \"Yes, yes, okay! Just please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody beamed at you, which only made you hate her more. She instructed you to go sit on the office chair, which you complied, albeit ruefully. Then she and her friends huddled together in a group, a secretive circle in which they whispered and giggled delightfully their plans to make your existence a misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only hear things like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cute, but he'll stand out way too much-\" Janet complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've brought my make-up kit. We cab fluff him up!\" Sophie said from the side. 'Fluff him up??? That didn't sound particularly appetising!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about his hair? We need a better wig. That one doesn't cut it. Do think I need to go to the costume store down by the road?\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Idea!\" Melody intoned: \"Make sure its a red one! One the same as Yoko Littner. And get some perma-hair gel and a wig plant. We don't want his hair falling off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another thing.\" Janet interjected: \"What about the bikini top? You didn't think that one entirely through, Mel. It doesn't fit him. Let me get a sport bra or something. They'll think Evan is just a little late bloomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" said Melody with an evil voice: \"I got something you'll all love to help him with his chest!\" She then showed something to the girls. It must have been unique or funny, because they all exploded with snorts, laughter and applauds to Melody. You had the grim suspicion you didn't want to know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that'll work.\" Janet agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like the natives of a tribe that had just finished discussing how they were to cook and eat the captured explorer, they all turned to face the hapless helpless you. You gulped in trepidation and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Eeevaaan...\" Sophie called out to you, the same way someone called out to a pest with pretended harmlessness only with the intent of fumigating it. From behind her back she revealed...</span></div></div>",

You knew exactly what Sophie was holding in her hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn world of action movies it was a particularly legendary Hollywood prop. Since the amount of male stuntmen tended to outnumber their female counterparts by a good ratio of 10 to 1, directors usually found themselves lacking girls to mimic the star heroine of the show. To mend this problem, male stuntmen crossdressed regularly for the roles, often for days on an end to save time for the make-up artists. This saved time in turn reduced production costs. The offside was that the stuntmen had to wear things like permanent wigs and false breast forms glued to their chest, sleeping with it for as much as a week until the specific scene had been successfully shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you recognized them instantly. Squealing, you tried to dart away from Sophie whom was holding the 2 plastic blobs toward you the same way an insane mad-scientist would wield defibrillators ( those machines in hospitals they use to shock people; they look like ironing cuffs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Evan!\" Sophie jubilated as you tried to retreat from her: \"I have some falsies for you!\" The other girls at this point was rolling on the floor as they were overcome with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away, freak!\" you yollered at Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll look great with them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Melody declared an end to all the ruckus: \"Evan, if you don't stay still and do as we say, I'll send those emails!\" she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no. I don't want to! Anything but that!\" you groveled. Melody paid you no mind as she and Sophie dragged you back into the office chair and made you sit. By now you were oozing embarrasment from your crimson face. Perhaps you were too stunned from shame that you did not resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie pulled off your bikini-top and started rubbing something that felt similar to jellyton on your chest, making you cringed.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" you yelled in shock, never having any girl, even your mother touch you there that way before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! You like that?\" Sophie asked.<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" you raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, you didn't notice your sister smacking the breast forms on your well-glue-infused chest until she hammered them there.<br>\r\n\"Congradulations! It's a girl!\" Melody declared, supported by the cheers of her friends. You felt your head would explode like an overheated Thermonetor as the blood of shame rushed to your head making it glow bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to remove the breast forms, but Sophie slapped your hands away.<br>\r\n\"Take it off!\" you shouted shrilly, very much like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep his hands down until they dry.\" Sophie ordered. Katie and Janet pinned down your arms, making all your struggles in vain. Realizing the pointlessness of resistance, you slumped back into the chair. Damn girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He's starting to enjoy it.\" Melody stated jeeringly at your resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate you all!\" you grinded through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and I love you very much, little brother.\" And she flicked your nose, the way she always did after successfully mocking you, as if to drive the point home that you couldn't do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last they released their hold on you; you gasped for air as the pressure on your chest was withdrawn, making you able to use your lungs as normal once again. Then without ceremony, the very first thing you did was to try and rid yourself of the false breasts. <br>\r\nAmidst the ridicules of your sister and her friends you quickly discovered what a hopeless exercise that was.<br>\r\nThe breast forms were well and truly stuck. Whatever supernatural superglue Sophie had used made sure they remained in position, had ensured they were attached as an extension of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize like what a moronic fool you looked - a girl seemingly desperately tugging at her breasts as if to remove them whole - until your sister's and her friend's shouting laughter threatened to blow the roof apart. You glared at them miserably; your blush so intense it could have set candles ablaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was on the floor, clutching her sides as if her intestines were about to fall out from her shaking; she choked on her giggling as she tried to say something: \"He...he...he's a natural. Your little brother is so awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes were river streams as she laughed until she cried: \"Oh he's so cute. I should have taped that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I have it all right here.\" Melody indicated to her digital camera in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we a bit cruel?\" Sophie asked as she approached you with the bikini-top once more. For some reason the point of no return in terms of humiliation had just been breached, and for the first time you didn't so much as put up a fight as she donned the bikini-top over your falsified chests. You just stood there. Meekly and tired from being made to endure that shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Fits well!\" Sophie announced as she tied the bikini string behind your back. The rest of the girls agreed upon this favorably; with compliments of how beautiful you looked which made you scowl at them. For some reason the more you projected in your face how much you disliked the whole damn lot of them, the more they just coed on about how adorable you looked, all very much to your displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait!\" Katie interjected: \"Look closely. He's too pale for them. People will too easily be able to see the difference in skin colour. We need to discolour the lay-lines against his chest. Or they'll see the plastic against his skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Janet said. \"I've got the make-up kit right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, sport.\" Melody pushed you into the office chair for a third time. Janet and Katie took turns to tickle your skin with white brushes as they coloured in your parts that was attached directly behind the breast forms. Then Sophie took some oil and rubbed it onto your back. At this you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?!\" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to make sure you're skin all over your falsies looks the same, so sit still! This is tanning oil. I'm making you a bit less pale on your back. Trust me, you'll look great.\" Sophie said cheerfully. The sound of 'falsies' made you want to strangle someone. Most specifically your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon completion they inspected you. You utterly despised their scrutiny of you, as if you were some kind of play doll; something you suspected they were treating you as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Janet pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Katie asked.</span></div></div>",

The others rejoiced their agreement. <br>\r\nOh dear lord help me! you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was routine by now, they slammed you into the office chair; the same way the FBI would do when they wanted to intimidate a dangerous criminal they were about to interrogate. They didn't need any roughhousing; you were intimidated sufficiently for certain by the ton of narcotics they were busy unpacking on Melody's cabinet in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie tried to smear the pale of lipstick onto your lips, you pulled your face away in disgust and revulsion: \"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way!\" Sophie said: \"Now hold your head still! Fluff up time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go take a long jump off a short cliff!\" You rebuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude!\" she said and tried once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody then grasped your ears in her hands and pulled; You yelped in agony: \"Hold still, little brother. You don't want to be losing your ears. Katie, help me hold his head in position.\"<br>\r\nWith the combined actions of Katie keeping your neck firmly solid and your sister threatening to tear off your ears if you moved, you succumbed to their tyranny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're evil.\" You said to your sister, through clenched teeth and teary eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do this quick way, or the painful way. Now keep your face straight. We're going to make you beautiful.\" Melody said, clearly enjoying exerting power over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And puff up your lips.\" Sophie said; her lipstick hovering above your face in anticipation: \"I can't do anything if you scowl so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agonizing wank of your ears by Melody quickly made you obedient and you complied, although with great reluctance. You could hear Sophie giggling as she began the disfigurement of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start with plucking his eyebrows.\" Janet said, picking up a hideous looking device from the table. A bizarre looking set of tweezers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!! What are you going to do?\" you asked, flabbergasted. Plucking someone's eyebrows sounded so midieval!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then goes your eyelashes, Evan!\" she said enthusiastically: \"Now close those eyes.\" <br>\r\nYou didn't need any prompting. As Janet held the tweezers close to your brow, you squinted, then shut them completely in fear that she was about to poke out your eyeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the process was quite painless. Nothing more than pinching your skin, as Janet removed your threads of hair one by one. It was almost enjoyable, but you sure as the moon wasn't cheese going to show them that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie appeared to be finished with your lips. They felt waxy, as if covered with plastic. Next she used the brush to apply powder to your cheeks, chin and nose.<br>\r\n\"Now to add some colour!\" she hummed cheerfully: \"You have a nice face, Evan, truly. Like you were meant to wear make-up.\"<br>\r\nYou just growled your disagreement; knowing by now that nothing you said would make her any less pleased with dollying you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janet switched her attention from your eyebrows to your eyelashes: \"Now you must keep really, REALLY still, Evan. Unless of course you don't mind losing an eye.\" You took her word for it, as well as her advice and kept deathly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, little brother. You truly are into this sort of thing aren't you? What? You're not even going to deny it? It's okay. We don't mind boys who like to come in touch with their feminine side. Don't worry, your secret is safe with us!\" And she laughed mockingly. The witch!! She chose to taunt you exactly when you didn't dare move or speak; while Janet was busy depleting with your eyelashes with an unpleasantly sharp object; knowing full well that you would have had a sharp immediate comeback. Damn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Janet put down the tweezers; thinking she was done, you started opening your eyes: \"No Evan, keep em closed. I'm not finished yet. Time for some lovely false eyelashes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have eyelashes!\" you said, disgruntled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. I removed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what?\" You asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute when you complain.\" Janet replied, ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm cute when I'm suffering?!\" You asked incredulous and irritated by their continues callous demeanor with which they mistreated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Now be quiet and still.\" she ordered and applied a glue-like substance to the top off your eyelids. Following that immediately before you could ask what she was up to, Janet slapped on held down 2 plastic things on both lids.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you look radiant now, Evan. Eyelash galore for you.\" she giggled. What was it with girls and giggling; they didn't seemed to get enough of it??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done. But keep em closed. They still net to dry in the atmosphere. You're up Sophie.\" Janet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you felt something akin to a fat wet pen or crayon tracing across the contours of your closed eyes: \"Some yellow for flare!\" Sophie said: \"It'll fit well with Yoko's red hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, since I'm done, I think I'll quickly run to the pharmacy to get the permanent wig and gel. I'll just be back in a jiffy\" Janet said.<br>\r\n\"You do that. We'll be right here waiting, won't we Evan?\" Melody said, fondling your hair. You grumbled in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, you then felt Sophie getting busy with a last quash brush directly on your eyelids: \"And last, but not least: some eyeshadow! Ohoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, pressure on your earlobes made you aware that Sophie had placed something feeling like prestic on them: \"Yoko doesn't have earrings, but I thought: oh so cute! He just has to have some clip-on's! What you say, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" Melody said, releasing your red raw ear shells for the first time in minutes; it felt like circulation returning as the blood flowed through them.<br>\r\nYou felt like hairpins were inserted and closed over your ears; luckily whatever they were, they covered a wide area across your earlobes so as not to pinch them too badly in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right sport, you can open. Behold the new you!\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of their consistent giggling you suspected  that they had uglified your miserable face to the point of extreme; that they were going to make you walk the streets looking like a clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes revealed nothing you could have hoped to expect. You gawked at yourself in amazement and mezmeration.<br>\r\nIn short you were...what? Pretty? Idiotic you knew. But the fact remained that your sister and her goofing friends had succeeded in making you appear like an ultra feminine girly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to concentrate to recognize yourself. How so little make-up could change someone so drastically...it was queer and admittedly fantastic. The eyeliner and eyeshadow softened your eyes and the lipstick made your lips very un-male. Your entire face's features had been rearranged to become feminine. The eyelashes was the cherry on the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly your short hair hinted at you being anything other than a girl. Your face actually made the skimpy anime clothes you were wearing suit you!<br>\r\nYou never thought it possible that you could be physically attracted to yourself, yet here you were, eyeing your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister squeezed your shoulders: \"You like it?\" she laughed; there was no fooling her as she had watched you the entire time: \"It's okay for a girl to fall in love with herself.\" You REALLY didn't like the way she referred to you in the female pronoun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Katie stared at you in awe. Obviously they looked as if they had outdone themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say, little brother? We going to the convention now? Nobody's going to recognize you. You're girlier than we are.\" Mel asked. You had to confess; even your mother would not be able to identify you, let alone anyone that knew you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet arrived at that moment with the wig. This was a fairly unique item. It looked real. Professional. The hair was smooth and flowing, not as crass and fake as the one your sister had supplied earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" You asked Melody dejectedly as you saw what they intended to place upon your head.<br>\r\n\"Sit still, or we make you.\" was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then dumped something that felt as eerie and cold as unboiled eggs on your head. The perma-gel. They smeared it into your head nice and good; as if they were folding the dough for a cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this ever come out?\" you asked angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. It'll only last for a day. Eyes straight, thank you.\" Then, like crowning their masterpiece with the final part, the girls lowered the permanent red wig onto your head. You felt like an abducted person about to have a brainscrambler device placed on your head by aliens. <br>\r\nThe whooting and cheering of the girls signified completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie took a pare of scissors and cut misplaced strands of hair away, while also styling your hair to be similar to that of Yoko Littner. Melody added the finishing touch of placing the skull-hairpin to the side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last gander in the mirror revealed that, for all intents and purposes, that You were now Yoko Littner.</span></div></div>",
