After laying for what seems like half an hour, he get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon standing up link notices a slight chill run between his legs. Looking down he notices that the clothing he is wearing is smaller and shorter than he remembers. He estimates that his shorts are a good 3 inches shorter than before. He also notices that his shoes and hat are tighter than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot connecting the dots, link thinks otherwise and assumes its probably due to him eating to much or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down once again at the flower, he gets onto his hands and knees and takes one more whiff of the strange flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he goes to get up...</span></div></div>",

His blood splatter everywhere under link's massive foot. \"Whoops, sorry little bug. But you shouldn't walk in my path\" Link said. Then he thought,\"Hey, that was kind of fun\". He spotted another traveler who was lost and slowly raised his foot over him, then brought it down quick and squished the traveler in no seconds flat.\"Heh heh heh, oops. How clumsy of me. I should really watch where i'm going\" Link joked.\"I can't wait till I get to Ordon, they'll be so fun to squish\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink eventually found Ordon and then walk into the village, crushing their houses with with feet. Link started squishing a few (what he now considers bugs) people of Ordon before he stopped and thought,\"Maybe I should do something more pleasurable since no one can stop me\". Link smirked and then grabbed a few villagers with his left hard and some more with his right. He then held them all to the ground and then began to sit down. He had them all underneath his buttcheeks and near his buttcrack.\"Get ready bugs, because I feel really gassy today\". Link then lets out a massive fart on them.\" Aaaaahh, smells like paradise\". He than starts grinding then underneath his ass and laughs at their gagging and pain. All this power was giving Link a massive hard on.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nLink then grabs a few more villagers and puts them on his erection.He then pushes them in to his piss silt. Link smiled and moaned with pleasure couldn't hold it in any longer. Link let out a massive roar and them spilled his load all over the village and villagers. He then smiled and continued to crush all of villagers with his foot. He then somehow grew a little bit more and was even more happy. He decided to drown any survivors and stood up. He then peed on the entire village, shooting out any dead bugs out of his manhood. Ordon was now covered with nothing but blood, cum, piss and dead bodies. All that remained was one villager. Link put him up his asshole to feel me pleasure later. Link farted on the villager before leaving, laughing at all the destruction he caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better find some more villages, towns or cities to have fun with.\" Link then went to....</span></div></div>",

Especially that whore, Zelda. I don't think I got any sex with her at all for saving her and her kingdom. Well I'll teach them all a painful lesson in respect, and have a lot of fun doing it. I come back for Ordon later.\" Link thought to himself, smiling at the dirty things he had prepared for them. He found a playful kid with bow on his way, who tried to shoot Link's face, hitting every shot. But they did nothing to the now invincible giant Link.\"You little annoying bug! I should squash you for attempting to hurt a god like myself. But i have something better in mind for you.\" Link said smiling shorty after. Link then grabbed the boy and pushed him into his piss silt until only his head stuck out. He felt the boy struggle inside his cock, which gave him a boner. Link moaned a little, and bullied the kid saying,\"Keep it up bug. once your done, I'll squish you under my ass little the insect you are.\" before continuing to Hyrule. Once he reached Hyrule, he stomped on the guards and head out to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Link reached the castle, He decided to kill the princess quick so she can't stop him later and crushed the entire castle under his sole.\" That takes care of that whore.\" Link thought. Link then felt weird as he started glowing. He started to grow so massive that he could flatten the entire place with just his gigantic bubble butt. Link then laughed in a sadistic way as he started having his fun at his new size. He started rampaging and crushed houses and people under his foot, creating fires.\" I know how to put the fire out for you bugs.\" Link grinned as he sat down on the outside of the town, crushing all the animals and trees under him, and made a circle with his legs, surrounding and trapping the citizens. Link then aimed and squeezed his cock and pushed the boy out, making him fall under his balls. Link then pissed on everyone, putting out some of the fires and drowning some people in his piss. Link laughed at the drowned people's lifeless body's and ate them.\"Mmm that tastes so good with their blood mixed in.\" Link boomed with laughter. He then decided to end them all...with his ass. Link found the boy under his balls and pushed back to where he was in his cock, moaning at the pleasure of his screams. He then stood up and turned around, his bubble butt facing the town.\"Goodbye bugs, your hero is now your executioner.\" Link laughed evilly as he looked back as his round ass slowly descends on the town. He gets really hard from their screams of terror and crying. He has the biggest grin on his face as he flatten the town. Link then felt some people still alive in his asshole and decided to gas them to death. He then grinned and farted on the crying survivors, loving all the destruction and torture he caused Hyrule. He then stood up and looked at his little cock slave grinning evilly,\"Time to put you to use and then end you. He then continuing grinning at the frighten boy as he jacked off with him just to see his terror.Link was so mean to the little boy as he told him that he will crush his family next, who were in Ordon, laughing at his misery.\"YEAH. YOU'LL ALL MY BITCH BUGS. I WILL CRUSH ALL OF YOU AND ENJOY EVERY SECOND OF IT.\" He shouted to the whole world. He then Roared with pleasure as he fapped and cummed on the ruined town, drowning all the remaining people, except the little boy. Link found the little boy and stuck him up his asshole, wanting him to see his family die from him. Link sat down on the cum and grind his butt back and forth,feeling all the wet juices touch his perfect ass, and even shoving some cum into his asshole. He licked his lips, imaging the boys terror and got a little bit harder again. Then Link went to.........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link got up and was now keeping true to his word, now heading in the direction of where Ordon was located. On his way there, Link saw something in the distance on top of a big hill. He took a slight detour and went to go check it out. It was a small town with only a few houses. Link grinned and decided to have that small town as a snack. He went up the big hill, which took less than 5 seconds thanks to his new size, and sat down right next to the town. He then started grabbing houses right off the ground. He then threw the houses in his mouth and swallowed them and the people inside in one bite. Link sighed and laid back on top of the hill as he digested his snack and hear muffled screaming coming from inside his stomach. He loved their terror and started to jack off real quick. He grunted and moaned as their screams got louder and couldn't hold it any longer. He blew his load all over his belly. He then took a nap for 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, The mayor of Ordon, being pestered by the villagers of Ordon and being scared himself, hired a wizard to save their town from the mysterious giant that destroyed Hyrule. The tried to find Link to save them but couldn't find the hero anywhere, not knowing he was the one who destroyed Hyrule. The wizard said that he knew no shrinking spells or knew any other wizard that did. He did, however, have a few potions to transport everyone away. But as he reach for them, A mouse came into the room and went into the wizards clothes, caused him to drop a lot of his potions in an attempt to catch to mouse. The potions all had different effects, some of which were strong enough to affect everyone. One potion caused him and the mayor to fall asleep, and another made the village grow bigger in pollution, as house and buildings grew all around the village, making already existing house grew into buildings and people coming out of nowhere, moving into the houses and buildings, transforming it into a very huge city. One potion had a horrible effect on the entire city as it took away the citizens fighting spirit and bravery, causing them to be afraid of anything. Another caused everyone in the city to have amnesia and forget about everything in their lives, now forgetting who Link was and what he did for them and the world. The last potion fell straight onto the wizard and teleported him away from the city, far away into another part of the world. In the end, all the wizard did was make Ordon more vulnerable to Link and made it easier to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink woke up, now finished digesting the small town and having a lot of gas. He wiped the cum off his belly and decided to save that gas for Ordon and got up to continue looking for it. He then remembered the small boy and grinned as he decided to let out a little gas on him by farting on him to wake him up. The boy woke up gagging from the smell around him, wanting this nightmare he's enduring to end but it was all sadly real. Link snickered at him and went to look for Ordon. He continued walking through the forest, crushing any trees, unsuspecting travelers and animals under his bloody foot, loving every second of it, until he stop in amazement at the huge city that was know Ordon. Link looked closely down at the city and saw a few citizens shaking in fear of their own shadows. Links shadow was just barely outside the city, so they didn't notice him yet. Link was astonished and thought to himself,\"How long was I asleep for when I first woke up!?!? I know I dozed off a little then, but not for this long!!!\". He was now confused and wanted an answer before starting his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a person just outside the town gate. He was the only one not affected by the potions because he was outside the city when everything happened, looking at everyone in the city get affect by the potions. Link picked him up carefully and said,\"What happen here old man?!?\". The old man recognized the giant as Link. He then asked first,\"How did you get so big, my boy? And why on earth are you naked?!?\" Link then replied,\"It doesn't matter right now, tell me what happened first\". The old man sighed and said,\"I was just outside of what used to be the village on a hill, coming back from my home city just a little left of here to visit my nephew, when all of a sudden, a light started to envelop the city and out of nowhere, houses, buildings and people start to appear and grow around and in the village, and before I knew it, this old village became a city\". Link hid his smirk realizing the nephew he talked about was the kid now stuck in his asshole as he felt squirming coming from within it. He then continued to listen to the old man.\"Then another light enveloped the now city of Ordon and when it was over, I pulled out a telescope that I always carry and saw a few people in the town running in fear of their own shadows. I also saw some people talking to each with scared faces which made me think that everyone now has amnesia. I just hope my family is alright.\" the old man finished. Link pondered and thought that if the whole city has amnesia, they can't remember who he was, and now that their scared of everything, he couldn't wait to start his fun and see their reactions to his massive size. Link then grinned and said,\"Do you want to see your nephew real bad?\" The old man nodded his head. Link then said,\"Ok bug\" right before he put the old man down and sat down on top of him. The old man closed his eyes and covered his eyes in fear. When he opened them, he was directly in front of Link's cum-filled asshole. He saw in horror inside of it, his nephew crying in agony. He was too shocked in fear to move now that he saw that. Then Link got up and raised his bloody foot over the old man. The old man said in fear,\"What happen to you Link?!?\". Link chuckled and said in a mean way,\"What can I say? All I did was get rid of a few bugs. And now, I see one more that needs to disappear\". Link then brought his foot down on the old man and felt a slight crunch under it. He grinned, licked his lips and tried hard not the laugh at the boys cries coming from his asshole, as he cried louder at the death of his uncle, knowing that he couldn't save him or his family from this merciless giant. Link then........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was grinning as he raised his right foot over a few citizens in the city, who were cowering in fear of their shadows until they saw an enormous shadow cover them. They looked up in total fear of what made this shadow and saw Links blood-stained foot, his massive cock, sack and his buttcrack, and just beyond that was his evil smile as Link was looking straight down at them, licking his lips, thinking of the amount of terror he just filled them all with and was imaging all the pleasure he'd get out of this city. Then the citizens screamed in terror at the giant, too scared to move, as Link brought down his right foot slowly on the people below to soak in their fear and pleas for mercy before squishing them into a gooey mess under him. He was grinding his foot into the ground and laughed evilly doing so. Link continued down the road, crushing people and buildings under his two feet and rubbing his erection, laughing and not showing a shred of mercy for them. Every time he took another step, whatever was left of the dead bodies and pieces of destroyed buildings would fall off his foot and land onto the streets below. Link then stopped and saw a house that was untouched somehow by the potions effects. The mother and father inside was not scared of what was happening outside. They were too busy worrying about their boy who hasn't came back from the forest and their brother who hadn't showed up yet. Meanwhile, the kids brother was freaking out from looking out the window to see the new city being destroyed by a naked giant. Link wondered and reached inside his asshole with his finger and pulled the boy out. He held him in one hand and then asked him,\"Is this your family bug?\", and the boy gasped in shock and fear to find out that Link found the boys family. Link saw his face and said,\"Ah so it is your family. Time to keep true to my word brat.\" as he used his other hand to tear off the roof and grab the people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family was shocked in fear in his hand and asked Link why he was giant and naked and what he wanted to do with them. Then then look at Links other hand and saw their boy crying. The father, in a fit of rage shouted to the blonde hair giant,\"LINK!!!! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SON!?!!?\" Link squeezed the father tight and yelled back in anger,\"DON'T YELL AT ME FOR YOUR SON'S STUPIDITY! HE TRIED TO SHOOT MY FACE WITH HIS BOW AND ARROWS.\" before calming down a bit. The family asked their son if that was true and he nodded his head in shame. The father asked why he thought shooting a giant that was the \"Hero of Hyrule\" was a good idea. The boy didn't have any responds as he knew this was all his fault. The father then said,\" That's still no reason to scar my son and torture him. And what happen to my brother?\", as Link could care less for his scolding. He did answer his question however.\"Oh him? Why don't you look down my feet\". Link showed his bloody foot to the family and they all coward in fear. Link smiled and said,\"I put along with the rest of the bugs I squished on my way here. Maybe you should join them too, bug\". The father was struggling in anger, wanting to punch Link's face, while the mother and other kid cried for the poor old family member. Link laughed and said,\"Hope you liked seeing what's left of your family together again, because it's the last family reunion you'll ever get!\". Link then raised his hand over his mouth and loosened his grip, dropping the father into it and eating whole in one swallow. Link sighed and said he tasted great. The family was crying for the father before Link took the other son off one hand and into the other. He then brought the mother to his cock and pushed her into his slit, moaning at the pleasure he felt doing it. Both children cried out,\"Mama!!! NOOO!!!!\", as she was falling down into Link's cum sack. Now both parents was dissolving inside Link. One would come out as Link's waste and the other would come out as his seed. Both boys begged for Link to stop but Link ignored them and shove them up his asshole.\"Don't worry brats. You still be alive...for the next few minutes or hours before I trash this city and then disposed of you.\", Link said laughing cruelly. Link then crushed the house under his cock and moaned. He then got up and continued his fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink rampaged and destroyed half the city in half an hour. Mostly because he teased the people he crushed by walking slowly to make them think the have a chance to escape. But no one escaped his two feet and they all got crushed under it. Link then want to crush everyone under his massive bubble butt. Luckily for him, the spell from earlier now gave him side effects so now Link could change his size any time he wanted to. Link shrunk down to 100 feet and start walking up to buildings and sitting down on top of them as they crumbled under his weight, killing everyone inside. He kept buttcrushing everything, laughing sadistically at everyone, until he saw a ton of people running to the destroyed part of the city, in an attempt to leave the city. Link then grinned and grew himself to 400 feet tall. He took one step and blocked the only exit out of Ordon with his foot. He then turned around and grinned, looking down at the citizens under him as his ass fell down on top of them. He felt some of them squirm under his ass and heard screams of panic, and he thought,\"If they're this sacred now, I can't wait for the reactions when I share my gas with them\". Link licked his lips and snicked down at them before he let out a massive fart on them. Link sighed in pleasure as people were crying in agony and holding their breath as he continued to fart. The boys inside had it much worse since the smell would be trapped inside when he finished. When it stopped, he felt some people trying to crawl under his ass to escape but it was all in vain. Link began to grind his ass into the ground hard and crushed anyone under it into blood stains.\"Nice try bugs, but it's useless to escape me. Oh. I feel some more.\" Link said with a grin. He then laughed as he let a few more massive long farts on everyone, as it torture their noses and some of them ran out of air and passed out. Link got really hard from their suffering and wanted to jack off now. He got up for a minute and scooped up everyone, before sitting down again. He put everyone into his slit until only their heads stuck out. He then licked his lips and grinned down at them and then started to pump his cock up and down. He farted on the kids a little more to hear their screams mix in with the other people in his cock.\"OH Yeah...yeah...keep struggling and..screaming bugs.....it'll make this...feel...all the more better....oh....oh fuck..fuck.\" Link moaned as he was ready to explode.\"OH FUCK YEAH\" Link roared in pleasure as he threw his head back and cum and people shot out of his cock and rained down into the whole city and across Links face, belly, sack, legs and foot. Link then panted and rested a bit before farting out the kids and standing up. He bent down and looked under and behind him to see the kids barely alive from the lack of air. The looked and at the grinning giant as he cruelly said,\"Goodbye, you worthless pathetic pieces of shit.\", as Link brought his ass down and squished both boys under his two asscheeks. Link cummed a bit more before he shitted on the bloody remains. He then laughed and grew to 5000 feet. Link's head was touching the clouds as he grinned and finished off Ordon and the forest. He started to piss on everything and drowned anyone or any animal that was left in Ordon and the forest. When link finished, he smiled at his work and started to stomp through the piss and move to the next place to destroy. He decided he would stay that height until he reached another city,village,town,etc. He was grinning and smiling all the way.</span></div></div>",
