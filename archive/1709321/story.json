Everyone he knew was boring and acted caustic towards him. He also lived near the sea, and everyday dreamt of going out in the family boat and leaving forever. In fact, for quite some time he had been planning this. After a while of accumulating supplies (it took a quarter of a year) he was ready to go. He headed down to the docks in the early morning one day and glanced out to the sea. It was the only place for him; the was something inside him that couldn't stop him from going to the grand ocean. He looked back at the neighborhood in the distance: his family and childhood. He didn't regret leaving them (sadly, he failed to understand that they deeply loved him). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed aboard the small sail-boat and cut the rope loose. He could sail better than his boring dad, so in no time, he was far from the docks, with the morning breeze in his hair. He had decided to go...</span></div></div>",

The water was unnaturally, beyond-tropical warm. It must have been because the cove trapped in a great deal of heat from the day. Nonetheless, John could not wait. He jumped in, and rose up. It was like swimming in a giant bathtub. Josh swam and splashed around, trying to entertain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not notice the thing swimming around his boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour, John was ready to go back into the boat. He was perfectly ready for a good nights sleep. But Jen came to mind again. He remembered it all. She said she wanted to leave her normal, boring parents with her brother. They left one morning, and their boat was found, empty, in open oceans. A tear rolled down John's cheek. Why did it have to happen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question was the same reason John had left. It wasn't because of his boring life. He had come in search of Jen. Jen had always said she was leaving home to find the beautiful mermaids and the mysterious octogirls (she swore they were real). And John did, too. Now he had to find either a mermaid or a octogirl (it was a really outlandish idea) to find out what had happened to Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interupted by a nearby splash. He looked around. Nothing. John was starting to feel hopeless. There were no such things that Jen often talked about. She was probably just joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother splash, this time followed by a giggle. Right behind him. He turned once more. Again, nothing. Something brushed against his toes! He looked down to see a inky figure swimming around only 20 feet down. Could it be? It resembled the mermaid Jen had talked about. The mermaid rose to the surface again, and this time, she stayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long blond hair that hung down to her tail. Her naked body had not a single imperfection. She appeared to have the body of a 20-year-old female, except for her lower body, why was a purple scaled mermaid tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, who are you\" she said in a friendly voice.<br>\r\nJohn was to surprised to speak. He let out an odd grunt.<br>\r\n\"Hehe. You're funny! Do you want to be my friend?\" she giggled.<br>\r\nJohn couldn't talk. He was petrified.<br>\r\n\"So do you wanna play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn froze. He recalled what Jen said about mermaids. If they wanted to play or be your friend, you get out of there. Why? You're about to find out.<br>\r\nJohn couldn't respond in time. The mermaid grabbed him and pulled him beneath the surface.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He struggled and struggled, but he couldn't break free from her grip. She suddenly stopped moving. Her lips met Johns and he felt something odd. His lungs were tingling inside his chest. He struggled more, but his attempts were futile. She moved her face away from his. <br>\r\n\"It's already happening. It always starts with the 'mermaid's kiss'\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found that he could breath freely in the water. The mermaid swam around him, giggling. Suddenly, another mermaid appeared, and another. They were all swimming around John. That's when they started singing.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, no! I should have never come here!\" he thought.<br>\r\nThe song was oddly beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn tried to swim away one last time, but the song was too beautiful. He couldn't force himself to leave. The fish girls ripped off Johns swim trunks. The mysterious song started coming out of John's lungs. His voice was of theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn started feeling different after he begun singing along. His legs felt like they were covered in sand or pebbles. He looked down upon them to see his skin turning into skin-colored scales. His feet felt a sudden achy pain as they flattened and lost all bone mass. His upper body was also changing. His breasts were now that of a preteen girl, slightly raised. He continued to sing along. His legs were not very recognizable: they were fully covered in tight scales. He felt his male organ get covered over by the tight scales, which had formed a v-shape around his hips. He could no longer feel it, and it tightened into a vagina. His hair was significantly lengthening. It was also becoming a bluish color. His breasts were now the size of a fully developed women's. He was singing louder, more forcefully. The scaly skin was stretching across the space between his legs and tightening. It was also turning green. His feet were now fused into one green mermaid flipper. His legs pushed against each other and became a mermaid tail. Biologically speaking, John was no longer male. She looked upon herself as she stopped singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large breasts. Her tail. The large hips. The long blue hair. It shocked her. She looked at the other mermaids. There was something inside her that liked this picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, she was not feeling very normal right now. She was definitely torn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked \"What now?\" Her voice shocked herself.<br>\r\nThe mermaids...</span></div></div>",

I'm really overwhelmed right now. What do you expect\" John replied in her smooth, feminine voice.<br>\r\nShe looked at her body. Put her hand on her hypes. She was trying to get used to it, but she yearned to change back.<br>\r\n\"It's ok. You're new life will be so much better. Eternal life in a young, beautiful body. No one could ask for more\" The mermaid responded.<br>\r\n\"I just want to be back to normal. I want to be who I used to be. After all, I don't know how to be a mermaid.\" John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaids looked at one another.<br>\r\n\"I know! He needs the 'final gift' from us.\" a mermaid with a red tail a flowing brown hair said.<br>\r\n\"The final gift?\" John did not recall Jen talking about this. In fact, she wished this was all just a dream, that he would have never swam here. But it was real. She whipped her tail about, pondering what was about to happen.<br>\r\nThe mermaids swam towards John. She noticed they were holding one of the golden neck rings they all currently had around their necks.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with that?!\" John cried, her voice was worried sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made quick work of getting the neck ring around John's neck. It suddenly tightened and became irremovable. John attempted to pull it off,but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my name again?\" John thought, dazed.<br>\r\nShe couldn't remember. She looked at herself. Her body. She was beginning to really like it's feel. The flipper was so wonderful compared to her old, clumsy legs. And her feminine shape was so great. The long hair billowing from her head was beautiful. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to love being in this cove, where my sisters will always love me.\" she said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neck ring had decided Johns thoughts, and she was now a full mermaid. <br>\r\n\"I'm Meridia. And I love my new life.\" she giggled happily. <br>\r\n\"It's so good to see you finally understand\" the red tailed mermaid replied \"you do understand we're at war with the octogirls, with their leader Jen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeridia froze. <br>\r\n\"Who\" she said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Jen.

There were living areas, much larger then his own.  Sea crystals of indescribable beauty grew in the special gardens, pearls were being brought in from other tunnels by other mermaids.

Different parts of the map were colored differently, John later learned that these designated different mermaid clans, areas controlled by their allies dolphins and whales, their rivals the octogirls and their jellyfish allies, the areas controlled by sharks, who act as bandits and raiders.  <br>\r\nThe copper colored mermaid, who's name was Calista, asked where the empty boat had been found.<br>\r\n\"Exactly fourty-eight miles north east of Midway island.\" he said.

But she doubted she ever have the gold to buy one if she lived to be a hundred. On the opposite side of the tent was a round table with the ever famous crystal ball. Behind the table was another entrance to the tent, through which Kirsten could see Aleta's wagon and Aleta herself as she fed her horses. Travelers said Aleta was old but beautiful, but at this point all Kirsten could see was that she was indeed beautiful; her long raven black hair shone in the sunlight, her body was toned and lithe, her skin was smooth and tanned by her life on the move. But it was when Aleta came into the tent that Kirsten saw why everyone said Aleta was old. There were no wrinkles of age on her face, but her deep blue eyes bespoke wisdom one only obtains through great age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome my dear. Have you come seeking an item of mystical importance, or to see what may be in thy future?\" Aleta asked with her melodic yet mystic voice.</span></div></div>",

The amulet was made of a strange blue metal; set into it was an exquisitely carved green gem in the shape of a figure Kirsten knew very well. It was Aquaria; the queen of the sea, a half woman half octopus being that lived and ruled beneath the surface of the sea. Kirsten knew the tales like any other person from a seaside village, and she only knew what an octopus was because the occasional fisherman from the south would bring one of the strange sea creatures with him to the market. Many sailors wore trinkets or tattoos of Aquaria to sway her favor, to grant them calm seas and steady winds and to protect them from the monsters of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten screamed when something yanked her backwards. \"Careful there miss, seawater ain't the best for bathing in.\" The burly sailor who grabbed her collar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten then realized she had been so engrossed in the tales of Aquaria going through her mind she nearly walked off the dock. \"Oh, thank you sir. I had my mind elsewhere.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem miss, g'day to you.\" The sailor said tipping his cap before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten shook her head at how foolish she had been and put the amulet on around her neck and tucked it beneath her dress, as most sailors had far less ornate medallions and may try to steal hers if they saw it. With her belongings already aboard the ship, and her amulet safely hidden Kirsten boarded the ship herself.</span></div></div>",

No one on the ship knew where it had come from; it seemed to come suddenly from nowhere. But that didn't matter much now; the only thing on peoples' minds was surviving the onslaught of icy rain and lightning. Kirsten was trying to find her way around in the dark brought on by the storm when a bolt of lightning struck the ship. Within a moment the sails were ablaze, the fire inextinguishable by the rain. Kirsten stumbled backward in fright, only realizing the railing that once ringed the ship was no longer there. With a terrified scream she fell from the ship and hit the water, and then all went black, save for a blue-green glow from her amulet.</span></div></div>",

She glanced around, not that far away was an opening leading out to a beautiful vista of the sea and sky meaning it was day and she was in a cave. With her surroundings identified, Kirsten looked at herself to see if she had been wounded, and gasped again at what she saw. Her dress was gone, as was any clothing she had on, but that paled to what else she saw. Her legs were gone, but in their place was the body and tentacles of an octopus. Kirsten tentatively reached out with her hand and touched one of the tentacles, and felt the touch. Her other hand jumped up to her neck and she felt the amulet Aleta gave her, warm against her bare skin. She grasped the amulet and pulled it to where she could see it better. \"Did this amulet do this to me? Did I die and it brought me back like this?\" Kirsten wondered aloud.</span></div></div>",

With nothing better to do, Kirsten dove into the water and swam out of the cave.

She made the mistake of spreading her legs to sit, which irritated her changed privates. \"I didn't think my girly bits had survived the transition. I'll have to explore them later,\" she said, losing her attention on the statue to rearranging her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wait until later?\" the statue asked in a still-stony voice, which startled the young woman. \"You humans are always saying there's no time like the present.

She swished her tentacles together, and zoomed over to sit near Kirsten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten turned red as the coral she was sitting on, \"I guess I am embarrassed. I mean, I was taught that we were to share those parts with nobody. It took me forever to think of a window on a ship as a bathroom, instead of a bucket in the smallest closet I could find.

Aleta didn't really come to her senses until her tentacles had finished sliding the diver into her second mouth, she looked down at her distended stomach where she could see ripples as the still living diver struggled inside her.

I was one of the few to survive the shipwreck, and even now I know I may never make it back to land...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, little one.

My physiology is not even that well adapted to digesting your kind. You'll be well protected in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safer inside you than out?

The reality of the situation begged to differ, and yet... and yet, well, Maria had remained alive in here this long, hadn't she? Not knowing, yet - somehow - trusting, Maria placed her hand against the wall where Rena's lay. The mermaid reacted to the touch with a formless noise of agreement, but somehow Maria understood that she meant much more than she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now as I said, human. Get some rest.

Her species wasn't generally aggressive toward human, but they would eat some of them on occasion. Alena, on the other hand, was strictly against eating humans. There were plenty of other octogirls who shared her views, and many of them were friends with humans. Alena had never met a human herself, but she was always hoping that she could one day become friends with one of them. Little did she know, that day would be today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alena was swimming through the lake and catching fish with her tentacles to eat later, she heard a splash from above her. She looked up to see what looked like a human flailing wildly to keep from drowning. Alena couldn't just let this poor human drown, so she quickly swam into action. She positioned herself so that her head was directly under the human, and began to swim upward. The drowning human was shocked to feel a small island rising out of the water below them. Looking down, they realized quickly that this wasn't an island; it was a giant head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Alena used one of her tentacles to lift the tiny human off of her head and place them in the palm of her hand. As she examined it closer, she realized that the human was a young woman. The woman simply stared up at the colossal octogirl that had just saved her life, not knowing what to say. Just then, Alena made the first comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, little human? You're not hurt, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, the woman responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no I'm not hurt... Thank you very much for saving my life Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was no problem at all! I couldn't just let you drown, could I? By the way, my name is Alena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Alena, my name is Trisha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Trisha, how did you wind up all the way out her in the middle of my lake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>your</i> lake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, essentially yes. I'm the only sentient lifeform living in it, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you do have a point... As for how I got here, it's a long story... You see, I was out tending my garden earlier... And right out of nowhere, this giant bird grabs me and carries me away! I managed to struggle free, but I think you know what happened afterward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that must have been tough... So you don't know how to swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know how? Heck! I've never had a body of water big enough to even<i> try </i>swimming in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Well, would you like me to teach you? My home is in a small cove not too far away from here. The water there should be shallow enough to use for swimming practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd rally teach me how to swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Trisha!
