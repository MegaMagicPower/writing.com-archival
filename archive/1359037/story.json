As per usual, they had eaten at a fast food restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru,\" a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru stopped. \"Sai?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai materialized behind him. \"Hikaru, maybe next time you should suggest a different place to eat to your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru blinked. \"Huh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that fast food you're eating is starting to affect your body.\" Sai emphasized his point by poking Hikaru's stomach with his fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru flushed. \"S-sai! Cut that out!\" He covered his stomach with his arms. Sai was right, however. It was difficult to see, but Hikaru's stomach had grown a little rounder, a little bigger, owing to the amount of fast food he had been eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru rolled his eyes. \"Sai, I'll eat what I want, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai shook his head, sighing. \"Fine, fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in frustration, Hikaru continued walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he stopped short when he saw a ramen shop with a sign reading, \"Ramen eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru grinned. \"Wow!\" He started running towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai waved his arms frantically. \"H-hikaru, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill running, Hikaru smiled. \"It's okay, Sai. I'll still be able to make the train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I...\" Sai began. He shook his head. \"Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hikaru got reached the ramen shop, he saw a price list. \"Huh? What's this?\" he asked the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, those are the different contests,\" the clerk told him. \"There are twenty-minute, 30-minute, and 50-minute eating contests. The prizes for winning one are several weeks of free ramen, depending on the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Hikaru asked, excited. He liked fast food, but he liked Ramen even more. \"All right, sign me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich contest does Hikaru register for?</span></div></div>",

There was a single table and a chair waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Hikaru turned to his guide. \"Where are the other contestants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, the guide pointed to a chart on the wall. There was a list of names on the chart, each with a number next to them. The guide spoke. \"The way we do it here is, you pay for a contest, and, if you eat more than the person at the top,\" he gestured to the chart, \"you win 2 weeks of free ramen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's face lit up. \"When do I start?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide smiled. \"Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led Hikaru to his seat, then walked out, only to return with a tray filled with at least ten very large bowls of ramen before leaving again. Hikaru prepared to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sai appeared behind Hikaru. \"Hikaru, I don't think this is a good idea. What if you get sick from eating all that ramen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru laughed. \"Don't worry, Sai. I can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting anymore time, Hikaru dug in. Within five minutes, Hikaru had cleared out at least half of the bowls. His stomach had swelled considerably, pressing against his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of this, Hikaru prepared to dig into another bowl when he suddenly groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru! Are you alright?\" Sai asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly ignoring Sai, Hikaru bent down and hurriedly undid his pants button and zipper, causing his stomach to bulge out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" Hikaru sighed in relief. Without further ado, he began tucking into the remaining ramen, even while the guide brought in more ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More ramen?\" Hikaru stared happily at the bowls. \"I love this contest!\"</span></div></div>",

He'd managed an additional six bowls before his stomach just couldn't take any more, and he now concentrated on rubbing his belly, attempting to soothe the uncomfortable tightness he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach had bloated to a few inches in front of his body, briefly reminding Hikaru of the cartoons he would sometimes watch. His pants felt uncomfortably tight, even though they were undone. His shirt, unable to fully contain his stuffed belly, had ridden up, exposing his stomach and navel (much to his embarrasment) for the whole world to see.  All in all, he was quite a sight to see, shirt up, stomach bloated, and rubbing his stomach, which produced a pleasurable feeling that Hikaru couldn't help but give a sigh of contentment at, even as he groaned in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, Hikaru staggered up out of his chair, and slowly made his way to the door, pushing his way out. Once outside, he tried pulling his shirt down over his belly, but every time he brought it down, it just sprung back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru groaned in frustration, continuing to rub his belly. Sai materialized behind Hikaru, but seeing that he wasn't exactly in the mood for talking, the ancient Go master simply stared reproachfully at Hikaru's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Sai, Hikaru stumbled along the sidewalk, drawing shocked looks from passerby. He didn't pay attention to them. Eventually, he came across a bench. Sighing in relief, he collapsed down onto it, running his hands up and down his stomach and smiling in contentment. Before long, he found his eyelids growing heavy, and he fell asleep- completely forgetting that he was supposed to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

A thin line of drool trailed from the side of his mouth, which he quickly wiped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched his arms in a yawn, then leaned back and sighed, massaging the bloated mass that was now his stomach. His stomach was still swollen, but it no longer hurt. Hikaru smiled, rubbing his belly with both hands, letting the cool night air flow over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's eyes shot open. \"What?!\" He looked about frantically; it was dusk. \"S-Sai! How long was I out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's companion appeared beside him. \"A few hours, I think. Your gorging must have tired you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru yelled in surprise. \"Why didn't you wake me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai shook his head. \"Believe me, I tried...\" he began, beginning to poke Hikaru's exposed belly with his fan, eliciting a deep blush from the boy. \"But it would appear that you are a rather heavy sleeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru smacked a hand to his forehead. \"Aw, man, this can't be happening...\" He groaned. He looked up at the sky. \"I'm going to get in so much trouble for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's self-pitying tirade was interrupted by a growling noise: Hikaru's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound caused both Hikaru and Sai to jump. \"You're already hungry again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru laughed nervously, scratching a cheek with a finger. \"Well, it has been a while...\" He looked up at Sai. \"I'll probably get home late anyway, so...\" Hikaru turned his head. \"Let's go. I know this burger place that's open all day.\" Before Sai could protest, he began walking off. As he did so, he re-buttoned and re-zipped his pants, and pulled his shirt as far down as it would go over his belly. However, a fair amount of skin, about up to his belly button, still showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai re-materialized next to him. \"Hikaru, why are you trying to fix your clothes up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru shrugged. \"Well, if I walk around with my pants open and my belly sticking out, I'd look kind of weird, wouldn't I?\" He laughed, then clutched his belly in pain; his shorts were uncomfortably tight. He got over it quickly, though, and continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes...</span></div></div>",

That's three more than the previous winner. You, my dear lad, have won this contest!\" exclaimed the guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to Hikaru, he gave him a pat on the back before reaching into his own pockets and pulling out a laminated card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your reward. This card will allow you to have as much ramen as you want for the next two weeks. Just make sure to show us the card when you come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru just nodded, unable to talk much do to his fully stuffed stomach. As it was, he was currently in his seat, shirt up and pants unbuttoned, rubbing his gut in an attempt to help him digest and therefore, relieve some of the discomfort he was feeling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting just to go home and get some rest, he quickly took the card, and then proceeded to stumble out of the restaurant in a food-induced haze. Making his way to the train station, he thought of all the ramen he was going to have for the next few weeks as he sat down on a chair, waiting for his train to arrive.</span></div></div>",

Alright! New record!\" He laughed, patting his stomach. \"Playing Go isn't the only thing I'm great at!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed!\" The chef walked out of the kitchen, throwing an approving glance at the bowls stacked on the table. \"You certainly have quite the stomach, my boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru turned his head to look at the man. \"Thanks!\" He burped suddenly, and his hand flew to his mouth. \"Excuse me... Yeah, the ramen here's really good! Not to mention...\" he looked down at his stomach, a thoughtful look on his face. \"It's actually sorta fun, watching my stomach get like this.\" The chef followed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it had been that first day, Hikaru's stomach had been stuffed to its limit; it now had a decidedly round appearance, as opposed to the fairly flat state it had been in when he'd come in earlier that day. His shirt had pulled up a good distance over his stomach, exposing the stretched skin, as well as resting a good several inches above his navel. His shorts, similarly, had been unbuttoned midway through his session; as a result, his stomach had pushed out a bit more, taking full advantage of the breathing room. In addition, his zipper had been slowly forced down by the growing stomach, and was now completely undone. This, Hikaru noticed with a flush of embarrassment, had resulted in the bright white cloth of his briefs peeking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef chuckled. \"I'm glad you feel that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru glanced up at the man, confused. \"Mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm thinking about trying out some new varieties of ramen, and I'd like YOU to be my taste tester. You get to try some delicious new noodles, AND you still get to take advantage of the rest of your free ramen time.\" The man smiled. \"What do you say, lad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru thought it over for a minute, stroking his exposed belly.

You know there is such a thing as too much ramen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sai. I don't think I can ever have too much ramen!\" was Hikaru's simple response. Sai was only somewhat quelled by that response, but he knew that he would be unable to convince Hikaru otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, as Hikaru slept on the train home, he dreamed of his new job, eating tons of ramen to his delight. His dreams would soon some true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Hikaru arrived at the ramen shop, and the chef eagerly walked up to him. \"Good! My new taste tester is here! Are you ready to start?\" Hikaru nodded eagerly, and the chef beckoned him into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have quite a few varieties for you to try. I'll give you a sample bowl, and you tell me your thoughts. Unfortunately, because it is a test pot, I can't sell it to my customers, so you'll have to finish all of it yourself.\" Hikaru only seemed to get more excited by this as the chef picked up a pot of ramen, carrying it with him as he took Hikaru back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the actual restaurant part, there was a table with a chair reserved, with a sign saying \"Taste Tester\" on the table. The chef motioned for Hikaru to sit down, and he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the first sample: Sausage Ramen.\" The chef declared as he placed the large pot of ramen onto the table. He then got a bowl and chopsticks, as well as a ladle, and told Hikaru to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru took the cue, and he ladled himself some noodles and broth. He took a taste, and it was amazing. Hikaru dug in at a much faster pace, managing to say, \"It's fantastic!\" before slurping up noodles with excitement. Soon he had finished the bowl, and the chef watched, awestruck, as he pulled the entire pot over to himself, and began pulling noodles out with his chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate with gusto, his stomach beginning to distend yet again after a while.</span></div></div>",

Just like with go for you.\" Hikaru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hikaru's statement was a bit off. Even if he hadn't noticed it, it seemed like he had indeed eaten too much ramen, and it showed. Hikaru's body had plumped up; he had developed a pair of chubby cheeks and a slight double chin. His arms had the little definition they had and were now thicker and jiggly, and so were his legs, which now sported a pair of thick thighs. His chest had become soft and pudgy, not boy boobs yet, by quite a bit, but it was there. His belly was now round and jiggly, chubby enough for it to poke from under his now somewhat tight t-shirt. His pants weren't doing much better, at they dug deeply into his belly and were strained by his plump rear, which jiggled whenever his walking turned into a jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru was somehow blissfully unaware of this fact, but Sai wasn't, and  he didn't know how to tell Hikaru. One thing was saying he had put on a couple of pounds, and another was telling him he was about to become more than chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Sai, the ramen awaits us!\" And with that, Hikaru headed towards the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

They could be poisoned, for all we know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru grinned. \"Don't worry, Sai,\" he thought back. \"He said they didn't want to hurt me, and I AM kind of hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai sighed and shrugged, before vanishing. He cared greatly for Hikaru, but he could be so reckless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru smiled as the servers approached him. However, he suddenly realized something. \"Wait a minute,\" he began, \"how can I eat with my hands tied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this,\" one of the men replied, before shoving a burger into Hikaru's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru gagged for a second, but when he realized the burger wasn't being shoved any further, he began chewing. As he ate small portions, the server pushed the burger further into his mouth, and Hikaru repeated it until the entire burger was gone. Afterwards, the server took out another burger, and Hikaru did what he did before. This was repeated a few times before Hikaru's waist began to get tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Hikaru held out his hand. \"I'm starting to get full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in understanding, one of the men held out another burger. \"Eat this,\" he told Hikaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust us,\" the man said. Hikaru, still a little unsure, nodded his head, and ate the burger as before. He was shocked to find that, after finishing it, he felt hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll tell you later,\" the man assured him. \"For now, eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving an unsure smile, Hikaru allowed himself to be fed more triple cheeseburgers. After ten of these treats, Hikaru's stomach had grown, pressing against his shorts uncomfortably. He winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, one of the servers noticed this. He set his tray down, walked over to Hikaru, and bent down, and, to Hikaru's shock, unbuttoned and unzipped Hikaru's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru sighed in relief as his gut bulged out, no longer constrained by the undone shorts. His stomach was peeking out ever so slightly, which Hikaru noticed with slight amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, that wasn't enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want next, Shindo-kun?\" one of the servers asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat food is Hikaru served next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These burgers were pretty good, and the servers were being surprisingly polite. He definitely wouldn't mind spending some more time here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more, it was surprisingly fun watching his stomach. As time drew on and Hikaru ate burger after burger, it began to grow, slowly but surely. Every time it increased in size, a little bit more of his stomach peeked out. His shirt continued moving further up his swelling belly until, about an hour later, it rested nearly on top of his now-bloated stomach, several inches away from his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru stared at his belly, startled but somewhat amazed. Had he really eaten that much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, he got another suprise: one of the servers came forward, crouched in front of Hikaru, and placed both hands on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" Hikaru's question quickly became a startled yelp as the man began moving his hands, rubbing the bloated appendage's exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man carried on, Hikaru's shock quickly became contentment; that felt REALLY good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing happily, he settled back and closed his eyes, allowing his belly-massage to continue. He could get used to this...</span></div></div>",

Soon another server was taking the slices and directing them into Hikaru's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tasted the pizza, finding it to be easily the most fantastic pizza he had eaten. He eagerly took more bites out of the pizza, enjoying the flavor, oblivious to the slow rising of his shirt to make room for his slowly distending stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one of the pizzas, Hikaru's shirt had risen up almost to his navel. Another pizza pushed his shirt about an inch above his navel, which now saw the light of day. Hikaru still remained oblivious as he downed even more pizza with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai couldn't even get Hikaru's attention, so he was forced to wait until Hikaru was out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Hikaru finished his third pizza, his shirt was nearly to the top of his unnaturally distended stomach. At this point in the feeding, another server began to gently rub his belly, causing him to relax as he gratefully accepted more food from his captors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the man running the operation was back in the room to check on Hikaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that these subjects would be eager, but I never expected this!\" He exclaimed, satisfied with the progress he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then talked to Hikaru directly, \"You've behaved quite well! I think I'll give you a little reward!\"</span></div></div>",

Uncapping one of the bottles of soda, they motioned for Hikaru to open his mouth. As Hikaru did so, the servers placed the opening inside his mouth, and tilted the bottle slightly upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru smiled as the sugary liquid was poured down  his throat, being careful to  keep on swallowing to keep from choking. In a few minutes, the bottle was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like more, Shindo-kun?\" the white-haired man asked. Hikaru nodded eagerly, and more servers came forward, each bearing bottles of soda. One by one, they emptied them into Hikaru's eager mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fifth bottle, Hikaru's stomach had swelled out a little bit from all the liquid. Hikaru noticed this and briefly winced, but quickly forgot about it as another server began pouring another bottle down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen minutes later, as the 30th and final bottle was emptied into Hikaru's gullet, the servers stepped back. Hikaru groaned, his liquid-engorged belly now enlarged enough to be exerting considerable force against his shorts. It was evident that it couldn't stay like that forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Hikaru's pants button blew out, letting the rest of his pants undo themselves and allow his belly to surge outwards. Unable to contain the engorged mass, Hikaru's shirt slid upwards before coming to rest just on top of his stomach. This caused Hikaru's gut to expose itself completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his swollen belly. Hikaru frowned. \"Ah, man. I liked those shorts...\" Just then, Hikaru felt something in his stomach, all of the carbonation starting to affect him. Suddenly, he let out a great belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Hikaru leaned back in the chair, panting. As he sat there, one of the servers came forward and rubbed his exposed belly. Hikaru sighed happily at the soothing sensation. It wasn't long before he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later...</span></div></div>",

He looked down at his belly; the carbonation had gone down, and his stomach was once again concealed within his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru, are you alright?\" Sai asked, worriedly leaning over the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Hikaru laughed reassuringly. His stomach growled. \"Kinda hungry, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hikaru's stomach continued to growl, he noticed something in the shadows of the room. Curious, he got up and walked over to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's jaw dropped. Standing before him were literally DOZENS of tables of food, from ice cream to burgers to noodles and everything in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's eyes lit up. \"I-I don't know where to start!\" His eyes wandered to a plate of fried chicken. \"This'll do...\" He set upon the table with a frightening ferocity. Sai raised his fan to protest, but lowered it back down. That was Hikaru...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, though, Sai noticed something odd; Hikaru had finished off four tables already, but he didn't seem to be getting full in the least. What was more, with every bite of food Hikaru took, his stomach grew, albeit so imperceptibly it would have taken a trained eye to see it. As it was now, Hikaru had a round bulge underneath his shirt, which continued growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai shook his head. \"I have a bad feeling about this...\"</span></div></div>",
