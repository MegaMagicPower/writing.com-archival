They knew that they were going to have to fight them sooner or later and they had both agreed that the battle for the mamodo crown will end now. Wonrei, who has gained the ability to sense the energies of other mamodo has detected a strong energy source from Canada. Li-en and Wonrei boarded the nect plane to Canada and prepared for their next fight.  (Once the fight for the crown is over, the winner will get one wish.

His name was Frostra. His partner went by Drake. \"Good evening Wonrei. My name is Frostra and I will be the last mamodo you will ever face.\" <br>\r\n\"And why is that Frostra?\" <br>\r\n\"Because Wonrei, I am going to kill you here and now! Drake you know which spell to cast!\"  <br>\r\n*Gio-Freezo-ruk* <br>\r\nFrostra grew spikes all over his body and they continued to grow larger until they burst off of him and flew in every direction.<br>\r\n\"Li-en!\" Wonrei quickly jumped in front of Li-en as she cast a spell.<br>\r\n*Rerudo*<br>\r\nA Thin emerald colored wall appeared in front of Wonrei's hands, protecting both of them. <br>\r\n\"Grr, nice spell Wonrei but my anger towards you is stronger than any shiled you may have.\"  <br>\r\n*Gigano-Freezaruga*<br>\r\nA Giant beam of ice was fired directly at Wonrei and encased him in a block of ice. \"Haha! Now to burn your book and then to assign work for your little girl friend here. Maybe she would be a good slave to clean my castle. Top to bottom every day.\" <br>\r\nWonrei then broke free from the ice after hearing what Frostra had in store for Li-en. \"You shall not touch Li-en.\" <br>\r\nWonrei began to glow with a redish color and his energy spiked greatly. <br>\r\n\"Uhh, Drake use my armor spell now!\"<br>\r\n*Gigano-amuruk*<br>\r\nFrostra then grew an extra plate of armor on top of his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does this Mamodo hate Wonrei so much? How will this battle turn out? Stay tuned for the next addition and find out.</span></div></div>",

Why do you hate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, back in the mamodo world I encountered a beautiful girl. She was the most beautiful mamodo girl you could ever imagine. But when I finally got the courage to talk to her, you talked to her first and she liked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize Frostra, but I do not recall this ever happening. Do you happen to know her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes her name is Lin. She has long black hair and is about your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I apologize Frostra. You see Lin is my half sister. She wasn't selected for this battle. We were probably just talking and you had the wrong idea. I apologize if there was any confusion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you lie, I know she isn't your sister. It can't be true. You're lying. I will defeat you here and now and then show Lin who she should fall in love with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Anyone who has to deal with violence to get what they want, will not be allowed to be with my dear half sister.\" Not only by my choice but by hers as well. She doesn't like to fight and will never go out with a monster like you. All you think of is power but I and my friends rely on inner strength and eachother to help each other with our goals and dreams.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I will go out with her, related to you or not. I am not fighting just for me, I am fighting because I want to be the one to protect her!\"<br>\r\n*Go Boren* <br>\r\nWonrei releashed a furious blow to Frostra's stomach, cracking his armor in the process.  <br>\r\n\"No I will not fail against you Wonrei!\" <br>\r\n*Lagikor Fang*<br>\r\nA giant wolf figure appeared in front of Frostra and lunged toward Wonrei. <br>\r\n*Rerudo*<br>\r\nThe shield broke and Wonrei was badly injured. <br>\r\n\"Li-en, I fear if this battle is to go on much longer you will get hurt. Please use our two spell combo to defeat this mamodo once and for all.\"<br>\r\n\"Right Wonrei\"<br>\r\n*Redoruk*<br>\r\nWonrei lunged towards Frostra at light speed.<br>\r\n\"Now Li-en!\" <br>\r\n*Ganzu Boren*<br>\r\nWonrei dealt 36 blows to his opponents stomach where the armor had broken.<br>\r\nFrostra soon fell and lie helplessly on the ground. </span></div></div>",

Lin may come to like you and we could become friends in the other world.\"<br>\r\n\"Wonrei... you truly are a force to be reckoned with. How is it that someone so strong can be so kind as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because my goal is to become a king that will protect others. If anyone ever needs help, I will be there to help by any means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Wonrei. I will try to improve myself to fit your expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I do not have any expectations for you. I only want you to make yourself happier, and if making Lin like you makes you happy, then do whatever you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Wonrei. I am ready to go back to the other world now. Good luck with the rest of your battles Wonrei.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Frostra's book was burnt and he returned to the mamodo world.

It was then at that time that he began to think of when they first fell in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at Li-en's grand parents farm. They had gone to there to escape the clutches of Li-en's Mafia ruling Father. It was also the time when Li-en first began to train Wonrei the art of Kung fu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane had hit some turbulence. The plane's violent shaking rudely awakened Wonrei from his day dream. Moments later it had happened again but it was stronger than before. Suddenly the pilot spoke over the loud speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention passengers, we are having a slight problem with turbulence so please bare with us and fasten your seatbelts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bad feeling about this Wonrei.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too feel something strange going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonrei suddenly heard a strange chant and looked around trying to find out where it had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonrei, what is it? Did you hear something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I think it was a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the back of the plane in the rest room, a book owner was casting spells over and over.<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha. Not only will I get revenge on the pilot that ruined me but I will defeat a mamodo as well. I, Vladimir along with my mamodo X-31, I will take my revenge on anyone and anything that stands in my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silent robotic like mamodo waited inside one of the over head compartments where the luggage went. He silently applied Extra weight by teleporting boulders into the engines of the plane. Vladimir's plan was to make the plane crash and then use X-31's ability to fly to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Li-en and Wonrei...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Shouted Li-en.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Li-en, he must be here somewhere.\" Wonrei closed his eyes and focused on every sound going on in the plane. Within a few moments he heard where the spell chanting was coming from.<br>\r\n\"Li-en the restroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi-en smashed the door open and caught the book owner red handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you finally caught me eh? No matter my mamodo has enough power to defeat you in a normal battle. X-31, come on out!\" <br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\"  X-31 dropped out of the over head compartment and focused on Li-en's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandsen!\" </span></div></div>",
