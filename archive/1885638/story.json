They were both happy in each others company, and they both knew it. Then a green smoke ball shot through the air, knocking them both flat. Kitana landed on top of Lui Kang. Picking themselves up, they saw the unmistakable form of the deadly Ermac. The green energy around him attesting to his existence as a coalescence of souls. Floating onto the wall, he watched as Kitana and Liu Kang struggled to their feet. Taking their stances, they tensed as Ermac floated down. He lunged forwards, and the fight began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they were standing over the defeated Ermac. They were both sweating, but neither of them were seriously hurt. However, then Ermac began to make a strange noise. They both looked astonished at him- Ermac, the soul ninja, was laughing.

As far as she could tell it was just a normal day on earth. She heard a groan and turned around. Liu Kang had just woken up. She walked over and helped him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happened?\" asked Liu Kang<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Kitana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she helped him up and walked back to their chambers together.</span></div></div>",

Liu Kang began losing muscle weight, while Kitana Hair grew shorter. Now they looked like opposite gender equivalents of each other. When Liu Kang woke up, he rose immediately. As he did so he felt his new hair tickle his back. Even as this happened he stumbled due to his changed muscle mass. Looking down, horrified, he woke Kitana up. She was equally as horrified. Now their clothes didn't fit themselves. However, Kitana's boots and underwear now fit Liu Kang's changed form. In the same way his clothes now fit Kitana.
