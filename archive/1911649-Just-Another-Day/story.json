And what are you doing here Loki? I woulda figured your brother had you buried in a dark whole in some far off corner of the galaxy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me he and my father wanted to. But mother, she  wanted me a little closer to home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just had to see it for myself. Word has spread throughout the galaxy that the might avengers of earth have split up. Truthfully I just had to see it for myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you wanted to be the one to defeat earths mightiest hero's\" Steve said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, after Thor locked me up in Asgard's dungeon I did begin plotting your teams demise. And the thought of breaking you all by breaking you apart did occur to me, but I didn't think it would work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it did. So, what's you evil plan today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Loki started. \"I figured I'd try and, as you humans say, kick the dog while it's down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. You see, in my traveling of the galaxy I've come across many unique devices\" Loki said smugly as he pulled something out of his jacket. \"This one here can send a person to an entire different earth. An, alternate reality if you may. Some with minor differences that may or may not have an effect on the grand scheme of things, others where major events are changed and the world is vastly different\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't you go try your luck with one of those, other earths\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it, teaming up with myself and taking over a different earth. But then I decided, why not just scatter earths mightiest hero's and take over while they're absent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was about to say something when Loki activated the device he had in his hand. It began making noises before it suddenly shot out a beam hitting Steve square in the chest. The beam knocked Steve out of the chair and back several feet before he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Loki send Captain Steve Rogers?</span></div></div>",
