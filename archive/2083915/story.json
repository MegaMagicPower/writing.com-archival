            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been months since the destruction of the BSL station, leaving Samus still on the run. She'd managed to avoid Galactic Federation persecution up to that point, but it was far from easy to do so. It seemed as if almost every single outpost that she arrived at had someone there, waiting to either report her or capture her. Though the infamous bounty hunter still had many willing to support her and her endeavors, especially since the truth about the Federation's Metroid program had been revealed to the public, this did not make her travels any safer. She had to remain on the run, doing her best to stay one step ahead of any potential pursuers, leaving her unable to stop and rest for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not doing well, Lady\" Her computer commented, as they sped through the stars. Samus turned her attention to her AI, leaving her gunship to autopilot as she retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much choice, Adam. Everywhere I go, it seems the Federation is just waiting in the corners to arrest me. We've been living out of the ship for ages now...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep going on like this, you're just wearing yourself out. Not befitting to a soldier necessary for this system's survival.\" Adam responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, but I won't be able to do much of anything if I end up in their prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undeniable. Though it's also untrue to say that you don't have any support whatsoever, the Galactic Federation has been under more scrutiny than ever since the breeding program went public. Your capture would certainly cause a stir among the systems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brilliant solution, Adam. I'm sure being imprisoned would only lead to very peaceful reformation and justice.\" Samus responded, a very faint smile hiding her sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not unaware of the repercussions that would come with that, nor did I imply that the stir would be completely peaceful. Only a statement of a possible outcome, Lady.\" Adam retorted, in its emotionless tone. Samus sat back in her seat, her mind getting lost in thoughts of her childhood. Her time with the Chozo, raising her as one of their own. Learning the ways of their warriors, spending time with the fellow chozodian children, all simpler times. Times before politics, world ending catastrophes arriving one after another, her nemesis Ridley looming over her life like a phantom, times when the weight of the world was far and away from her shoulders. As she reminisced about the more peaceful moments in her life, Samus suddenly felt herself thrust out of them, a bright flashing erupting from her main screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A distress signal\" Adam confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where from?\" Samus inquired, immediately sitting up to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it advisable to pursue this signal? It may be a trap for all that you know, Lady.\" Adam warned.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it's in a very remote part of space, far from any Galactic Federation or Space Pirate outposts. I doubt they'd get the idea to build a trap all the way out here, it doesn't seem like something either one would get the idea to do.\" Samus responded, locking her ship onto the coordinates of the distress signal, boosting on ahead, trying to get their as quick as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel it is best, Lady.\" Adam responded, leaving Samus to her decision. The bounty hunter sped along, soon arriving to her destination, what looked like a large, desolate space station. The station looked to be completely cube like in its design, with several docking bays dotted along it, several windows into the various rooms of the ship, all too far to get a clear look. Though brightly lit, the station gave off an eerie feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you find any information on this ship, Adam?\" Samus asked as her ship circled the cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing found. This ship can not be found in any known databases that we have access to.\" Adam responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any readings on the ship?\" Samus asked, activating her Fusion Suit as she walked behind her main chair, waiting to dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing found. Based on my scans, there isn't a single life form on this vessel that I can detect, no unusual energy surges anywhere on the ship that I can find. It's as if the ship has been completely abandoned only recently.\" Adam responded once more. Samus thought to herself, before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land the ship and deactivate all power.\" Samus ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting at, Lady?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a look around inside. Something is clearly going on here, this can't just be a trap. This station looks like it once held a very important purpose, it wouldn't have just gone quiet like this for no good reason. Something has to be here. While I'm inside, I want you to completely power down everything so we don't draw attention to the ship. In the case that I need to retreat, the last thing I need is you being destroyed or detained in some way.\" Samus responded. Adam complied, quickly landing the ship and turning off most of the ship, only leaving the exit hatch open and himself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful out there, Lady. This situation is clearly out of the norm.\" Adam stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, any objections, Adam?\" Samus sarcastically asked, activating her helmet before carefully walking towards the open hatch, her back to Adam as it deactivated itself. With that, Samus jumped through the open hatch and onto the docking bay of the large cube station, taking in her surroundings as she carefully walked ahead, doing her best to keep to the corners of the room and out of sight. Upon entering the main doorway, she was greeted with brightly lit, white, smoothed, long hallways in front of her, seemingly extending endlessly and in every direction. Samus continued forward, moving towards the still blaring distress signal, letting her visor guide her as she kept her eyes on the various corridors and hallways all around her, canon at the ready. After what felt like hours, Samus finally found herself at a large elevator, leading deeper into the station. Once she reached the bottom, all that Samus saw in front of her was a large grayish room, akin to a warehouse, with a gigantic door on the opposite side. As she cautiously walked towards the door, her canon aimed straight ahead of her, Samus suddenly stopped in her tracks as the lights around her all blacked out instantly. With nothing but pure blackness all around here, Samus quickly began weighing her options.</span></div></div>",

You may call me Mor. I do not mean to cause you alarm.\" Mor responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly find just a voice to be frightening.\" Samus retorted, her canon still aimed to the air. A faint giggle could be heard from the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I would imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Samus continued questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was awaiting you, Aran.\" Mor replied. Samus lowered her canon a bit, curiosity gripping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You received my distress signal, did you not? I'm glad you managed to find your way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you send that signal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to speak with you, Aran.\" Mor responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used a class one distress signal to drag me all the way here to talk?\" Samus said, somewhat frustrated, realizing she had likely been fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no choice, you rarely ever take the time to remain in one area for long, and I was desperate to bring you here.\" Mor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I show you?\" Mor requested. Before Samus could respond, the door on the far side of the room began to slowly opened, revealing a stark white, smoothed room beyond it. Cautiously, Samus approached the room, canon drawn. Once inside the room, Mor spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you feel their presence?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, exactly?\" Samus questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My experiments, my pride and joy, my children.\" Mor answered, as the panels seemed to fold away from the walls. Behind the panels, there seemed to be endless rows of glass containers, each one holding a small, bluish-purple, jellyfish-like creature in each. Samus looked on, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are....those...\" She stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. They are not the metroids you are familiar with. You see, despite my best intentions, they are still....imperfect.\" Mor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they here!?\" Samus immediately questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must understand, Aran. With the Federation being so bold as to attempt to capture the X parasites, biological weapons have simply become a necessary part of balance in this system. In order to quell the threat of one predator, you must have another at the ready. Rest assured. these creatures are loyal to a fault, and would only ever be released should it be deemed absolutely necessary.\" Mor assured. Samus looked on in abstract horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I can't allow this.....this....this isn't how it's supposed to be. The answer to stopping the Galactic Federation's corruption doesn't lie in these things! You can't continue this!\" Samus yelled in response, raising her canon to the tubes, ready to obliterate them. Before she had the chance to fire, however, a sudden chill struck her in the back of her suit. Samus fell to the ground, dazed, her vision growing blurry, her body feeling unstable. She watched as her Fusion suit began to fade before her eyes, leaving her in nothing but her Zero suit with her stun pistol, hardly ideal choices for this scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of your....disdain for these creatures. Believe you me, Aran, I was well aware that you would probably try to attempt that before I even called you here.\" Mor stated, as Samus slowly began to pick herself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why even bother to call me here in the first place?\" She asked, still breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough. Ever since your assignment on the BSL station, your cellular makeup has changed to match parts of the original metroids. These missing pieces of DNA are precisely what I need to complete my experiments, and allow my children to grow into what they were meant to be. In short, you were the perfect source of nutrients for them.\" Mor responded. Samus' blood ran cold as she heard the tubes all around her hiss and slowly be lifted away, letting the creatures free. She immediately turned to flee back to the dark room with the elevator, feebly attempting to blast any of the \"mocktroids\" that pursued her, but it was no use. After only managing a few yards of distance, Samus felt a warm, pulsing feeling on the back of her knee, quickly turning to confirm that one of the creatures had latched onto her. As she attempted to swat it away, more and more of them swarmed her, latching on wherever they could, leaving her on the floor, unable to stop them draining her. Despite her apparently dire situation, Samus continued to thrash about, in a vain attempt to stop them. Though it seemed to be fruitless at best, she quickly realized that it may actually be working, as the mocktroids began to detach from her body. In just a few minutes, the creatures had fled from her and returned to their nesting tubes, much to Samus' confusion. However, upon getting back up to walk towards the tubes for inspection, she immediately tripped over herself, landing on her outstretched hands. Upon looking at her hands, however, a sudden realization dawned upon the bounty hunter, she had suddenly become a lot smaller than normal.</span></div></div>",

While most of the outer parts of the ship were damaged and had long since vented their atmosphere, most of the interior was intact and had a stable atmosphere and good hull integrity.  She only stopped at a room with a large pink X on the door, the only form of marking on the doors she'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room must've been important.\"  She said to herself as she entered the room, collapsing her helmet to cycle in some clean air for her suit.  (The air was getting a little stale.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her sat a little vial filled with some pink substance on a pedestal.  Looking closer at it, she saw some writing on it, and leaned in to try and read it.  Then the vial exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was covered in the strange substance, she could feel herself coughing as it flew down her throat as she gasped for breath, \"Suit!  Emergency evac to ship!\"  She called out, letting suits autopilot run her through the most efficient route, not trusting herself to not blackout on the way with a strange substance in her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her ship, Samus stripped naked and threw her zero suit in the decontamination pod and ran into her shower, washing the substance off her face.  As she stood in the hot shower longer, the more relaxed she felt, not noticing that things were getting a little higher up than they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ample breasts shrank, her muscles lost definition, her pubes disappeared, and her womanly curves slowly faded away as she washed herself in the shower.
