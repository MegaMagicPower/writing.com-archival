            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Space, as Captain Kirk might put it, \"the Final Frontier\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr in regards to today's traffic in the Saxxonian Galaxy, it may as well have been just a huge parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the three dimensions of travel, one can either go forwards, backwards, upwards or downwards. Maybe even diagonally if you've got one of those new Mustangs. But according to the Driver's Manual of the Galaxy(ies), initiating a criss-cross maneuver in a non-maneuvering zone was a penalty of 5000 credits, money that Meitnerium didn't quite care to cough up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Faith!\" she shouted at the Volkswagen in front, who had stopped prematurely with plenty more room to scoot forward into the lane. On the fender, the words \"student\" and \"driver\" did little to ease the hotheaded girl's rage. She slammed both hands down on her Porschette's horn in fury and started beating on the steering wheel. Finally she could get moving! Her slender foot pumped a little fuel into the modest sports vehicle before having to immediately stomp on the break pedal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young metalean fumed; she had been dealing with this bozo for thirty minutes now! It was obvious that it was his first time driving, but he could have picked a better place to start out than the inter-frickin'-stellar highway! Had there been room to get out on the highway, or breathable air, this joker would be getting the beating of a lifetime! Fortunately for him, there wasn't. And she wouldn't. Meitnerium of the Metalement Galaxy would just have to be patient; which wasn't one of her strong suits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roared from behind the sound-proofed glass of her car, making the most disturbing and animalistic faces as she voiced her disapproval of the kid ahead of her. She could see the driver, a teenaged boy of Willixian descent, check his rearview mirror meekly; his face twisted in horror at the deranged madwoman and her frightening expressions. He mouthed his apologies and allowed her to pass him vertically, lowering his own vehicle slightly so that she may pass without skimming the hood of her car on the lane of traffic overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank Faith!\" Meitnerium spat as she shot the kid a proverbial bird. Her lead foot syndrome flaring up again as she sped past the other drivers with blatant disregard for traffic laws. Checking her mirrors to see if she had an out, the young driver quickly turned onto the road to Steez Technical School. Thanks to that little jerkface wanna-be driver, she was going to be late to first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Meitnerium's target was within sight. She turned up the shields, pumped the gas, and turned on the AC in preparation for entering the atmosphere. There was the traditional gravitational speedbump which she had grown accustomed to, then like any good driver does, she turned down the gravity to neutral so as not to stress the tires before speeding down the ramp to Steez Tech. As a planet solely dedicated to education and whatnot, it was relatively small in circumference with a large building pillaring from the ground. But all that meant was a five minute drive to the surface and about a thirty minute elevator ride to reach her first period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young student groaned as she rolled onto the parking lot, keeping her foot on the breaks as she slowed in velocity. \"Man, that fat bitch is gonna kill me.\" Meitnerian cursed under her breath as she searched the expansive lot for a space to park, \"What is, this my fifth time being late?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some luck, she managed to find a decent space about ten minutes walking distance from the entrance, it was beter than nothing. So, bidding adieu to her fuzzy dice and zebra-print seat covers, Meitnerium grabbed her things, opened the door, and started hoofing it through the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her tan cardigan, jeans, and flats, Meitnerium looked every bit the \"college girl\" role one might expect. She held her purse in the crevice of her elbow, which held her cosmetology nook and thusly allowed her to touch up her makeup with her free hands as she trekked towards class. Yep, every bit the college student. Everything except the fact that her skin was the softest shade of green and the antennae that bobbed from the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a bad thing. A lot of species out there had stranger colors to their skin -orange, red, blurple- and her whole family, better yet, her whole species had green pigmintation to their skin. The only real problem there was for a metalean was finding clothes that went well with their particular shade of the color. But fortunately, she had been blessed with long, ivory hair and deep amber eyes to accentuate her beauty and thus opening up her options in clothing. She was also graced with small antennae, an almost universal attraction in her species save for a few perverts with weird fetishes. They dangled and bobbed cutely from their stalks rooted in her soft white locks, squishy to the touch yet with a hint of firmness; leading to a universally agreed hottie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, everything was cool.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she stumbled into the building, the familiar scent of old books flooded her schnoz unwarranted. It always made her want to sneeze. She said her customary hellos to the office officials up front as she was prescribed a late pass under the excuse of \"car troubles\". \"Goodbye student number 155367!\" said the automated voice. They always seemed so artificially cheery, it creeped her and a lot of other students out. Probably because they were robots, yeah that was probably it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly sprinting down the hallways to spare herself an even more harsh tongue lashing than before, Meitnerium came to a stop at the elevator and pressed the 'up' button. Rummaging through her purse, finding and checking her phone for the time, Meitnerium grew impatient. \"Come on, come on...\" she mumbled. Suddenly the metallic seals let out a soft 'ding' before they opened, revealing a set of glass doors that slid open, and she entered the compartment. Turning to the wall's touchscreen, she held down the 'SHIFT' button and pressed the 1, 2, 7, and 'ENTER' keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, the antiquated elevator started moving upwards towards the one-hundred-and-twenty-seventh floor. \"These things are so slow.\" the young snow-haired student said to herself as she tapped her foot impatiently. It was understandable that they were slow, having such a long vertical trek ahead of them. And sure, the dangers of matter transporters were obvious. But the many other colleges she visited, and subsequently rejected from, at least had escalated elevators that cut the high time of travel in a third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy would that third of a timeslot have been appreciated. Lo and behold, nearly twenty minutes after actually entering the elevator, Meitnerium finally reached her destination. It certainly didn't help that the damndable thing stopped at least seven times so that other students could get on. But rather than bitch about it, Meitnerium would settle for finally getting to her Cosmetology class. It wasn't her best subject, but it always provided a nice cushion should her other career ideas not pull through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. No doubt that oversized sow Mrs. Henderson would have something to say about her recent spell of tardies, but she could handle it. Who was she to judge, surely she had trouble getting places on time too with that ginormous body of hers. Meitnerium snorted at the prospect of her teacher having a life, \"Poor fat cow can barely waddle around class, let alone go to the club.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sultry voice came from behind her. One that she recognized as, without a doubt, Mrs. Henderson. The green pigmented lass turned slowly to face the behemoth of her nightmares, standing three feet away (assuming that her belly counted, it would be a mere half-a-foot) with her chubby arms folded over her stomach. Behind her glasses, a patented glare of malice aimed directly at Meitnerium shone with a distinctly wicked intent. \"Miss Perioda.\" she said in a husky voice, her multiply chinned face frowning deeply, \"I don't have time for you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a good majority of women that hailed from the Saxxonian Galaxy, Mrs. Henderson was a woman of amplitude in all three of her axis. She was inexplicably tall, standing at well over 2 meters vertically and a good meter and thensome in depth. Horizontally she was the average woman, if not a little wider in the shoulders than most, overall giving her a very intimidating appearance and explained why all fat jokes were conducted in her absence. \"Why even bother having your Daddy pay for college if you aren't going to attend classes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Mrs. Henderson!\" Meitnerium pleaded, \"Just one more chance, it's only my fifth tardy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're late. Go talk to the dean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm only...\" Meitnerium peered inside the door's window and checked the clock on the wall. \"Five, ten, fifteen... fifty-five minutes?\" she counted aloud, \"That's pretty damn late!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see my point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, lousy, whale'uva professor.\" Meitnerium cursed her absent teacher with fervor as she await the arrival of the dean in his office. This was after she had calmed down some, the words were both indescribable and unpronounceable before she had taken a few deep breaths on the long elevator ride up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault people can't drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only a little late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I haven't been late before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should really start expecting things like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be held accountable for her inexperienced attitude with my style of college attendance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she huffed and crossed her arms over her green bosom and started to pout; her eyebrows furrowed, tongue in cheek, and bottom lip bitten down on. She heard a loud clapping from behind her. \"Bravo, Ms. Perioda.\" the elderly dean said from the entrance, \"I think that last one was my favorite, mind if we put it on a poster for College Humor?\" he chuckled as his elderly Willixian body shuffled towards his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps if you were as prepared as you are clever, you'd be able to get to class on time.\" Meitnerium rolled her eyes, she had gotten used to this kind of treatment from the faculty around here. Always \"if you just did [this]\" or \"If only you'd [that]\", it was really starting to bug her. \"Hahaha, yeah.\" she said curtly, \"Look, I know why I'm in here, so can I just go back to class?\" she leaned forward slightly, \"I mean, if you keep me here, aren't I just missing more class than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on the dean's face faded at her impertinence, his cheery demeanor replaced with a disapproving scowl. \"It would be wise for you to hold your tongue, Ms. Perioda.\" he said sharply, \"It'd be a shame for those pretty antennae of yours to get ripped off in a futilistic struggle with an old man.\" she gulped, somewhat intimidated by his sudden threat. While no means a 'scary' man, it would serve to reason that he could do a lot of damage given the element of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about your attendance record.\" he said once cooled off a bit, \"It seems that in the last month you've arrived late to class at least 5 times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped her shoulders, growing a little uneasy in her defense. \"Yeah, I have, but today wasn't my fault, I was caught in traffic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware. That was my nephew, delivering my heart medication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"TRANSFER!!\" Meitnerium roared, once again behind the wheel of her Porschette and in a state of intense fury. At the suggestion of the Dean himself, Meitnerium was to be no longer considered a student of Steez Technical School and was to be relocated to a college somewhere in the Transylvania Galaxy. Otherwise known as the freak show parade. She had heard the stories, crazy orgies and incest carrying their influence to other planets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium roared even louder as she thought of all the hard work she had put into her studies (none) and how much she had paid to go to Steez (little to nothing) and put it all into perspective (negatively). \"Ugh!\" she groaned, \"I hate, HATE, everyone at that stupid, STUPID college!\" she wailed, now beating on her steering wheel once more as she cruised down interstellar highway 56,400. \"And I'm going to have to live in that awful, smelly, rank DISGUSTING place with all of those raunchy, sex-crazed freaks from Transvestite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fate would soon deliver her salvation from the yucky slums of the most perverted galaxy in the universe. In the form of a natural disaster, no less. Just as she roared and wailed about her misfortunes, a mass of fiery rock loomed over the unusually deserted highway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot STAND trannies!\" she spat, finishing up her little tantrum for the afternoon. \"I need to binge.\" she sighed, reaching into her pocket and pulling out two food tablets and swallowing them. \"Ah, that's better.\" she sighed contentedly when she noticed an obscenely large amount of light coming from behind her. \"Ugh, that better not be a cop.\" she said, checking the rearview mirror. To her shock, a meteor was speeding behind her. Instinctively, she let her lead foot do the talking for her. It wasn't that she was afraid of dying; even admittedly wussy models like her Porschette had been equipped for the high-pressure of space and meteor impact. It was more like \"Dad said I can't get into another wreck or he'll take my license!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this shortsightedness was simply due to the fact that she had grown up with meteor insulation her entire life and her species as a whole was rather durable, she never expected what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meteor struck the rear of her Porschette, instead of simply tipping her out of the way and back onto the highway, it instead pushed the car offlight-road and into the vast expanse of the universe. She attempted to turn, but the meteor was going far too fast, it wound up propelling her for hours and eventually into uncharted territory! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metalean checked her UPS,  it read 'Milky Way', she was out in the boonies! The aliens out here were hicks! Complete and total rednecks with no cool, well, ANYTHING! At the very least, she was sure to find someone out here who knew how to get this rock out of her fender. If it ever stopped, which it didn't. It seemed dead-set on reaching a tiny blue marble off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohcrapohcrapohcrap!\" she shouted, trying desperately to find a light-ramp on the diagram displayed on her navigational system. But alas, there was nothing to be found! No light-ramp, no directory, no one could help her! \"Planetary Collision is NOT covered by my insurance!\" Meitnerium shouted as she plummeted further and further down towards the ever-growing blue speck in her windshield. She tried turning, she tried giving it gas, she even tried the breaks, but to no avail. She was going to hit that planet. She was going to hit... Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Now, in no small part due to the word limit instituted on Writing.com, you will be given three choices as to where Meitnerium lands on this big, blue marble of ours. land either in the midwestern town of Roswell New Mexico or . Here she will be discovered and taken in by an unsuspecting member of the locale... so yeah, have fun with that :P))</span></div></div>",

Her airbags had inflated correctly, but other than that it looks like most of her father\u2019s SUV she was driving was totaled. Meitty was glad she\u2019d survived the crash, but knew she was as good as dead as soon as her father saw what she\u2019d done. She grimaced as she dusted a bit of soot off of her tattered clothes and stepped onto Earth taking a few moments to adjust herself to her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked about her\u2026Trees as far as her eyes could see, and even worse no antenna attuned technology as far as her own feelers could detect\u2026Other than her one big BOOM when she landed here, the wreckage of her car was instant,  smokeless, and\u2026whatever it had hit had been vaporized to dust instantly some sort of metallic thing, or whatever. She wondered what dreary planet she\u2019d unfortunately found herself on here in the boonies of the 'Milky Way'.  She hoped it wasn\u2019t Moltor, with its infinite volcanoes, sure it had natural hot-springs but right now her hair and complexion would not be able to deal with that kind of humidity right now. Hopefully it was Dokar, or at least nearby,  she\u2019d never been, but given the tall green hunks she\u2019d seen transfer in from the planet\u2026being stranded for a few days alone wouldn\u2019t be so bad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begrudgingly took a few steps up and over a nearby hillside, finding the gravity and air here not entirely unpleasant. Whence she crested the hillside she saw a small city\u2019s worth of buildings in a variety of sizes, from a distance she could even glimpse the outlines of some sort of lifeforms\u2026. Wait a minute the way these buildings were laid out, oh no\u2026no, no, no, no, <b>NO</b>! Ugh, this would be so Meitty\u2019s luck right now, that in all infinitesimal planets in the whole fricken\u2019 faithin\u2019 universe she\u2019d transferred from her own academy and crashed right outside another in one single trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least it would be over soon. Sure, she\u2019d have to dial up Daddy, and then there would be shouting, and he\u2019d have the \u201cI told you so\u201d tone in his voice, but at least she\u2019d be off this rundown rock quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust make her way down the hill and\u2026</span></div></div>",

Maybe this was a far distant Metalean colony planet left to be mostly forgotten out here in the middle of nowhere?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with this information, but still unsure exactly where to go Meitty took in her surroundings now that she was outside one of the major buildings. The life forms here were also startling similar to Meitty\u2019s own Metalean race in appearance but yet they were all so\u2026so\u2026different! Not a single green complexion to be seen here, but pink skin, and brown and more, all paired with such different hair styles colors and makeup,  though with a majority wrapped in bright garish yellow uniforms.  Meitty felt a tiny twinge to maybe transfer and take her cosmetology degree studying here, if maybe after some further investigating\u2026Wait a second\u2026were all of them female?\u2026No males in sight! Ugh! Could this day get any worse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty, so caught up in her examination of Earth\u2019s existence ran in to a thick padded wall, or at least it felt like padding, it was actually a person! Standing before her, about a head taller than her, was a dark haired, woman, whose round face complete with thick rimmed rectangular glasses bore the look, not of anger, but one of concern. Said head, sat atop a frame that made her a near twin to her (now ex-) teacher Mrs. Henderson. At least this one had the decency to dress somewhat adequately, though it\u2019s yellow uniform still clung to her side rolls and did little to mask her hulking breasts that pushed perkily upwards against the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u2026Oh, hello there\u2026. Everything okay? Are you lost?\u201d asked the life-form in front of her.

Well, now let\u2019s see\u2026M\u2026.M\u2026M\u2026\u201d the large girl looked at the clipboard she was carrying furiously fat fingering through papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I'm not a studen-...Look, can I just make a call real quick?\u201d asked Meitty wondering why she was going to have to go through this whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just, like, phone home\u2026 or whatever?\u201d asked with an arch of her eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d trailed off for a bit usually not one to let ANYONE hold her phone, but after noting the ruff looking state this poor girl was in, her matronly instincts won out. \u201cSure\u2026here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty tried her dad\u2019s number same as always; 269-8745-553-554-226-4447-777-889. No answer. She tried her mother\u2019s\u2026Still nothing! Her dad\u2019s work, all of her friends! All met with a voice explaining that her call could not be completed as dialed.  This stupid backwoods blue ball probably didn\u2019t get coverage out here. Well, nothing left to do here but sit and wait for her dad to get the emergency crash signal her SUV sent out\u2026that is if <u>that </u>didn\u2019t get total toasted in the crash along with the rest of her vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Meitty\u2026Eh, where were you from again?\u201d Asked Ronnie as she took her phone back, all while trying (and failing) not to gawk at the incredibly long area code that accompanied each phone call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMetalement, duh. \u201d Said Meitty in a flat tone, as if her own white locks which currently covered her twin antennae, plus green skin weren\u2019t enough to give it away, they were even speaking Metalement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Ronnie sighed miserably; she assumed this was some remote city in Europe which didn\u2019t much help in this situation. A bead of sweat formed on her brow as she could sense this was one of the VERY FEW times she was going to need help from someone higher up than her own R.A position, plus with more students checking in by the minute she was falling behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing would be to make sure this Meitty girl stayed calm and felt at home here. \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m sure your parents have the Academy\u2019s number, they\u2019ll probably call to check on you as soon as they can.  Just so you know I\u2019ll put a notice into the attendance office right away\u2026 For now though, how about I put you in a temporary room with someone, till things get things officially sorted out?  Is that okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d said Meitty with a roll of her eyes wanting nothing more than for this to be over as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right.\u201d She gave a small nod before double checking her clip-board, then nodding once more before speaking again. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a spare room on my floor for now so just follow me!\u201d  Ronnie turned about and began slowly walking down a hallway, at the same time she dialed up a number on her phone. \u201cHi, so I\u2019ve got a lost student here\u2026yeah I tired but I think she\u2019s from Europe...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty tuned out, walking the halls following the enormous life-form in front of her. This was so annoying\u2026but on the other hand certainly already a million times better than her assigned school of Transvesttie. Maybe she could convince daddy to do some away studies out here\u2026In fact if she made the right moves she might be able to\u2026. Wait, there was something else peculiar about this school; Same Yellow uniforms? That sort of thing wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary. In fact the Pastafarianism place down a ways from her old school did that. An all-female school? Again, not preferable, but not unheard off, as Meitty\u2019s friend Vortia had almost been assigned to one given her constant breaking of curfew.  No, the weird thing was that out of all the organisms here, Meitty seemed to be the only interplanetary attendee, not even a single feline from the Amenhotep Quadrant and those things were practically on every planet! No way\u2026Was she\u2026Was she on an undiscovered planet! If that were the case\u2026maybe she\u2019d better keep the fact that she was an alien here under wraps for a while\u2026I mean they seemed pretty friendly so far, if a little weird, but who knew what could happen...Meitty casually brushed her hair making sure it now fully covered the two antennae on her  head and tuned back into whatever this Ronnie person was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-And if you need a spare uniform there\u2019s should be a set in either one each of the closets.\u201d Said Ronnie sounding a bit out of breath from the speech she\u2019d been giving and the walk.  \u201cWell, here\u2019s your room. And like I said I\u2019m going to make sure you get a hold of your parents one way or another.  For now though just relax here want you to feel at home. Oh! It, looks like your room-mate has already checked in. Excellent! I just know you two are going to get along great!\u201d said Ronnie, the last few lines coming off as a per-programmed routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Great\u2026.\u201d muttered Meitty in a sarcastic echo of hollow excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon to give you an update as soon as possible Meitty. Just stay calm. Everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Ronnie said talking down to the foreign girl as if she was a five year old, and with that Ronnie turned about, and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if this was where she was going to be crashing (metaphorically and literally) for the next few hours might as well get it over with. Whomever her roommate was Meitty was sure of two things; she\u2019d have to find out a lot more about this planet she now found herself on AND be extremely careful NOT to reveal that she wasn\u2019t exactly from around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, are you my new roommate?\u201d asked the voice from behind the door it belonged to a student named...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, are you my new roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this, <i>this</i> was the type of life form that Meitnerium was used to seeing. No more of the dumpy, huge ones lumbering around the backwater campus that she'd marooned herself on. This girl had flair! She was a little shorter than Meitty, but not by much, with long brown hair and pretty blue eyes. With her tight waist and her full assets, <i>she</i> looked like the kind of girl that Meitnerium was used to hanging out with. Maybe being stuck on this gawdawful mud ball wouldn't be so bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor thing didn't have any antennae though. <i>Some</i> people were into that, she supposed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah?\" Meitnerium answered in half, \"I mean, for the time being anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? At least until they tell you you're in the wrong room\" the life form behind the door laughed, \"C'mon in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl retreated further into the dorm, leaving the doorway wide open. Shrugging her shoulders, Meitnerium followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer temporary domocile couldn't have been temporary enough. If the rest of the campus hadn't been any indication, the decor of where they expected her to stay was decidedly lacking. Everything was... <i>grounded</i>. Like on legs. Nothing was hovering, which meant that if she wanted to ever rearrange this sty, she'd have to (ugh!) drag everything on the floor. There was this sad little screen and two hard looking couches. To her right, there was this big white box and containers against the wall. What the hell even <i>were</i> those things? What could possibly go in them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she tried, at least she thought she was trying, to be polite. These primitive folks hadn't given her any reason to call Protectorate of Sentient Species yet (not that she could without any bars). The fact that they had houses and rooms and big buildings where they all sat inside with <i>moderately</i> functioning air conditioning was a silver lining in itself, she guessed. Whenever she pictured Primitives, Meitnerium always thought of, like... cave people. Unga bunga. That noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm Hannah.\" the primitive said with a smile as the door clicked behind them, \"And, uh, if you don't mind me saying so... you're looking kinda rough. What exactly happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriggin' Faith, what was the right answer? As in, the answer that didn't make her seem like she was an alien. If she was going to do this, she might as well do it right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... just a little... crash?\" Meitnerium guessed, \"Yeah, there was some... uh... <i>vehicular impact</i> up the road. I had to walk up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... a car crash?\" Hannah repeated, furrowing her brows at what was, apparently, a less than sterling example of primitive speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Car crash. Totally.\" the green girl leapt onto that, \"Like, I just barely got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn girl, that's rough.\" Hannah frowned, \"But hey, props to you for your motivation. You walk off a car crash to come to prep school? I don't think anyone else in this academy would have done that. Was there anyone with you? Are they okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I was by myself.\" Meitnerium dismissed, \"I was just driving along when I got pulled in by orbit. Like, I <i>tried</i> pulling up, y'know, but it just didn't work. I mean, when <i>outside</i> of holos does that work, amiright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the blank stare on Hannah's face, Meitnerium wasn't doing as good a job at blending in as she originally intended. Thankfully the primitive laughed, taking what she'd said as some kind of joke. She just smiled and nodded, relieving the suddenly very conscious Meitnerium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, why was it so hard to bring herself down to these primitives' level?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight...\" Hannah said with a strained smile, \"Well, the bathroom's right over there if you want to go freshen up a little. I mean, you know, you're gonna have to change into your uniform anyway right? Plus the whole... car crash victim you've got going on there.... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitnerium.\" Friggin' Faith. Did that sound Primitive enough? Did she really <i>need</i> to worry about sounding primitive when her skin was green? \"Meitnerium Perioda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay, um... Meitty...\" Hannah seemed to have trouble pronouncing her name (it's a very common name!) \"Well, uh, I think we're about the same size. If you want, you can go take a bath. Put on my spare uniform. Get out of those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium looked down, fully realizing just <i>how much</i> of her glorious green bod was on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd call them <i>clothes</i> but...\" Hannah laughed a little, \"They're more like rags now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of this sad little physical switch in the wall, the so-called bathroom was alight. Everything was a soft yellow and white; also this room was <i>way</i> bigger than it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet, Meitnerium recognized. That's where you, uh... did your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the <i>size</i> of that sanitation station! It was huge! It took up, like, half the room! On Metalement (and most <i>civilized</i> parts of the universe!) all it was was like this little faucet built into the wall! You'd stand under it, input your demand, and poof! You were clean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here there was this curtain and this weird basin. And like, a hole in the floor. Why would these primitives need a curtain? There was <i>already</i> a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith. Guess that's why they were called primitives. Always reinventing the wheel instead of proper sanitation stations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Meitnerium stripped down, exposing her lithe green form fully to the otherwise empty room. Woof, she did look rough. The mirror in the bathroom showed her just how bruised and beaten she'd gotten in that wreck. Her clothes were tattered, yeah, but she didn't realize just how <i>dirty</i> she'd gotten. Her muscles were sore and achey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the more reason to get in a nice, relaxing sanitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean, please.\" Meitnerium commanded, standing underneath the showerhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long day, wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as she hated to admit it, Meitnerium wasn't exactly the brightest girl. She did cosmotology, not anthropology. So Faith forbid that she not be able to decipher the greater intricacies of this primitive planet's bathing system. She stood there for about two minutes before finally breaking down and calling for help. She may have just met the girl, but if she didn't want to spent her (hopefully brief) time on this mud ball stinking up the joint, she was going to have to get some help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Hannah?!\" she hollered, her cheeks a dark green with embarassment, \"Do you think you could come in here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the doorknob rattled and turned as Hannah entered the underdeveloped bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Meitty, what's--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she came to see the figure standing in front of her, completely naked and standing in the bathroom in a probably unintentionally provocative pose, Hannah's ivory cheeks burned bright red! She instantly recoiled and retreated behind the door. Honestly, the people on this planet. They were so concerned with privacy! Curtains on their sanitation stations, now freaking out when a houseguest (roommate? Blech.) was naked? For a bunch of primitives, Meitnerium couldn't help but think that they were awfully prudish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing.\" Meitnerium pointed at the station, \"How do you... how do you work the thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah crept back in slowly, peeking out from behind the door ever so quietly as she was beckoned to come inside. She was still beet red and obviously flustered by Meitnerium's lack of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But I can't... Ugh!\" Meitnerium gave a petulant stamp of her foot, which sent her perky green breasts bouncing, \"How do you work this thing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was super embarassing to say that she couldn't figure out this ridiculously simple tech. But no one in her family had seen <i>knobs</i> on thei sanitation stations since... since... Faith, museums. It wasn't <i>her</i> fault that society had left her ill-equipped to deal with life on other planets! It was just... It was just how things were done, okay?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, perhaps <i>seeing</i> that Meitnerium was somehow out of her element, Hannah's guard lowered even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... you must have hit your head or something...\" Hannah said, still clearly flustered with Meitnerium's nudity, \"I mean, okay! If you need help, I'll be more than happy to show you how its done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium sunk down into the water. This was so... <i>relaxing!</i> The water was warm and it felt so good against her bumps and bruises. The bubbles that had sprung from Hannah's strange mixture she'd squirted into the water before her; delightful! They smelled so good! And all the stuff that Hannah had shown her--all different variations of \"soap\" that went different places. Although it wasn't <i>tasty</i>, Meitnerium sure could have cared less. While it didn't match all the different ways that a truly modern sanitation station could have made her smell, she certainly wasn't complaining about smelling like Lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the Faith a lavender was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, girl. You just sink your pretty, uh, blonde (?) head into those suds.\" Hannah said with a smile as she ran a washcloth up Meitnerium's arm, \"Let Hannah take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl. This girl though. This primitive girl was everything that Meitnerium had ever needed in her entire life and more. Maybe when her daddy picked her up, she could talk Hannah into coming with her and just... doing nice shit for her like this all the time. Friggin' <i>Faith</i> this was amazing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Meitty, I gotta ask...\" Hannah asked, \"The uh... what's with the green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium blinked dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. The uh...\" Hannah winced, hoping she hadn't offended her, \"The fact that you're green.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Meitty was truly torn from her lofty, bubbly sanctuary for the first time since she'd really melted, \"Uh... skin condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, I don't think that's a thing, but okay.\" Hannah said cheerfully, \"And, uh... the... things? The things on your head? Your doingies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium's hands shot up to cover her antennae--when had those popped out?! She had hidden them safely underneath a headband for a reason! The last thing she needed was... oh, who cared. This felt <i>amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an alien.\" Meitnerium said with a facetious tone, \"Don't tell anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah raised an eyebrow curiously, unable to hide a wry smile developing between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" Meitnerium purred as she sunk into the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what<i>ever</i> Meitty.\" Hannah rolled her eyes, \"C'mere so I can do your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium complied, warm water sloshing all around her as she shifted her position in the basin of the station. Hannah poured shampoo on her long white locks and started kneading it into her scalp. Meitnerium practically puddled right there as she felt Hannah's long fingernails scritch and scratch against her skin. Then she started tickling the shaft of her antennae...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~\" she sounded again, her chest heavy, \"Stop it, Hannah, those are sensitive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really commited to this alien thing, aren't you?\" Hannah raised her eyebrows again, \"Well, I'll try not to be too rough, green-skinned space babe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium bit her bottom lip as Hannah kneaded and massaged the top of her head. She hadn't been touched like that in... wow, <i>weeks</i>. Not since she and Gallium Brown broke up. It was so relaxing, so <i>soothing</i> so... <i>not</i> soothing. Hannah sure had magic fingers alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now dunk.\" Hannah ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn command, Meitnerium took her first use of primitive vernacular into action. She lowered her head into the water, held her breath, and got all the soap out of her hair. When she rose, she was suds free--and sopping wet. Her skin was shiny with water as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" Hannah said with a smile, \"Now why don't we get you a robe? I think I saw one in the closet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium did a cute little spin, the robe fluttering in the breeze she created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she was a fair bit taller than what was expected of these other primitives. The robe was pretty short on her. It only came down to cover her glorious green glutes! Her long legs were completely on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Hannah said with a thumbs up \"Here, wrap your hair in this towel so you can go sit down on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh! Accessorizing! <i>Now</i> Meitnerium was starting to feel at home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green girl did as she was told and wrapped her white locks up in the fluffy cream towel that Hannah provided her before (struggling with) turning the doorknob and entering the next room of her somehow less horrible domicile. She plopped herself down on the couch, kicked her feet up on the coffeetable, and folded her arms behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this wouldn't be quite so bad!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dude just looked at her like she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.   What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to call a towing company!  Oh, forget it.

Really makes you come to grips with how big the universe is and how comparatively insignificant we are, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the wastelands of central Texas, far from civilization, the night was black and the stars were bright. A sprightly, middle aged man stood roughly twenty feet from the nearby backroad and gazed upwards through a powerful telescope with an air of wonder. His teenage son, on the other hand, leaned against the car parked next to the road, strengthening his thumbs with a constant barrage of texts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure it is, really worth dragging me out here on a three day weekend... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">stupid meteor shower.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the midst of said meteor shower, our young alien protagonist's vehicle is on its last legs. The gallant machine, paid for and kept functional with daddy's money, had done its best, but in the end the atmosphere of the blue planet would win the day. In a final act of chivalric sacrifice, it jettisoned its owner, shielding her in the armored bubble required by interplanetary safety laws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium continued her profanity filled plunge towards the planets surface, the friction causing her shielding to glow a merry red. Only minutes later, it hit the ground with an unceremonious \"whump\" and a cry far too obscene to be printed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that's odd...\" The amateur astronomer said, stroking his chin. \"Looks like one of the meteors actually made it through the atmosphere. I do believe it landed quite close to our position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's great dad, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Tom, show some enthusiasm! Why, I remember when you were just a little boy, you used to love coming out on our stargazing trips!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when I was <i>eight</i>. I'm nineteen, dad. I'm in college now. I don't like wasting my time on stupid little trips like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, I'm gonna go get us a souvenir, whether you come with me or not, Tomcat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, the young man stowed the cell phone away in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if it really means so much to you... and stop calling me that, it's annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed and confused, Meitnerium struggled just to stand up without falling over. No signs remained of her car, the bulk of the machine being consumed by reentry and the protective shielding vanishing after it served its purpose. Due to an post-planetary environmentalist group without sufficient understanding as to exactly how vast the universe is, all such devices were not only bio degradable, but immediately consumed after use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such a state was the green skin lass discovered, sitting on a rock and clutching her throbbing head with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Scott! It's a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dad, I can see that... you don't have to shout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking there way carefully through the brush, by the time that they reached the alien, she was passed out, a pool of vomit next to her. Quite clearly, the trauma of the crash has led to some rather nasty physical injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... are you sure this is such a good idea? I mean... she's not exactly... human... is she? Won't the government or something come after us now?\" Said Tom, glancing nervously at the comatose girl stretched out in the back seat of the van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, stop being so paranoid, Tommygun. Life isn't like those films on the silverscreen! We'll just take her back home, get her fixed up, and then we can tell someone about her. Besides, it just would be inhospitable not to take a victim in! Good Samaritan and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas is big. Exceedingly so. Even given the vast amount of time consumed in the drive from central Texas to a small suburban community on the outskirts of Houston, Meitnerium only awoke after they had arrived at home.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes tightly shut, clenching even tighter together at the awful cacophony, she rolled over on her side and away from this pesky early bird. But he persisted, simply moving his stupid face closer towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he asked again, this time more direct in his approach, \"Miss Extraterrestrial, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Meitnerium rolled over to face her bothersome savior. With great pain, she unbolted her eyelids and braved the light that would surely jump at the chance to attack her killer headache. She looked his face up and down; glasses, mustache, somewhat balding. Yeah, this was definitely not what she expected. The slumbering celestial body let out a low groan as the impact took its toll on her now conscious body, mostly resulting in a migraine and a universally sore feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you understand me?\" he dragged the words out a mile long and gesticulated their meaning the best he could, \"Arrrre yoooou feeeeeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of the room, still thumbing away at his cellular, Tom decided to speak up. \"Of course she doesn't understand you Dad.\" he said with a distinct tone of realistic confidence, \"She's from another planet, she probably speaks a whole different language.\" His father, undaunted by his son's cynical view, persisted at attempting to communicate with the new house guest. He resumed his exaggerated speech, \"Weeee fooound yoooou in-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium simply couldn't take another second of this drek. She grabbed at one of his signing hands and held them still, \"I get it, thanks for the rescue.\" she said curtly, her expression much like that of a woman her age getting over a nasty hangover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of anger, or even the intended notion of shutting up, the older gentleman's expression changed to one of almost childlike bewilderment. \"T-Tom Turkey, did you hear that?!\" he spoke of her like she was a toddler learning her first words, \"Sh-She just talked!\" Curiosity peaked, Tom decided to slide his phone back into his pocket and inspect this visitor from the stars with his own eyes. \"Hey, yeah, she did...\" he said, mildly curious at the strange being placed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do a lot of other tricks too.\" Meitnerium replied snidely, \"Now who's gonna tell me what happened to my-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it might be her antennae?\" the father continued fawning over his new discovery with glee, \"Maybe picking up the individual sound waves through some sort of telekinesis, then carrying directly to her brain where she pieces out the information?\" he reached out to touch one, \"She may very well be omnilingual!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium smacked his hand away, \"Hey, watch it creep!\" she barked, \"Don't make me call the cops.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, the green-tinted invader reached into the pocket of her now tattered jeans and pulled out her still intact cellular. Due to the high pressure gravities of most planets, phones in most systems -depending on service provider- had been made extra durable so that they may work correctly in many different climates, sort of like Roaming. However, one thing not installed in this technical masterpiece, was the ability to pick up the primitive transmission signals that radiated from the towers across this Faithforsaken planet had. In short; no bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frickin' Faith!\" Meitnerium shouted, now sitting up and brushing off the blanket placed with care as she stared down her phone in hopes of scaring up some signal.</span></div></div>",

Running a short diagnostic on herself she found her body required sustenance. Surely this strange planet at least had food pills, carbon based life did have to eat and all, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank  you both for your brave rescue but more to the point do the life forms here possess food pills?\u201d she asked adjusting herself and trying to gain her bearings to the Earthling\u2019s couch. Judging from both of their faces they didn\u2019t seem to catch her drift. So uneducated these people were, oh well they had helped her out she tried again.<br>\r\n\u201cNutrients for nourishment?\u201d she states again sounding like an earthling mother as she explained something to her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to make a connection with the older one, as his face lit up as he said \u201cNurishment! Heck we got plenty of that! Heck you must be starved, did you miss dinner?\u201d He was talking a mile a minute now trying to help her out anyway he could. \u201cHey Tom-tom, drum us up some of that chili we mad and maybe some cornbread. Don\u2019t worry girl we\u2019ll put some meat on your bones\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle age man ushered her into the kitchen where she found herself sitting in a chair, which strangely touched the ground unlike the hover seats of her home world. <br>\r\nSoon a smell unlike any other she\u2019d ever known filled the room.  Dark and spicy like a taco flavored food pill, but 1000x more palatable. A bowl of strange chunky red brew was set before her and the father and son pair watched intently seeing what she would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in frickin\u2019 faith was this stuff?  Meitnerium wondered. Could this possibly be the \u201cmud\u201d substance she\u2019d read about? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad she\u2019s not-\u201c Tom started seeing their new guest looked quite confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush  Tom-mato\u201d his dad cut him off, \u201cDon\u2019t  you think she knows what food is?\u201d He waited a few seconds more before he scuttled forward slowly to not scare her and taking the silver spoon next to the bowl he plunged it deep into the bowl and held it to her pursed lips. \u201cHere this is food, now say, Ahhh\u201d he said demonstrating the action of opening one\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, they expected her to put this stuff in her mouth? Disgusting! Nothing but food pills and the occasional boyfriend\u2019s tongues passed through these lips\u2026Well, actually\u2026 the stuff did smell pretty good...Maybe just one bite of the strange stuff just to say she did to her friends back at home. She opened her mouth into a small O shape so the father figure could gently place the stuff into her mouth, he then stepped back to watch the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Meitnerium was taken to a world unlike any other she\u2019d ever know.  This unusual thing called food was AMAZING! She could taste and analyze the flavorings to the smallest detail, this intriguing creation had not used artificial computer-designed molecules, but an actual raw ingredients! These flavors were absolute; no assemblage of molecules may duplicate the complexity of actually eating living organism. The pills and there artificial computer-designed food flavorings were much in demand to  the point of shunning \"natural\" food grown in \"dirt\" This was something  new and radical to her. Not taking a second to stop and chat with her saviors, they could only sit and watch as she voraciously cleaned her bowl spoonful after spoonful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow bowl empty, and with a smudge of red chili on the slight of green skin around her lips, she breathed a sigh of content before asking. Never before had she actually felt full, physically full, as in her stomach had absolutely no more room inside of it, only knowing the \"feeling of full\" that food pills brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had definitely warmed up to this place, and found herself asking\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oddly enough, she found herself watching this relatively simple concept studiously, as if to memorize the process and search for some sort of secret art in \"drumming up\" some food. But no, there was no mystery to it; he put the ladle  in the pot, emerged with a big bowl full of that red-brown slop and poured it into the bowl just like lemonade. Before she knew it, Meitnerium was greeted with another steaming bowl of chili eagerly waiting to be eaten. She was never one to turn down free nourishment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their green-skinned house guest began choking down her food, Tom and his father could do little more than watch as she slurped spoonful after spoonful past those full green lips of hers. \"Dang, you weren't kidding when you said you were hungry!\" the patriarch of the ranch style rambler said in an amused tone, \"I think we might need to get this girl a bigger bowl next time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the two men, however, was not so easily taken in. Having grown up with movies like E.T. and My Favorite Martian influenced a young man from very early in his life. While not xenophobic in the general sense of the word, Tom found it very offsetting that his father was just so willingly opening his arms up to a being who had -quite literally- fallen from nowhere and into their laps. He tapped his father on the shoulder, bringing him aside to discuss their pigmented squatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad... I just... what's up with... this?\" struggling to find the words that quite described the current situation, Tom lightly gesticulated in Meitnerium's general direction. In a hushed tone, he continued, \"I mean, what if, you know, she's like... just what the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father, ever the easy-going man that he was, placed a comforting hand on his son's shoulder. \"Take it easy Tom, we're just helping out someone in need of a hand; just like if she were human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Dad, the thing is... she's not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider her a room mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's an alien!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's pretty obvious by now, Tom Cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, all I'm asking is 'what do we do when her big green emperor overlord father comes down and thinks we've been holding her hostage'; or what if she gets sick and almost dies because she's allergic to chili and we have a whole army of flying saucers destroying Earth because we killed some kind of alien princess?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, that Stephen King really warped your little mind.\" his father responded casually, \"Don't worry, we'll just look after her until she catches a ride home, this might be a good thing for Earth though, connecting us with other intelligent life forms may just knock us down a few pegs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both of them turned just in time to be met with the sound of silverware clanging against ceramic dishware. \"Tom, could you get the lady another bowl?\" the balding Texan asked politely, \"And some cornbread too, its in the fridge behind the milk.\" Tom rolled his eyes, \"Yeah sure thing Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium found herself observing the strange customs of this teeny blue planet with raised eyebrows. Apparently, the already established lack of food pills was not met with individual storage compartments, but everything was all stored into one big, bulky, non-compressible unit. Weird. However, not such a bad idea now that she thought about it, especially if it could keep whatever this chili stuff was inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss, I'm... um, not too sure how to start.\" the older gentleman said from across the table, \"I'm Harry, and that's my son Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium's attention was divided between the arrival of her third helping and her savior. \"Mph, Meitnu'ium.\" she garbled through a mouthful of beans and chilies. \"E-Excuse me, I didn't quite catch that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe swallowed, \"My name's Meitnerium, sorry this stuff is really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No bother.\" Harry said, politely gesturing her to continue eating at her own pace, \"If you wouldn't mind... where are you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metalement Galaxy, it's a bit of a drive from here.\" she cut him off not to be rude but to spare him the embarrassment of asking, \"I mean, this is way out of the way for me, if my college professor hadn't transferred me, I probably would have never even been anywhere close to these last few galaxies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Galaxies?\" Harry stammered, \"You've seen... Galax<b>ies</b>, as in plural?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I've had my license for about four years now so I've got a lot of driving done.\" Meitnerium said casually as she eyed the spongy loaf of corn bread next to her bowl, \"There was this one time where me and my friend Astatine wanted to go to the Uranium Beaches of Sats in the Galaxy of Bloop, but it was just me and her in that big SUV of hers, right, so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sorry for interrupting.\" Harry said with furrowed brow, \"SUV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Space Utility Vehicle.\" Meitnerium said, somewhat perturbed by his lack of intelligence, \"So we totally picked up some college guys and we-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" Tom, who was safely positioned behind the kitchen counter in case of lasers, piped in for the first time, \"You said you were in college, do they actually have schools in space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say!\" Harry seemed elated, discovering that life up in the stars wasn't so different from life here on Earth, \"Tommy Gun's majoring in economics!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, don't call me-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you majoring in Miss... um, Meitnerium was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cosmetology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that some kind of study of space, stars, constellations-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hair, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On <i>Earth</i>, but we have no idea what it could mean to someone from Meitnerium's-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's really hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"</span></div></div>",

But boy, what a trip this \"food\" stuff was! It was just like food pills, sans the pill, with the exact same effect of fullness that she was left with afterwords. However, there was something more to it. A substance that lacked simply popping a pill or two into your mouth and being done with it. This spiciness was real, not synthesized. Luckily her slender alien tongue was familiar in spicy tastes thanks to a trip a little south of her home world's border into Little Mexicarium. But substance and organic taste wasn't the only thing different, she could feel her stomach's capacity as it pressed against her cardigan, a warm wave flushing through her as the piping hot chili slowly filled her up to the brim. Soon enough, she was full and out of interest. Suddenly, she just wanted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, she was getting tired just as the sun had started to rise. The interstellar being let out a loud yawn and stretched, the contents of her full tummy bulging out from underneath her top as she arched her back. \"Look fellas.\" she said in a rather flat tone that reflected just how bored she had grown with the constant barraging of questions, \"You cook a mean \"chili\", but its late, and I should really get some sleep before I head out.\" she said in a somewhat rude tone of voice, allowing one slender green hand to fall down to her midsection and tentatively touch her bloated belly. \"Hey, no problem!\" Harry said whimsically, \"We Earth folk pretty much get out and about during the day, you can take the spare bedroom and take in a quick nap before you ship off.\" Tom could only roll his eyes at the thought of this alien... this enticingly angloid alien at that... being invited so willingly into their happy home. But, Dad was Dad. Nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium seemed satisfied enough, her response an unconvincing \"Great!\" as she stood up from her place at the table. She actually wasn't too thrilled at the prospect of sleeping in anything that wasn't her bed at home, just as anyone would be. But she would make due, she had driven home sleepy and she had driven home drunk. Drunk was a lot better with her. \"Just down the hall, first door on the right.\" Harry said happily, \"Need anything before you fall asleep?\" he inquired, \"Extra pillow, blanket, glass of water?\" Tom resisted the urge to reference 'Signs', simply because it was a bad movie that really made little sense to him. \"Nope, I'm just gonna get to sleep.\" she said flatly, \"I'll probably leave right after I wake up, so... yeah, thanks again for the chili.\" she said hurriedly. Harry smiled, \"Don't thank me, thank the Missus! Think you could meet her before you head out? She's never going to believe this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises... so yeah... thanks um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry and Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiight... g'night!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quietly entering the designated room \u201cM\u201d found herself in the cramped quarters that were the house\u2019s modest guest room. The small size didn\u2019t matter to her right now for the only thing occupying her mind was sleep. Finding the bed to be strangely made of sponge unlike her firmer bed at home, she had no trouble getting to sleep, enjoying the way her frame softly sank into the relaxing mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat well deserved sleep seemed to last forever as the visitor\u2019s first and possibly last meal here on earth worked its way through her system. Unbeknownst to her (and her entire race for that matter) Meitnerium\u2019s body was simply not familiar with food. Long, long ago her species had once dined on actual meals, but now as the population advanced further and further with technology it simply left no time for one to sit down for meals. Food pills had been the obvious answer and so a good millennium or two had passed without anyone ever having partaken in such wholesome foods like those of Earth. This biological adaptation to food pills had also brought an unknown consequence to her race,  with their bodies trained for the digestion day long of food pills, had meant that Meitnerium would have a slow metabolism rate of next to nothing if they ever did eat <i>\u201creal\u201d</i> non synthetic food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not to say Meitneriu\u2019s body rejected what it had devoured, no far from it in fact! The filling chili had been put right to work in her small stomach, her body instinctively storing the calories and spreading it quickly into the smallest little layer of pudge onto the green gorgeous body.  This first sampling of food would act as a stimulus for her stomach; giving \u201cM\u201d a feeling her race had never felt for a long time:<b> hunger. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakening from her warm dreamless slumber, Meitnerium felt completely recharged and filled with energy. Looking at the clock it seemed to be five in the afternoon Earth time. Rising from underneath the blankets she failed to notice only the slightest little bit of change in her physique, much to preoccupied with thoughts of getting of this strange ball of dirt and water she found herself on. She twisted the small room\u2019s door open and slowly stepped about the house finding it quiet and quite empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom and the others must still be out\u201d she imagined and Meitnerium was right as Harry was working pre-obligated for overtime that day at work otherwise he would have hurried home as soon as possible to check on his house guest. Tom seemed absent as well; perhaps busy with a test at one of his later college classes. And the \u201cMissus\u201d seemed vacated from the premises as well. Harry seemed to trust her enough that she could \u201clet herself out\u201d  without supervision, almost like she was nothing more than a hotel guest. She shrugged and headed to leave ready to get her ship and get out of this galaxy, when one certain word on a nondescript box caught her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwonkies?\u201d  She said out loud, her ability to read human English not as finely tuned as her ability to communicate it just yet. She took a step towards the kitchen table where the box lay. The word was odd, an old old cuss word in her native tongue, but somehow humans had written it down and it seemed to refer to the strange food inside the box, this puzzled her. Setting the box down she saw there was a pre-packaged miniature feast of food set out for her on the table. On top of the spread was a note which she promptly read, this time focusing her English reading abilities so to understand every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Ms. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Meitnarim</span> <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Meineriam</span> M. I hope you enjoyed your short stay here on Earth. It was awful nice to meet another life form. We didn\u2019t want to wake you but the family was awful busy this afternoon so we\u2019ll probably be gone when you wake up. I explained everything to the missuses and she didn\u2019t believe me at first, but when I showed her the green guest we had sleeping in our house she seemed to take it well enough. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to meet her she loves to see people enjoy her cooking. She thought we ought to through something together for you before you left, it\u2019s just some leftovers we had lying about, and with some stuff  I got at the store to pack so ya\u2019ll had some snacks for your trip back. Tom said you might like Reese\u2019s pieces for some reason so there\u2019s a king size bag for you there too. Just some good old southern hospitality to helpy you on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry of <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> Earth, Texas </span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas, Earth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: Hope ya put in a nice word for Earth with the other aliens, lot of us here are worried ya\u2019ll out there might not think too kindly of us.  Hope you travel safely; and ya\u2019ll come back now ya here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell how nice. \u201cshe said aloud slightly touched by this odd act. She would definitely be taking this \u201cfood\u201d with her and show her friends, and hay maybe she would even stop by Earth again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing first though and that meant getting to the ship, which she knew had to be somewhat of a wreck. But even if it was wrecked maybe she could salvage of a few of her other high tech gizmos and gadgets from home out of it, or at least salvage what was left before some other earthlings turned it into scrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it<i> was</i> still sunny out and she definitely did not want any of the other local wildlife spotting her. She might just have to stay and sample a few of these leftovers and other snacks this family had so thoughtfully left  for her, she really wanted to try more of this food! Just until it got darker of course then she\u2019d be off, maybe even stay till Harry and the rest get back and say goodbye to the nice family in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a sweet smell emanated from the box of snack cakes, it penetrated M's thoughts making her salivate at just the thought of tasting the treats. She would have to decide quickly, she would...</span></div></div>",

Just for a little while, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll... it's not like my car's <i>going</i> anywhere.\" Meitnerium said slyly as she shifted her gaze over to a box of these impolitely named snack treats, \"And besides, I should really thank these guys in person.\" Her slender green fingers fumbled with the tricky packaging of the confounded 'Twonkies' box, \"That Harry guy <i>really </i>wants me to meet his wife too, I guess that means I'll have to stick around until <i>she</i> gets home.\" the little green glutton stared down the clear marketing freshness shield of what appeared to be a small sponge, \"And I don't really know what goes on here at night too well, they'll have to come and protect me, better wait till -what'shisface... Tom gets here too.\" finally she lifted the small Earth pastry to her mouth. Dropping rationalization for sticking around a little longer, she sunk her pearly whites into the spongy delight and chewed, her deprived taste buds exploding with euphoria as she tasted yet another Earthling delight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twonkie was soft and spongy as previously foretold by Meitnerium's exploratory fondling, but beneath its squishy yellow exterior lay an ivory goldmine of a slick sugary delight that slid so smoothly down her throat. It was thick, her inexperience with chewing nearly choking her as the Twonkie almost lodged itself in her slender esophagus, though after the struggle it's aftertaste -akin to that of a poundcake pill- swam back up to tease her tongue of more, more, more! She looked back at the decapitated pastry, white ooze spilling from the deep flesh wound she had given it. Then she looked into its colony pod, eleven more of its kind lay sleeping in the same plastic shield- ready to be devoured at any instant. A wide grin crossed her slender green face as she stuffed the remaining victim into her mouth at once, her cheeks bulging with masticated Earth goo as she chewed this delicious edible sponge for all it was worth before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVigor revitalized, Meitnerium began tearing into her parting gift like a woman of half her sense and double her weight. She grabbed the second one and opened it with much more ease than the first, ripping into it in a familiar fashion and devouring the unsuspecting little delicacy like a woman possessed! \"Mmm... say what you want about Earth people!\" Meitnerium said to herself, \"These hicks sure do know good food!\" And with that, she started on her third Twonkie. And then her fourth. By the fifth, she realized that there was a perfectly comfortable chair to sit on <i>right</i> by all that food on the table and promptly relocated herself there. By her eighth mispronounced portion, Meitnerium had shown no signs of slowing down, going even faster as she began om-nomming through her ninth, eleventh, and finally last Twonkie of the box. The little green lass, never really one for moderation, immediately scanned her hoard for another box; only finding one other box to fit her tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one depicted a noticeably darker foodstuff with white tribal markings on its topmost layer. Meitnerium inspected the box, sounding the brand name out the best her lack of pronounciational skills could muster. \"Hoo... hoos...\" she dragged the words out a mile long before giving up, choosing instead to eat her food rather than read it. Slender fingers tore open what poor safety packaging this brown little treat had to offer before she shoved the whole thing into her awaiting maw. This one had a much different outer layer, though it and the Twonkie breed shared the same inner complexion. Either way, they were delicious. The size was a little cumbersome, Meitnerium masticated her little heart out to refrain from choking on its circumference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might have a new favorite.\" she said wickedly as she ripped open another package...</span></div></div>",

These snack cake things were a scientific anomaly, seemingly lighter than air but yet quite dense on the inside with gooey mass. Mass! The food here had texture and mass something no run of the mill food pill could ever recreate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long till the box was empty, and the chocolate taste had disappeared as fast as it came. Her stomach still demanded more, almost as if she had no control over this new found urge of hunger. She lunged at big orange bag and read the title aloud again stretching out almost every syllable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinggg Size Bag of Reka\u2019s Pieces?\u201d she attempted.  Well enough reading. She neatly ripped into the bag but at first was disappointed at what she saw.  These\u2026these were miniscule, definitely not the king size treats the bag had proclaimed.  She held one of the tiny treats in her palm and the set it back down on the table in disgust. Well there sure were a lot in the bag, and it\u2019s now like she\u2019d know what else there was to eat around here. Seeing no other recourse she decided to try one. She slipped a single bright yellow colored \u201cpiece\u201d into her mouth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph!\u201d she grumbled. Her eyes lit up at the taste, there was a flavor here not unlike the one on the hoo hoo\u2019s, but there was more. That flavor was here and yet there was something more with it something that served to enhance it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately had one more letting it melt in her mouth this time. Wonderful! Perhaps another new favorite even! But so small to eat the whole bag would be quite tiresome, unless\u2026 Wait. What if she were to take a handful? She giddily attempted the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFricking Faith! It was a success! A delicious delicious success!  Feeling very clever as she began swallowing them down by handfuls she was barely chewing. The next few moments became a blur of chewing swallowing and chocolate peanut butter delight for her, only wakening from the daze she was in by the startling sound of the clock signaling that it was now almost 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakened from her gorging she grew self-aware of the wrappers about her which served as a testament to her ravaging ravenousness. She really had finished the entire mini-feast/gift, even making sure to get every bit of chocolate and cr\u00e8me that had been smudged around her lips and fingers. Then locating a nearby trash receptacle she quickly took care of all of evidence of her mess. As she emptied the wrappers in the garbage she caught sight of her distended stomach. Whoa-  is what she was about to say, when the front door to the house was opened instantly wiping the sight from her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, your still here!\u201d came the unmistakably cheery voice of Harry. He ushered his wife in who was only slightly taken aback by the green good looker before her. \u201cHoney I\u2019d like you to meet Ms. Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitnerium, nice to meet you\u201d she said extending a green hand outwards in good faith. Harry\u2019s wife shook daintily and then smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you too, Harry\u2019s told me all about you.\u201d she said straightforwardly and warmly. \u201cOh my, I take it you found the snacks?\u201d she asked noticing the empty table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh the gifts are safely stored\u201d Meitnerium lied pulling the mysterious alien card. Well half lied, she herself really had no idea where she was putting it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh\u2026 Great! I imagine you didn\u2019t get the chance to get into them, so you must be starving! Does dinner sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d she exclaimed eagerly, knowing she would do a lot more than lie to get another chance at food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Harry, what should I make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter honey. Maybe a little of this a little of that, give her a little taste of everything.\u201d Harry reassured his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh that's a perfect idea! I\u2019m going to get the first food review from outer space!\u201d she giggled excitedly as she headed into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you....she just loves cooking!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meitnerium's attention was focused elsewhere, away from this silly little Earth man and his inquiries. The tantalizing thought of \"a little bit of everything\" was music to her green little ears as Meitnerium imagined just what \"everything\" could mean to a girl like her! That chili stuff was good, those twonkies spectacular, hoo hoo's superb and those pieces sublime! Perhaps there was some sort of art in combining all these tastes into one super dish? No, that was silly; it would taste terrible... maybe. It was more likely that there were simply more tastes out there for Meitnerium to experience rather than the first handful she had come across. It excited her to think of what culinary wonders the modest Texas wife could be concocting in front of that \"oven\" thing of hers, struggling to hold back the floodgates on her drooling jaw as images of her repertoire of already sampled cuisines filled her imagination...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo?\" Harry leaned in slightly, trying to catch his squatter's attention, \"Ground Control to Major Meitty?\" he joked, \"You alright in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Meitnerium snapped back to attention, her dreams of cornbread and candy bursting for the time being. \"Hmm, what?\" she asked blankly as she struggled to peek into the kitchen past the balding Texan. \"Well finally, I was starting to worry maybe you were gonna lunge past me to get at my wife's cooking!\" he chuckled, \"Anyway, I wanted to know if you wanted to check out what's left of your ship while my wife's cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While your wife cooks?\" Meitnerium's eyes widened in disbelief, \"You mean you people actually have to <i>work</i> to eat, it's not instant?\" There was a slight snort from the kitchen as Harry's wife, Louise, couldn't help but overhear. \"If only, I'd kill not to have slave over a hot stove for hours on end.\" she popped out of the kitchen for a bit as she let the water rise in a too-be-washed pan, \"Harry said something about you having food pills, I guess eating actual food is a new experience for you, isn't it?\" The older gentleman gave a quick peck to his wife's cheek, \"Hey, she might as well experience the best first, right Honey?\" Louise chuckled before batting him off, \"Oh stop, I'm not cooking you hushpuppies- they take too long!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on a sec.\" Meitnerium interrupted, her food-rattled brain managed to grasp onto what meager conversation she and Harry had shared \"Did you say... what's <i>left</i> of my ship?\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"GREAT FRICKIN' FAITH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut here, maybe an hour or so from Harry's happy home, a large crater had formed little less than twenty four hours ago. As one might have guessed by now, it was the obvious result of Meitnerium's Porschette breaking through our atmosphere. It was a hole just a little bigger than the car itself, maybe a foot or two wider than where the fender initially impacted due to a super light space-safe material. Thankfully the accident had occurred out in a rather barren part of Texas instead of traveling just a few dozen miles over into town. Perhaps had the brave vehicle made that quantum leap, then the results may have been less devastating. However no, it did not. And the results were quite devastating at that, Meitnerium could attest to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front had made the most impact, taking a complete nosedive into the planet's surface. As such, the relative accordion effect that had resulted was understandable. The bright red paint of her once gallant steed had been mussed and scratched off in places, despite the extra coating of atmospheric protection wax that her Daddy had splurged on. All four tires were flat, every window broken if not destroyed, both doors forced open, and the exhaust pipe had exploded due to a large chunk of space rock lodged in it's cold dead cylindrical walls. Even by extraterrestrial standards, this car was totaled. \"Oh man, Daddy's gonna kill me!\" Meitnerium whined as she continued pacing about the crash site, her still taut tummy bobbing up and down slightly with each step, \"He told me that if I get into even one wreck -just <b>one</b>!- then he's taking away my license!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have some kind of location device in there?\" Harry asked, taking a look at this strange vehicle from beyond the stars, \"I mean, even Tom's got a GPS.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my UPS module's busted and I don't think Onstar would pick up my signal out here!\" the fretting alien wailed as she sat down on a nearby rock. \"What am I gonna do?!\" she bellowed to the waking world, \"That car was my only chance at getting home... why didn't you tell me it had all but frickin' exploded?!\" Harry was really at a loss here, he had actually expected something like a transporter badge or a communicator that would beam up his green little houseguest. But years of sci-fi television had led him astray- Kirk and Picard being the only real inspiration for interstellar lifestyles really didn't seem like such a good idea at this point. Now here she was, little Meitty all alone with no one to turn to and stranded on an unfamiliar planet with no family or friends... it really had to suck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Meitty.\" Harry sat down beside the sobbing extra terrestrial on her rock, placing a fatherly hand on her shaking shoulders. \"What?!\" she barked back, \"Just freakin' what?!\" she wiped her spillage with the back of her hand as she faced the kindly Texan with misdirected fury in her eyes. \"I know a guy, I don't know how good of a job he'll do on a foreign car that's... well, quite <i>this</i> foreign, but I think I could get him to take a look at this for ya.\" he smiled behind his mustache, \"And until he gets it fixed, you could always stay with me and my family.\" Her quivering green eyes turned away, \"I don't <i>want</i> to stay with your family!\" she sobbed heavily, \"I just... I just want to go home right now! I miss my family and all my friends!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knowingly brought the frightened little angloid into his arms for a big fatherly hug. \"Hey, hey, I understand.\" he said softly, \"I wouldn't wanna share a roof with me either, I'm amazed my wife puts up with me.\" he joked, even Meitnerium had to laugh a little bit at his corny old guy humor. \"But there's nothing else you can do but wait Meitty, and we at the Parker household would be honored to put you up until we can get you back home.\" after a short fit of intense sobbing, Meitnerium looked up and smiled, \"Thanks... you're a pretty nice guy... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Harry.\" she quickly finished her sentence for fear of seeming rude (for once), \"But... I don't know if-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll feed you every night and give you all the love our little blue planet could offer.\" Harry said in a very fatherly tone, \"Trust me, I don't think you're gonna do much better that.\" he smiled wider as he wrapped his arm around the shivering alien girl's shoulder. \"Now come on, we better get home- I'll send my guy out here to tow this away so he can get right to work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, we better get home for dinner.\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately enough Meitnerium had packed a few things for her transfer to the new school and found an airtight high pressure container. Lifting the see through tub from what was left of the trunk end of the car she searched its contents to see take stock of what was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the ever curious Harry joined her side and lifted a neon blue colored sleek striated elongated tube. \u201cWait is this some kind of ray gun?\u201d he asked both confusion and excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a blow dryer.\u201d Meitnerium said flatly, promptly taking it from his hands swiftly and adding it back to her box of doodads. Her irritability had risen up again at the hick and his \u201cinferior intellect\u201d; she was much too upset right now to deal with him right now. She calmed down a bit at the sight of Harry\u2019s shirking figure before adding  much more calmly \u201cLook I don\u2019t have want to explain exactly what everything  in here does, but maybe I can show you later.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, and to show he understood he courteously carried the tub to his car without opening the lid on it once, even though he was downright drooling at the thought of seeing all that alien science and technology. He understood she would be stuck here in the middle of nowhere surrounded by strangers for who knew how long, and that these few private things were all she had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the crash site of what once was her incredibly stylish vehicle, Meitnerium was now quite depressed.  She leaned against the cars window and tried to doze off; barely catching pieces of the conversation Harry was having on his own working cellular device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill\u2026Yeah its Harry, I got a heck of a job for you. Yeah it\u2019s foreign really foreign.  Yeah it\u2019s about an hour west off the freeway past my place, terrible crash, you can\u2019t miss it\u2026.Yeah if you could just tow what\u2019s left and take a look at it\u2026Yeah\u2026No it\u2019s not mine it\u2019s for a friend\u2026.I\u2019ll come by tomorrow and see what ya think of it\u2026.Yeah \u2026O.K then a six-pack on me\u2026 See ya then\u2026.\u201d He promptly hung up and the car grew swiftly silent, leaving Meitnerium alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought over the wild and crazy day she had just had she realized she could be in worse situations: she could have been stranded on an empty barren planet, or heck even dead on the wrong side of the black hole. Then again considering what her father might do to her, death might have been the better option. For now though she had \u201cdiscovered \u201ca planet that had this wonderful extraordinarily blissful food and this nice if slightly odd family had taken her in without any second questions she was very lucky for that. She couldn\u2019t think of a lot of people that would do that on her home world, let alone for a stranded alien.  Hmmm, what could she do as a sign of thanks? Ah Ha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Harry, was it?\u201d she began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hehe, Did I wake you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry apologized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s fine. Uh, here.\u201d She said blankly, and she fished into her pocket pulling out a single brownish tablet. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the food pills I was telling you about; I found a few left and it\u2019s not much but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww shucks you don\u2019t need to thank me. It\u2019s what anyone would do.  Sides\u2019 it might be nice to have someone else around the house now that Tom Glum\u2019s gone all <i>moody</i> on me.\u201d He stared blankly at the pill hesitant to except the strange offering. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow up like a berry if I eat this am I?\u201d he asked her deadly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a food pill, you know, protein, glucose, and all that.\u201d She assured him (\u201cHonestly where did this hick get such strange ideas?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell heck I\u2019ll try anything once. Thank you Meitty.\u201d He gulped it in a single swallow. \u201cHmm, is that, Bacon?\u201d he pondered out loud. His voice rose as he continued\u2026 \u201cWell hey that\u2019s really something! He smacked his lips together and ran his tongue around them. It was strange to Harry, though it wasn\u2019t exactly bacon he could barely taste the essence, almost like it was a ghost of a piece of bacon he had had that morning. He smiled at the fact that it seemed to last with him, and that he had probably the first human who ever received a gift from an alien, something he\u2019d  once only dreamed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were home and they entered the house where even more new smells filled the air. Meitnerium wondered was there a fire here? It certainly smelled like a smoke was coming from somewhere in the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Mmmm</i> Louise must have just got done with some Barbeque.\u201d Harry said whiffing the air. His calm demeanor letting Meitnerium know that this was a normal smell here on Earth, and breathing deeper she found the smell did possess a fragrant dark sensation to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, great your back how was the ship?\u201d Louise immediately asked as she emerged from the kitchen smothering Harry in a big hug.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was totally busted, and she\u2019s a little down about it\u201d Harry said returning the hug. \u201cShe managed to get some of her things out of it though, and Bill said he would take a look at it at least but I don\u2019t think...\u201d He trailed off not wanting to further dower his guest\u2019s gloominess with his negative predictions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Well I hope you at least came hungry!\u201d Louise said not missing a beat. Her attitude returned the warmth to the house and filled Meitnerium  with a  sense of welcoming mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually, I don\u2019t know how to say this honey but\u2026 I\u2019m actually pretty full\u2026\u201d Harry said dumbfounded himself as he tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>WHAT</b>!? You of all people passing  up on <i>my</i> cooking?\u201d Louise asked slightly shocked.  Mettieranium too was surprised by this fact. Usually she could a pill or two like they were nothing, maybe even three or four at a time if she really wanted to make a pig of herself. If someone who ate real food eater was full after just one, did at mean she could eat four times as much as a regular earthling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry baby\u201d Harry continued, \u201cbut well, Meitty here had found some leftover of her food pills, and you know me I just had to try one. Let me say that the most certainly do work. It was pretty neat to try one; I feel like I just got done with one of your three course meal breakfast, not bloated but just perfectly full, and there was this tiny little trace of bacon or uh, something like it.\u201d He described to his wife as best as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise seemed to understand it wasn\u2019t the weirdest thing she\u2019d been told over the last twenty four hours. \u201cWell if you say so sugar\u2026 I guess that means more for the rest of us right Meitty. She smiled brightly at the voracious extraterrestrial. \u201cYou sure I can\u2019t get you anything Harry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, maybe just a glass of milk for me dear, and oh maybe some for Meitty too. I might get some of the leftovers tomorrow, but <i>haha</i>, then again with the way Meitty ate last night maybe not.\u201d He added as he took a seat at the head of the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOk then.\u201d Louise said as she turned back towards the kitchen, but then she quickly pirouetted around and faced Meitnerium. \u201cOh and by the way dear\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wash up? What the Faith did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Meitnerium's planet, mealtimes were usually spent individually and generally at whatever spare second or two their busy days would grant them. This allowed more time to word, study, play video games, chat with friends, or anything else that fell under the blanket category of \"whatever\". This had proved to be a great thing, productivity was up and the fixed serving size in each pill prevented Metaleans from overeating. While they were a species quite rehearsed in the general topic of cleanliness, due to their reliance on simply popping in their required nourishment for the day, the concept of \"washing up\" had been phased out almost entirely. On Metalement, you took your shower either in the morning or at night -boiling down to a simple matter of preference, children still weren't too fond of bathing there either- and you went about your cycle until the time came for another bathing session or whenever you felt it necessary. So knowing this, it wasn't too shocking to see Meitnerium gazing blankly at Louise. \"Ummm... what?\" the culture-shaken alien asked with a hint of dissatisfaction, \"Did I step in something? I don't smell that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louise, I think we might have to be a little less willing to throw our vernaculars around.\" Tom chuckled from the head of the table, \"Come on Meitty, I'll give you the rundown.\" the patriarch of the family said kindly as he lifted himself from the seat. Meitnerium followed him down the hall and into a room on the left. \"So you ust run your hands under the water with a little soap and that's it.\" Harry explained thoroughly. \"That's it?\" Meitnerium parroted, \"That's it.\" With a flick of the primitive \"light switch\", the room was illuminated in an instant, revealing an ever-useful fixture that even Meitnerium had recognized. \"Thanks, but I am <b>not</b> doing anything in <i>that</i>.\" Meitnerium said indignantly as she gestured to the porcelain throne next to the tub, \"I mean, that's just sick, on <i>my</i> planet, we use that when we have to-\" she was cut off by a simple gesture: Harry stepping aside and showing her a strange Earth bathroom fixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry, my bad.\" Meitnerium apologized halfheartedly as she was ushered in front of this strange indent in the counter's top. It was pearly white and kept very clean, whatever it was. There was a silver trunk stretching from the back of the mouth and stopping halfway down to it's surface. On either side, there were two handles left unlabeled, perhaps to grab onto like a motorcycle? She pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes at the strange contraption as her admittedly not-too-intuitive mind started to work. Deciding that her motorcycle idea was the closest she would get, her slender green grabbers stretched out and touched both handles. As she pulled, she found that they did not come closer, as she expected, but instead they turned together, as in towards each other. Startling enough, a surge of water spewed from the nostril of the immovable metallic hose and splashed Meitnerium on the lowest part of her torso. \"Oh Faith!\" she shouted as she recoiled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly, Harry simply outstretched his hand and turned one nozzle completely to the left and the other slightly to the opposite direction. The powerful torrent immediately slowed its pace until it was a tranquil trickling that gently fell into the drain. \"It's called a sink, on our planet we use these to wash off specific parts of our body.\" Harry explained dutifully, now pointing to the small pump like device to the left of the fixture, \"That's soap specifically made for our hands, so we get a little-\" here he gave the nozzle a quick two pumps and allowed it to sneeze all over his hand, \"-and then we rub it in, and wash it off in the sink.\" Meitnerium observed flatly, her expression cold and calculating. Liquid soap... actually not a bad idea. Some men on her planet used body wash, was it kind of like that?<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nAnyway, on with the main attraction: dinner. As promised, said course had already been prepared and was ready by the time Meitnerium had emerged from the strangely adorned Earth bathroom. The smell, now stronger than ever, hit her green little nose like a bag full of bricks as she grew closer and closer to the source. The source of course being the kitchen. And as Mrs. Parker's frame had been removed from its place in front of the stovetop, Meitnerium could now adequately see just what she had been cooking for so long. It looked to be the bones of a moderately sized animal, specifically the ribcage sans the solar plexus, drenched in a red sauce and allowed to stew. It seemed that the ribs had been cooked beforehand and slathered in said topping afterwords, so they weren't entirely basted in their own juices. However, these observations were of course lost to the gluttonous alien; as her thoughts were simply that whatever it was looked absolutely fan-freakin'-tastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself begin to salivate as she drank in the sight of another wonderful Earth bounty, despite gorging herself little less than three hours ago on junk food. Her lithe alien body had had its fill of the previous helping, now it wanted <i>more</i>. She slowly opened her mouth, hoping to get some insight on what Faith had graced her plate with. But she was so taken with the meal that all that seemed to come out was a mindless stutter; her eyes never leaving the pile of animal parts for a second. Louise, from the counter whipping some microwavable mashed potatoes into edible shape, smiled. \"Well I'm glad to see that my food gets Meitty's stamp of approval!\" she seemed tickled, placing her bowl on the table top and walking over to her tenant's side. \"Wha-what is that?\" Meitnerium was practically choking on her own words, her tongue more of an obstacle than a feature to her mouth. \"That is barbecue ribs, made from scratch.\" the housewife said with pride, \"Usually I have time to let them marinate in barbecue sauce for a few hours, but I figured you wouldn't mind if I just cooked up some ribs and slapped on some sauce, Meitty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium could only smile, \"No way, I don't mind a bit!\" she said with genuine enthusiasm, \"This looks so good, I-I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have as much as you'd like, just sit at the table and I'll get you a plate.\" Louise said happily, scooting the young visitor to her seat at the dinner table. \"Shouldn't we be waiting on Tommyknocker?\" Harry piped up, \"Oh no, he said he'd be out with Jerri again. He won't be home until late.\" Louise pish-poshed as she delivered the long-awaited platter to Meitnerium, who immediately got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving only tasted a small sample of whatever tastes Earth had to offer before, Meitnerium was understandably wary on simply inhaling anything placed in front of her. She used her dainty fingers to grab at the carcass, a little surprised at the primitiveness of the meal in that you actually had to <i>rip</i> your helping off of the main serving. With a little difficulty, Meitnerium had salvaged a respectable chunk for herself and slowly lifted it to her mouth,turning her head slightly in order to get a better bite of meat. As she chewed, spitting out a lock of her long white hair that had swooped into the side of her mouth at the last second, the familiar sensation of reality and depth hit her taste buds. The meat, while thick and not nearly as sweet as anything else she'd eaten today, had a very chewable texture. It wasn't chew{i)-y by any means, just being the first actual meal she'd eaten on Earth besides cornbread that Meitnerium had actually been required to chew before swallowing. It was juicy, the supposed natural flavors of the meat blending in seamlessly with whatever glorious topping Mrs. Parker had graced it with. She swallowed, it rolled downhill roughly, but settled in the pit of her stomach as it radiated a certain warmth and a hint of spiciness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking precautions, Meitnerium pushed her long white hair back over her shoulder and started tearing into the meat. She ravaged it, very much like an animal that would have killed this pig in the wild. Accidentally, her finger had picked up a trace of buttery white heaven- the mashed potatoes. They were fluffy, baked, warm, and seemed to send the same radiating feeling of self satisfaction through Meitnerium's body as the main course. \"Oh my goodness!\" Louise said, delighted, \"You really <b>do</b> love Earth food!\" she giggled, \"Here, I'll go get you some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, \"some more\" quickly became \"all but whatever Louise hadn't already laid claim to\". By the end of the night, two hours after initially sitting down, Meitnerium had been stuffed like the hog she had made such quick work of. Harry had left long ago in lieu of a little television before bed, and Louise had taken to cleaning up a little. But Meitnerium just <i>ate</i>. She sat in her chair, pushed back from the table as she reclined in euphoria. Her stomach surged forward as it churned and gurgled in agony; her green skin turned taut as she stuffed that meal on top of her other still only half-digested stuffing. It peeked out from underneath her cardigan, a semicircular dome that was stuffed to the brim with both junk food and some good ol' Texas cooking. Her hands, as well as some areas of her cardigan and the general \"mouth\" area were covered in sauce, and she had the most zoned-out look on her face as she struggled to keep breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Earth food had been pretty good so far...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still in a state of what local Earthling would call a \u201cfood coma\u201d Meitnerium sighed contently as the rich tang of the meat\u2019s sauce continued to flow through her system. She was doubtful if things could get any better than this\u2026this feeling of fullness she had right now in this glorious moment.  She wondered if she was growing addicted to this food stuff, oh who she was kidding she was in love food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Mrs. Parker said returning from the kitchen after cleaning Metiernium\u2019s plate.  \u201cI suppose ya\u2019ll want to wash up now right?\u201d She asked sullied yet satisfied looking Metiernium. \u201cOh, uh, I mean you\u2019ll want to shower. You know<i> show</i>-<i>err</i>?\u201d she corrected herself bringing her fingernails to scratch and scrub her scalp for demonstration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmmm a shower\u2026 that actually sounded really good right now! Metiernium nodded to the most excellent of food makers, gently easing her swollen frame away from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled towards the bathroom, Meitnerium could fully take in her night\u2019s haul. She watched or more importantly felt as her abdominal section usually flat as a board actually had a sort of a bounce to it now as she walked. She let her hands explore this paunch her body now carried around in front of it. Strangely it gave way under her touch giving Meitnerium a sensation that was not quite unpleasant. Interesting, something about her body was strangely\u2026softer. She pushed the thought out of her mind; it was probably due to the planet\u2019s different gravity anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium\u2019s mind refocused on getting clean as she reentered the bathroom, she felt like showers shouldn\u2019t be too different to figure out here compared to back home. She shortly stripped herself of her well-worn clothes and after only faintly observing the slightest protuberance her midsection now possessed when she undid the top button on her jeans, Meitnerium stepped into the shower. From there she commanded the signal for hot water thought her antenna by force of habit...nothing. Oh of course it hadn\u2019t worked, Earthlings had not installed antenna controlled devices yet! Well perhaps it was at least voice controlled? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot!\u201d Meitnerium commanded to the blank shower walls. Nope still no water. That\u2019s when she noticed the handles below the shower head much like the handles at the sink. Giving one a twist, just as she had seen Harry do to the sink handles she jumped back as she began to feel warm water jettison upon her. Now she looked about the shower to see what she could clean with Hmm\u2026bar soap, liquid soap\u2026 OH! Shampoo just like home.  Meitnerium reached for the bottle which was bizarrely almost the same green color as her skin, this was far from the ubiquitous pale and white color that was the shampoo of her home world. She shrugged hoping that shampoo that she was now pouring into her hair would be mostly harmless to her hair here on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started lathering her ivory locks Meitnerium was taken aback by another quality of the cleanser; it\u2019s smell. What was this? Even the soap here smelt magnificently sweet, good enough to eat even! Food seemed to be very important here on Earth, it was seemingly everywhere! And why not? Food was probably one of the greatest things Meitnerium had ever discovered! So what exactly was this soap smelling like? Through the shower\u2019s streams and the suds, Meitnerium observed the skin colored bottle closer.  The strange green fruit on the front of the bottle provided a hint; \u201cGreen Apple\u201d it read. She had seen these strange objects in a bowl on the center of the dinner table, although those were red. She thought they were some strange form of Earth art at the time, but if she would have known they had this sort of aroma to them she would had devoured them. Well she might try just a taste of this liquefied green goopy kind, she let a bit of the lather trickle down into her mouth. <span class=\"cgreen\">Yuck!</span> Ok, maybe she wasn\u2019t supposed to eat this stuff; it was still soap, but such sweet-smelling soap at that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shower Metiernium dried herself off with a towel quickly, and scampered into what would be her new room. Searching through the tub Harry had brought from her demolished vehicle, she found that fortuitously her instant-hair dryer lay right on top of the small treasure trove of her possessions. Then after quickly aerating her hair, she searched for any spare outfits. Digging around she pulled out her favorite pair of pink and fuzzy pajamas. She had planned on wearing these for those cold mornings at college or for those nights in with her friends, either way they were in-room only. She\u2019d probably die from embarrassment if anyone other than her closest friends found out she was still wearing these\u2026but she supposed the Parker family wouldn\u2019t care. Considering it was either this, her dirty clothes, or well, naked, Metiernium went with the pink and fluffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So from what she could tell she had only two outfits left. Well, fashion here on Earth (from what she\u2019d seen at least) was much plainer and rustic than that of her hi-tech home world. What was a young fashionable Metalean to do? She supposed if she was going to be stuck here then she\u2019d have to ask the Parker\u2019s for some new clothes, but that would be a problem for later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else did she have here; maybe she could do a little re-decorating to her new room? Oh! A picture of her family! As she placed the holo-picture on a bedside table she sadly realized it might be a long time till she actually got to see her family again, but she was happy to have at least a picture of them around.  Oh, and another! One of her and her friends at Bobba-Jabba-Hoth house, she smiled as she remembered that one crazy night. Thinking about her friends she knew it would be a long time until they realized she hadn\u2019t actually <i>gotten </i>to her new school yet, so it would be quite a while till anyone would be worried about her. Hopefully her Porsche would be fixed before it came to an interstellar search and rescue, but she was beginning to feel that even if  she would be here for a number of Earth days, it wasn't exactly the worse place to stay\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pictures of her family and friends at her side Metiernium felt a lot better now than she had yesterday night, and she even felt a little safer in this new \u201chome\u201d she found herself. Still extremely full she lazily nuzzled into her bed, and slowly sank into another night of warm digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at least on the same sleep cycle as the rest of the house Metiernium awoke the next morning which was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saturday!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Meitnerium's planet, the equivalent of Saturday was usually spent with leisure. Kids would wake up early to watch cartoons, teenagers would either hang out at home or go with friends to the mall, and parents enjoyed the first taste of their weekends by sleeping late. Meitnerium had done it all, having even skipped a stage and going headfirst into the Mall at age 8. But one of the greatest things about skipping that awkward stage of adolescence was that for quite some time now, Meitnerium had grown quite used to sleeping in on those long Saturday mornings. Even during college Meitty never batted an eye open unless it was <i>at least</i> noon. And this habit had been cemented into her everyday weekend schedule, thus becoming a fixated part of her life now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the Saturdays on Earth are noticeably quite similar; moderation being the only key difference. And even then, that wasn't really anything having to do with the two different cultures or even the different species conflicting; moreso as just Meitnerium being a little bit coddled and used to getting her own way a little too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer piercing amber eyes slowly slid open, both eyes and mind still hazy as she fumbled about her new bed. The thick covers suffocated her tiny green form, which kicked ever so slightly in frustration towards the heavy blankets. In her mind she was still in the bedroom of Gallium Brown, half-expecting his muscular toned body to fall back on top of her for another innocent session of sucking face before the heavy stuff came in. However as the interstellar squatter looked around, she slowly regained cognitive abilities enough to recognize her surroundings. She sort of wished that she would have awoken in her bedroom -at least her old dorm room- by now, though the surrender to her new 'home' was made easier by the hazy memories her old knick-knacks brought back. Staying with the Parkers wasn't all bad, Meitnerium was starting to understand that better now... even if they were un-evolved Earth Hicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleepy gaze shifts to the alarm clock provided by her sponsor family; it bore a time that translated very much into what she was accustomed to waking up at, 12:30 in the evening. Defiantly she shifted about in the bed and fought off consciousness for a good five minutes before resigning in her campaign... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium slid out of bed begrudgingly; allowing her green little piglets to touch the carpeting in her guest room, slowly followed by the heels and then balls of her feet as she hit the floor with a slight thud. Looking down, the evidence of Meitnerium's massive binge from yesterday was gone entirely- though, after a good twelve hours of sleep, that food had <i>plenty</i> of time to digest. However, something seemed off. Her stomach was flat again, and her flushed green face had faded. But there was an undeniable feeling of heaviness to her svelt green bod that was almost impossible to ignore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, on top of being spoiled and haughty, Meitnerium was always one to prove the impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps out of her room, still dressed in her fuzzy pink pajamas and eager to devour away at whatever new Earth delicacies Louise had to throw at her!</span></div></div>",

Unless, had someone come to find her? She braved the corner and found that only one human was present in the house today the teen, and her assumption of rescue had been incorrect. What she did find is that they did have a working television here on Earth! She was giving these crude humans more and more credit every day. It\u2019s not like they\u2019d get her favorite shows out here though, shows like \"<span class=\"clred\">\u043e\u0449\u0445\u0445\u044c\u0441\u0443\u0444\u044b</span> Shore\", or \"The Big Explosion Concept\" were still six million light years away from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was equally taken aback with Meitnerium sudden appearance, as well as the alien's appearance; her kinky white frizzed hair and pink pajamas giving her the stereotypical \u201cmorning after\u201d college girl look.

(And was it his imagination or did she always have that little bit of chunk and bounce to her?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill barefooted she sleepily trudged into the room causing Tom to turn the noisy TV off so he could better hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Tom Patterson right?\u201d she mumbled casting a heavy-eyed glance at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Tom <i>Parker</i>,\u201d Tom corrected her. \u201cDad told me to call you Meitty, is that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it works\u201d she said nodding her head. That\u2019s when her eyes lit up noticing the empty bowl and spoon next to where Tom sat. \u201cOh, did Louise make chili?\" She asked instantly perking up at a chance to try the zesty broth again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d Tom laughed, \u201cWell it's a little early for chili, its cereal in the morning around here\u201d he explained.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCereal?\u201d She questioned, obviously oblivious to the term. \u201cWhere are Harry and Louise? Did I miss them \u201cdrumming\u201d some \u201ccereal\u201d up?\u201d she asked attempting to use the Earth lingo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mom and dad are pretty much early birds.\u201d Tom said still a little uneasy around the strange new house guest. \u201cWeekend mornings I usually just crash here right by myself on the couch in front of the TV and have breakfast\u2026Oh, sorry crash was a bad word...They probably won\u2019t be back till dark now that they\u2019re going over to Bill's to check on your car.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d  Meitnerium said aloud as she recognized something; What better way was there to fill ones free time on Earth to sit and feed ones face in front of the TV? But just as quickly as her spirits rose they fell with a sad realization. \u201cSo I missed the food then?\u201d she frowned deeply, a sad and disappointed look coming to her soft amber eyes. The only people she\u2019d ever know to make this food were gone and she\u2019d apparently missed a real treat, now what was she to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s  still food.\u201d Tom assured her, finding himself surprised at how well\u2026human this alien was. As he watched Meitnerium's face turn into a smile now that she would be getting food after all, he could feel himself slowly dropping his hostilities towards her. Sure he\u2019d hardly believed it when his Dad had found her, but if she was really up to something she would have done it when she got here, maybe he<i> could</i> relax a little around her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll go fix you something and we can uh, talk.\u201d Tom got up and Meitty replaced where he had been sitting, sinking into the pre-warmed couch. Heading to the kitchen, Tom\u2019s mind went wild as it searched his banks of alien movie tropes. He tried to plan how the next few days with a female alien would play out in his head: Would she try to escape? Would the government show up? Worse would her parents be angry when the showed up?  His thoughts changed as he saw Miety curled up looking quite cute on the couch in her pink and fluffy pajamas. Maybe things would be more like a lighthearted comedy? Tom imagined her transferring in and posing as a new student in his class or his dad doing the ever clich\u00e9 act of dressing her up, and having to lie about her having a skin condition, well something like that. Back to the breakfast before him, Tom began talking to break the ice with the teen extra-terrestrial as he poured her a bowl of Lucky Charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Mom and Dad still buy me these kiddy cereals.\" He began his small rant. \"It\u2019s like I\u2019m always going to be there baby you know?  I mean some days I\u2019ll have a bowl, but now we\u2019ve got like four different boxes of the stuff I have to finish.\u201d  He reentered the living room with bowl and spoon in hand as he continued. \u201cThey could at least ask if I wanted something different you know? This stuff gets too sweet for me.\u201d He handed the bowl and spoon over to Meitty who marveled at the mixture before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo sweet! Too sweet? Was that possible? Meitnerium wondered privately. Well now she had to try it! And what such bright colors and strange shapes were in the bowl! Red,Yellows,Purples, Greens,Blue. She sampled a spoonful, and was pleasantly delighted at the taste that greeted her tongue. She was amazed too at the ability of the cereal to be like three things at once... the sweetness of the \u201ctwonkies\u201d, the chewiness of the meat, and yet somehow liquid like the chili. Swallowing she immediately began shoveling spoonfuls into her much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, if you\u2019re gonna eat that fast you can just forget the spoon.\u201d Tom joked. \"Dad wasn\u2019t kidding, you do get hungry! I'm glad <i>you</i> at least like it! ...Hey that gives me an idea...\" Tom said as he got up from the couch.He took two steps before turning around and darting back towards the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Uh, Let me explain the TV first!\u201d He began ready to give her the in's and out's of the device in front of her. He started by holding up the clicker to her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I understand how a TV works.\u201d Meitty said astutely, pushing the clicker away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Tom asked in disbelieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, although I don\u2019t quite understand this remote\u2026\u201d she said puzzled at the device in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, we use that to control the TV, you know change what show is on or turn up the sound, turn it on. Watch.\u201d He stated, as he pointed the clicker at the TV. and pressed the red on button, which did indeed turn the TV on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHA! Looks like I\u2019ve got you beat there. Yep, everything back on the home world is controlled through these\u2026\u201d  She parted her snow white hair to better display her two stubby antennas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d Tom said quite surprised. Then moving closer strangely entranced, he let slip the first thing that came to his mind\u2026 \u201cUm can I touch them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh faith! So forward!\u201d She giggled at the sensual offer. \u201cWell\u2026you did get me a bowl of that cereal stuff so\u2026I don't mind, just be gentle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom slowly approached them taking the tips gently between his thumb and index finger, unknowingly in expert form of a Metalement Galaxy stud. \u201cUh, they\u2019re kind of a squishy.\u201d Tom said innocently as he gently massaged and squeezed them in rhythm not noticing how red he was making the green alien girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ohhh!</i>\u201d Meitty accidentally moaned aloud from the perfect performance. \u201cUm that\u2019s enough! Didn\u2019t you have an idea or something to get too?\u201d she shouted getting a hold on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d  Tom said quickly, and he disappeared back into the kitchen not wanting to forget his brilliant plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments Tom returned with..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Commercials everywhere!  She wished she could write down everything she was seeing in these commercial commercials for things called fast food, candy bars, something called doughnuts, whatever pop was, it was all  too much to take in. Wow! Food was even the main thing for human television! She was visibly drooling from all she saw; going into a state of semi-culture shock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had just a little bit of leftovers from like four different boxes of this stuff, so I mixed them all together.\u201d Tom explained as he returned from the kitchen this time with a much bigger bowl, and a much bigger serving of cereal. \u201cAt least it won\u2019t go to waste the way right?\u201d He smiled as he revealed his cunning plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tom plopped onto the couch beside her, she awoke from her daze as he handed her the bowl. The thoughts of the television shows here on Earth flew from her mind as she saw the larger bowl of sweet cereal. She supposed there would be time for the food she'd just seen later; there was food here to be eaten! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have so many questions\u201d Tom began finally ready to inquire Meitey about her home life. And Meitnerium would be  happy to oblige him with answers, as long as she could keep eating. (This spoonful she noticed some of the pieces of cereal were actually frosted human letters. How weird, but how delicious!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...Well first of all what is it like-\u201d  Tom was unable to finish the question as the TV roared, now back to it's scheduled programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both listened closely as an announcers voice began booming from the surround sound speakers. \u201cAnd now back to...\"</span></div></div>",

Tom decided maybe the questions could wait a little while longer\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show seemed to shock Meitnerium even more than the commercials did. She stared in disbelieve that humans could looks so different from the small glimpse she\u2019d had of them. Taller ones, shorter ones, some that were wearing the most beautiful dresses she\u2019d ever seen in her life, even better than most that were on her home planet! And look at that one! He\u2019d give Gallium a run for his money in the sex appeal department. All this was out there and she\u2019d never even known. Humans were definitely not as low brow as she had once believed them to be; no they were a lot more like Meitnerium than she ever could of guessed. And here she was stuck in the lousy country side, in the middle of nowhere, with a family who were plainer then plain. Well maybe not Tom.  He at least seemed to be more \u201cwith it\u201d than the rest of the family, but he was far from her idea of sexy\u2026okay maybe he was just a <i>little </i>cute\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium of course had many questions about what she was seeing and so began to ask them aloud. Tom began to explain some teen human culture to her. Going on to explain popularity, high school, bossiness, cliques, prom, bullying, and spoiled princess. Meitnerium began chiming in about her own life and they both found their races eerily echoed one another in their similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...so afterwards even if her father buys her the car if it\u2019s not the right color she throws a fit.\u201d Tom said as he was beginning to finish up an hour later. He had forgone seeing her as an illegal alien of ill intent,  now as far as he was concerned she was just another regular teen, albeit a green one from outer space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frickin  faith that sounds wonderful!\" Meitnerium said enthralled at the idea of her bossing her parents around and making sure she got everything she wanted, at getting new dresses every other day and cars and being the envy of all get friends. Oh and of course food food food, day in day out. This fantasy was only a few steps down from how she was actually treated at home, but the teen on television at the moment seemed to be twice as spoiled as she ever had been! Lucky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, are you kiddin\u2019 me?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cNaw, those people are fun to watch at how ridiculous they are but I wouldn\u2019t get near anyone like that in real life.\u201d he affirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium sighed at the dream crushing statement, it seemed to be true. She may have been her parent\u2019s little princess on her home world, but here on Earth it looked like there was no way she would get to be bossy. Or was there\u2026she wondered. Tom probably wouldn\u2019t put up with her demands like her dad did (usually), but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t another way to get what she wanted around here\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the now empty bowl, Meitnerium was about to say something to Tom\u2026... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan we go out shopping? You do have malls around here right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom eyed his mysterious house guest up and down as his brain processed this sudden request. He leaned back slightly as Meitnerium folded her hands together and showed off all of her pearly whites in a pleading smile. In all honesty, he was always one for the mall scene every now and then; and as Meitnerium had already proved that, strangely enough, she was a lot like American teenagers it stood to reason that she would want to hang out there as well.  \"Please oh please oh please?\" she begged eagerly, nary taking a breath as she eagerly awaited his response. What was he supposed to say? \"No way, you can't leave the house or you'll get taken away by the government\"? That'd be a terrible thing to point out! But then again he <i>was</i> a little anxious as to how his local mall would react to an actual <i>alien</i> taking a little shopping trip inside Hollister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut again, she was stranded here with only a finite number of outfits before she ran out. Those pink pajamas were cute, but Meitnerium probably didn't have much more than a few outfits saved up at best. Maybe it would actually be good for her to go out and get some clothes so she could better survey the Eath's area! And besides, all they were doing was laying around watching TV and eating cereal; it's not like they'd really be missing anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess its no big deal.\" Tom answered nonchalantly as he pulled himself from the couch, \"We'll pick you up a couple of outfits and then head straight home, you got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, Meitnerium's attention had been lost at 'okay'. Since being a very young Metalean girl, fashion had always been a driving force in Meitnerium's life. When she was nine, a young Meitnerium once demanded an entire wardrobe change as a birthday wish because the new spokesperson for the line was \"ugly\". At age thirteen, she had run up a 7000 dollar credit bill at the clothing stores around the city- all of which her father was left to pay for. Of course now that she had grown older and wiser, those splurges had slowly tamed themselves as more important things came into the picture. But like any girl in the cosmos, Meitty needed to look her best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!!\" Meitnerium nearly squealed as she sprang from the couch and locked Tom in a thankful embrace. \"Oh thanks so much Tom!\" she said quickly, releasing herself and barging directly back into her room. From behind the door Tom could hear a muffled declaration- the best of which he could make out was \"Getting\" and \"Ready\"....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, being rather well-versed in Woman Speak, Tom deduced that he was in fact going to be there a while.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"<i>Really</i>?\" Tom said in disbelief as his companion for the day emerged in nothing more than a pair of Steez Tech. yoga pants, a t-shirt and sunglasses. \"It took you that long just to look like you rolled out of bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium scoffed, \"Oh please, you should see me when I <i>really</i> get out of bed, I look nowhere near like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom rolled his eyes and jingled his keys anxiously. Meitnerium joined him in the doorway, where he had been standing for just shy of twenty minutes, and smiled playfully as she stepped out before him. He locked the door behind him and escorted the spoiled alien student to her chariot for the evening: a 1996 Sedan. And a real rustbucket at that. Meitnerium could barely contain herself, \"Nice car.\" she giggled, \"Nice to see someone who doesn't overcompensate.\" Tom shrugged slightly as he hopped into the driver's seat. \"Yeah well, can't complain.\" he hid his true distaste for the un-swaggin' of his wagon behind an unperturbed face and simply shoved his keys into his ignition, \"Oh what, so if it doesn't go the speed of light it's automatically a junker?\" he joked, \"Most kids on Earth would be <i>begging</i> for a car like mine.\" Of course Meitnerium didn't believe it; she wouldn't send this car to an orphanage on her planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, so long as it gets us to the mall, it works for me.\" the alien said, figuratively lowering her nose low enough for her to climb into the front seat, \"I'm still gonna duck down really low though, just so no one sees me in Earth's most Awesome Car.\" she said tauntingly. \"Oh ha ha, you're really funny- you know that?\" Tom jeered back, \"Just wear....\" from the passenger seat floorboard, Tom managed to rummage through his crap to find a Texas Longhorns ballcap and hand it to Meitnerium, \"<i>this</i> in case somebody sees you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium laughed, \"No way, why do I have to wear the hat?!\" she swiped the cap from Tom's hands and playfully placed it atop his curly black hair, \"You wear the hat, it's yours and it smells!\" Tom couldn't help but catch her infectiously jaunty behavior and pulled the cap from his head, pulling it down over Meitnerium's eyes, \"This is my lucky hat! It doesn't smell!\" he quipped back with a giddy grin, \"And besides, you're the <i>green</i> one here- plus you've got those antennae up there, you'll stick out like a sore thumb!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a <b>ballcap</b> will fix that?\" she said dryly, adjusting the sporty ensemble to better allow her vision. Checking her reflection in the passenger side mirror with a quick little pose, Meitty decided that she didn't look half bad! Like a little bit of a slob or an underachiever maybe; but hey, when on Earth! \"Fine, but I'm only keeping it because it looks way better on me than it did you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where're we going, anyway?\" Meitnerium continued after a quick jab to Tom's arm, \"Some kind of hoedown Earth mall where I can tip cows and hit on my cousin for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom finally started up his car and turned to pull out of his driveway, not even looking at Meitnerium while answering her question. \"Wow, you're really off about the whole 'Earth' thing... well, mostly.\" he said after going a good distance in reverse, \"We're headed somewhere that'll make even <i>you</i> look normal...</span></div></div>",

Tom had felt somewhat insulted by the hick remarks Meitnerium had made, not just as a Texan, but as an Earthling too. Well he\u2019d show her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you promise to keep the whole \u201calien\u201d thing a secret right?\u201d He asked her, still a little giddy about what he was about to do. He was pretty confident the disguised alien beside him could blend in, heck, considering how some people looked at the mall it wouldn't be hard at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, I understand,\u201d Meitnerium answered with growing impatience. \u201cCan\u2019t be captured and all that\u2026<i>Honestly</i> humans are like; one of the last races to have discovered aliens but if it means they won\u2019t freak out I\u2019ll try to stay hidden.\u201d she bemoaned crossing her arms and pouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they had entered the mall and as they passed through the gray automatic doors Meitnerium stopped on the spot. She brought her hands together and nearly squealed with delight.  This\u2026 this was more like it; this was what she\u2019d wanted! Her mind tried to take it all in as her heart fluttered in delight at the new min-world around her. Neon signs, racy outfits, cute boys, the whole place was just so alive! It was just like back home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTain\u2019t so Podunk any more ain\u2019t we miss?\u201d Tom said with an exaggerated twang and an air of pride about him. Meitnerium barely heard him; she\u2019d picked a store to start with and dashed off towards it ready to go where few men have gone before: the women\u2019s clothing department. Tom had to briskly walk to keep up with her, cautiously watching the cap Meitnerium was wearing as it began to bounce and bobble atop her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they\u2019d arrive at the first store, and Meitnerium hit the racks as if she were a regular. Tom saw as she began sliding through the clothes at a fervent pace as if in pursuit of something. Finally she paused and lifted her treasure into the air with delight; in her hands she now held a slinky black outfit. As he passed the other women present in the store Tom watched as Meitty pressed the dress to her figure judging it to fit perfectly. Then she returned it to the rack and went one size smaller (well knowing the tighter fit drove the guys wild.) She retreated to the back which she\u2019d correctly assumed to be the dressing room and went to work, leaving Tom to wait for her outside red faced from more than just the short sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling time, Tom checked the area searching for camera\u2019s and surprisingly unlike in the long list of movies he\u2019d seen there were no camera\u2019s about, no CIA agent\u2019s looking for him, and no one had paid Meitnerium any mind. So far so good, he supposed\u2026The thoughts of was quickly dropped from his mind as quickly as his jaw did when he witnessed Meitnerium exit the dressing room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the dressing room Tom saw that the black outfit had not just clung to Meitty\u2019s form, it squeezed it tightly as if it\u2019s life depended on it. Leaving little to the imagination but a lot to think about it abruptly ended to make way for Meitnerium's now slightly rounded stomach. Although she wouldn\u2019t admit it, she had a hard time squeezing herself into the outfit, chalking it up to one of the few differences between the human culture and her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack goes so well with green, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d She asked seeing she was getting the desired effect from her test subject. Meitty decided to go in for the kill; she might have been a bit of an idiot when it came to school but if there was one thing she knew had to do it was shop, especially if someone else was footing the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, black and green are sort of evil looking but I think they look good on me, I  should know, I did  have a shirt almost exactly like this one\u2026 that was before the crash...\u201d she trailed off on a sad note and added a sniff for effect. \u201cSo can I get it?\u201d She asked immediately perking up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026what?\u201d Tom mumbled shaking his head to re-focus.  \u201cOh, sure, uh, how much?\u201d he asked in the voice of a boy who\u2019d obviously never been clothes shopping with a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium told him how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he began now immediately having second thoughts about the stupid mall trip. But seeing how happy she was, and seeing this was probably a once in a life time thing to be buying clothes for an alien, he realized he could cough up the money. Most of the money in his account <i>had</i> been from his parent\u2019s as an allowance, (a generous allowance at that) but maybe he could talk into his dad giving him a reimbursement for giving Meitty a good time\u2026 (The dress didn\u2019t look to bad on her either he had to admit, can\u2019t forget that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d he finally said. \u201cBut this and two other things at the mall, and then we\u2019re out of here. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you, thank you!\u201d Meitty said in a way that had been not only practiced but perfected from its repeated use on her parents. <br>\r\nBut as the shopping continued three turned into four, and then five! Tom found himself unable to give an unsympathetic \u201cNo!\u201d to Meitnerium\u2019s ; \u201cPlease\u201d\u2019s or her \u201cBut it\u2019s on sale\u201d\u2019s and her \u201c<i>Aww</i> but its<i> sooooo</i> cute\u201d\u2019s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, he trudged behind Meitnerium feet aching from standing while carrying all of her purchases in tow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey!\u201d cried a passerby suddenly approaching Meitnerium from the other side of the walkway. Meiternium tried to ignore him but he continued closer. \u201cHey you!\u201d he cried again louder and this time Tom and Meitnerium both stopped dead .Had her disguise had been seen through? Oh no, what would this guy do next, call the police? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen and slightly behind Meitty, Tom could only watch in horror as the buff young man made his way towards Meitnerium. Suddenly the stranger raised two fingers abruptly and placed his hand to his forehead. It was a perfect mirror of Meitty\u2019s antenna and she panicked at the gesture. Her antenna! Had she forgot to re-cover them, had she been seen? She moved her hands instinctively to cover them and found that thankfully she\u2019d kept the hat on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guy dressed from head to toe in burnt orange stomped closer, his mouth opened and his eyes narrowed on the cattle shape on top of Meitty\u2019s head. Then he gave a great smile as he loudly shouted \u201c<span class=\"cred\">All right Hook\u2019em Horns</span>!\u201d at the sight of her hat, yelling with true college frat boy bravado. As soon as he appeared he\u2019d disappeared back into a crowd of people, his job of raising school spirit complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom breathed a sigh of relief. That had been too close, and after that little scare he really needed a break. Fortunately he saw something ahead of them that might serve as a good distraction from the beating that both his wallet and feet were taking, it would be a risk but it was worth a shot to end this interstellar shopping spree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ahead of them, a familiar face had caught Tom's attention as he trudged forward; having been burdened with carrying all of Meitnerium's bounty like some sort of pack mule. At first Tom simply planned on distracting Meitnerium long enough with the food court in order to catch a breather and maybe get a bite to eat, replenishing his diminished reservoir of energy in the process. But what he had discovered in the stead of his journey towards the food court proved to be much more entertaining than sitting down with his verdant skinned oppressor for the evening. For there, in the middlemost section of the tables laid out for people to chow down and right next to the pillar, was his good friend Jerri and two other girls, one of whom was a mutual acquaintance for the both of them. Meitnerium, who wouldn't have known to single this face out of the crowd on her own, was still happily keeping up her step ahead of Tom and eagerly eying the strange customs of Earth's social hangout center. One thing she half-recognized was the smell of cooking food; and that alone was enough to cross the right wires in her pretty little head. One thing she failed to recognize, however, was the smell of a foreign substance: oils, fats, grease, these things didn't seem to register with Meitnerium's deprived sense of smell and taste. All she knew was that there was something different being cooked out there, seemingly from all around her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, lookit that!\" a rather low pitched though unmistakably feminine tone sounded from the clamor of the mall crowd, \"Tom, get'cher scrawny butt over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium looked over to see Tom, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><i>her</i> Tom</span>, follow the greeting willingly -even gladly- to the source; a short, rather skinny girl dressed modestly; almost like a boy! \"Hey, Jer!\" Tom greeted her warmly as he lugged the twin bags of swag beside him, resting them at his feet in order to give this pint-sized human loudspeaker a great big hug. \"Oh man last night was great!\" the curly headed Texan said with emphatic joy, \"That movie was sick!\" A little bewildered, Meitnerium quickly hopped over beside Tom in hopes of gaining a little insight towards his sudden departure. \"Yeah, but the best part was at the gas station afterwords- those big trucker guys picking on you was the <i>best</i>!\" Jerri giggled as she elbowed Tom in the side. \"Hey, watch it now.\" Tom vaguely ventured, completely forgetting about the green skinned temptress standing beside him. \"I'll be watching you hit the floor!\" Jerri teased, flailing her arms around playfully, \"that Automotive Tech's really buffed me up, Son!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two burst into laughter, unable to keep up this charade of false bravado any longer. It wasn't until after a full minute of laughter that Jerri (or Tom for that matter) acknowledged Meitnerium's presence in the slightest. The two girls still seated at the table, however, had long since noticed the green girl in yoga pants and a ball cap and had started questioning amongst themselves. Jerri was just a little bit above that. \"Sorry, me and Tommy here go back.\" she apologized, taking the dainty green hand of an ignored bystander in this seemingly A-B conversation. \"I'm Jerrianne Short; you can call me Jerri.\" she said welcomingly, \"And, um, if you don't mind me asking... I mean, are you wearing something or what?\" Meitnerium immediately understood the question; though she still seemed somewhat annoyed at the diminutive girl for so eagerly diverting Tom's time away from her own needs. \"I'm Meitnerium Perioda; but everyone just calls me Meitty here.\" she feigned pleasantries, \"And, uh... it's a skin condition; kinda embarrassing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that, the whole story was answered. Jerri just shook her head sympathetically, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.\" she said humbly, \"But you're really pretty.\" Meitnerium couldn't help but like this girl just a little bit more now... even if it was just a little. \"Thanks, you're really pretty too.\" she reciprocated the compliment, albeit halfheartedly, as she turned back to Tom. \"Hey, you think we should get out of here or what?\" she asked quietly enough for only Tom to comprehend, though loud enough to make it seem like it was about her \"skin condition\" being pointed out, \"I really wanna try on some of these new outfits.\" Tom, who now had a reason to stay anchored to the Food Court, if only for a little while, turned back and whispered just as quietly, \"Aw come on, just take a seat- I'll get you a burger <b>and</b> you get to meet Jerri.\" he murmered, \"She's really cool, you'll see.\" Without much of a choice (Tom <b>was</b> driving after all) Meitnerium took a seat and pulled out an empty one for Tom to sit beside her. Jerri sat across from Tom, and the other two girls sat next to Jerri; the only character out of them important enough to be named. The next five minutes was a string of non-stop talking between the two old chums- who reminisced like they hadn't seen each other in years; it was understandable for Meitnerium and the other two girls to feel just a little bit left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to do, Meitnerium simply sat there; bored out of her mind and cheek poutingly placed in hand. Her eyes traversed the now seemingly dull mall, watching the patrons meander about their tables aimlessly. She caught sight, however, of something completely foreign to her. The process was interesting; one heavyset mother of two with her younglings clamoring at her side placed an order, holding up two fingers to signify the number. From there, the teen behind the counter tapped the touchscreen -wait, Earthlings hadn't quite come that far yet, what was that word... <i>keypad</i>!- and grabbed a bag that had been delivered by the never-resting chefs in the back! Just like that! The mother handed her the currency and hobbled off with her meal! Meitnerium's eyes widened with wonder, her cheek raising from her hand, as the woman (now seated. Yes, Meitnerium was creeping on a housewife in the mall, give her a break) pulled out a full meal not only for herself, but one for each of her children as well! It was instant food! Food in it's Fastest sense! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty?\" Tom nudged her in the green elbow, \"You alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh...\" Meitnerium could only muster this weak response as she basked in the glory that was good ol' American Fast Food. \"I'm actually a little... hungry, think we could all.... um... get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two unnamed girls declined, actually having to get going rather soon. Tom was actually a little peckish after lugging around all of Meitnerium's crap all day, and Jerri had actually skipped breakfast; so a little something to eat wasn't too out of the question...</span></div></div>",

You three have fun though\u2026\u201d she added a little dryly as the duo left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, see you two later\u201d called Jerri cheerily  waving goodbye to the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, what do you want Meitty?\u201d asked Tom who was also set to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium was still far too stunned at how fast the food was being made around her to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about McDonald\u2019s?\u201d Jerri said, choosing for the faltering foreigner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me\u201d Tom agreed, and the trio got up and made for the golden arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri and Tom gave their regular orders, but for Meitty Tom had something special in mind. He had a feeling he\u2019d have plenty of time to talk with Jerri as he ordered the #1 special which included A Big Mac, large fries, and a large chocolate shake, believing the sizable combo ought to tide Meitty over for a while. In a few moments they were carrying their respective trays to their table, Meitty astounded at how fast food could be cooked compared to her dinner\u2019s from before and near drooling the entire time.  She paused as she sat down at the table savoring the moment right before she un-wrapped this gift of swiftly prepared scrumptiousness before her. Not far from her Tom and Jerri were chatting it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026she\u2019s foreign?\u201d asked Jerri leaning in closer towards Tom who nodded to the question. \u201cWell that explains the name then... but, well how long is she staying with you?\u201d Jerri whispered to Tom between bites of the fires the two were sharing. She had tuned her voice down slightly as to not offend the vixen visitor. She wouldn\u2019t have needed to whisper anyways, Meitty was lost in a new world of fast food heaven oblivious to the world around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm well, we don\u2019t know for sure\u2026\u201d  Tom began, searching for an apropos answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jerri said a little louder than she'd meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrick\u2019n faith it\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Meitty interrupted biting down into her burger. Wow! So this was a hamburger such simple complexity, a stacked tower of strange and colorful ingredients each adding together to the total flavor like pieces of a puzzle, the meat burst with flavor obviously the star of the show, but the condiments added to it stacked right on the other were like perfectly synched backup dancers. Mietty couldn\u2019t get enough of the other parts of the meal either, the thick paste that tasted of the hoho's only in a cold  liquid form. The sensation of salty that came with the fries and the wholesomeness that came with them if they were dipped in the strange red sauce called ketchup.  Unnnf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that movie last night was something else! Did you want to maybe...see...\"Tom tried to use Meitty\u2019s intruding interjection to steer the conversation away from the alien, to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure can eat!\u201d Jeri said having lost track of their conversation and had now shifted most of her attention to the foreign fast food feedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah\u2026\u201d Tom began. (Think! Think!)  \u201c...She\u2019s from pretty far out-out and away. I don\u2019t think they have fast-food where she comes from but she really likes it here\u2026And I was saying earlier  she might have to go back to her home country pretty soon, or it might be a while longer.\u201d He said trying to cover all of the holes in the story he was fabricating. \u201cCould be even as soon as tomorrow depending on what her family wants\u2026 \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell shoot! You better be showing her a good time while she's here then!\" Jerri said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Of course!\u201d agreed Tom, who was not feeling any better for lying to Jerri whom he NEVER lied to.  \u201cWhy do you think I brought her to the mall? She\u2019s been having a great time. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d  He turned his head and found Meitty was licking the last bits and pieces of ketchup and hamburger from her fingertips. He assumed the shake was completely  gone too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-you\u2019re done?\u201d  Tom fruitlessly asked unbelieving that in minutes a good old American burger, and a large fries, <i>and</i> a large shake  had been quickly finished off, he\u2019d missed it she inhaled it so quickly.  \u201cWell then Meitty how about some dessert before we go?\u201d Tom asked forming a rater devious idea, briskly he left the table before Meitnerium could question what a dessert was. Whatever it was she hoped it tasted as good as a burger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could eat like that\u201d Jerri had suddenly said to Meitnerium who now had to hold her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you then?\u201d Meitnerium asked, honestly puzzled on why she seemed to be better at this eating thing than they were, and she\u2019d just discovered this stuff a few days ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I would but I\u2019ve got to stay in shape for practice\u201d she grumbled. The phrase \"in shape\" had flown over Meitty\u2019s head and not wanting to insult this local she\u2019d simply chosen to ignore the phrase all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, Meitty, how did you end up here?\u201d Jerri asked brightly, while studying the rather \u201cunique\u201d outfit Meitty had on. One item she was wearing in particular, a certain someones lucky longhorns cap had struck her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell after I left my planet-I mean my place, Harry saw me, uh, hitchhiking in the rain. And like, I told him I was looking for a place to stay.  After that he took me in right then and there no questions asked.\u201d She half lied, feeling fortunate she\u2019d remembered that \u201chere\u201d meant \u201chere as in Texas\", not \"here as in Earth or for that matter the Milky Way Galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Jerri said relaxing as she began to understanding how Tom had been acquainted with this rather ravishing looking refugee. An escapee that Jerri noted was not only was taller than herself but also a bit more \"womanly.\"  \u201cWell, Harry is a bit goofy isn\u2019t he?\" she continued still as bright as ever. \"I think that\u2019s why Tom tries to act so serious sometimes, is that he gets embarrassed by his dad.  But really everyone in Tom\u2019s family is really nice; you really couldn\u2019t have picked a nicer guy-I mean place to stay with. I think you\u2019ll just love it here.\u201d Jerri said fully welcoming this new <u>hopefully short term </u>guest that her best (but-not-quite-boy) friend Tom was now sharing a roof with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom returned from his short quest to the Dairy Queen carrying with him a sundae filled with ice cream.  He had spent his last cent and bought Meitty the largest size scoops available, and even had it messily adorned with sprinkles and splattered with hot fudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow be sure to eat it slow\u201d Tom warned, informing Meitty of the dreaded ice-cream headache that would happen if she ate this too fast. He felt this whole scene was pretty anti-dramatic compared to the clich\u00e9 heartwarming \u201calien\u2019s first taste of ice-cream\u201d scenes that had abounded in so many flicks he\u2019d seen, but the longer Meitty took to eat the less questions Jerri would ask about her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty took hold of the plastic spoon Tom had provided her and took a large scoop of the cold mystic wonder, making sure it was filled with hot fudge and sprinkles. She let the mixture rest inside her mouth and then sighed as she savored her first bite. Immediately Meitty was brought to near tears of joy from the heavenly delight.  Such texture such sweet taste chocolate sprinkles, her pleasure sensors were running on overload!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried to resume chatting but began to notice Jerri was distracted by the semi-chartreuse stranger and her eating, well maybe gorging was a better word. Meitty had tried to hold her self back as Tom had warned, only to begin scrapping and scooping the frozen delight as fast as she could shovel it in Apparently not possessing the sensitive nerves in her mouth as humans did leaving her free to eat as fast as she wanted. Her licking and lapping of ice cream continued as chocolate and sprinkles swirled around the inside and visible outside of her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they don\u2019t get ice-cream headaches where she\u2019s from either\u201d Tom said nervously laughing off how his plan had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right!\u201d Jerri shouted more amazed than put-off at this sign of gastronomical fortitude.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she had finished off every bite of the ice-cream too, and Tom believed she was finally full. He was about to find out how wrong he was, for, whether from the food already inside of it, or at the very idea of more food, Meitty\u2019s stomach gurgled loudly. Meitnerium looked more surprised than anyone else at the table by the strange chemical reaction taking place within her stomach, but the others didn't seem to worried about it so she wasn't either, in fact it kind of tickled as it gurgled she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when at the sound of the rumbling...</span></div></div>",

Jerri saw his face begin to twist and picked up on the sign without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, are you still hungry?\" said Jerri in reference to the rumbling that had come from Meitnerium's stomach. \"You must have been starved back home. Tom, why don't you let me get her something else?\u201d asked Jerri head and heart not 100% full of only good intentions for this friendly female foreigner. Thinking that If she filled Meitty till she was about to explode she wouldn\u2019t have worry about Meitty and Tom getting any <i>ideas</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are so many generous people here.\" Meitnerium said milking as much sympathy as she could.  She was begging to feel almost spoiled from being showered with such snacks and kindness; keyword: <u>Almost</u>. Jerri <i>had</i> offered and now she was going to take full advantage of it Tom was sure he saw a devious grin flash not only on Meitty\u2019s face but in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell shoot, c\u2019mon girl!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jerri, but really you don't have to\u2026\" Tom began but the two were already up. He knew that this was just the kind of nice person his friend Jerri was, always smiling and always wanting to help. He watched as Jerri led Meitty to another restaurant and  moments later they returned with a double beef stuffed burrito. Mietty masticated it in mere minutes. This spectacle was too good to be true for Jerri never imaging someone of Meitty\u2019s semi-trim build could still be scarfing so much at such a pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jerri that\u2019s enough don\u2019t you think?\u201d Tom asked hoping this binge would stop before attracting other onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I want to see just how much her tank can hold!\" The perky fireball replied full fascination for the green guest. Meitnerium and Jeri got up several more times, each time returning to the table with a serving of what the next restaurant had to offer.  Meitty continued to eat, and Jeri was completely blown away by how much Meitty could pack away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Glompf *she stuffed a cony dog crammed into her face. (It was thick and meaty like the chili) Washed down with a healthy sized order of lemonade. (Meity's face immediately puckered at the strange sensation of sour.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp* she finished the last of the bowl of fried shrimp and rice. (The shrimp were spicy but the white granules were strangely tasteless.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Chomp dip chomp* The cheese slathered pretzel was finished. (Salty, but the hot and bubbly cheese dip seemed to balance it out)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smorsh* she swallowed down the last bite of a pizza. (Which much like the hamburger used a combination of spicy meats and sauces to come together for one ultimate taste. )<br>\r\n <br>\r\n*Glorp* She chewing through the last third of a cinnabun.(It was the stickiest thing she had all day, but the warm gooey center and icing made up for the mess)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate and she ate, all while the  tomboyish Jerri was basically cheering her gluttony on. Eventually the feast was finished not for want of funds, but on the Tom's realization that the two had been to every one of the twelve restaurants that comprised the substantially sized food court, and his instance that going for more anywhere else would make them look crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again though Jerri\u2026really you didn\u2019t have too\u2026\" Tom said forced to do the thanking for the food, and the apologizing for Meitty\u2019s overwhelming appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That was amazing!  You don\u2019t think that\u2019s impressive Tom? I would've bet she would've popped by now!\u201d jabbing into visibility rounded and stretched taught tummy. \u201cCareful l-oohf, ow,ow.\" Meitty breathed out. Her stomach sloshed it was so full but Meitty wasn't worried about the size and weight , she knew she just had to sleep it off and it'd be gone by the time she woke up. She was so happy, and she knew that Jerri would be her newest friend here on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really\u201d Tom lied flatly. In actuality he couldn\u2019t help but feel strangely giddy as he watched Meitty\u2019s cheeks bulging with food and her belly that was growing ever tauter. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t forget  how nice it was  that you treated her to a little bit of everything while she was here. Isn\u2019t that right Meitty?\" Meitty only lazily nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well don't forget you\u2019re paying for the movies next time!\u201d Jerri insisted. (Though it had been slightly more than she\u2019d planned on spending, it turned out it had been worth the price of admission for the astonishing display. She was sure now that  the Tom (healthy teenager as he was)  had lost any wayward ideas he would have had for this green colored bombshell that had seemingly fallen out of the sky. )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou got it Jerri!... Oh wow look at the time! Three o'clock we should be getting home\u2026\u201d Tom said gazing at the clock that adorned one of the food court\u2019s walls. Tom realized that after that generous gift leaving without at least inviting Jerri over would be rude, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to keep this flimsy \u201cRandom foreigner from parts unknown with a skin condition\u201d story up if Jerri followed them home.  No! It would be rude to eat and then run like that, he could only hope Jerri had other plans for that after noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, Jerri, did you want to come with?\u201d he asked gritting through his teeth and hiding his crossed fingers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jerri's face visibly saddened, her endless reservoir of pep taking a break for refilling. \"Sorry Tom, gotta meet my brother at work.\" she said dryly, \"He wants me to check out this new car he bought, wants to see if we can soup it up together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried not to seem too relieved; resisting the urge to let out a content sigh and let his crossed fingers relax. \"Hey, no problem.\" he said nonchalantly, \"We can hang out another time.\" The two stared at each other for a time, the silence awkward and in abundance. Tom's hand slowly found its way to the back of his curly black hair, scratching an itch that wasn't quite there while Jerri teetered between her tiptoes and heels. \"So... are you sure Meitnurr... Meitty's gonna be alright?\" Jerri stuttered, referring to the stupefied foreigner still seated at the table. \"What? Oh yeah, she'll be fine.\" Tom reassured her, nudging Meitnerium awake from her cataclysmic stasis, \"She's just a big eater, I'm sure she'll just skip dinner or something.\" he ventured vaguely, assisting his stuffed-stupid house guest to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium struggled to remain standing after her latest feat of gastronomical display. Her knees were begging to buckle under her lack of control and conciousness combined with the increased baggage that was her still far from digested meal. As Tom helped the poor hapless extraterrestrial to her feet, all she could do was groan lightly at the intense pain emanating from her midsection; suffering only heightened by Tom's clumsy jostling of her body. \"Ugh...\" she whimpered as the spoils of her appetite's victory took their effect, letting out a long \"Ohhhh...\" as she felt a sharp, sudden affliction in her taut tummy. It was Jerri, rubbing the dome-like structure that jutted from her middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" the little brunette said with mild wonder detectable in her voice, \"This girl nearly ate this place clean! Where does she <i>put</i> it all?\" Deciding to retract her hand from Meitty's gut, though not due to an acknowledgement of the verdant glutton's pain, and let it wrap around Tom's slender shape for a quick goodbye hug. \"We're still on for the movies, right?\" she ventured, \"Next Saturday?\" And while Tom was more than happy to oblige, his smile was more distracted than reassuring as he balanced the wobbling alien body and attempted to wrap things up and head home. \"Yeah, sure.\" he said quickly as he hurried Meitnerium, who was now little more than dead weight, out the door. \"Call me alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium had never been in so much pain in her entire life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was four, Meitnerium slipped and fell off of her friend Selenium's roof. Now she could only yearn to relive that laser sealing her (then open) head shut. At nine she had gotten into a fight with another girl at the mall. Meitnerium <i>begged</i> to have that big butchy twelve year old pounding her face in right about now. And just last year she had broken her arm in a slight fender bender. This didn't even come <b>close</b> to the food baby can-canning inside of her poor overfed stomach right now. The burgers, the ice cream, whatever those things drenched in chili and \"cheese\" were; they all seemed like such horrible ideas in retrospect. Well... maybe not <i>all</i> of them, but certainly a good majority of them could have been enjoyed at a later date. And yet; the intense afflictions she was experiencing seemed somehow bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough overused and certainly exercised to its limit for today, Meitnerium's slender aquavian tongue had experienced more tastes today than in a lifetime back home. Everything on Earth was just so rich and full of flavor! Even when she came across something that she didn't like (which looking back seemed to be scarce), Meitnerium's repertoire of consumed foods had expanded her once sheltered sense of appetites! She doubted her friends, no, <i>anyone</i> back home had ever fully experienced the wild ride that was their sense of taste! Before crashing on Earth, her tongue was simply a muscle used to talk and wriggle inside of a Metalean guy's mouth; now it was an orifice that had found its true purpose after 21 long years of deprivation! That thought alone, though assisted with others that predicated just exactly what she might experience next, got her through the intense trauma that was her little slip in self control. That and the new outfits she had suckered from Tom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, feeling a little more cognitive now, Meitnerium noticed that she was back in Tom's car; scenery swooshing out of her field of vision, safely buckled in, comfortably slouched into a slumbering position, and ball cap still firmly rooted onto her luscious white locks. She attempted to stretch, only to find that her meal still hadn't quite digested. She would <i>not</i> make that mistake again. The waving pain was already horrible, but moving so suddenly pushed it to the 'unbearable' point. \"Ooh... ooh...\" she whined, tentatively touching the swollen mass that resided inside her stomach with her slender fingers. That... actually didn't feel too bad. With the tips of her fingers Meitnerium gingerly circled the green distortion in hopes of easing its upstarts, letting out the slightest of pleasured moans in the process. Hope fulfilled; maybe <i>this</i> was worth the horrible pain of such severe eating. As she massaged the rock solid dome, she felt something inside churning; something strange that seemed to travel up her esophagus and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRAAAAAP!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nearly drove off the road at the sudden interruption; \"Oh shit!\" he cursed as he quickly regained control of the wheel, \"Oh man that scared me!\" he shouted, checking his rear view mirror for any signs of any onlooking cops. Meitnerium was just as equally shocked. \"What the Faith was that?\" Meitnerium shouted back. \"It was a burp, Meitty.\" Tom said matter of factly, \"You've never burped before?\" the addressed burp-virgin could only notice the remarkable release in pressure on her stomach. Suddenly her valve was no longer ready to explode- there seemed to be a little more wiggle room in that taut tummy of hers! \"No... but I do feel a little better.\" she said sheepishly, still a little dazed and sleepy. \"Where're we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home, where else?\" Tom answered, \"We're almost there, you've been sleeping for almost a half an hour.\" Meitnerium found herself traveling back to the stuffed tummy she had acquired, finding it a little less pleasurable to massage now that her figurative valve had been released. \"Oh...\" she said, \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be, you sound like a chainsaw when you sleep.\" Tom teased, only to see the questioning look on Meitnerium's face that seemed to scream, 'I don't understand your silly underdeveloped Earth speak'. \"Sorry, I mean you snore really bad.\" he quickly corrected himself. This garnered a much more desirable effect in Meitnerium, her face twisting into one of comical disbelief. \"I do <b>not</b> snore!\" she said in a raised voice, some energy finally coming back to her. \"Yeah, you do.\" Tom said with utmost certainty. \"You burp big too... I think my ears are ringing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just drive me home Earth boy!\" Meitnerium said tauntingly, \"I've got a date with a shower and a warm bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no dinner?\" Tom quipped dryly as he pulled into the driveway...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well in fact Meitnerium did have dinner that night; it had helped dull the pain when Mr. &amp;Mrs. Parker announced that her car had been deemed totaled. Strangely Tom hadn't mentioned the mall splurging spree to his parents and was also oddly disappointed when Meitty didn\u2019t have seconds for dinner. Finishing the meal quickly Meitty was feeling only slightly better, but then her feelings soared when she realized all hope was not lost, for as she searched her tub of tools she'd retrieved from the wreckage, she realized she'd packed away a distress beacon. Said beacon would send out a signal and broadcast it to the outer limits of the solar system; all she had to do now, all she <i>could </i>do now was hope for some alien passerby to notice it and come pick her up.  Activating it she felt a little more at ease, at least she\u2019d done <i>something</i> to aid her rescue and if she had to hunker down somewhere; Earth with its hot showers, ludicrously soft beds, fashionable malls and wide range of food, wasn\u2019t exactly the worst place to wait a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a few days became a few Earth weeks, and then a month; soon she couldn\u2019t exactly remember how long she\u2019d been here Earthling or Metalean time wise. It could not have been much longer than two or three Earthling months she was sure. But what a time it was! Slowly she adjusted to her life and she continued to eat, and devour, and gobble further, all though never reaching her Jerri funded level binge (well maybe once or twice.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. And Mrs. Parker couldn\u2019t have been happier with their insatiable interstellar new guest, over the past month(s?) or so they had bonded with Meitnerium quite well, taking her in as one of their own. They welcomed the girl's appetite, happy to see the once rail thin visitor was packing some healthy meat on her bones. Never once did they mention Meitnerium's rapidly ballooning size and weight, never even denying her second or thirds of both dinner and dessert.  No, as they saw it there was always plenty to go around, and a lot less leftovers to deal with to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty herself marveled at what this food was doing to her. They sensational cycle of her days now consisted of; waking (then eating a nice breakfast to start her day), watching TV (with snacks of course), maybe going out with; Tom and Jerri (to the movies) or Harry (once to the grocery store to see where food came from, and once to a crude representation of how humans saw the galaxy called a planetarium,) or  Louise (who had so kindly taken her clothes shopping again when Meitnerium had complained of Earth washing machines shrinking her clothes.) and then after that it was usually her favorite three step combo of a nice hot dinner, a nice hot shower, and a nice hot bed.  Faith, she even seemed to be working once or two of the occasional burps things in there too! This everyday treatment seemed to be doing absolute wonders for her body! Meitty marveled at her reflection which seemed to be growing in all the right places.  She ran a finger down one of her green and thicker thighs. They had obviously grown in the weeks that passed since her crash,  not only that but her hips and breasts seemingly grew at an equal rate.  And yet another part had grown as well her midsection, or as she'd heard the humans so often refer to it: her belly. That seemed the best word to described the thing that she was currently spilling out of her new pajamas. Even after walking out of a steamy shower with a towel wrapped around her curvaceous middle, it was hard to keep covered. So she now found she simply didn't, neither after shower or after dressing. This wide wobbly and doughy thing before her was simply there for all the world to see. As far as she was concerned she had blended in quite well with the Earthlings here, most of which still far surpassed her in size. She probed it with a finger loving the senastion as her fingers sank deep down into the mass. She thought about the past month (or was it months) of nonstop eating and gluttony, and knew if this was the results she'd gotten out of it, than this big belly of hers was definitely a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf fact she knew she\u2019d be the absolute envy of all her friends when she revealed this brand new look when she got back home. All of her friends would be <i>so</i> jealous of her new developments (in the  front  and the back mind you), and judging from Tom\u2019s dumbstruck reactions she\u2019d seen him give her, the boys back home would be giving her a lot more attention too. And tummy rubs; she absolutely loved the way her stomach felt when , after she'd stuffed it full, he fingers gently rubbed it. She hoped she could get others to do that for her on her home planet since no one (not even Tom) would do that here.  Oh, she could see it now; forget tanning on Willix and trying to get that right shade of green, everyone would be heading to Earth next summer vacation  to grow theme selves large and wide just as Meitnerium did.  Yes, she simply loved the fact that there was now more of her to love, and for now she was perfectly content to stay here and add to her girlish figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely the only one who did care about her feminine form\u2019s expansion was Tom. He\u2019d tried to explain to her that such gains shouldn\u2019t be possible, but Meitty wouldn\u2019t hear it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you saying I should just stop?\u201d she asked him one night after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...It\u2019s... just...\u201d Tom started as he began to sweat. \u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t like this? That you don\u2019t like <i>me</i>?\u201d Oh yeah Meitty knew how to flip a conversation around, having a lot of practice with her previous flirts.  It took a lot but she just managed to keep from laughing as Tom bashfully began squirming about and dancing around the obvious fact that he was really starting to like Meitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Meitty, it\u2019s just\u2026 How much did you weigh before you got here?\u201d he said, finally asking the rather rude question he\u2019d been holding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did\u2026 <i>I</i> weigh?\u201d She began confused. In her time here Meitty thought she had gained most of the ins and outs of odd human behavior but this one had completely confounded her. \u201cYou weigh\u2026<i>each other </i>here on Earth?\u201d Now to Meitnerium there were certain things that were weighed spaceships for example, she\u2019d even seen food on Earth being weighed on her trip to the grocery store which also made sense, but why would you need to weigh yourself?  The reason for her conundrum was that modern Metalean's had never once grown to a size of \u201cOverweight\u201d or \u201cObese\u201d like on Earth, not only that but their mastery of Zero-G gravity would have made such measurements irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitnerium, could you just come with me for a second\u201d Tom said sternly, going so far as to use her full name to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d she agreed stubbornly as she followed Tom into the bathroom. She watched as he went into the bathrooms closest (full of those nice and fluffy towels she loved) and bent down towards one of the lower shelves. He pulled out a strange device and set it down on the ground before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if you could just step on this scale for a few seconds...\u201d He asked her pointing to the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty decided she play this little game though couldn\u2019t see why Tom seemed so\u2026interested in finding out her weight. She did as asked and stepped on the contraption but she huffed and crossed her now thicker arms across her now bigger chest as she did so, just to show Tom she wasn\u2019t happy about it.  The gizmo seemed to whirl and clack beneath her, until Meitty heard the contraption click and finally stop. Not able to see the results from where she stood (there was only more of her wonderfully sexy self in the way) and definitely not feeling like bending over, Tom was left to read the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty was already growing disinterested with this Earth boy's  fascination of weighing somebody but she did manage to give just enough attention to hear a bit of the results as Tom read them aloud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whoa!\" Tom dragged the word out like silly putty, elongating the 'o' sound in shock, even going so far as to let out a little whistle afterwords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say, what's it say?\" Meitnerium griped as she grew just a hair bit defensive at Tom's utter amazement in how much mass she had gained. \"I-I can't really tell Meitty.\" Tom poked at one of her pudgy green piglets on the scale, \"Your toe's in the way, all I can see is a 2 and... I think that's a three?\" Meitty rolled her eyes at the silly Earth boy, taking a half-step back from the plastic part and back onto the rubber mat. Honestly, these Earthlings with their silly contraptions; weighing <i>themselves</i> instead of things, how ridiculous! Back home, her father shipped out exactly 9.7 tons of BMW parts all over the surrounding bit of the universe (he'd said so many times) and had never <i>once</i> thought to put himself on that industrial scale of his? Why? Because it was a stupid idea; that's why! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...However, just because it was a stupid idea didn't mean that Meitnerium couldn't culture herself a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked down at the now foot-printed plastic, realizing that he had in fact been wrong; she weighed far much more than he would have guessed! The obligatory two as the starting digit was a bit of a shocker on its own, considering just how slender Meitty was when they rescued her. The last digit was not a three, rather it being an <i>eight</i>. So whatever that middle digit was, at the rate Meitnerium practiced her hedonistic habits, she wouldn't be there for long. And as she moved the plumpest of all big toes Tom had ever seen, Meitnerium's weight was finally revealed with the middle digit; 4. <b>Four!</b> Meitnerium was just a pound or two shy of weighing two hundred and fifty pounds! Had this space woman actually gained such an astonishing amount of weight in such a short amount of time since arriving on Earth? Whether that spoke more about the habits of his new boarder or his home planet, Tom really didn't want to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed upwards, hesitant on delivering news that would absolutely crush most women. Feeling premonition in the unveiling of his discovery to the awaiting audience, Tom's lips curled slightly; attempting to form a friendly smile that would comfort this verona vixen should things go sour. However as his eyes traveled upwards, Tom soon found that Meitnerium's doubly chinned cherubic countenance was nowhere to be seen within his vantage point; instead getting an eyeful out of her fully exposed stomach, left to sag over the waistline of her favorite pair of (now ill fitting) cutoffs. Its soft expanse rolled seamlessly over the belt line, making a smooth curve that dipped (at its apex) to the level of her crotch and back up to the other side to form a protruding muffin top, doubling back around once more again to form a second layer on the blubbery pagoda that was her belly. Her thick legs touched each other, rubbing their patterns of scantily clad denim against one another even as she stood still; her whole guacamole-shaded body rising and falling slightly with every breath. Tom's smile became flustered, finding himself suddenly with a lack of words as his cheeks grew rosy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Well?</b>\" Meitnerium huffed impatiently, \"How much do I frickin' weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's tongue soon became his bane as he struggled to get it working, only managing to stammer and stutter stupidly. His tied tongue only came unknotted when he heard something break the silence: a sound he had grown very used to in the past few months living with Meitnerium...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you eating up there?\" he asked in an elevated pitch, disbelief evident in his voice as he slowly rose from his crouched position on the tiled bathroom floor. Sure enough, Meitnerium had somehow managed to get her greedy green grabbers on a bag of Lay's Barbecue Potato Chips almost as if by magic. Meitnerium seemed unperturbed by the silly question. \"Yeah, what's it look like I'm doing?\" she asked nonchalantly, shoving a big bite of sliced salted potatoes in her mouth at once, \"Why -crunch- you want some?\" Tom could only shake his head and smile lightly, taking a single obligatory chip as he headed out the bathroom door. \"What?!\" Meitnerium hollered as she carefully stepped off of the scale, \"You're not even gonna tell me how much I weigh?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty's softened jaw dropped in astonishment, \"No way!\" she hollered as she headed after him, \"You're the one who wanted to know so much!\" However, now that he had gotten her attention, Meitnerium <i>would</i> like to know and then evaluate that mysterious \"personal\" weight the scale foretold. \"No time.\" Tom said in an exaggeratedly hurried fashion, \"We've gotta go meet Jerri at the movies.\" Meitnerium let her hands fall down to her thighs in exasperation, making a loud slapping sound against the pillowy pillars of leg blubber. \"We just ate dinner!\" she shouted back at him. \"So I treated you to an early dinner, I've got finals tomorrow and this is the opening night of Battle for New Mexico.\" Tom delegated as he grabbed his keys, \"Plus I just wanna hang this over your head for as long as I can.\" he spat as he started out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerk!\" Meitnerium shouted. Normally she would hurry after him and give him what's-what with a few playful smacks on the back of the head, but she knew he didn't like for her to be outside without some kind of headgear to hide those pretty little antennae of hers. She pawed around the nightstand placed in the entryway where Tom's keys had been laid; picking up a pair of stylish-enough sunglasses and bringing out her hair band. She pulled her snow white locks back, securing them and her dangling Metalean parts underneath the thick accessory and placing the pair of sunglasses atop her head as a further deterrent. Checking herself with a quick pose in a nearby mirror, Meitnerium deemed herself acceptable and quickly hurried out the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes late. As usual; or rather it had started becoming the norm after Meitnerium became their third wheel. She always managed to slow that boy down, leaving Jerri standing out in the parking lot like a loon while the commercials were playing. She had dressed up for this, nothing too formal but still. It seemed that Tom's eye had been revolving around Meitnerium just a little too much for her taste, they never really got to talk much anymore with that green suction nozzle around. At school things were fine, that being when they actually got to <i>see</i> each other, what with conflicting class schedules and whatnot. However they always managed to save at least one day a week for each other, that either being Saturday or Sunday. Her own finals weren't too far away, maybe Jerri could sneak in some face time with Tom during the summer; foreigner free?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Jerri heard the familiar clunking sounds of Tom's automobile approaching; she'd offered millions of times to take a look at it for him, but he'd always refused. She waved excitedly, cupping her hands together over her mouth to let out the familiar beacon: \"TOOOM!!\". It was no shock that four other Toms in the parking lot looked up. As he and Meitnerium emerged from his crappy sedan, Jerri couldn't quite help but notice just quite how round Tom's green-skinned squatter had allowed herself to become in the past months. She struggled to rise from her seat, even as she did so the fully-exposed curvature of her belly simply wobbled up and down along with the rest of her over swollen form.  Of course she had been present for a good bit of her gorging, but only seeing Meitnerium once or twice a week wasn't really enough to take in how much the once svelt and beautiful foreigner had expanded. In a way, it made her happy to see her this large; this <b>fat</b>. But that was a rather nasty feeling, wasn't it? It wasn't like she and Tom were dating... what right did she have to be jealous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time!\" Jerri hollered, still audible across the parking lot, \"I got your freakin' tickets you bums!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIf you two make me miss the trailers, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Jerri began getting flustered as the trio entered the theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u201d Tom brought a finger to his lips and continued the conversation in much quieter tone. \u201cLook Jerri I\u2019m sorry but-Oh, see still early\u201d He said pointing out that the theaters lights were still on and that the projector was still showing those boring god-awful pre-show slides and commercials.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww you just got lucky.\u201d Jerri said as she skipped up a few steps and placed herself in the middle of three open seats in a row, thereby guaranteeing her a seat next to Tom.  Tom and Mietty followed, but Tom waited just outside the row, and let Meitnerium go ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you got the tickets Jer, so the snacks are on me, what\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d He asked in a half whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll split a medium Coke and Popcorn with ya Tom\u201d Jerri ordered. She would have added \u201cone straw\u201d but managed to refrain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLarge Dew for me, and a large popcorn\u201d Meitty said, now halfway to her seat. The florescent green sugary soda agreed quite well with her, and the discovery of popcorn had been an interesting discovery for her. \u201cOoh and don\u2019t forget the butter!\u201d she added remembering the taste of the golden goo as Tom made his way out. She then plopped her near two hundred and fifty pounds into the chair beside Jerri, squeaking into it both physically and audibly. Now left alone with the green glob in the seat beside her, Jerri was given a chance to take in the size and scope of the globular girl that sat to her left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wow! </b>Jerri thought privately trying not to make her stares too obvious. Simply put Meitnerium <i>had </i>gotten rather large, and from the sound of the order she\u2019d given Tom, her growing wasn\u2019t going to stop anytime soon. For what Jerri could tell though Meitnerium didn\u2019t seem to mind, in fact she was wearing smile that was just as wide as the rest of her. Jerri recalled the mall episode, thinking that had been sort of a onetime thing for Meitty, with Jerri along just to see how much the lean and green girl could binge on. Obviously she\u2019d taken to fast food rather well. It was nice that Tom still treated Meitty as one of his friends as Jerri knew a few boys at school who would dump a girl if she started to even grow <i>slightly </i>rounder. In fact Tom had never even complained about what a drain Mietty was when it came to his food and wallet. A shocking thought raced across her mind, causing her heart to skip a beat. One again Jerri snuck a peak at her distracted companion/completion, focusing this time on Meitty\u2019s comparatively wider hips and bigger butt which filled her seat from side to side, as well as her heartier chest which had ballooned up from an attractive but average looking, to huge and almost boastful in their size.  Her imagination getting the best of her,Jerri could see the two hindrances growing larger with the more Mietty ate, eventually eclipsing Jerri from Tom's life.Jerri began to feel a paltry stacked up against such stacked completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until a nasty idea struck her\u2026maybe she\u2019d play dirty. With this short moment alone she could tell Meitty how the fat really made her look here in America, now that would take the pep out of her step! Nicknames like \"Tubby\", and \"Lard ass\",  flooded her brain, and hey she was green too maybe she caller her \" a fatty frog\" or something like that. The evil plotting didn't last long as Jerri realized how easy it would be to tear into this female from far off lands, it simply wasn't like Jerri to do something as mean as that. Tom might even get upset that Jerri had said something his new innocent friend and that was the last thing Jerri wanted from her best friend. Meitty even seemed to genuinely like Jerri, especially if Jerri was the one treating the group for that night. Jerri felt she was being too hard on Meitnerium who as a foreigner probably had a hard enough time fitting in already without the added worry of her weight. So things were set, the way Jerri saw it, if there was a thing between Tom, Meitnerium, and herself, (and she wasn\u2019t saying that there was) but if there <i>were </i>ever to be something between the three of them\u2026 she\u2019d play things fair and square, without restoring to name calling and the like.  Almost instantly afterwards Tom returned from the snack counter carrying a literal armful of snacks and sodas. Handing the snacks to their respective owners, Tom settled down comfortably on the other side of Jerri, and the film began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rush of an action film, the kind were style was placed over substance, in essence the perfect \u201cpopcorn movie.\u201d Taking her eyes away from the movie during one of the films quieter scenes, Jerri looked about her. There was Tom silent and enthralled with  film as always, seemingly oblivious to <u>anything</u> around him, unlike Meitty who was strangely laughing throughout the intergalactic war epic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they call an interstellar cruiser? Fracking faith!\u201d she chuckled to herself, sending her body wildly-a -wiggling. Soon the film (and refreshments) were finished. As the threesome exited the theater they excitedly raved over the explosive film.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think even an SUV would blow up a space ship like that, even if you did drive it off a skyscraper\u201d Jerri said to the group on their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed and added \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so, but tell me that wasn\u2019t cool when the guys found the captured alien tech in Roswell, and then they used that stuff back on the aliens?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Meitty answered who was now quite use to the fact that it seemed humans always won in these things. \u201cBut what was up with that mothership? Ha!\u201d She scoffed as she slid her sunglasses back on perhaps a little too fast as they happened to knock off her thick headband, revealing her antenna for the world to see.  Jerri hadn\u2019t noticed them as she bent down to retrieve the headband, but certainly did as she offered the headband back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Mei-ieie\u201d Jerri gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you.\u201d Meitnerium said unaware of her new nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMietty what- what are\u2026those?\u201d she asked pointing an accusing finger at the dangly-bobs hanging from her head. The act caused a few bystanders to stop and crane their heads to see what the ruckus was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh! OH!\u201d Tom said immediately switching to damage control mode. He quickly searched for an answer to the inquiring question his brain seemingly worked the best under pressure like this. And everything had been going so well too, how come mom and dad never had this problem? AH! Perfect!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS...she\u2019s just dressed up for the movie premier\u201d He near shouted to crowd as he took one step towards Meitty and gave her a playfully punch in the arm. \u201cYeah she's a total sci-fi nerd, I guess they didn\u2019t turn out to look like that at all huh Meitty\u201d he added callously giving her antenna a squeeze in attempt to soothe the awkward lump of a situation. Tom was the first person to realize how increasingly obvious things were becoming but this answer would hopefully be the end of it. He was staring to worry how easy it was now getting for him to lie to the ever trusting Jerri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed off and nervously grinned at Jerri waiting for her reaction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jerri knew Tom Parker better than anybody on the face of the Earth, save for maybe his parents. If there was one thing Tom couldn't do, it was lie; not to her, and <i>especially</i> not on the spot. The diminutive gearheaded girl could spot the signs from a mile away: his cheeks got all red, his smile stretching across his face so that his dimples were set on display, and he began laughing nervously. She narrowed her eyes at the appendages dangling from atop Meitnerium's head, scrutinizing every single detail about the oblong lures that hung from the thick stalks firmly rooted in her snowy hair. Surely they were fake, there was no way on Earth a girl had been born with antennae! Of course, she would have said that three months ago about girls with green skin too. Perhaps just a little procuring squeeze to one of them? Just to reaffirm her position on where she stood with this. She boldly took a step forward, standing about three inches from the twin mountaintops of Meitnerium's cleavage, and stretched a hand out, her fingers primed for pinching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hey!\" Meitty took an instinctive step back, her response simply grained into her Metalean way of thinking. It wasn't intentional; the last thing she wanted to do was to out herself as an alien. But as she realized her mistake Meitnerium calmed herself and came up with a quick lie; \"I mean, don't yank on them!\" she did her best to mimic the elevation and pitch of her previous outcry, getting moderate results, \"It took so long to... uh, attach these things with... um.... stage makeup!\" she stammered. Tom's urge to facepalm was overwhelming, it was only through the toughest of wills that he managed to overcome. Inwardly, he crossed his fingers and hoped for the best; from what he had learned about Meitnerium, the antennae were very sensitive; should she slip up and scream or moan, they would have to come up with another fib to feed Jerri <i>really</i> quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri crossed her arms, \"I just wanna see 'em!\" she sounded very much like a child -her highly pitched voice not helping the allusion- and indeed looked like one as she jumped slightly to swat at Meitnerium's supposedly cosmetic features. \"If they're fake, why won't you let me give 'em a good squeeze?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a good point, both Tom and Meitnerium could see the logic in her statement. And while Meitnerium wasn't exactly comfortable with the idea of another girl touching her doo-dads, there wasn't much else of a choice. She looked to Tom for support, and hopefully some sly Earthling way out of this, but was only met with a simple shrug from the black headed teen. Meitty took a deep sigh and bowed slightly so that the smaller girl could adequately reach the birthrights mounted atop her head. Like a cat with a ball of string, Jerri's face immediately brightened up as she latched herself onto one dangling ball of green squishy skin via her index finger and thumb. She began slyly rooting around in Meitnerium's hair to catch the stem of these stalks, instead finding nothing but the usual shade of green: no glue? That certainly didn't sound fake. Ultimately deciding to go for the direct approach in determining whether or not these dangly doo-dads atop her foreign friend's scalp were fake or not, Jerri prepared fingers for max squeezification. She almost stopped to think that, if they were real then Meitnerium would get one nasty pinch. She dismissed it immediately, chalking it up to the \"Stealing Tom's Time\" section of their friendship. With that in mind, her roughly callused hands got to work; squeezing those little sacks of flesh like pimples on prom night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge to scream was overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in her entire life had any part of her body ever been so abused, so blatantly harmed! Such sensitive, sensual things were those antennae atop Meitnerium's head; why would anyone dare squeeze and twist time like this with such rough hands! The green skinned dough-girl from beyond the stars almost wanted to cry, though not as much as she wanted to punch this little leprechaun in the face. How dare she abuse such a sensitive part of her! But no, Meitnerium managed to hold herself back. \"S-See?\" she rasped through an unfaithly amount of pain, \"Totally... totally fake! I can't feel any sort of... terrible, agonizing pain... whatsoever!\" Satisfied enough, Jerri let go; though not without some slight reservations in regards to Meitnerium's poor choice of cosplay. \"Well\u2026that costume sure is...ummm...nice\u2026but wow, they feel so real though!\" she said with genuine amazement, \"Where'd you get those done, they're actually kinda cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took a deep, relaxed breath as he brought his hand to his chest to quell his beating heart. \"Um... Louise, uh, did them for me!\" Meitty lied on the spot, \"Um... can I get in the car, I left my soda in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was dismissed, Meitnerium waddled quickly into the car, grabbed one of Tom's old discarded jackets from the backseat and let out a muffled scream into it's thick fabric as loud as (in)humanly possible; the pain was simply too much for her to bear. Outside, Tom was not oblivious to this development. \"Oh wow...\" he murmured quietly to himself, astounded at the whole situation. In a sense... had his interstellar roomie just been sexually harassed by his best friend? \"What?\" Jerri asked aloud, picking up on Tom's hushed voice. \"Oh, uh, nothing; I'm just... um, gonna get home and into bed- it's almost half-past ten.\" in actuality, he really <i>did</i> plan on getting out of here and into bed as soon as possible; even the stimulation of Battle for New Mexico wasn't worth repeating his major. \"Oh... okay.\" Jerri said, seeming a little disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at school tomorrow, alright?\" Tom said as he hurried to the car, \"Had a great time, I'll tell Dad you said hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom?\" Jerri asked sheepishly, almost longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I have a goodbye hug?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry, of course you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two embraced, the smaller girl squeezing tightly onto her larger (though ultimately scrawnier) friend as she made up for lost time. She had been feeling neglected; Tom barely spoke two words to her tonight; two words to <i>just her</i> anyway. It was almost like... she was being snubbed out. Was there really something to him and Meitnerium? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After his hug with Jerri, something Meitty was sure to take note of, Tom crawled into his car which seemed to be becoming increasingly more congested. He was not feeling any better about lying again to Jerri, or about his final tomorrow, or about the whining he was about to get from the individual he was practically a private chauffeur for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026oh\u2026faith\u2026\u201d Meitty said nursing her nubs, exploiting the situation if only slightly. That pinch had really hurt, but most of the pain had subsided by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorry about that, I had to do something you know?\u201d Tom said apologizing for so suddenly gripping her green stalks. (Yes go on\u2026Mietty thought privately not yet looking up from her stooped position.) \u201cOn the plus side though I don\u2019t think Jerri will ever wonder if you\u2019re an alien after that, so that\u2019s good huh?\u201d (Yes, keep going \u2026) \u201cAnd if, um, there\u2019s anything I can do to-\u201d (Got him!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe some fast food?\u201d Meitty asked perky up quickly. In fact she\u2019d asked so quickly that even the oblivious-to-almost-all-matters -female Tom could tell she\u2019d been milking the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, <u>one </u>Big Mac.\u201d He said acting as the almighty enabler for Meitty\u2019s addiction. Her pouting eyes told him that that simply would not be enough even with the dinner and popcorn she\u2019d just demolished. \u201cOkay, <i>and</i> a large shake too, but only because you handled yourself so well back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeity giggled in delight before adding, \u201cHey, <i>she</i> was the one who was doing the handling! Worse than that she\u2019s got a grip stronger than yours!\u201d Meitty informed him, still gently massaging her sensitive sensors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll memories of soreness seemed to slip away as soon as Meitty spied a familiar pair of golden arches. She expertly ordered her beefy burger and shake, showing she fully understood how the precious gift to the world that was a drive-thru worked she did let Tom do the actual money handling though. Meitnerium happened to notice in her thrilled pre-eating state that once again Tom seemed to be scraping the bottom of his wallet to fill the top of Meitty\u2019s stomach, and once again there had been no complaints from him.  Hmmm\u2026maybe she could give him something in return, Meitty wondered, now actually feeling a debt of gratitude for someone, someone she\u2019d once only thought of as an unevolved small town hick. Not only gratitude she realized, but when it came down to it whenever Jerri was around Tom, Meitnerium actually felt a bit possessive of him. Well she'd make sure Tom would stay \"her\" Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Meitnerium said suddenly at the pick-up window. She quickly fidgeted in her seat and managed to unbuckle her tight seat belt, leaving Tom in confusion about what she was about to do next. Meitty then leaned across the seat and ever so lightly brushed her ludicrously large torso across Tom as she leaned over in order to retrieve the food and drink from the girl now at the second window. The soft brush-up was enough of an attention getter for Tom, without the fact that Meitty had also slickly used Tom\u2019s left thigh as the support for her left hand. Meitty well knew that the flirtatious move was giving Tom plenty of time to take her in. The girl in the second window smiled as she saw Tom and Meitty had both reached for the bag of food, and unsure of what to make of the scene in front of her simply handed the food to the strangely dress girl. By the time Meitty had again resumed her seated position, Tom\u2019s body had been aroused to fully salute the seducing act. Speechless he could only lean closer to the wheel praying Meitty hadn\u2019t noticed what her light flirting had done to him. Mercifully it seemed Tom didn\u2019t have to talk at all as he drove home for  if there was one thing about Meitty that was <i>almost </i> as amazing how much she could put away, it was how fast she could talk and eat and  yet not do both at the exact same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah, um thanks again for the movie-Oh wait that\u2019s right Jerri got the tickets tonight, silly me. You and her are like, really close huh? I\u2019ll take your silence as a yes. That\u2019s good; I\u2019m uh-glad that you at least take me along too to the movies. So what do you want to do tomorrow? Maybe we could call Jerri over here and weigh her? I have to say though,I think I got her beat even if you won\u2019t tell me how much I weigh *Haha* What do you think?\u201d Meitty said now finally finished with the small-talk, and with her burger, and with gulping the last bit of her shake down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abbout what?\" Tom ventured only picking up traces of the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout hanging out tomorrow...with Jerri.\" Meitty said, slightly wishing she'd remembered to retract that last bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can\u2019t-t-test-t-tomorrow\u201d Tom stammered, his final now actually one of the last things on his mind now. Never had he been \"lightly flirted with\" like this, he was only used to the playful and causal chiding Jerri had so often given him. Jerri!...The hug from Jerri flashed in his mind, and suddenly a wave a realization came over him. Things were becoming even  more complicated in his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Meitty seeing a chance to recover and sounding like she\u2019d just heard about this for the first time. \u201cThen maybe you and I could, I don\u2019t know do something <i>special </i> tonight~\u2026\u201dshe added still using her playfully flirty  if somewhat huskier voice that said \"It's only eleven, and I'm damn well used to saying up way past that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was the one who was gulping now\u2026He didn\u2019t think Meitty was talking about binge eating out of the fridge, though that was something Meitty had once classified as \"something special.\u201d Or at least if she was talking about binging on some snacks, she was really sending him the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of signs. Getting closer to home he knew his mom and dad would probably be asleep by now, or at least they were on their way to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he <i>had</i> done enough studying for the final already , what would an extra hour or two do for him? Nothing that's what. Tom could feel himself getting red, as well as the tiniest bit of sweat starting to form now just underneath his black haired brow. He couldn't hide it any longer, not even from himself, there was definitely a part of him on the inside, a hotblooded and young part that was now admittedly more than just a tiny bit excited to find out what Meitty had meant by \"special\" and would be thrilled regardless of the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...suddenly and without warning, Meitnerium had laid her head down on Tom's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this was a relatively innocent, albeit flirtatious suggestion that even the most innocent of girls here on Earth were capable of putting forth. Apparently, while Tom was distracted by the enigmatic seductress seated beside him, she had lifted up the armrest on her side to allow her clumsy and rather cumbersome shape more wiggle room; sliding onto her side, allowing her generous amounts of blubber to cap off one of the empty cup holders, and proceeded in using Tom's rather bony lap as a pillow. Fortunately she wasn't really there for the comfort; she tried to make that perfectly clear with a deep melodramatic sigh, as if to say \"come hither dear\" in the breathiest of voices possible. With one plump finger Meitnerium gently circled a segment of inside Tom's thigh. Then, to continue the well-practiced routine of bold advancement, Meitnerium turned her head slightly so that only the slightest bit of her sunglasses peeked over her shoulder and let out another sigh of discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should go without saying that Meitnerium knew there was no bone that protruded from the average human's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assumptions on the similarities between Earthling and Metalean physiology correct, Meitty smiled devilishly at the overstimulated young man she was so readily flirting with. \"Why hello there.\" she teased, referring to the formal salute of his Little General, \"You better put that thing away, it makes your lap <i>so</i> uncomfortable.\" she chuckled lightly as she tapped the denim covered soldier with her index finger playfully. \"That's really not helping.\" Tom said, trying to sound as uninterested as possible in the wriggling green visitor in his lap. \"Oh really? On <i>my</i> planet it helps.\" she said in a sultry voice. Slowly her heavy form reclined backwards, her sagging green backfat bunching up slightly as it stacked on top of Tom's lap. She lifted her sunglasses, pushing them back into her neatly combed head of starch white hair as she gave him an inviting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his silence as acceptance, Meitnerium slowly shifted her significantly rounder body until she was in a laying position between the passenger seat and Tom's lap, her engorged ass suffocating anything inbetween. \"Hey Toooooommy?\" she asked a voice that went far over the top. He could only respond with a half-conscious grunt while attempting to form human words; the result sounded a little like \"Y-Yuh?\" Meitnerium smiled wider as she gazed up at her scrawny Tommy; just like on her planet, when boys could barely speak, it was a sure sign that control had shifted between the two predominate brains. \"Would you say that you... like Jerri?\" she asked in the same voice, not allowing her pitch to drop anywhere lower than flirtatious, \"Y'know, like you... <i>like</i> her?\" she gripped the inbetweens of Tom's fingers with her own; slowly using them to push off her headband and reveal the soft, green antennae they concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha... uh, yeah...\" was all Tom could muster as more and more blood was sapped into his now throbbing member. He didn't seem to be aware that his fingers were being gently guided in small circles around the tender dangling ovals atop Meitnerium's head. They, like the rest of Meitnerium's skin, seemed almost flawlessly smooth. As Meitnerium was slowly being massaged, she let out a light moan to vocalize her pleasure, though only to fuel Tom with positive feedback; she had gotten a little dramatic with it. In her best, most breathy voice practiced and tried on many other men, Meitnerium continued her inquiry. \"Oh reeeally?\" she slurred as the circular pattern's of Tom's fingers started to get to her, \"Do you like her like... you like <i>me</i>? You <b>do</b> like me, right Tom?\" Without waiting for an answer she began wriggling again, resting most of her back now on Tom's thighs and allowing her head to fall on the left one, her hair rolling down his leg and touching the floor. Looking back up, she could see a look of unpleasant frustration on his face. \"What's wrong, Baby?\" she asked in a molasses-sweet slur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're bending it...\" he mustered; certainly feeling all those extra helpings of dinner Meitnerium had gobbled up as all of them weighed heavily on his General.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the simply flirtatious smile on Meitnerium's round face grew nearly devilish in her lust, bringing her knees up in preperation for a kneeling position on Tom's lap. As she walked on her undefined knees, Meitnerium found herself at a premature stopping point, only halfway onto her docking station that would have put her face to face with her date for the night. Much to her displeasure, and Tom's disdain, Meitnerium used her leg as a propping point so that she could wedged herself a little further into whatever crevice she had occupied. However a loud honking noise interrupted the two, as Meitnerium's bubble butt had activated the car's horn. \"Oh!\" Meitnerium squirmed in distress, trying to re-establish the mood by prying her heavy self from the steering wheel though finding herself far too corpulent to bend that way anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpertly and without a word, Tom pulled the seat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart boy.\" Meitnerium said finally with bolted confidence. Tom could only smile sheepishly, not quite sure what to do in such a situation that had rendered him so hot and heavy. All two hundred and fifty pounds of Meitnerium's weight rested on top of Tom's thighs, nearly crushing his leg muscles. She drew closer to him with every passing second; her inflated breasts pushing up against him. Before long they were but for the tips of their noses apart, Meitnerium's exposed stomach brushing against Tom's t-shirt as she threw herself closer and closer to him. Tom found himself wrapping his arms around Meitnerium, though he was barely conscious of his own actions at this point. His hands stopped at her hamhock thighs before traveling up to her inflated badonkadonk behind; able to feel where the tight cutoff shorts had constricted the jiggling masses of her swollen thighs by where the bulges. He rubbed gently, with surprising expertise, at the twin mounds of butt blubber. Meitnerium had no complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... you're really good at that.\" her voice dripped with enticement, her cheeks full and flushed with a healthy (well, for her) shade of green as she wrapped her thick arms around the driver's seat; around Tom. \"Do you like this new... <i>improved</i> Meitty you've got here?\" she asked with a devious grin. Tom could only shake his head fervently, \"Y-Yes ma'am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin grew wider still, exhibiting those thick dimples she had sported sometime in the past few months. She tilted her head and forced herself upon him, her tongue prying his lips apart as she attempted to get to know him. The slender, aguavian tongue wrestled with Tom's own rather thick pink tongue inside the conjoined arena of their mouths as Meitnerium pulled herself closer upon him from the outside. Between moans, Meitnerium swatted at the area below Tom's seat; if his car was anything like hers, she could get the seat to recline with a lever or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they both found themselves at a horizontal angle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Meitty said with a lick of her lips...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night passed into a warm haze for the both of them as pleasure echoed through both of their bodies.  The last thing Meitty had known Tom hands had been appreciating her bulbous bottom, and then he\u2019d taken her shirt off, and then he\u2026he\u2026 he went straight for her two stems! From that point on everything became a blur for her, but it was a blur of utter bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same blissful feeling had stayed with Meitty all through the night apparently, and even into the morning. Meitty slowly opened her eyes her head slightly throbbing (specifically her green stalks), and was slightly shocked to see that she was not in her own room. Wait a minute where was she? This wasn\u2019t her bed! What was going on? Meitty now panicked about her seeing no sign of the blankets that had adorned her bed back on her home planet. Wait a minute, she was begging to calm down now\u2026 that\u2019s right she was here on the planet, um what was it? Earth! That was it. Meitnerium began to relax as she remembered she was in her \u201cnew\u201d room her with the Parkers. Okay, but what had made her freak out like that? When had she gotten home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium remembered that she\u2019d been expecting to wake up in the close quarters of Tom\u2019s car but apparently they\u2019d made it all the way home.  One telling sign that what she\u2019d remembered was real had not just been some wanton dream; she was completely nude underneath her blankets. Meitnerium had to do a double take to see that Tom or more importantly Tom\u2019s parents were not surveying her, as if it were some kind of Earthling prank. Simply put she was dumbstruck that she, the princess of all temptresses back on her home planet, had been the one who\u2019d gotten her proverbial world rocked last night. And by none other than the undaunting specimen that was Tom! Now she really wished she could remember more of last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly (well quicker than her normal leisurely pace) Meitty squeezed into on her pajamas and went searching for Tom. Harry suddenly stopped her in the hallway before she could get to some answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Meitty! Any word from back home? See any friends in the movie last night?\u201d He asked way too chipper and way too loud for Meiternium likes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUggghn\u2026Nope...\u201d she said just barely muttering the words as not to further aggravate her headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'll keep an eye on the sky for ya.\u201d He said heading out of the house towards work on this bright and beautiful Friday.  Meitty was thankful he hadn\u2019t added one of his laughs, or else her head might have split in two. Well maybe she could find Tom now before his final today.  Unfortunately there seemed to be another roadblock on her information highway, Louise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019all set Tom?\u201d Called Mrs.Parker in a stern but motherly tone. \u201cIt\u2019s your last test right? Hate to come this far and miss it.\u201d she joked, blissfully unaware of the certain stresses that the modern college student faced when it came to impossibly hard Math finals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d  Came a flat answer from behind Tom\u2019s bedroom door. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly inches away from said door Louise stopped Meitty before she could hide inside Tom\u2019s room.\u201cMeitty dear can I talk to you in private real quick?\u201d Not \u201cup\u201d enough to think of lie Meitty only nodded.\u201cUm...it\u2019s about Tom.\u201d Louise began eyes searching the room as she looked for a place to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh faith... Louise had hear them? Had Tom said something? Meitty was stuck now either way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just wanted to tell you how much a blessin' you've been here. Since ya\u2019ll been around here Tom's been a mighty lot happier. In fact he was smiling at me this very morning like he was the king of the world! And it was a real smile too, not the fake one he gives me when I tell him to look nice for a photo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Thank Faith!  Meitty sighed quickly in relief as she thought of something to say. \"Well... It might be because of \u201cthe summer vacation\" I hear him talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe see what I mean?\u201d Louise laughed as she now headed out of the house.  \u201cYou're just so funny too!  Well I wanted to tell you that and just say thanks before I left. Have a good day dear\u2026Oh wait...\" She turned her head and shouted causing Meitty to cover her ears and scrunch her face in discomfort. \"Eight o\u2019clock Tom! You better get your butt a-movin\u2019!\u201d and on those words she too left the house for work.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally! She\u2019d get some answers about what had actually happened last night; Meitty couldn\u2019t wait to see Tom sweat as she made him go over all the sensuous details. She was about to enter his room, when she literally bumped into Tom himself who was as in much of a hurry as his parents were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-hey-Meitty nice-bed head. Can\u2019t talk-\u201cHe spurted out quickly as he maneuvered  his svelte around Meitty\u2019s form, which was hogging most if not all of the doorway to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom\u201d She began sluggishly turning to follow him as he made for the front door. \u201cWe didn\u2019t-you didn't \u2013Did you tell your parents about our, you know...last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha-ha yeah, our \u201cFirst Contact?\"  He chuckled as if she\u2019d brought up something as minor as a dollar she\u2019d owed him. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t tell them what happened, but I\u2019ll tell you <i>allllllll </i>about what happened when I get back.  It\u2019s a real funny story. I\u2019m sorry, but I won\u2019t be long. Its only one last class, but I\u2019ve got to go!\u201d In a flash the third member of the Parker family left the household leaving Meitnerium just as clueless as she\u2019d been when she\u2019d woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... now what?\u201d she huffed aloud and alone.  She was not familiar with being snubbed like this having usually slept in during the family\u2019s busy morning routine. Seeing as she wouldn\u2019t be getting any answers till Tom got back from his final, she realized she\u2019d just have to keep her self-interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when she saw something that could definitely keep her occupied for a while\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There, in front of the television and placed atop a throw pillow, was a single box of opened a cinnamon flavored variety of the Popped Tarts. Next to the stylized blue box of toaster pastries sat the remote, eerily pointed towards the television in what must have been some sort of strange coincidence. But more than likely it was just Louise, or maybe even Tom... that sweetie. \"Well fine then.\" Meitnerium said aloud with a voice of mock discontent, \"If I can't figure out just how last night went down, I may as well just sit here and wait.\" With that Meitnerium waltzed over to her rightful and well worn space on the couch, plopping herself down with a heavy \"Oof!\" as the cushioned davenport creaked slightly under the abuse. Grabbing her breakfast with one chubby hand and plunging into its cardboard confinement with the other; she pulled out a silver-wrapped pair of pastries that seemed to glisten in the sunlight... or perhaps it was just Meitnerium's hunger-induced imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the box to the side, Meitnerium held her first course of the meal in her left hand and wrapped her right around the controller. With one pudgy thumb, she punched in the necessary numbers for some channel Louise had introduced her to: the Style network -among many others, this one had slowly become her favorite. Satisfied with the hour's programming for now, Meitty placed the remote delicately on the end table beside her and began to unwrap her treat with nimble, green hands. Ripping the packaging open with her index finger and thumb, the green gluttoness wasted no time in shoving the first sizable bite into her mouth; she couldn't help but marvel at how dry it tasted without something to drink. \"Mph... need shomtheng to jrink.\" she mumbled through stuffed cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to rise on her own power, only to be reminded that she had grown far too corpulent to do that on her own very well anymore. \"Ugh...\" she moaned, slowly sliding off of the couch through a series of clumsy and reckless twists. As she reached her feet, Meitnerium was again brought to face another challenge of her new rotund physique: her lack of equilibrium. As the plump lass rose, perhaps just a bit to quickly, she found herself surging forward along with the heavy weight of her top half. Finding balance after a second or two of teetering, Meitnerium scratched her billowing tummy in confusion before remembering her entire reason for exertion. 'Popped' Tarts still in hand,  Meitnerium followed her hunger as it led her towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly bounced out from underneath her casually \"thrown on\" top, it rumbled and cried commandingly for more food to quell its unceasing hunger. Meitnerium could only pat her bloated stomach like she would a small child (well, not like <i>she</i> would have patted a small child...) and coddle the spoiled gullet. \"Man is this thing getting big.\" she said with mild amazement in her trek towards the fridge, \"Must be the food, or it could just be me.\" Meitnerium teased no one in particular, mainly herself, as she rested a hand on the convex of her tummy; she gave it a light slap for good measure before letting her hand rest again. She opened the fridge and took in the sights; what went best with uncooked pastries? They were out of milk, the sweet tea was bad (Harry had made it), and the SmartWater had been drank (Another one of Louise's crazy 'jog' things). The only thing left just so happened to be Meitnerium's beverage of choice, thanks to Tom, and came in surplus around here: Soda. Pepsi specifically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling hungrily at the bottom drawer of the refrigerator, Meitnerium slowly started to bend over. Barely able to crease her apron of a belly even further, she didn't get very far in her quest for a thirst-quenching can of Cola. She was simply too large. Looking down at her stomach disapprovingly, Meitnerium chomped down on the last bit of Pop Tart remaining in her hand as her under-used brain struggled to formulate a plan. She backed up and wiped the residue on her hands to her flannel pajama pants, lurching forward a bit as she held onto the door for support. Finally, she was able to get a soda! Better stock up; anything to avoid this ordeal again! With a quartet of Pepsi cleverly choreographed into any fold that would keep the cans in place, Meitnerium slowly staggered to her feet as she fought off the cold mistress that was gravity. When she was back to a standing position, she simple smiled and congratulated herself on a job well done and her ingenuous skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that things had been taken care of Mietty resumed her place on the couch, plopping back down in the same fashion as before. As she kicked her feet up on the coffee table, Meitnerium let her free hand fall down to the crevice where her spare tire met her lowermost curve of blubber; only moving it when she required a drink from her many cans of soda. \"Phew, that was a lot of work.\" she whined to herself, \"I'm glad Summer's soon, the Tom'll have to stay home all day and pamper me.\" In her complacency Meitty let out a satisfied smile, contented with being waited on hand and foot. The idea that it was Tom made it all the more enticing. Though she had to admit, her appetite had obviously caused some noticeable changes in her; of course it was food that had done it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Meitnerium seemed to remember an old college professor of hers who was quite corpulent; her and the other students used to poke fun at Mrs. Henderson's overall mass quite a bit. But despite being from the Saxxonian galaxy, she <i>was</i> quite the hog! What was that word that Xenon used once to describe her... it started with an \"fuh\"... \"<b>Fat</b>\", that was the word! Was perhaps the same development occurring in Meitnerium, in her own body? It definitely made her unique, a \"fat\" Metalean. But perhaps she had given Mrs. Henderson a hard time, only able to see that now that the two of them had something in common. This \"fat\" development. Looking down at her accumulation of said insulation, Meitnerium realized for the first time that anything below her belly was a complete and utter mystery to her now; she had no idea how her toes looked. What if the paint had come off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Oh well, she'd just get Tom to do it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Meitnerium, like so many Earth girls before her, simply zoned out in front of the television and ate away at whatever was in front of her...</span></div></div>",

Looking around and not seeing the culprit behind the annoying sound Meitty was forced to do her best and turn the volume up higher on the tv. She was not getting up.  But yet even with the adjusted volume the noise continued. Seeing no one else was going to be fixing the irritating problem she finally willed herself up from the couch, spilling pop tart crumbs off her front and onto the floor below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving learned from her previous experience with her own shifting contents, Meitty was a little more steadied when she rose from the couch a second time. As she followed the noise she was surprised when it seemed to be coming from her own room. Now interested in finding the siren like beep, she checked her room and discovered it was coming from her own pod of stuff.  Her mouth fell wide open when she saw what was making the racket; her distress beacon had been answered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fatter fingers fumbling, she opened the shell of the container and retrieved the glowing beacon inside.  Now in her hands she re-situated the phone like object, ready to hear the voice of who ever had answered the signal. She pushed the red button that was labeled \u201cANSWER\u201d in Meitty\u2019s home language, and waited for a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Meitnerium Perioda? Is that you?\u201d she heard a voice on the other end ask. Meitnerium was shocked, not only because someone had actually found her way out here, but because the voice on the other side was not a voice of a galactic worker, it was actually really familiar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the voice of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"D-Daddy?!\" she shouted into the receiver, \"Is that really you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium had to admit that was a pretty stupid question. Not only because of the well recognized, deep gravels that only her father's voice could possibly possess, but also because looking at the screen of her telephone she could clearly see the words \"Dad\" written in blocky Metalean letters. It may have been a little fuzzy, but it was definitely her Daddy on the other end! She paused, leaning onto the dresser drawers for support as she waited with bells on for an answer. At this point she was really more excited to just <i>hear</i> her father than go home; she didn't realize just quite how much she had missed him in these long months. \"Dad? H-Hello?!\" she brought the phone closer to her mouth, raising her voice to overcome the approaching static, \"Daddy can you hear me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of -ourse I -an!\" Her father's voice was overpowered by what sounded like grain, like he was standing at the opposite end of the ocean. Meitty managed to hold back tears as she heard him shout, \"S-e's o-ay!\" to somebody in the background, probably her mother and all of her friends waiting for her back home. \"-oney I'm s- gla- you'- o-ay!\" He said loudly into his own end, \"Your M-oth- and I have m-ed you so m-ch!\" In the background she could hear digitized sobbing, likely her mother weeping into the side of the phone. \"I missed you guys too; oh I'm so happy I can talk to you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was fading, fast. She could hear it, her father's words became more and more muffled by the oppressive static between them. \"-eit-erium?\" she held up her phone with doughy arms and stood on her tiptoes, putting her father on speaker phone so she could get it as close to the beacon as possible; which wasn't very close at all, considering it was in orbit. But Meitnerium was desperate! \"I'm here Daddy!\" she shouted, struggling to hold back tears of joy. \"W-re a-e you?!\" she heard her mother shout into the phone, \"Ple-e baby, yo- h-ve to te-l - wh-e you are!\" Meitnerium nearly lost it when she heard her mother's voice. She immediately wanted to bring the phone in closer so that she could talk to everyone waiting on her at home; but should she move that receiver any closer to the ground, she could very well lose signal entirely! \"I'm in the Milky Way system; Earth!\" she shouted loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-re?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>Milky Way System!</i>\" she parroted herself loudly; emphasizing the name of her crash site very clearly. \"Please, come and get me! I want to see you guys so much!\" She brought the phone down at the sound of a low beep, her phone vibrating softly in her fleshy hand. Panicking, Meitnerium tilted her head up towards her phone; worst nightmare realized in the form of a dully lit screen and a low battery signal. \"Oh Faith!!\" she shouted, bringing her phone back down on reflex. \"No no no; this battery was supposed to have a shelf-life of six Metalean months!\" Immediately she caught herself. \"FAITH!!\" she shouted as she looked at the screen. \"Mom? Dad? Hello?!\" she shouted to a non-responsive party. <br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"I love you...\" she said softly before closing the phone. Tears slowly began to roll down her rounded cheeks and her chest began to rise; Meitnerium had lost the one and only contact she'd had with anybody from home in the last few months all because she didn't bring her charger. She tightened her grip around her phone before throwing it onto the bed in rage, giving it a quick punch before completely breaking down into a blubbering mess on top of her covers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even get to say goodbye...</span></div></div>",

Even with the events of the night previous flashing in his mind, he still managed to bring out the facts he worked so hard to memorize. Now with the campus in his rear view mirror he couldn\u2019t wait to get home and start vacationing. His heart was beating with excitement as he thought of all the fun things he\u2019d get to do this summer with Meitnerium. As he entered the house Tom smiled when he saw Meitty had been through the box of pop tarts he\u2019d left out, and that the TV was still on. But wait\u2026 was that\u2026 crying? Hurrying through the house he found Meitnerium in her room face down and weeping into her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitty\u2026 what?\u201d he began unsure where to start.

At least you know they\u2019re looking for you, and at least they know you're safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...well, so.\u201d Meitty said sounding stubbornly inconsolable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I guess our planet\u2019s must be pretty close, because Earth was close enough for them to reach your beacon. I bet your peoples space-ships can get here pretty fast...It's not like they'll have any trouble picking what planet your on either, everyone...well except maybe dad, thinks we're the only \"livable\" planet in our solar system.\u201d Tom found the words were  quickly coming to him as he stated the honest to goodness facts, not like his lies which often took long to think of .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty said nothing, but had stopped her bawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd hey! Till they come get you, you still have us here on Earth\u2026You still have\u2026me.\u201d  He leaned in and placed just the smallest kiss on the top of her snow white head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tom!\u201d Meitnerium said as she sat up and tightly embraced him, (almost sending him tumbling over and off the bed.) She rested her head against his shoulder before speaking again. \u201cYou know what your right. They\u2019re probably doing all they can to find me right now\u201d She added feeling a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is something we should celebrate!\u201d Tom said hoping Meitty would remain positive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good\u201d Meitty said giving one last final sniff. \u201cI\u2019m going to \u201cwash up\u201d and then we're going out.\u201d she commanded now back to her semi-bossy self, as she headed into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d Tom said, only happy to see Meitty brighten up so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and Tom\u2026\u201d she added, sticking her green head out from behind the bathroom door, \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting out of telling me what happened last night\u201d and she tossed her top towards Tom. She giggled from behind the bathroom door, and Tom knew everything was going to be okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would have been minutes if it were Tom showering up, turned into an almost hour long affair as he was once again forced to wait for Meitty to get dressed.  It proved to be worth the wait though as Meitty was absolutely stunning as she exited her room. Looking  quite hip(py) and ready for summer in her printed cotton tank top and shorts,  she was far from the blubbering blob of a being she\u2019d been a few hours ago. Tom found himself quite pleased as he realized Meitty\u2019s top wouldn\u2019t be close to covering her growing green gut, <i>and</i> at the sight of her shorts as they were slightly sinking into her hips. The two were signs that Meitty might need to go shopping again, but maybe that was something best saved for later this summer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne again packing into the snug car Meitranium was feeling better, even happy, now that Tom was here. <u>Her Tom</u>. Meitty knew he was right, her parents would be looking for her and find her any day now, even if it might take a while. For now there was no use in crying. Lost in her thoughts about her family Meitty hadn\u2019t realized they\u2019d apparently arrived at their unusual destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for something special?\u201d Tom asked Meitty, wearing a grin that looked a mile wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty took in her surroundings and realized they were at\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...a relatively unimpressive building in design. Despite its poor architecture and design, the parking lot of said building was simply flooded with cars of all kinds; ones that Meitnerium could easily identify as a \"rich man\"s or a \"poor man\"s vehicle simply by looking at the automobile in question. Granted, she was judging them by her own standards which in turn had been established by her father, but the basic principle was the same all things considered. Tom's teensy-weensy Sedan nearly rolled into the parking lot (fitting into the \"Poor Man\" quality quite nicely) as he started strolling around the lot looking for a parking space. As he drove, Meitnerium had to restrain herself from pressing her nose against the glass of her window to see what was so \"special\" about this building. Not only had it attracted apparently hundreds of patrons before her, it was obviously special enough for Tom to consider taking her here for a date -was date the right word? Nevermind...- Her golden eyes traveled to the corners of their sockets as she sought out whatever mysteries this no-doubt hot spot for Earthling dating had to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, from what she could make out, was a brightly lit place with amusingly tacky choice in decor. There were humans of all stature, great and small both in position and in size, seemingly going through some sort of maze bound by felt rope. Of course, it may have just been a trick of the light or something, there was no way Tom had taken her into a... club? That would be so sweet of him, taking her to a dance club! She <i>did</i> like to drink; and she <i>did</i> like to dance. Oh the thought of how long it had been since she'd been dancing, it nearly made Meitnerium shudder with delight! She longed for the panels of translucent squares of elevated solid light that supported the only the most talented, sexy, or well-recognized movers and shakers that had come in that night. She never really figured where she fit into in all of those categories; hopefully all three! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, this was a club on <b>Earth</b>; a place that, as had been made painfully obvious during her stay on this planet, was not nearly as technologically advanced as her home on Metalement. Again still, from the images that she had absorbed in her long hours of T.V. troping Meitnerium guessed she still had plenty to be excited about. Maybe the outside was just temporary, a facade until they could get something cooler and edgier? Either way, so long as it had good booze and some killer beats Meitnerium would make the best out of her attendance tonight. The thought of rocking all of these podunk Earth hicks with her out of this world (literally!) dance moves made it all the while, and it showed in the excited smile that bunched up between her ever-rounding cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it the car had come to a complete halt in a tiny parking space between an SUV (surprisingly enough to Meitnerium, the \"S\" did not stand for \"Space\") and an old hoopdie car that bulged a little bit over its own parking space and into Tom's. \"Well, you ready?\" the curly black headed teenager asked his green-skinned sweetheart. \"You know it!\" she squealed, bringing Tom into her embrace for a big kiss on the lips, \"Oh Tommy you've made me that happiest girl in the Galaxy!\" she teased him lightly, \"I mean, taking me out to a club on our first date; maybe you've got just a little bit of Metalean charm in you after all!\" she finished off with a quick coo and relinquished the poor suffocating boy from his squishy fate. \"Wait, Meitty!\" Tom called after her as she wiggled her plus-sized bum out the door; she left the SUV's door with a nasty ding as she underestimated the size of her voluptuous booty and the space it would require: thus rocketing Tom's door into its side. Tom hurried as fast as he could out his own door before he noticed the sizable dent and took priority towards insurance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup guys?!\" Meitnerium shouted as she boisterously waddled her way into one of the side doors that led inside this mysterious and severely underdeveloped Earth \"club\". As she makes her way in, in all of her revealing glory, she catches the eyes of father mother and child; none of whom can seem to stop staring at this eccentric green girl who looked quite the part of patron to one of these institutions. \"Is she green?\" a daughter turned to her father, \"My God, she didn't have to be so loud!\" a single mother coddled her son's ears, \"See Sherry, that's what you'll end up like if we sell the Bowflex.\" a husband nudged to his wife as he gestured towards Meitnerium's fully exposed midsection. \"Where's the party?!\" she continued under the false idea that this was a club, instead of a rather family-oriented chain of buffets. Oblivious to the derogatory remarks she was garnering from the guests tonight, Meitnerium sauntered up to the felt rope and squeezed herself between the aisle. \"What is this, why're we all just waiting here?\" A homosexual man in front of her turned back with repressed hatred in his eye, \"We're waiting to get in.\" he said curtly before turning back to his date. \"Waiting to get- what is there a bouncer or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened yet again to reveal Tom, exhausted from the panic of dinging a very expensive looking car and chasing after Meitnerium. He wheezed and panted as he slowly broke in the quickly-forming line to get to his date of the evening. \"Meitty...\" he gasped helplessly before he was brought into another killer squeeze. \"Oh and here's the man who brought me here to my first club here; <b>here being in Texas because I'm totally from Earth</b>!\" she squealed, \"Oh Tommy Tommy Tommy you sure do know how to get into a girl's heart, don'tchu?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a club... it's a restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium paused for a second before dropping Tom in shock. Had she? She had, hadn't she! She'd made a total fool of herself in front of all these Earth people! She turned on her heels and faced the back of the man in front of her's head with an audible \"hmph!\". Tom, still trying to catch whatever breath he had left, couldn't do much more than smile and let out a little laugh as he saw Meitnerium pout, no doubt hiding an even more verdant face than usual. \"It's one of those all you can eat places; the ones you've been bugging me so much about... while you're... um, in this country.\" At this she melted visibly, \"Oh, oh Tom I...\" she caught herself and turned right back around, \"No way, I'm still mad at you for making me look like a fool. And <i>not</i> taking me to a club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want we could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothisplace'sgood!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they patiently waited for their turn to enter this food mecca, Tom could see the meatier Meitty before him was far from mad; she was visibly trembling with excitement as she stood in line, her fingers titched anxiously at her shorts, and it seemed her golden eyes had grown to match the size of the restaurant\u2019s dinner plates. The undeniably deprived- starved if Tom didn't know better- gleam in her eyes spoke everything Tom could possibly want to know about Meitnerium's intentions for tonight right then and there, its testimony further accentuated by the deep rumbling of her greedy gullet. And after more than their fair share of waiting, they were gloriously admitted entrance into this bounty, smorgasbord if you will, and were escorted to a booth on the far right side of the restaurant. Their booth was small enough to cause Meitnerium a little grief, but the interstellar porker managed to wriggle her way into one side of tonight's table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Tom finally began after a few seconds of awkward positioning on Meitnerium's part, \u201cGo ahead and help yourself.\u201d he commanded his elliptical date for the evening. She seemed at a loss, which all things considered was quite understandable. Especially since she had just managed to heave herself in there, Meitnerium never was one for physical exertion. \"Help myself?\" Meitty repeated in an almost haughty sort of tone, \"You mean they don't... you know, bring the food to us?\" Tom smiled and rolled his eyes, \"You're just so laaaazieeee!\" He taunted Meitnerium with the last word, rising from his own seat so as to lead a tutorial in self-service. Meitnerium's jaw dropped, \"I am not lazy!\" she said in an elevated pitch as she wriggled her way out of the booth, \"I just thought that these people, like, brought us whatever food we wanted!\" She was actually sort of looking forward to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And spoiled too.\" Tom said as he grabbed Meitnerium's pudgy green hand, \"We've really gotta get you used to this whole 'Earth' thing pretty quick.\" He guided Meitnerium towards his first inclination regarding her tastes: the Meat section. Seeing that she wasn't too fond of salads, either because it was healthy or the similar pigmentation shared with her own skin creeped her out a little; Tom wasn't sure. But that didn't leave much either than fruits and, well, the already reached destination that was the Entree's. He watched with a sort of fascination as Meitnerium held back the floodgates of saliva and sheer gluttony, easily able to tell that her first instinct was to grab the biggest hunk of anything and shove it in her mouth. She rested her hands on her grumbling midsection, trying to quell its incessant growling. \"Tom.\" she whispered, almost as if not to offend the culinary gods themselves with her ignorance \"How does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom simply smiled and held up a single finger as if to say \"just watch.\" as he expertly and nonchalantly walked up to the section where the roast beef was being handled and cared for. He garnered the older gentleman's attention and made the rather anticlimactic order of \"Large order of roast beef, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, in Meitnerium's astonishment, the chef smiled graciously, grabbed his knife, and began cutting up the immaculate hunk of meat in front of her to Tom's direct specifications. \"No no, a little bigger.\" he said with confidence, \"Meh, maybe with just a little more pink on it...\" and when, in what seemed like eons to the onlooking Meitnerium, Tom the placeholder had completed her order; resulting in a rather large slab of roasted beef. She poked it, almost grabbing at it with her bare hands before Tom ushered them down. \"There's no way you're just gonna get that one slab of beef!\" he said with mild amusement, \"You can get more before sitting down, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably the best thing Meitnerium could have heard at that point. \"I can?\" she asked, devilish intent made clear in her narrowed brow and greedy smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom eyed the giant stack of ribs that Meitty had devoured and contemplated over whether or not that poor pig had any ribs left to spare after Meitnerium got a hold of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was already her seventh... no <b>eighth</b> plate; he wished he\u2019d kept track as he was sure the number would have been in the double digits before the day was through. He was beginning to understand why Jerri had pushed more and more food on Meitty at the mall that afternoon, he was getting a little excited (in both sense of the term) as he watched the green gobbler stuff herself further. Meitnerium sure did take advantage of the all-you-can-eat experience, and for what he\u2019d pay for Tom thought it was an awesome deal. In fact he was pretty sure that place was actually losing money on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo about last night?\u201d she asked suddenly, wiping her lips clean of any leftover rib residue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe topic was unavoidable, she'd said several times throughout the meal that they were going to get it out of him after the next course. Fortunately for Tom, she had been pretty preoccupied in indulging herself and failed to notice that she had already gone through two more plates before noticing. \"Yeah... well, you know you weren't exactly yourself; I mean you were practically... well, <b>literally</b> climbing all over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I was a bit horny last night.\u201d She mentioned dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHor-nee\u201d she said again a little too loud for Tom\u2019s comfort. \u201cYou weren\u2019t exactly taking it easy on the girls last night.\u201d She explained pointing directly at where her antennae would be had they not been covered. \"Well yeah, I guess I was kinda 'on' myself last night.\" he lowered his voice to avoid attracting attention, \"Um we were...\u201d His mouth was running dry as finding the right words to describe last night was becoming difficult. \u201cAnd you, uh, just laid the seat back; we both were naked, and well weeeee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm yes\u2026 go on!\u201d Meitty ushered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd well, I\u2019m pretty sure you know what comes next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do, but tell me anyways.\u201d Meitnerium said eagerly, almost sitting on pins and needles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is where it gets pretty funny.\u201d Tom said happy to get to the \u201cpunch line\u201d of the story. \u201cIt was right around that time where you started uh on top of me, but I guess you weren\u2019t quite used to a compact car, because well, you jerked up and hit your head. Hard!\u201d he said exploding into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I said. I knew you were fine, but you were o-u-t out. That was pretty much the end of things before they could even really start. It was a good thing too that mom and dad had gone to bed too because I had to drag your 250 pound butt all the way to your bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that certainly explained Mietty\u2019s \u201cmorning after\u201d headache. She was very disappointed at this lackluster ending. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to make up for it double next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s faced flushed red. \u201cNext time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah we\u2019ll have plenty of fun till my parents come back\u201d she said twirling a pudgy finger through her pearly locks. \u201cBut I have just one more question\u2026 Tom am I\u2026what was that word, fat?\u201d She pinched an inch of her stomach to highlight the topic in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Tom gulped. He had all ready accidentally let slip her weight, and now he had to diffuse this bomb of a question that now landed in his lap. Worse yet, unlike Jerri, Meitty could tell when Tom was lying; better tell her the truth then\u2026\u201cUh-well I don\u2019t know about fat\u2026curvy maybe\u2026\u201d Oops. \u201c-Which is perfectly fine!\u201d He shouted not wanting to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. He leaned in closer \u201cIt\u2019s actually common around here to be on the\u2026plus size of things\u201d he whispered across the table. His eyes motioned for Mietty to take a look around at some of the heavier, much much heavier patrons that obviously frequented this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Two hundred fifty pounds doesn\u2019t sound like that much. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t tell me. \u201d Tom breathed a sigh of relief as Meitty who was much used to wieght in massive tons than paltry pounds wriggled her way out of the booth. \u201cIn fact you seemed pretty fine with all this last night\u201d she added with a golden eyed wink and a shake that sent her bulk a bouncing. Tom could only smile in response. There was something about this alien\u2019s attitude that he loved or was it something about that big, green, jiggling ass\u2026.Now that he thought about it, Tom couldn't be sure which one he liked more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of their time there continued in the same fashion; as Tom talked Meitty ate, and ate, and ate, finding new surprises of taste with every plate; even recognizing some familiar ones. Hot plates of mashed potatoes and thick gravy, garlic bread, spaghetti, sesame shrimp, hush-puppies, pepperoni pizza! All of it enchanting to her taste buds. Tom was glad her spree wasn\u2019t gaining any attention here (well from anyone besides him) and that each time Meitty went up for another helping she was patient as she waited in line. Time passed and eventually, Meitty had completed her trip up and down both sides of both buffet tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tom, this was\u2026 *buraap* Sorry. This was absolutely perfect.\u201d Meitty said content with letting her own hands do the tummy rubbing for now. \u201cI want to come here every day!\u201d she half ordered half bemoaned. The idea was tempting to Tom but he knew it would probably remain a fantasy, he could imagine the restaurant owners putting up a \u201cDo Not Serve\u201d sign behind their register in the dead center of which would be a picture of Meitty. In one day whether from her previous grief, or for the celebratory situation, or simply from hunger Meitnerium Perioda had nearly ate the place dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Meitty. I don\u2019t think so. But I do think we\u2019re missing one thing from this being absolutely perfect\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Unable to think of anything that could make this even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDessert.\u201d Tom said with a grin that looked like he\u2019d been eating a certain dirty something himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The concept of dessert was not foreign to Meitnerium. During the long months of her endeavoring stay on Earth, more specifically the Parker Household, she had grown quite familiar with the concept of something sweet following a meal. Usually it was a simple slice of apple pie to satiate her need to fill that one small space that another whole ribeye seemed much too big to fill, though she had been known to devour an entire tray of brownies when the mood struck her; the spectrum seemed to fluctuate haphazardly. And while she was by all means a woman with food after her heart, Meitty didn't quite know just what was so exciting about a tray of brownies. Well, no more exciting than usual. \"Oh, well, works for me.\" the taut-tummied extraterrestrial said in a slightly surly slur, trying to keep the flirtatious air about them alive, \"But can I have a sec to digest? I feel like I might pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled and cooled his jets, \"Sure thing.\" he said understandingly, \"You feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its just... phew, I ate so much food!\" at this Tom's gaze traveled downwards to their table, where the conquest of Meitnerium's latest culinary massacre had yet to be taken away. And of course she was right, this wasn't quite her limit but Meitnerium had eaten a lot more than Tom had expected her to. In fact, she had probably eaten more than anyone else here tonight! \"Yeah you did.\" Tom could only reaffirm her statement at this point, there was little other option other than blatant agreement. \"I-I've just got this sharp pain, riiight here...\" Meitnerium gestured to the ailing area in question, it being the apex of her distended stomach. Tom reached out and touched it gently, only for her to wince and recoil in pain. \"Ow!\" she yelped, \"Knock it off you jerk!\" Though as she returned to her reclining position, Tom could clearly see the problem as a small shadow formed under Meitnerium's prominent stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do me a favor?\" he asked slyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your feet up on the booth?\" he pointed to her sneaker'd green little feet, \"And then lay back on the side?\" Meitnerium stared for a second, trying to discern the strange post-gluttony ritual of Earth before doing as Tom asked. Immediately, that being as soon as her stomach was free to drop heavily between her thighs. \"Ooh!\" she cooed in amazement, \"Much better!\" She examined the little flushed imprint the table had left on her stomach with mild amusement. \"Frickin' Faith, you people should really get adjustable booths.\" she made the indigence in her voice very clear as she said that, \"A girl wants to get her grub on and you podunk little hicks make her poor ol' tummy hurt!\" at this point her intentions were clearly not meant to offend, flirtatious even as she cradled the addressed \"poor ol' tummy\" sensually, looking at Tom with her best 'come hither' eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me some dessert?\" she said in a low voice as she massaged her overloaded stomach, \"I don't think I can get back in this booth if I ever get out... not that I wanted to.\" she whimpered. Tom could only smile knowingly. The girl was good, he had to give her that. \"Ice cream it is then.\" Tom said in an approving tone before rising, taking a second to disguise his hard-on the best he could. Meitnerium chuckled, \"Oh my, happy to see me indulge myself?\" she asked quietly. Tom could only smile back before retreating to the dessert section. Meitty watched as he walked away, and as soon as he was out of earshot she began howling quietly to herself. \"Owowowowow!!\" she whined as she held her poor overstuffed tummy close. It really hurt after so much food, but she wouldn't dare let Tom see that! \"Oh... ohh...\" she moaned quietly as her best attempts at soothing the raging fire inside her belly proved useless. Massages were beyond useless at this point, it looked very much like she had swallowed an Earth Basketball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a heated pain that radiated outwards, not unlike burning oneself on a heater or an oven. Her plump little fingers danced around it anxiously trying to cease the pain, but the natural processes were already at work. What she was feeling was digestion; her body was trying to break down way too much food at once, and she was definitely paying the toll for her gluttony. Oh if only she had refused those last three or four plates, she wouldn't be in this mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her eyes brightened when Tom came into view, ice cream cone in hand...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the sight of Tom with ice-cream, Meitty resumed her everything-is-fine-with-me position bearing with the burning in her belly.  As Tom handed her the single scoop cone Meitnerium noticed he\u2019d even adorned it with a cherry on top. Not just yet ready to dig into the ice cream, Meitty moved towards the cherry which she usually saved for last and expertly grasped it between her lips. Then still with the cherry in her mouth she managed to tie the stem into a small knot, giving Tom the impression  that her tongue was now probably the second most used muscle in her body, the first of course being her growing gluteus maximus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium swallowed the cherry with a wink, but then she cringed as the insufferable sensation within her seemed to return. You might say her body had now reached a tipping point. Chemically her body had adapted from the quick fill-me-up of nutrients of her planet\u2019s food pills, and was now quite accustomed to digesting Earth food slowly throughout the day or while sleeping like most humans. But now the odd combination of the variety of foods within her, including the cherry, had sent her digestive system into overload. The constant inflow of food from the buffet had pooled inside of her stomachs limits, but now with so much different food stacked inside of it, her stomach\u2019s contents had reached overspill status. One half of her strange alien body was getting the signal from the other half to digest as much as it could as fast as it could to make room for more food. This chemical reaction took place in a matter of seconds, but sent Meitty\u2019s metabolism into a hyper \u201cstore and save\u201d mode. This prompt processing was the cause  of her previous stomach aches, but now this process meant she could eat even more, which<i> also</i> meant she would be  packing on the pounds at an even impossibly faster rate! Meitty\u2019s body was set to store sustenance, putting her on the fast track for further fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Glooo</font><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">orrrro</font><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">p</font>*</b> The sound of liquids shifting and splattering erupted from Meitty\u2019s stomach, so loudly in fact that her stomachs throbbing and vibrations seemed to shake the very table it was pressed against. However now that her body had \u201cprepared\u201d for more food the burning seemed to have ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, everything\u2026okay?\u201d Tom ventured to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026Yeah I think I just made some room actually!\u201d Meitty said trying to explain how the pressure within her had strangely disappeared.  This hadn\u2019t been like a burp; it felt strangely different, as if the food she ate had sunk into a new lover part of her stomach that she never had before. Shrugging off the sensation she made quick work of the delicious ice cream cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Mmph, </b>more please!\u201d she commanded felling like she had gotten a second wind of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were almost music Tom\u2019s ears, both of them looked equally happy that some room turned into a quite a lot of room actually. This time he was sure to count the calories and the cones she was chewing through. He moved up to double scoop on the cones, stacking some of the chocolate and vanilla scoops from the restaurants gallons, which just like the buffet were limitless in the amount of visits allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty showed that she was in full swing this time hedonistically handling the cone in only four very large mouthfuls.  And the cones kept coming with Meitty quickly finishing each flavor. This time she ate them slower which gave Tom another opportunity to admire her as she patiently ran her tongue over the ice cream to bring its cold, smooth, rich goodness to her taste buds. Three, four, <b>FIVE! </b>The gorging Meitty was putting on display was now everything short of gulping down the ice cream straight from the tank, and while Tom quickly filed <i>that </i>fantasy away for later, he saw her consumption  was  now drawing a crowd. As she finished her 6th double scoop cone of a cone he decided enough was enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Meitty look at the time!\u201d He began feigning shock as he quickly looked at his cellphone.  \u201cWe really have to go!\u201d He said extending a hand to the booth babe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way! I was just getting started!\u201d she whined licking her lips for any sweet chocolate residue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be late you know, for that thing\u2026\u201d Tom said arm still extended. \u201c<i>C\u2019mon Mietty, people are staring</i>.\u201d Tom whispered  pushily between a clenched teeth smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo!\u201d Meitty added snobbishly turning her head away for effect.  Much to Tom\u2019s chagrin he would have to get Meitty to stop eating when it wasn\u2019t really the<i> eating</i> that annoyed him, it was the fact that people were staring that was the issue, and recalling a similar scene from the movie \u201cMy Favorite Martian\u201d he decided it was better to leave now before the people staring started asking questions. Tom, now more than a little ticked off, now forwent the formal extended hand shtick and was forwardly gripping Meitty from both sides, well gripping as  best as he could. Fortunately to onlookers he still looked quite gentlemanly, as if he were gently ushering his heavier set date out from the stall.  However the two didn\u2019t seem to move; Tom\u2019s might was no match against Meitty and her perfectly placated pudge. His hands sank into one of the rolls that were now Meitranium\u2019s sides and his forward progress soon halted leaving him pushing in place. Trying with all his might, now face to face with her heavy bulk, Tom realized grimly Meitty wasn\u2019t budging. In fact Meitty looked quite entertained by his futile attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what\u2026\u201d Meitranium began in a tone that absolutely knew it was going to get its way. \u201cI\u2019ll go\u2026if you promise me a tummy rub tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Tom said, he could live with that sort of punishment, even look forward to it a little. He had only resisted contact with Meitty because most girls he knew (excluding Jerri) just didn\u2019t like to be touched (plus the whole she\u2019s an alien thing, but he\u2019d gotten over that rather quickly.) As he warmed up to her he\u2019d grown accustomed to getting into close quarters with his heftier housemate, but he absolutely drew the line at tummy rubs which she so often asked for. Considering the events last night, and along with the rest of his new found feelings he had for Meitty, a tummy rub wouldn\u2019t be too taboo to Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty seemed to sense this air of agreeableness and so she decided raised the stakes. (Hey this was her ice cream he was messing with!) \u201cAaaand, you have to be my private butler all day tomorrow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d  Tom shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then. You know I wonder if that Roast Beef guy would mind if I got back up and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Okay! Okay! Please\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Meitty giggled as she attempted to slide her way out of the booth. Tom moved in to help and saw that only by just turning ever so slightly sideways Mietranium narrowly avoided getting stuck in the booth. So close together and for an added effect for the crowd around them Meitty kissed Tom squarely on the mouth, which Tom returned, picking up the not-so-subtle residue of double chocolate ice cream on her warm, moist, plump lips Finally, the bill was paid, and once again they crammed into the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway home Tom noticed Mietty could barely keep her eyes open and was presently using his shoulder as a sort of sleep-support. Her drowsiness (an obvious effect from the super-stuffing she\u2019d done) meant that her system could use this down time to further her hyper active ingestion and absorption of food. In fact if either of them had focused close enough they would have noticed Meitranium\u2019s already swollen stomach seeping forwards as her body slowly stored away more and more fat. All that food was going almost instantly to her thighs, her hips,her chest, and her\u2026well everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home Tom led Meitranium in her almost sleep-walking trance to her bed where she crashed face first into a pair of pillows.  Tom smiled as he watched the pea colored (and increasingly pea shaped!)  girl before him drift into sleep with a content smile on her face, her early morning miseries completely forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom too felt rather tired and considered a nap. But gazing at the grass colored girl before him with her fleshy midsection spread out like a vast and lush verdant meadow, he could feel excitement building within him rising to attention once more. After a day like today some sensual snuggling/tummy rubbing sounded pretty good to Tom, and after all a deal was a deal\u2026 But maybe Mietty would rather just sleep? The easily distracted girl would hopefully forget about the whole \u201cprivate butler deal\u201d thing when she awoke.  And so Tom decided that would probably be the best course of action, simply crashing beside her, utterly wiped from the whirlwind of a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Mitranium, left alone to its work and with plenty of food to work with Meitty\u2019s mega-metabolism went to town processing as much nutritious food it could handle. Slowly as she slept Meity\u2019s stomach stretched upwards and rose outwards growing a tiny bit larger and heavier with every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis rare odd chemical reaction taking place within her would definitely end up changing Meitranium much more than a normal meal would  but by how much?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meitnerium was definitely bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a position looking upwards at Meitty's sagging green adipose as it rested heavily on her thickly padded thighs, the realization of her growth could only resound in Tom's mind as he wriggled and writhed. Her t-shirt, borrowed from Harry's rather heavyset brother Dick and then inconsiderately converted into a crop top to allow roomier accommodations for Meitnerium's fickle sense of comfort, had allowed the globular green gut to surge forward and her position forcing it to form into two distinct belly rolls as she reclined lazily on the couch. Her cutoff jean shorts were worn tightly around Meitnerium's pronounced thighs, even now as they separated from each other to better allow Tom's maneuvering as he struggled on his knees. Looking up for a second, Tom could even see the ever-thickening crease that formed at the meeting of Meitnerium's pair of chins. \"Ohhhh Tom... come on, hurry up...\" the overfed invader whined as she felt Tom's curly black hairs brush against her belly, \"If you don't know what you're doing down there then just get up and do it manually... I'm getting so frickin' hot and I can't stand it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up a second!\" Tom grunted, snapping out of his flab fervent trance and back to his labors, \"This isn't so easy when you're sitting down, why don't you spread your legs a little bit more?\" Meitnerium looked down past her engorged top half at the struggling Earthling in an annoyed humor, \"My legs don't <i>go</i> any farther Tom.\" she answered with a heavy sarcasm, \"Unless you want my shorts to rip I suggest you just deal with what ample space I've provided you with and do your thing.\" Tom just had to grit his teeth and bear it if he ever wanted this to be over with; he closed his eyes and reached a little bit farther. Nope that wasn't it, and that wasn't either. <i>That</i> certainly wasn't it, and he didn't even know <i>what</i> that was! Maybe this was useless after a- no wait, there it was! Tom's fingers could definitely feel the sweet spot! \"Oh Tooooommmmmm...\" Meitnerium slurred as the addressed human boy got a firmer hold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have <b>got</b> to try this ice cream!\" she exclaimed as Tom slowly rose from his position on the floor, \"Did you get the remote?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled, \"Yeah, no thanks to you.\" he jeered, \"How did it even get so far underneath the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I know.\" Meitty said dismissively as she fanned herself with her free hand, \"Turn up the AC, its so frickin' hot I'm gonna die here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom chuckled as he walked down the hall and fiddled with the cooling unit, \"How can you be hot?\" he asked in mock innocence, \"That's like, the fourth thing of ice cream you've been through this morning.\" Meitnerium gave him a look before responding with a dismissive, \"Whatever, just go get me another case while you're up.\" Tom bowed playfully before exiting to the kitchen through the dining room, \"Of course Malady, whatever my mistress commands.\" he said with a snicker. \"You're so weird!\" Meitnerium cried as she used the newly recovered remote to change the channel to E!, \"Please tell me Earth slaves don't talk like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom emerged from the kitchen with yet another container of ice cream for his ever-growing belle, \"Nah, not all of us.\" he said casually as he plopped down next to Meitnerium's expanse, \"And we prefer being called 'Butlers', not 'Slaves'.\" Meitnerium tossed the container aside and began tearing into the new one with fervor, her bent spoon evidence of the intensity with which she feasted. Her doughy stomach gurgled as it made quick work of the digestive properties Meitnerium's body was going through, her earlier bouts of gluttony nearly converted into precious energy storage and byproduct. She could feel, though didn't address, the tightening feeling that panged underneath the blanketing apron of her bloated midsection; no doubt her neglected waistline threatening to pop the button on her denim cutoffs before this container was out. Whatever, she just wanted some ice cream. \"Yeah, mmph.. but I own you.\" Meitnerium said through glucose-coated lips as she turned to Tom, \"So doesn't that mean that I can call you whatever I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Tom said as he pretended to contemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always have them.\" she said confidently as she deep throated her next mouthful of ice cream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down Meitty, you shouldn't eat so fast.\" Tom said advisedly as he watched his verdant romancer down what had to be the first half of her latest conquest in sugary sustenance. \"I know, I know; its just...\" she paused to wrap her lips around yet another spoonful, \"Ever since last night, I just can't stop eating!\" a hint of amazement was detectable in her voice as she looked down at her swollen form. \"You don't think I have a problem, do you?\" Tom looked at her blankly, \"Several.\" he said playfully; Meitnerium punched him in the arm. \"No seriously!\" she said with discernible concern. \"Yeah, seriously: several.\" Tom said again before receiving another quick jab to the arm. \"Whatever, but when I get mistaken for a woman from the Saxxonian galaxy, I don't want to hear you complaining.\" she huffed. Tom stared on blankly before Meitnerium realized that the analogy was lost on a member of a non-interstellar species. \"Sorry, space girl joke.\" Meitnerium said lightly before returning to her lazy ways of television and ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nestled in closely and tentatively touched Meitnerium's gelatinous midsection. \"If that's a way of asking if you're gonna get too fat for me, then I'd have to say no.\" he said expertly, \"I like you for you, Meitty- not how you look.\" Mietnerium smiled coyly and lowered her eyelids. \"Oh really, so on the off chance that I get all skinny again you'll still love me?\" she said whimsically as she gestured to her tummy, \"You'll still like me even without my lovely Space Lady lumps?\" Tom cracked a smile, \"Well, lets not get carried away now.\" he said impatiently as he smoothly moved his arm from the top of Meitnerium's stomach to grab at her lovehandle. \"Ooh, you beast.\" she purred as she brought her Earth beau in close for a deep, passionate round of spit-swapping... </span></div></div>",

He sighed at the interruption, but went to answer the door anyways. He caught himself and remembered to peek through the door\u2019s eye-hole before actually  opening it. It was Jerri standing on the other side of the door, but something looked like it was bothering the usually levelheaded Jerri. Before he could ask her and find out what the problem was he had to take care of Meitty and her antenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty it\u2019s Jerri\" he said just loud enough for Meitty to hear, but not his guest just outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Mmmpg</b>\u201d  Meitty said which translated in mouth-full-of-ice-cream speak as \u201cSo, what do you expect me to do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, put a hat on or something\" Tom pleased, but still Meitty remained physically and emotionally unmoved. Tom sighed. \"<i>Oh, please</i>, Mistress Mitranium\u2026\" Nodding in approval, Meitty began rocking her rolls in attempt to get up and dispose of her ice cream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ding Dong <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Knock Knock knock</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again followed by a series of knocks Tom couldn\u2019t leave Jerri waiting much longer, so he would have to stall for time and hope Meitty would get up on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerri...uh...hey!\u201d Tom began as he opened the door and propped an arm up against the door-frame, slightly barring Jerri from entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Tom....Can I come in?\" Jerri said looking a lot less lively than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come in?\" He said voice cracking slightly. He craned his neck and saw that  Meitnerium had at least moved from the couch. \u201cS-sure!\u201d he said lowering his arm and letting her step inside. \u201cIs, um, something wrong?\u201d he asked his usually plucky pal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you can tell...Tom it's horrible!\" Jerri began already getting visibly heated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Jerri just have a seat, and calm down\" Tom offered, unsure how to handle  the firecracker of emotions set to go off. Jerri did take a seat, finding the spot on the couch had a deep dent and groove into it, and was also strangely...very warm. Tom sat down beside her as she immediately went off and into her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we had a kind of  late customer come into the shop, and, and, well, I thought no problem we'll fix it real quick, and I'll still have plenty of time to study for the final. Well, next thing I knew Mom was mad and calling me, telling me it was almost midnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" was all Tom said, knowing exactly where this was leading too. Jerri was almost near tears, her the tough tomboy was almost actually crying! He leaned in closer and put an arm around her, but Jerri still didn't feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course the next day was the final! So I know I just did terrible on it and, I really think I bombed it!\" she finished sounding quite upset with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,Jerri.\u201d  Tom began as he brought her into a tight  one armed hug.  \u201cYou couldn't have failed that test; one, you\u2019re like the smartest person in the whole school! And two I hardly studied for that final and even <i>I</i> think I did okay on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, your just saying that\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Jerri, who's the one who wouldn\u2019t let me forget every time she  got an A on a test, which was almost every week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that was before the final! I know I did bad on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s over now right? I mean worrying about it won\u2019t really change your score.\u201d Tom said getting a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from having an oddly similar coversation with Meitty the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell..yeah\u2026 but still.\u201d Jerri said now just looking for a reason to continue her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill nothing! It\u2019s summer Jerri, we should do something to take your mind of the final.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean...maybe just you and me do something special?\" The idea certainly brightening her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe not just us two.\u201d Tom said retreating a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost as if on que Metiranium Perodia entered the room looking wonderfully refreshed and today sporting a sun hat. Thighs thundering she pounded her way to where Jerri sat(in <i>her</i> spot next to <i>her</i> Tom!) Her stomach acting as a moon  eclipsing Jerri\u2019s few of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi Meitty sorry.\u201c Jerri said to the belly before her. The two made room for Meitty by scooting over, and she lowered her bulk comfortably into <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">her</span> the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Meitty looked impossibly bigger than ever to Jerri! Something about the fattened female on her right made her feel better about the oblivious boy on her left. Almost as instantly as her test troubles had gone, another thing that had been troubling Jerri had been solved:Tom and Meitty. She had once thought Tom had put her in the friend-zone passing her up  for the new \"bigger\" more feminine looking\"green girl in town. Well she certainly was \"bigger\" now, bigger all over Jerri noted privately. Strangely even after putting on the pounds Meitty still looked like a knockout, albeit a heavyweight one. Her exotic green tinted skin had remained flawless, with nary a stretch mark or inch of cellulite blemishing her body. And of course there was Meitty's rack, and her ass, which had only doubled in size from the amount of calories she'd been feeding on. But with Meitty porking up into..this...before her very eyes, she felt like she no longer had to worry about any \u201ccompetition\u201d with Tom Meitty wise. Now she could wait till the foreign female went home, and then she'd make her move on Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jerri!\" Meitty said smiling a mile wide. Tom was thankful Meitty had cleared all evidence of the ice cream pig out from around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I was saying before Jer, sitting around all day wont help.\u201d Tom noticed how hot it was and a plan clicked inside his head, <i>a very good plan indeed</i>. \u201cHow about a dip?  He offered as a suggestion to both help Meitty stay cool and to help Jerri forget her worries, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">and definitely not because of the idea of seeing the both of them in swimsuits was enticing</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dip?\u201d asked Jerri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDip?\u201d asked Meitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a dip Jerri! And no not the kind your thinking off Meitty...What do you think Jer?\"</span></div></div>",

He rummaged around his closet for a bit as he searched for a shirt that was well-worn, something he didn't mind getting sandy, until he finally settled on a powder blue tee bearing the hoover-flagged Monopoly mascot with the words 'bankrupt' in all caps. Expertly putting his mother on speaker, Tom swiftly removed the shirt from its hanger, removed the one he was already wearing, and slid it to fit snugly over his trim form. \"I-Isn't that a little sudden, Tom?\" Louise asked from the bed, muffled through Tom's comforter. He bolted over his phone and switched it back to earpiece, \"Uh, I'm sorry I didn't catch that; what'd you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother sighs, all too used to dealing with Tom and a supposed selective hearing he might have developed at some point in between the scoldings. On the other end, she can't help but smile. She knows who he's going with, Meitty and Jerri, and just doesn't have it in herself to tell him no. \"Just never mind.\" she says in a tone that is dripping with attempted exasperation, though her laid-back attitude is still very apparent in the way she drags out her syllables. \"Well I guess, so long as you're home by eleven.\" Tom, as he pulled up his trunks, gained a little bit of pitiful influx in his voice, \"Oh come on Mom, its Summer!\" he said with his smile running a mile wide, \"You're seriously gonna give me an eleven 'o' clock curfew on my first day of summer as a College student?\" As he makes sure everything is in order, Tom can even picture his mother's face as she rolls her eyes from the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright fiiiiine...\" she says mockingly, \"...Two-thirty, just don't wake up your father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a bit of a stretch.\" Tom said in disbelief, \"I mean, I'm <b>sure</b> we'll be back before then, Mom.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I never know with you two crazy kids anymore.\" Louise said with a hint of coyness, \"You and Meitty have been getting awfully close these days, I just don't want to intrude.\" Tom couldn't help but smile, though he was a little worried as to just how much she realized their closeness lately. \"Cut it out, so does that mean I can go?\" he asked impatiently. \"Now hold on Tom, do you need money?\" she admonished, \"Does Meitty even have a swimsuit that will fit her... physique?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, the thought worried him slightly too, but even if Meitnerium didn't have something lying around that would at least make her halfway decent, there was no way <i>he</i> was going to complain. \"I'm sure she's got something... like a super-stretchy rubber bathing suit or something, you know how she is.\" Louise started to correct him, in that she did <i>not</i> in fact know what the intergalactic house guest might have tucked up her ever-snugger sleeve, but her office phone rang, it was an important client. \"I have to go, have a good time with the girls okay Honey?\" she rushed, \"I will Mom.\" he said in a forced bored tone, \"<b>Be safe.</b>\" she warned, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a click, she was off the line and Tom was left to whatever trouble he might get into. Not that he was going to get into any trouble, he was a good kid for the most part. And that's probably why his mother was so eager to trust him, if he had been anyone else she might have stuck firmly at eleven. Maybe even ten. Either way, the point was that he had gotten the permission to go. \"Hey Meitty!\" he shouted down the hall, \"Do you have a swimsuit or what?\" Standing at her door, Tom all but forced it down as he eagerly wait outside. \"Yeah, of course I do!\" he heard her response from inside the room. Raising an eyebrow inquisitively, Tom cracked the door open and started inside, \"No, I mean one that <i>fits</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his shock and awe, Meitnerium hadn't so much as changed her clothes as much as she had forgone them completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught candid, Meitnerium's heavyset shape was turned away from the doorway with every ripple dimple and fold exposed to the artificial breeze created by her bedside fan. She was poised in an arching position, one flabby leg mounted on the foot-board of her bed. Her long, ivory hair which had grown only longer in the weeks of her whimisical life on Earth, now reached halfway down her thick agave back and rested against her collection of back rolls. Her rear, which sagged quite heavily on the side that had her mounted leg, seemed much bigger without any tight already-outgrown clothing constricting it. As she turned to face Tom, Meitnerium's cheeks dimpled with a smile; \"Yeah, I've got a suit that fits.\" she said nonchalantly as the smell of aerosol filled her room. A low hissing noise seemed to come from behind her as she moved her arm towards her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his plus-sized sweetie turned around, Tom could see the better half of a bikini formed across one gelatinous leg, and one that looked all too real at that! She continued, not at all ashamed with herself or aware that this was far from the Earth culture, and started on the other leg before lifting up her stomach and filling in the crotch. Tom could only stare as the bikini bottom slowly came into shape around Meitnerium's massive rear. \"Mind getting my butt?\" Meitnerium asked with relative ease of her boy toy, \"I've been having trouble reaching back there lately, but at least I know where all those meals of mine are going.\" she said with a slight crinkling of her nose and a promiscuous slap to her buttocks; causing it to wobble and shimmy about wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom couldn't refuse, though he was far from silent. As Meitnerium tossed him a can of what felt very much like ordinary spray paint, Tom creased his brow in confusion as he scrutinized the task asked of him. \"So what, just point and spray?\" he almost sounded like he was holding a loaded gun! \"Yeah, don't you have Spraysuits here?\" Meitty asked, \"Oh my Faith you don't, I forgot. You're a hick.\" she giggled. \"Excuse me for coming from Earth.\" Tom refuted as he slowly sprayed the material onto the wide canvas of Meitnerium's ass. As he sprayed, there was an instant track whose material was indefinitely swimsuit material! \"Wow, cool.\" he said with a sense of expected amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium twirled around quickly and grabbed the can from him, \"Sorry Tommy, my girls are much much too civilized for Earth monkeys.\" she teased as she lifted up one of her naked breasts. Starting underneath the left one, she expertly forged a generous cup to nestle her breast into and then created a duplicate on the right side before joining them in the middle. \"If you want, I'll let you do my back.\" she said, tossing him the can again. Eager to play with one of Meitty's space toys for the first time, he eagerly accepted. \"Anything you want specifically?\" he asked coolly as she gathered her hair in front of her. \"Nah, nothing fancy, just make sure it connects to the straps I sprayed.\" Shrugging, Tom connected them with a double line and capped the can. \"That should be it.\" he said laxly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you Earthlings really don't have spray-on suits?\" Meitty asked with amazement as she hunted for a hat that went with her bikini, \"What do you do when you need to go to the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just grab a suit, I guess.\" Tom answered dumbly as he caught himself staring at Meitnerium's wide, wobbling behind. \"That's lame.\" Meitty said dismissively, \"Do you think it'd look good if I wore a sun hat with this?\" she asked girlishly as she posed. \"I think you'd look great if you went nude, but this isn't that kind of beach.\" Tom joked as he watched the incredulously fattened alien before him strike poses. \"You'd like that, wouldn't you?\" she teased before shoving him aside, \"Come on, Jerri's gonna be here any minute!\" she said impatiently as she walked out the door, Tom not far behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there are really beaches on Metalement?\" Tom asked as he searched his shorts pockets for his wallet, \"I mean, actual beaches?\" Meitnerium scoffed as she plopped down on the couch, \"Of course there are, you're not the only planet out there who likes to get some sun; just about every planet out there has a beach... save for Continentia.\" she said as she reached for a recently placed pouch of Hi-C, \"In fact, there're a few planets that're nothing <i>but</i> beach out there in the Shoal galaxy.\"   Meitnerium said matter-of-factly. \"Wow, so are they like the same on Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I've never been to one on Earth.\" Meitnerium said as she sucked the liquid from her pouch in one mighty inhale. She grabbed her sunglasses beside her and put them on as she heard the sound of Jerri's Jeep pull up in the driveway, \"Are the waters in Port Aransas green?\"</span></div></div>",

What color is the water then?\"  Meitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just keep  that a surprise.\" Tom said with the air of someone who knows a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Beep! Beep!</b> Came the happy sounding horn from Jerri's Jeep only a few feet from where Meitty and Tom stood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jer we see ya!\" Tom said greeting the curly haired cutey with their traditional fist bump.  Tom paused as he noticed Jerri was also in a rather dashing looking bikini, it was black and not exactly as form fitting as Meitty\u2018s but it still enough to turn heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked nonchalantly. In actuality she knew what she was wearing was having the <i>exact</i> effect she wanted on Tom, her best friend Tom. She had decided that Tom had been right by telling her not to worry about the final now that it was done; now she was focused on being a little bit more assertive and focused on other goals\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">nothing</font>.\u201d Tom said as he clambered into the front seat.  Meitty\u2019s mass hopped into the back seat giving the smallish ride just a slight hitch. Soon they were on the road and Meitty was picking up where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what else do the beaches on Eart-er, here have?\u201d she asked as she fiddled to make her seatbelt fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell crocodiles for one.\u201d Jerri stated mischievously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-Oh, yeah! And <b>sharks</b> too!\u201d Tom said catching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait those things on TV with all the teeth? You hicks are frickin crazy!\u201d Meitty said wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we were just kidding about the crocodiles Meitty, they won\u2019t be where we\u2019re swimming.\u201d Tom clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026I see, she was kidding\u201d said Meitty not one who liked being tricked. \u201cAnd the sharks too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Jerri began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>CRAZY!</b>\u201d Meitty shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled as the friendly chitchat between the two continued. A certain line from the beach boy\u2019s summer anthem \u201cSurf City\u201d echoed like a hymn in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two girls for every boy\u2026.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they\u2019d arrived at the beautiful Port Aransas coast. Meitty was stunned by the strange beach the colors here on Earth were so...different; instead of the sugar white beaches of her home world Earths sand had been toasted into a brown sugar color, and the water! Tom wasn\u2019t kidding when he said it would be a surprise to her with the blue water\u2019s color matching the sky, it was shades different than the green colored oceans of her home world.  And not only the land but the locals as well caught Meitty\u2019s attention. Boy boys boys! Buff hunks that would have out the stud of her previous beaus to shame. (Hey Tom was still hers but it never hurt to do some shopping for eye candy, which in fact Tom seemed to presently doing with Jerri.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty let Tom's staring slide as she began squeezing out of the jeep. The heat hit her once more and a \u201cdip\u201d into the water sounded just what she need on this scorching day. Letting the soft sand massage nicely against her feet, she practically bounced towards the blue water, drawing a few stares as she did so for many reasons. As she neared the blur surf before her, she felt that if the sand was this nice and toasty that water must be just right. Why she\u2019d go in feet first and let the nice semi warm wave of water hit her just like at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>BRRRRRRR F-F-F-FRICKING FAITH! </b></span>This water was even slightly warm at all; it was <span class=\"cblue\">F-F-F-Freezing!</span> Immediate Meitty rose from the cruelly cold water and ran back onto the warm sand and into the hot sun shivering as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom and Jerri who were carrying a multitude of beach going supplies began cracking up at the sight of her retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is something wrong ma-lady?\u201d Tom teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-ttt-Towl!\u201d Meitty begged as she reached for one. \u201cW-why didn\u2019t you t-two tell me?\u201d She wined as she toweled herself dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-t-to c-c-cold for ya?\u201d Jerri said mimicking her stutter. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the beaches where you\u2019re from, but we like our beach water cold and bracing here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you know the waters of Metalement are twice as warm as the waters here and twice as nice. It\u2019s like a hot tub all year long!\u201d Meitty said defending her home<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> planet. </span> European country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if the waters too cold here for you there\u2019s still plenty to do.\u201d Tom said helpfully.  \u201cYou could stay here and soak up some sun\u2026\u201d Tom offered holding up a bottle of sunscreen. (Tom wouldn\u2019t exactly mind taking said lotion and lathering up either of the two girls with him- <i>oops</i> he meant protecting them from harmful UV rays.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri seemed to sense the intent of the offer and cut in \u201c-OR... There\u2019s plenty of stores and stuff at the beach front. I even think there\u2019s a chili dog shack somewhere around here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good!\u201d Meitty said on the word chili alone. Chili had lost its place to double chocolate ice cram on the list of her favorite foods, but it had always had a special place in her hart as her first Earth food. Now adding the on top of a hot dog and Meitty was already starting to drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know about Meitty being by herself...\u201dsaid Tom his protective side taking over. \u201cPlus I think I left my wallet back at the house and\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Oh I got it!\u201d Jerri said quickly, as she magically seemed to pull her own wallet out from the pyramid made from a myriad of beach things. She grinned as she handed the soon to be leaving Meitnerium  a crisp green twenty, more than happy to buy some alone time with a shirtless Tom Parker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Thanks!\u201d Meitty said quickly, as she snatched the comparatively colored twenty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Tom tried to argue but he knew there would be no stopping Meitty now \u201c...Oh well just be safe ok Meitty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She assured him adjusting her now slightly wet sun hat to show she fully understood what Tom had meant. With a turn and a wink she half waddled half wadded through the sand and surf to the shops on the shoreline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 now what?\u201d Tom asked turning from watching the green girl of his dreams bounce into the distance, to the best friend he\u2019d now be spending some much needed bonding time with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We</i>, start by putting lotion on my back.\u201d Jerri said handing him the bottle and laying down on a spread out towel. Tom was surprised at how flirty Jerri was acting not that he minded, and if it stopped her from crying over the final\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes <b>MAM!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty had now done lot more walking than shed planned and wasn\u2019t happy about it. Fortunately the air conditioned gift shops and trinket stores had gotten her mind off the heat, but while some of earth\u2019s beachwear it was really that interesting to Meitty, and for once she didn\u2019t see anything that would be worth buying. She exited a store and that\u2019s when she noticed the open air eatery just a little ways down the street. Nearing the hot dog shack Jerri had mentioned she was greeted by the familiar flavorful smell of fries frying and chili cooking, the smells slid into her nose in and gave it a tasty hug. She lowered her monster bubble butt onto one poor stool that was just barely able to accommodate her soft and cushy tushy\u2019s bulk.  Unsure what to order she simply displayed the twenty to the worker behind the bar top. \u201cUh how many chilidogs can this get me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef/owner of the small stand blinked at the twenty and his eyes bulged as he traced it back to its big biking clad owner, something clicked as his mind took a second to put two and two together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, *ahem* a twenty would buy you about fourteen chili dogs, but for someone like yourself- uh, someone really hungry not fa-uh, we have the yard-dog special. That\u2019s three foot long chili dogs, plus a milkshake and a side of fries. You eat all of that and you keep the twenty plus you get a free t-shirt. But you don\u2019t finish it all in an hour and we keep the twenty. Sound good? He said offering the challenge to the chubby customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds delicious!\u201d Meitty said her stomach already rumbling at a chance for more food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jerri lay perfectly horizontal on a prepositioned towel; her arms crossed under her chin, the tips of her toes and her elbows just barely able to feel the hot sand on either end from their woven shield of cloth. She faced the shoreline, as per her request, and let her eyelids grow heavy as the sun baked her farmer's tan away and the pleasantly cool summer breezes blew over her. The small sunbather sighed contentedly after taking a deep inhale of the humid air as Tom's boney fingers lathered up her back with thick milky lotion. A satisfied moan escaped her vocal chords, not that she minded. Tom was a really good masseuse, and if his strong hands made her groan a little then by God she was going to groan. There was just something about him that was... special. Something unique to him and him alone. It was this that made her all giddy and excited whenever they made plans together, and it was this that had urged her to bring out her itty-bittiest bikini; all the better to entice Tom Parker into... or her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that was wrong of me...\" she pouted slightly as her inner conscience won over yet another moral tussle. Jerri had been struggling with these slowly growing feelings for Tom for quite a while now, ever since she saw him in Chemistry 101; he the tallest boy, she the shortest girl, and when they were assigned partners how he just so calmly accepted her proposal of being lab partners together. Over time they started becoming really close, friends even. She was so scared of college when she first enrolled, it was nice to have made a friend so quickly. In fact, Jerri largely attributed her outgoing nature in the classroom to Tom and his ever-encouraging presence. When he wasn't around or they didn't have a class together, she felt so out of sorts... so it was only natural that the two of them started hanging out over the weekend! And then she was sure that they were getting so close to one another, so <i>connected</i> to one another! But after only a month or so of weekend booking with her best buddy, it seemed that he had taken in someone else in the meantime. \"Oh... no, it's not Meitty's fault...\" the thought was as unpleasant as chugging a pint of rubbing alcohol, but Jerri's conscience won yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really wasn't Meitner... Meitnare... <b>Meitty's</b> fault that Jerri held this hostility towards her. In fact, Jerri wasn't even quite sure why she felt such animosity towards her other than being another girl who gets so close to Tom. But something about her... the way she talked, her sense of humor, even the way that she ate was just so strange. So <i>alien</i>. It was almost like this verdent european girl wasn't from this <i>planet</i>, screw not being American! Aware that she was getting a little carried away, Jerri exhaled deeply and allowed herself to simmer down. At any rate, Jerri and Meitnerium just didn't click. There was definitely more to that girl than Tom was letting on, but that was for another time at another place. Tonight was for her. Namely her, Tom, and whatever promiscuity may occur on the sandy coast of Port Aransas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out another one of those slight moans as Tom's hands dug deeper and deeper into her muscle tissue, rubbing the sunscreen deeper and deeper into her pores. \"Ohh... you're really good at this.\" Jerri decreed as Tom started rubbing her shoulders. \"Yeah, well, I try.\" the boy stammered, trying to ignore the undeniably flirtatious tone in his best friend's voice and keep his eyes on the afternoon sun instead of her tight little body. Admittedly, it was a stark change from Meitnerium's engulfing mass of blubber (to which he had grown quite accustomed to working with lately) but in a way it was a call back to normalcy. Before his contact with the greater universe, Tom had never once considered a woman of larger proportions (well, certainly not as large as Meitnerium was getting) attractive. But there was a certain guilty pleasure present in Tom as he watched the slender hottie from beyond balloon until she was worthy of her own solar system. Jerri though... she was human. From Earth. It was refreshing, comfortable even to not have to worry about foreign infections or puncturing some kind of bladder. Of course, she was certainly nice to look at too... which is why this little incident would be wiped from his little black box when Meitnerium asked what he did all day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number three!\" Meitnerium said gleefully as she hoisted up the cumbersome dog with both hands, slowly lowering it towards her mouth. As soon as the weiner made impact, Meitnerium chomped down on a mouthful of miscellanious pig parts and made quick work of them, churning them into masticated meat mush. She swallowed and repeated in a heartbeat, her ravenous appetite guiding her pathetic muscles in their gluttonous attempt to feed. This really was, in retrospect, probably the easiest thing Meitnerium had ever done for competition. Seriously, she had downed two-thirds of her challenge in less than thirty minutes. It was like, a competition made just for her. In no time she was at a third of the dog and, with a mischievous smile that was half-laughter half-voracious intent, she practically deep throated just about the whole darn thing. She chewed, swallowed, swallowed the remaining two inches of tip in her hand, and smiled triumphantly as the clock ran stopped with five minutes remaining. \"I believe you owe me some money, mister.\" she teased the vendor with an outstretched hand, quickly refunded her twenty dollars by a begrudging salesman. She cleared her throat, lowered her sunglasses, and peered at him underneath her sun hat, \"I believe that I also get a free t-shirt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling somewhat, the vendor reached underneath the counter and pulled out what could easily be a small blanket, tossing it at Meitnerium without a word (at least that I would care to repeat). Mocking the vendor now, Meitnerium stretched it out, finding it a stretch for her arm's length. \"Oh wow, this is a real treat.\" she said with sarcasm, \"Dippity Doo Dog's... nice name.\" The clerk grumbled something at her, his rudeness only enticing her more. \"Tell you what Dippity-Doo Guy,\" she ventured as she pulled her spoils over her head, \"I'm still kinda hungry, think you could whip me up three more of those yard-longers?\" she said in a cocky tone as she waved the twenty in front of his nose. He rolled his eyes... technically there wasn't anything stopping him. Things weren't too busy yet... but she sure was a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not.\" he grumbled, snatching the twenty from her chubby fingers. \"Just try not to let your ass leave prints on my stool.\" he quipped before looking over at said engulfing rearend, \"I'm sorry, stool<b>s</b>.\" Meitnerium gasped, \"Ugh, I didn't pay for rudeness, guy!\" she spat back, \"Just go on back to your little kitchen and make me some damn chili dogs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"And don't get too used to that twenty, I'm gonna be taking it from you <i>all day</i>!\" she hollered </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back on the beach Jerri and Tom had switched positions. Tom fidgeted slightly as Jerri\u2019s small and nimble hands massaged this way and that across his back leaving a winding and wiggly trail of coconut smelling residue on his back like footprints on a beach. Jerri was enjoying the massage just as much as Tom was and was trying with the best of her ability to suppress her girlish giggling. Curious to see what Tom himself was feeling, she worked her strong car tuning hands from around Tom\u2019s broad-ish shoulders and sneakily snaked her way lower and lower\u2026<b>and lower</b> untill..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJer!\u201d Tom said as he jumped. He\u2019d felt her mischievous hands working down to where his back ended and his swimsuit began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes<i>ssssss</i>?\u201d Jerri asked, her catty voice not masking her suggestive intent at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">oh</font>, nothing\u2026just that stuffs <i>cold!</i>\u201d He spluttered, thankful that he was laying facedown and was able to hide his growing excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he's still be playing oblivious huh? Well Jerri knew she could step her game up! She went back to his shoulders moving closer to him before speaking. \u201cYou know I think Meitty had the right idea...\u201d Tom could feel her voice drawing nearer to his ear, her breath on his ears and neck. \u201cI mean she\u2019s out and about with everyone and here we are, out on our first day off, and we\u2019re stuck on this side of the beach, all alone.\u201d Tom turned his head to glance sideways and saw what Jerri had said was true.  Sure, way, way, farther down the beach near the shops, stores, and eateries the usual small crowd of beachgoers had formed, but oddly their side of the beach was nearly vacant.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, must be because we got here so early. Plus we\u2019re like one of the first colleges out for the year so it\u2019s not that odd that we\u2019re\u2026a-alone. He said shakily as his mind realized why Jerri had pointed this fact out.  Things we\u2019re becoming immanent between Tom and Jerri and he realized he was going to have to do some deciding quick. The last thing he wanted was for Meitty to come back, see the curly haired couple locking lips (or worse hips!), and then he'd be stuck in the middle of a girl fight between his best friend and interplanetary lover. (Well two wet girls in bikini\u2019s wrestling each other over him actually wasn\u2019t a bad- <b>NO BAD SEXDRIVE!</b>) Then again if he did reject Jerri\u2019s advances and say...jumped into the cold water to \u201ccalm him self down\u201d their whole friendship might take a turn for the worse. If he\u2019d only known what Jerri felt for him before Meitty had shown up, he would've be perfectly happy to go out with Jerri! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Tom thought of something even worse... Now that he and Meitty were unofficially going steady and now that Meitty had settled down so well into Earth life, he\u2019d been taking her alien-ness for granted. Just like in the movies Meitty would eventually have to go back to her home planet and to her own family by the end of this whole ordeal and that could be any day now! And if Meitty left him after he\u2019d broken things off with Jerri, then where would he be?  Alone that\u2019s where! Within his head Tom began to panic. How did he get himself into this mess? He gathered his thoughts took a deep breath and decided: He would have to go out with both of them. It was as simple and sinful as this; Meitty would be his interplanetary plumper princess and Jerri his honest to goodness hardworking Earth girl in the long run.  For now he had to just keep an eye out for Meitty, which considering her present <span class=\"cgreen\">color</span>, <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">size</font> and <b>shape</b> that wouldn't be too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong Tom?\u201d Jerri asked him waking him from his thoughts. \u201cWas this a bad spot? Should we move?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Tom said as he remembered his somewhat double dealing of a decision. \u201cIt\u2019s not such a bad place at all. Besides I\u2019m sure we can think of something to keep ourselves busy...\u201d  He said thanking his time with Meitty for flourishing his facility for flirting <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd wh-what did ya\u2019 have in mind?\u201d Jerri asked quickly. Tom didn\u2019t need to see the look on her face to know what it looked like; he could practically here her heart beating quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019mores\u201d he said turning over and surprising Jerri by wrapping the wriggling girl with his wiry arms. \u201cA special kind of S\u2019more maybe\u2026\u201d he added, even here with Meitty a distance away the food analogies still came up. Jerri grinned and almost punched him in the arm, but instead elected for a quick peck on his chin. This eventually began something that was not Tom\u2019s first time making out, but was certainly his sandiest session of kissing ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty wrapped her plump lips around her second \u201cthird\u201d foot long chilidog.  She was practically a glowing emerald as she helped herself to another bite of chili covered perfection. The vendor however was turning green just watching her eat. Meitty, who was far from sick, seemed to be greedily gulping the second round of dogs even faster than the first! He watched as the next mouthful of dog disappeared into her mouth, pushing out her bulging cheeks as they were filled to capacity, all the while her face brightening into delicious delight still obviously enjoying the cooked dogs flavor and  the chili\u2019s hot spices. <b>God!</b> The way her stomach was making the t-shirt she\u2019d won ride up it was almost as if she was fattening up right in front of him. This was in fact not far from the actual truth, for much like at the buffet the fire in her stomached had been relit and her digestion indeed was immediately burning the food that was coming in and turning it into nice thick fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 <b>*chomp*</b> 2 <b>*oomph* </b>1 <b>*gulp*</b> The last bite of the last dog was engulfed by Meitty as she slid it between her lips grinning slyly.  <i>Mmmmmph</i> she audibly swallowed and the vendor could watch as the food lump slid down her throat and splashed down into the ocean of fat that was her stomach.  He quickly threw another t-shirt at her and slid the twenty dollar bill back across the table in disgust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooph\u201d she said as the shirt hit her. How rude could this guy get? She had planned on just winning a second shirt to give to Tom to match her own but if the vendor was going to act like this, she might as well get a third one for that Jerri girl who\u2019d given her the twenty in the first place\u2026 \u201cAnother yard dog special please!\u201d she said sternly locking eyes with the vendor that said \"Damn straight I'm going to eat another round and there's nothing you can do to stop me!\"  This was too much for the vendor to take, she had to be cheating somehow and he wasn\u2019t goint to lose another t-shirt or batch of dogs over it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry two per customer\" He explained quickly as he began turning his back on her to attend a vacant grill behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No fair!\" Meitty shouted/whined. \"You have to take my money that's how this works! I'm still starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me go pig out somewhere else poison ivy. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to see you stuff yourself.\" He said hoping the insult would finally motivate her to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you mean other places give away free t-shirts?\u201d Meitty said completely ignoring the nasty workers words and picking out only a select few. If that was true she\u2019d never have to go clothes shopping again!  The thought of free food <i>and</i> fashion was enough to get her round rear end up and with that she left the stool<b>s</b> she was occupying (still deeply impreninted with the pressure from her big booty) and set out in search of new food challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jerri's tongue probed the slippery confines of Tom's mouth. Simple and plain as day, the two had began smacking lips when Jerri Short penetrated the lips of Tom Parker with her pink, wiggly cadaver. Once inside she saw it fit to renovate the place, redecorating the inside of Tom's mouth with a coat of her own saliva. Reaching for the downward chimney of Tom's esophagus, the freckled girl found it necessary to lean unto Tom's avian chest slowly and sensually so as to ease it in. With her head tilted and her eyes closed, Jerri placed one tiny though toned hand on Tom's pectorial and brought herself closer towards him in the form of a deep embrace. A light moan escaped her throat as she played with Tom's, the boy of her dreams (well, maybe not <i>dreams</i>) had wrapped his arm around her and pulled her close as well, falling into the motions he squeezed Jerri's ass... which was, admittedly speaking, somewhat lacking in oomph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, <b>Finally</b>, Tom Parker was hers. There was nothing more than fact to it. No hearsay, no guessing, and no insinuation; Tom Parker was all hers. After so long, they had finally taken that big step up from \"just friends\", Jerri was ecstatic! This of course showed in her technique, she was much more grabby than Tom was, and her eyebrows flexed at the crease to give her an almost \"thank heaven\" expression. Oh, she could barely stand it; Tom was so nice, funny, smart, charming (...enough), and surprisingly warm for a boy his size! Using her knees, Jerri squirmed somewhat until she had managed to get into Tom's lap, moving one hand from around his waist to behind his head; nearly forcing herself down his throat as the passion overtook her.<br>\r\ne<br>\r\nTom's own technique was not to go without commemoration, but its true potential had been suited for someone a much more generous in all axises. All the humps and curves that Tom was used to grabbing just weren't there with Jerri. No folds to grab, no rolls to squeeze, and certainly no ass! For God's sake, Tom was used to barely being able to wrap his hands around Meitnerium's hamhock thunderbuns. how was Jerri's teeny-weeny tush supposed to compete with that? What's more, Tom was also used to fighting Meitty's heavy funbags for elbow room when they kissed. He practically had to force the damn things apart to get to Meitnerium's soft, agave lips. Again, this was a critical point for Tom; who felt a little out of place dealing with Jerri's itty bitty titties. He felt clenched, too tight in this little makeout session to really be comfortable! But it was nice to be able to wrap his arms <i>around</i> this set of lips for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran through the motions, Tom found himself thinking less and less often as the Little General soon took command. His instincts took over, his grip becoming stronger and firmer as his trunks grew tighter and tighter. The two eventually arrived on the sandy ground, both of them not seeming to mind the minor collision too much as passion overtook more and more of their thought processes. One such process overlooked was the dismissal of Tom's instinctual urge to grab something edible and sensually feed it to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Meitnerium</span>. One hand fumbled with Jerri's bikini top while the other reached for the cooler sitting beside Jerri's beach towel, popping off the top and rummaging around inside until he felt something food-y. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri chuckled through their sinful liplock, amused with Tom's squirming and ignorant of the meaning behind it. She refused to let go of Tom's lips, which a single question of his motives may have been able to halt them in their tracks; thus resuming the initial course of the smooching's track. However, her greed got the better of her. So she didn't. And Tom felt around in the icebox until he wound up with a pack of hotdogs. He alternated between the rip peel and Jerri's snap clumsily, much to the dissatisfaction of his partner. \"Tom, what are you <b>doing</b>?\" she asked, frustrated.<br>\r\n\"What? It's what I do with Meitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Meitty?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is: If I can eat this whole \"sundae\", in less that thirty minutes, I get my ten dollars back <i>and</i> a free t-shirt?\" Meitnerium asked the rather perky young girl behind the counter. The bubbly blonde smiled happily, \"Yes ma'am, now that's twenty-seven-scoops of ice cream in Neapolitan order.\" she said before catching the blank look on Meitnerium's face, \"That's, um, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry, nine of each flavor, with whipped cream and a cherry on top.\" she said with a sort of paid enthusiasm, \"I'm supposed to ask if you <i>really</i> want to go through with this due to some customers who wound up in the hospital a few years back, but I can tell you're a girl who likes to eat!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what gave me away?\" she asked coyly as she pat her big ol' belly as it hung heavily over her crotch, \"So do I just sit down at a random table or is there some kind of challenge involved?\" she asked playfully as the teenager behind the counter typed in the necessary order number, \"Oh, you can eat inside or outside, ma'am, but just make sure to come back here in ten minutes with an empty bowl or we keep your ten dollars!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it!\" This chick was a lot nicer than the last guy. She might let her do this more than just twice, no way was Meitnerium walking away from here before she was ready! Looking around, she saw that there were plenty of seats open, not sure why but didn't exactly care, and decided to sit in the middle. Not in a booth. After that incident last night, Meitnerium wasn't so much of a booth-seater anymore. The globular green glutton waddled over to her chosen seat and plopped herself down heavily. There was a noticeable creaking going on underneath her; no doubt this planet's underdeveloped building techniques in seating arrangements. Honestly, with food this good, the people of Earth should have developed a chain of chairs that could support a growing girl's weight! Though, she was admittedly growing a lot faster than most, it seemed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium looked down at her belly, still somewhat swollen after her last indulging. Big, green, and flabby were all words to describe it; other than squishy. It was getting harder and harder to remember what life was like before this big sack of blubber had pooched out of her stomach, namely because a good majority of her time went to filling it up... now more than ever. This whole \"can't seem to stop eating\" thing was almost a bother to Meitnerium, or at least it would be if she didn't enjoy it so damn much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she caught herself drooling as a bowl the size of her breasts was carried out... stacked high with a hillock of ice-cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\" the perky southern accent of the cashier rang true as Meitnerium armed herself with her spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you worry, I <i>will</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty!\" Jerri screamed for the umpteenth time, \"<i>Meitty</i>?! You fucked <i>Meitty</i>?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri was pretty mad. Understandable. But there was no need for wild assumptions, or foul language. \"Hey, I never said I had sex with her, alright?!\" Tom yelled back at her for what must have been the thousandth time, \"But yeah, we kissed. A lot, actually!\" Arguing really wasn't Tom's strong suit, if you couldn't tell. This had been going on for two hours. <b>Two hours</b> of the word \"Meitty\", a lot of screaming, and beating up on Tom's scrawny chest. It was hell, the longest two hours of either of their lives. Tom probably deserved it, but Jerri sure didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry.\" Tom said, \"Its just... yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you wanted to feed me?!\" Jerri shouted over the crashing waves, \"Is that why you wanted to fucking <b>feed</b> me?! So I'd get <i>fat</i>?!\" she hollered, \"Is that why <i>she's</i> so fucking <b>huge</b>?! How long have you been screwing around with her?!\" Tom raised his hands defensively, \"Look, I didn't know what I was doing!\" he shouted back over her incomprehensible barking, \"And no, I didn't... I didn't make her gain all that weight!\" Jerri snapped back, \"Well excuse me if I have a hard time believing you, Tom!\" she shouted, \"Is that the real reason why she's shacking up with you, huh?! So you two can just fuck each other all day long?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerri, please-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can just go fuck <i>yourself</i>, I'm getting on that ferry and driving back home... she's just having the time of her life pigging out over there, she'll be so fat by the time you get a ride home you'll just have to toss her out to sea with the other whales!\" Jerri whipped around, heading towards the land. Tom instinctively ran after her. Big mistake. \"No, just stay there Loverboy!\" she shouted, unable to hold back the floodgates any longer. Thick, wet tears soon started their way down Jerri's cheeks as she fumbled towards civilization. \"I don't want to hear or see anymore of you <b>or</b> that big green blob ever again, Tom Parker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerri, please, I can explain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You've lied to me enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerri, just let me-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, okay?! Just fuck yo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's an alien!\" Tom finally spat, \"She's a fucking alien, okay?! That's what she's living here, that's why she's green, and that's why she's fat; she's never had Earth food before. My Dad and I found her in the mountains and we're just taking care of her until she can get back home! That's why I did it. I was scared, okay? Scared of being left alone. I'm sorry! I'm so <b>fucking</b> sorry!\" Tom too, felt himself well up as emotions overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean, the antennae I saw at the movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-She's... an alien?\"</span></div></div>",

Tom had been given a momentary reprieve from Jerri and he was using it to confess and explain everything he could about Meitty; her first time eating chili (which now seemed like so long ago), her oversensitive horns, the movies, the buffet, all in hope that Jerri would understand why he\u2019d been lying to her. Tom was happy to see that while she wasn't 100% ready to forgive him, she'd at least stopped crying and being angry with him to hear him out. Jerri was quite shocked after all, the last few hours being quite the emotional roller coaster for the girl and the idea that she\u2019d actually been squeezing a real pair of alien attane at the movies; well it was a lot to take in....take in...that reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alien or not that still doesn't explain what you were doing back there.\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stopped walking and looked down at Jerri in the face showing he was completely serious.  \u201cJerri I\u2019m not going to lie to you...I kissed Meitty and....well I  kind of liked it! But that was before I knew about you and how you felt, and  I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she said appreciating his apologies but hated the way he always seemed to miss the obvious. \"What were you doing with those hot dogs Mr. Foot long lover boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Tom started the probing question touching his taboo fetish center. He looked away as he began to explain \"Like I said she loves to eat and usually-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so that\u2019s what ya'll like ain't it?\" her voice sharpening with a country twang. \"Bigger girls huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no,well kind off, but that\u2019s not why the reason why I  like Meitty and it's not like things are about big or little here... \" He searched for the words to explain it but simply ended up saying the blunt truth. \"Both of you are just really fun to be with, and um, nice, and well  people that I like. Well really really like in fact. Jer you're like the smartest person I know and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri cut him off again, and for the first time in what felt like forever Tom watched as the curly headed girl actually smiled. \"I...I believe you and I\u2019m sorry I blew up like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about Meitty sooner for both reasons.\" He paused as they both had a chance to breathe a little lighter. \"So where does that leave us?\" He asked, feeling like his experience with reading girls emotions  was at an all time low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just take it as it goes\" She said preferring to think things over and not give an outright yes or no To the boy of her dreams/The first person ever to cheat on someone with an alien. But, to show that this \"first date\" could still be salvaged somewhat she broke the tension between them by adding \"That feeding stuff is still pretty weird though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tom said both a look of surprise and a smile coming to his face. \"Who was blowing her up like a balloon at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..That-That\u2019s because I thought she was foreign.\" Jerri explained. Then, her mind intrigued she asked \"So how big is she going to get?\"  Jerri thought of an huge alien monster movie sized Meitty storming into town and downing an entire dairy farms supply of milk, with Tom cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly...\" He said sighing \"I don\u2019t know, and I can\u2019t say when she\u2019s going back home either. I mean I hope she does get to go back home to her family but, until then she seems to be having the time of her life being Earthbound<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">TM</font> here huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom...about that if she's leaving then I-\u201d Jerri stopped short when she saw Meitty out on the patio of \u201cRemember The Alamode Ice-creamery\u201d finishing off what must have been one hell of a stacked sundae. Well if you\u2019d call it eating. Jerri watched Meitty help herself to spoonful after gigantic spoonful of the ice-cream, looking filled with glee and without an ounce of guilt.  \u201cWow...\u201d Was all Jerri could muster as a strange mix of emotions washed over her as she watched Meitty go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow what?\" Tom asked. \"Oh look there she is Jer come on.\u201d  He slightly picked up his pace and passed Jerri. Jerri shook her head and whatever thoughts that were building within from watching Meitty tear into the towering treat. Maybe there was <i>one </i>more thing Tom and Jerri had in common... \u201cUh, race you there.\u201d She shouted taking off after him. The two quickly pulled up some seats as Meitty was finishing. Tom's mouth was running dry and he was practically panting as he watched Meitty gulp her way through what was practically gallons of ice cream. Jerri noted Meitty had only three more scoops left of this tasty tower. Slurping and scooping Meitranium continued with nothing more than a nod to the two of them as a sign of acknowledgement. She then lifted the bowl itself to drink down the creamy caloric rich ice cream soup left at the bottom of it before licking any traces of creme from her lips and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rather nice ice cream vendor, who had also watched Meitty defeat the dessert on this rather slow morning, ran out to congratulate her. \"Your winner lady and gentlman!\" she announced to the trio. \"Mitran, Miter, Ms. Perioda! Announced the country girl as she raised her cucumber colored customer's flabby arm and hand in victory. \u201cAnd here is your ten dollars and free t-shirt\u201d she said cheerily handing Meitty the two before heading back to the kitchen empty bowl in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh this one\u2019s pink\u201d Meitty noted as she unfolded the triple X-large t-shirt open. She wondered if all the clothes she\u2019d win today would come in this same slightly stretched size...oh well they got the job done eve if thereby weren\u2019t exactly the best designed clothes in the universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitty...what do you mean this one?\u201d  Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you notice? I already won this one\u201d she said as she stretched her now high riding shirt downwards so both could read the logo on the front.  \u201cI wonthis one for you Tom.\" she said as she tossed a matching huge blue t-shirt over to Tom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I really like this pink one too,\" she noted. \"I could win you one Jerri. Don't worry I still got plenty of room, do you want me to?\u201d she asked ever so politely to the girl on her left. Tom and Jerri\u2019s moth drooped \u201cYou didn\u2019t...\u201c Tom said more giddy than angry. \u201cDid anybody watch you?\u201d Jerri asked now realizing that taking care of an alien with an appetite like Meitty's was <i>indeed</i> a pretty hard for Tom to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha\" Meitty laughed nervously. \"Why would anyone care if a normal big girl like me wanted an extra big sundae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Because</i> Meitty you\u2019re...\" Jerri caught herself and settled down into a lower voice \u201cyou\u2019re an alien.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Meitty's turn to freak out as she looked to Tom and looked like she might run. \"Relax Meitty\" He said using his hands to motion her to calm down. \"I decided to let her know. Besides Jerri's cool with the fact your an alien,she's close enough to share in the secret.\"  He put an arm around Jerri to show there were no longer any walls between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty caught her breath as she considered this. Jerri <i>was</i> practically the only other nice Earthling she knew here,other than the Parkers. Jerri just better be carefull where she put that hand on <u><i>her</i></u> Tom. Meitty had never tried human finger, (well other than sucking on Tom's seductively once or twice) but there was always time to take a bite out of one that ended up in a place where it shouldn't be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, that\u2019s great...Uh, surprise!\u201d she said as she turned to Jerri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri was still flabbergasted as she re-read all of the shirts once more and did some mental calculations. \u201cI\u2019m more shocked you ate six foot longs plus a boat load of ice cream. How did I not notice before?\" Jerri was going to say amazed rather than shocked but quickly remembered this was the girl Tom had been  \"seeing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well  want to see me win something else?\" She offered to Jerri again smiling a hungry smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Woah Meitty, I don't really think that this is the best place to showcase your eating habits.\" Tom admonished as he played rational thinker of the group, \"Besides, it'll be getting dark soon, and I don't wanna actually have to live up to Mom's 2:30 curfew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Tom's voice of reason was lost upon his pair of fraternizing females as they lost themselves amidst the excitement of Meitnerium's new wardrobe plan and dazzling eating spectacle. While ever-eager to watch his plumper princess from the stars stuff herself silly, Tom just really wasn't all that into being outed to the government by Meitnerium's crazy skin-tone. The less people knew about her, the better. But that plan was in direct violation of the \"Me First\" policy that Metinerium enforced first-handedly. The joy of feeding, and the joy of being fed; they were twin vices that had Meitnerium by the slowly disappearing neck, a stranglehold that couldn't be denied. And honestly, Tom would hate to have to see that deprived look in her big yellow eyes. The look that shortly followed a form of physical abuse and a few hours of whining. Yeah, that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something that was a little harder to resist this time. Was it her bathing suit? Maybe it was her prodigious belly poking precariously out of her oversized garment? While both certainly were contributing factors, there was something of an outside force at work here. Normally Meitty would pout and whine, but she would eventually give in to Tom's warnings and go home after a little compromise. However <i>this</i> time there was a distraction. One that stood about five foot three named Jerri. She just kept egging Meitnerium on with talk of food and how cute those novelty shirts were! Her loud, southern-fried pipes kept Tom's opinions out of Meitnerium's head now that she had support! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't listen to him, Girl!\" Jerri said as he waved dismissively at Tom's direction, \"So what if you give a few people a show; I say you sit down on that stool and eat 'til you can't eat no more!\" she said eagerly, a bright smile plastered on her thin face. One that, not so shockingly, was shared with Meitnerium. The two of them seemed to be on the same page for once, and what a page to be on together. \"I'll take a serving spoon full of ice cream to that!\" Meitty giggled excitedly as she rubbed her tummy, \"A girl's gotta eat; and boy am I a girl!\" Jerri, too got a little excited as she watched Meitnerium rub her distended tummy, \"You sure are!\" she goaded, \"Now whip that big ol' butt of yours around so you can take another shot at this ice-cream sundae!\" she cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium did her best to follow orders, but as a woman so corpulent and round, she found it a little difficult to circumnavigate her glutius around the itty-bitty seat. Especially seeing as how most of said rear was currently hanging off the poor thing. \"Ugh, Tommy?\" she reached out a hand pathetically as she played up the sympathy, \"All those meals you bought me have made me a little heavy, can you help me up so I may continue stuffing my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who was he to decline? The fear of discovery was well worth it. He cracked a smile, which eventually turned into a little chuckle as he grabbed Meitnerium's soft hands and helped hoist her up. \"Ooph!\" she grunted, \"We need someone with some upper body strength next time, that way I won't have to do all the work.\" she teased as she slapped the counter. \"I'll have another one of those sundae things, please!\" she proclaimed her order to the cashier woman, who was more than happy to oblige her best of the few customers that the shop had seen today. \"That'll be ten dollars, ma'am.\" the blonde said, happily taking the familiar ten from Meitnerium's chubby fingers. \"Wait right here with your friends, I'll bring it right out to you.\" she said with a wide smile before disappearing into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so excited!\" Jerri giggled as she eagerly await the arrival of the boatload of creamery. \"Why are <b>you</b> excited?\" Tom asked inquisitively as he eased in on Jerri through Meitnerium's thick barricade of blubber, \"I never pegged you as someone who likes all this 'weird' stuffing stuff!\" Tom teased as he watched Jerri visibly recoil in embarrassment as she remembered her comments from earlier. \"I-I'm not <b>into</b> anything, Thomas!\" she stammered, \"It's just so cool watching Meitty eat, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's really creepy.\" Tom teased her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, even Tom's not that much of a creeper.\" Meitty joined in the Earth-hazing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut up!\" Jerri couldn't help but laugh, but only Tom seemed to notice that Jerri's smile got three times as wide when she caught sight of the massively robust boat of ice cream brought out in front of her very eyes. \"Oh wow!\" she shouted as Meitnerium began eagerly licking her lips, \"Its so huge, so big!\" Meitnerium snorted, \"Sh'yeah, so's my butt.\" she said with sound confidence in her gluttonous ability, \"Now watch me eat this sucker whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tom and Jerri couldn't deny the strange thrill that they both shared whenever they caught Meitnerium on one of her not-so-scarce incidents of indulgence. The overwhelming urge to just squeeze Meitnerium's bulging flesh was Tom's biggest urge, though he could swear that Jerri's occasional touches on Meitneirum's back led to a bit of a pinch as the green girl gobbled her glut. The wiggling in his trousers was matched only by the re-dampening of Jerri's swimsuit as they both sat, eagerly getting aroused as Meitnerium stuffed herself further and further down into the hole of obesity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then their eyes met over Meitty's ducked head. Both looked away instinctively, neither could quite hide just how red their faces were getting with all this excitement. But after a second or two had passed, they looked back. Their eyes shared the same sense of shame and arousal was easily recognizable to its counterpart. This was going to be a long summer after all...</span></div></div>",

Now goaded into gorging from the two friendliest extraterrestrials she\u2019d ever known she finished off the day by completing the \"Buffet of Burgers Challenge\" at the nearby burger shack. Tom and Jerri were both grinning like crazy as she finished the baskets of various burgers, both watching intently as Meitty\u2019s stomach began to bloat, filling further and further outwards with food in a water balloon like fashion. As the waiter handed the greenish glutton her free prize (a XL t-shirt spouting that she\u2019d beaten the burger buffet battle) he gave the triumphant trio a quick snooty glare that said \u201c<i>Big deal, shouldn\u2019t you be going now</i>?\u201d  Tom seemed to be the only one who sensed this, or at least was the only one who cared, and decided it was finally time to head home. Jerri or Meitty didn\u2019t give much of a fight this time, with Meitty finally feeling full, and Jerri full of new feelings to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back to the car, Meitty leading the way and having almost no trouble walking or getting out of the booth on her ownthank-you-very-much, Tom was suddenly approached by a much happier Jerri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, today...was...\u201d the curly haired girl looked for the words but couldn\u2019t find them. How did one describe a day where you find out that you\u2019re best friend/crush is into feederism and is in a relationship with a girl who is an alien with an almost endless appetite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing?\u201d Tom said helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, amazing\u201d she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom slowed his walking, and turned to Jerri looking like something was still weighing heavily on his mind. \u201cLook...Jerri, I\u2019m sorry for lying to you, it was kind of a weird situation you know and I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there.\u201d Jerri said cutting off his apology. \u201cI can understand why you lied about Meitty, and I guess I can understand about the feeder kind of thing. But for what\u2019s it worth that was one nice massage back there, sooo...let\u2019s just call things even?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Really?!\" Tom shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Meitty is probably the first alien ever on Earth, and um I don\u2019t mind sharing you, if you uh,<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> want to share her with me...or something</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom caught what Jerri was hinting at and was beginning to feel like the luckiest guy in the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">world</span> <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">universe</font>. Jerri saw his eyebrows rise and slugged him in the arm.<u> <b>Hard.</b></u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if I ever find out you have someone else again, we\u2019re done! You here? And I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s an alien a werewolf or vampi-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrickin faith you two it\u2019s getting cold!\u201d Meitty suddenly shouted having reached the car. \u201cI probably weigh more than the both of you and I made it here before you did!\u201d Tom and Jerri noted that the sun had set and things were a bit colder, even if they were all clothed in two XL tee-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo same time tomorrow at your place?\u201d Jerri asked in the same flirtatious way one asks for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Tom said and took off racing towards the car, with Jerri chasing after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a summer it was! After that wonderful day at the beach and much like ever summer break he\u2019d known the days seemed to fly by for Tom. One thing he was sure of was that those days that seemed to blend together were filled with food <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">food</font> <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>food!</b></font> And Meitty. Now often joined by Jerri during one of her stuffing sessions with Tom, the master muncher Meitty\u2019s weight seemed to explode with fat, while the earthlings gleefully gauging the green girls gains daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s parents had only brought up the heavy subject matter but once, equally astounded at how the once wafer thin girls frame had bulked into a triple stacked burger of a body. Meitty explained how she still felt completely fine and healthy<i>-no even healthier </i>since she\u2019d gotten here and the issue was likely never to be brought up again. That was until the issue of clothes that fit forced the pressing issue. Desiring something more stylish than her ever growing collection of t-shirts (which now included a shirt that read <span class=\"cblue\">1st place at the 4th of July hotdog feast</span>) Meitty looked for other options. Fortunately there were still plenty of cans of spray on suits with Tom getting to explore and cover all of Meitranium\u2019s celestial body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Meitty couldn\u2019t be happier. Here she was being spoiled to her hearts content<i> like she deserved</i> , here she had found her new love, here surrounded by food was almost perfect. That was a big <u>almost</u> as with every week that passed rescue seemed to be less likely. She never gave up hope though as her new family here on Earth assured her that her parents were always closing in on finding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it was a wild, fun, amazingly weird summer for everyone, but no amount of weirdness could prepare everyone for what was about to happen next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed like any other weekday that August when Tom awoke, well other than a near three hundred pound alien was hogging most of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...right\u201d Tom mumbled as he began raunchily grinning. He went over the events from last night where his memories of Meitranium were a hot and sticky mess of warmth, softness and sweat, with each of them discovering the ins and outs of the others races and finding them to be quite compatible. Last night\u2019s events were no different than any of the previous ones having expertly snuck into Meitty\u2019s room and entered a new world of passion and pleasure. They both had done the deed, and neither could be more pleased about it. He dug his head deep into Meitty\u2019s long ivory curls and breathed deeply their heavenly sweet aroma. This had all actually happened, the crash, the day at the beach, Jerri\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom jerked as he remembered Jerri would be coming over this morning, and while Jerri did know about Tom and Meitty\u2019s \u201cflings\u201d, Tom had always been courteous enough to not let things become too obvious and awkward. As he went to get up he realized his arm was caught underneath Meitty\u2019s mighty bulk. Having cuddled, and fondled, and fed, and spooned the night previous, the lucky arm must have become trapped as Meitty slept. With a bit of fidgeting Tom managed to free his arm from its belly and back fat prison and began to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitty c\u2019mon Jerri\u2019s going to be here.\u201d He whispered as he leaned in and kissed her Meitrainum\u2019s rotund lips. Her eye\u2019s flittered open as she thought about the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMph...No...Way\u2026you belong back in bed <i>with me</i>\u2026\u201d she offered raising the blanket to bare her bare body. Tom bit his bottom lip for the idea was ever so tempting. His eyes traced every part of Meitty\u2019s body, every part looked so delicious. Much like a butcher with a piece of meat or a hungry customer at a buffet Tom plotted where he would start first. To start there was Meitty\u2019s face with those juicy lips and double chin which were perfect for kissing, and then of course her outrageously large breasts and belly both large and billowing yearning to be kneaded almost like pizza dough, and finally there was the lower half the two thickest thighs Tom had ever seen, and a chunk of a rump that men would do anything for to get up close and personal with. If he hadn\u2019t already been sporting morning wood, he would have grown hard on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the doorbell rang and woke Tom from his perverse plotting. \u201cSorry Jer\u2019s already here.\u201d He said turning about face and leaving the stiffy inducing sight. \u201cI think she\u2019s bringing twonkie<i>sss</i>!\u201d he teased in hopes to rouse his heavy-set house guest her head rose at the words, and she turned to look at him.  \u201cFive more minutes\u201d she mumbled before settling back into bed and under the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gave himself a once over in the mirror to make sure he looked respectable enough for Jerri before opening the door. After combing down a bit of his massive bed-head he made for the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2019a Tom!\u201d Jerri said bright and perky as ever. Tom gaped for a moment before replying stunned at what Jerri had on. While not exactly formal, the outfit she had on was definitely a step up from the hoodies and tee-shirt sporting Jerri he\u2019d know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerri you look...great\u201d he finally said before opening the door further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019ve been, you know, trying something different. I\u2019m glad you like It.\u201d she explained as entered the house. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so bad yourself. Going for the I-just-got-out-of bed look huh?\u201d she giggled before standing on her tip toes and giving Tom a quick peck on his cheek.  Tom blinked, closed the door and then noticed the spiral bound notebook Jerri was carrying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked pointing to the red book in question.  Thinking about it he\u2019d seen her with it before usually scribbling away notes in it for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Tom you know how I\u2019ve\u2019 been...<i>experimenting</i> with Meitty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom could only cough and nod, and curse him for deciding to wear shorts that were growing pretty tight once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways\u201d Jerri continued unfazed, \u201cI decided to keep a journal at home about the whole thing.\u201d She opened the book and handed it to Tom to glance over. Inside he found tables and lists and logs of foods and their calorie contents as well as Meitty weight written in black sharpie on every page. \u201cWith all this stuff on the first alien ever, when I take Biology 2 they\u2019ll have to give me straight A\u2019s for life!\u201d she said gleefully. Tom smiled and rolled his eyes \u201cJerri you know you can\u2019t-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri quickly cut him off \u201cI know, I know, it was just a fun idea. Look just help me get the snacks\u201d They both headed for her car were Jerri had purchased what had to be at least five boxes of Twinkies and 3 two liters of soda. As they re-entered they were happily greeted by the sight of a certain green alien standing stoutly in all of her near-naked glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d Jerri uttered aw-stricken. Of course she\u2019d been getting closer with her new gal pal Mietty and was given more than enough time to poke and probe and prod her jiggling flesh, but actually seeing her standing up semi-nude was another story. In her hunger, Meitty\u2019s outfit for today had obviously been done in a rush, with just a few quick sprays covering the \u201cessentials\u201d. Meitty was only a little taller than Jerri but she was by no means tall, and so the way the weight had pooled and spread on her frame quite compactly. Her large swollen breasts now happily lay on a vast trophy of a stomach, her thighs almost kissing the front \u201capron\u201d of her belly where it oozed forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jerri those for me?\u201d Meitranium asked moving toward the multitude of boxes completely comfortable in her state of undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet\u201d Jerri said swallowing the bit of saliva that had pooled in her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s weight your big butt first.\u201d Then letting her hands sink freely on those green gluets, she scooted, (or at least attempted to scoot) Meitty towards the scale, with Tom close behind their behinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJournal open, pencil in hand, Jerri now bent over and peered at what Patterson household scale now read. The first digit\u2026Three\u2026Three hundred! Meitty had now official tipped the scales. And let\u2019s see 07. \u201c<b>Three hundred and seven pounds!</b>\u201d  She said aloud unable to control her excitement. She carefully stood upwards towards and with a smile a mile wide marveled at how large Tom and her new \u201cexperiment/hobby\u201d had become. There was no other way of putting it: Meitty was seriously <b>FAT</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Meitty said still a little surprised when the two would check her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Jerri said quickly as she began scribbling down something in her journal. Meitty saw that Tom looked equally amazed at whatever Jerri had written down, but she still didn\u2019t share the excitement the two did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two weirdos done?\u201d she asked flabby arms akimbo and tapping a heavy foot sending ripples up her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026sure.\u201d Tom said. \u201cYou want me to help you get dressed?\u201d He asked but it was too late. Meitty had already made for the couch and creamy delights, and once she sat down, there was no moving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping herself heavily on the middle of the couch (and sinking the cushions on either side of her she held two entire boxes of twonkies in one arm and a two liter in the other. She promptly turned on the TV. and was shortly joined by Tom and Jerri on either side of her. Squished and slumped together on the couch the three had never felt closer. The jostling and shifting of hands and weight on the couch had bumped the clicker of from the couch and it hit straight on the floor tuning the TV to the local news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLive! From what appears to be some sort of campfire accident. A highly modified SUV looks to have been found without a single scratch on it. Witness claim to have seen some sort of fireworks shooting across the sky and land here where a small fire started and then was quickly put out by local-\u201c The TV cut to a picture of an odd looking red car. No not just odd, this car had a three spoilers the size of a large sharks fin. And the trunk was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know that ship!\u201d Meitty shouted suddenly. She coughed for a few seconds almost as if she was chocking and she turned to look at Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou mean. Tom could see it in Meitraniums wide golden eyes as they began to well with tears: this spaceship-car thing was Metalian. Meitty\u2019s signal had finally been answered. But by who? And if they were looking for Meitty than didn\u2019t that mean\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock\u2026.Knock Knock\u2026knocks...knock* An odd almost otherworldly series of knocks emanated from the front door as if whomever was standing on the opposite side was unsure on how non-automatic doors were supposed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gulped a sick feeling in his movie trope acknowledging stomach.   He went to answer it anyways. The short few steps it took to cross the room dragged on as he realized this would be it. The reuniting between Meitty and someone from her home planet, they\u2019d take her away and it looked like that would be that. What was worse whoever it was probably wouldn\u2019t have expected to see her like this ballooning up to over 300 lbs. What if they got angry? What if this was the start of intergalactic war!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t answer the door. His hands were sweating now, his ears were turning hot and he was sure he was turning red. Even if it meant he\u2019d never see Meitty again, this was the right thing he had to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 steps, 2 steps.1...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as a metalic clicking noise could be heard, his arm fell limp to his side; causing the door to hang only partly open for almost a minute before a merciful gust of wind decided to speed things up and pushed the door the rest of the way. Standing on the porch was a brown-haired woman in her early twenties who was wearing a horribly mismatched combination of a black sport's coat on top of a gold turtle neck sweatshirt, pink short-shorts, and bright yellow flipflops that were obviously too big for the wearer's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings fellow Tezan!\" The woman said with an insecure smile as soon as the door \"remembered\" to open. \"I'm apart of the new government program to insure that all households are up to date on latest anti- brainworm standards. If I could just have a nano-cylce of your time, I can get my inspection done and be out of your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Thanks,\" the misdressed woman said as she pulled out what seemed to be a PDA or some other device with a touchscreen, which instantly began beeping in rapid succesion. \"It won't take long, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the brunette began to slowly take steps towards the couch, the device sounding off ever more frequently with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg! Tom! What the hell is that racket! We're trying to watch tv here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the voice caught the attention of the \"home inspector\", she instantly dropped the high-tec device in her hands, which fell to the ground with a resounding clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-Meitnerium?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing her name, the bulbous green girl managed to awkwardly rise off the sofa and turned around in an attempt to track down it's source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, who's this?\" Meitty said as a look of concern flooded her rounded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitnerium! it is you!\" The woman suddenly dashed forward and hopped clear over the oft-burdened sofa and gave the green mass of flab posessing Meitty's voice a hug. \"I'm so glad to see you're safe! You're probably lucky that we even managed to find you at all so far out here in such an under-developed sector\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of recieving nothing but a blank stare as a response, A look of realization suddenly hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the disguise,\" the woman said as she released Meitty and made a visible movement with her forehead. Almost instantly, the fashion faux pass before them was replaced by what appeared to be an imperfect replica of what M had looked like before she had discovered earth food. This metalean in particular had a lighter shade of green for her skin, along with purple colored irises in the center of her eyes and hair that was almost blood red. But what was the biggest contrast between her and Meitty was that her antennae were positively ENORMOUS! Sticking out a good 10 inches compared to Meitty's-which only stood out about three or four inches- and then currling inwards at the tips slightly, causing them to resemble minature elephant trunks. The little bulbs at the ends of the antennae currently had tiny metal spheres encassing them, causing Tom to assume that they must have created the \"disguise\" just a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortia!\" Meitty practically screamed with delight, practically crushing the newly-arrived metalean in her oversized grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm guessing you two know eachother?\" Jerri suddenly chipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were friends in high school. While I made the 'brilliant' move of trying to get a higher education, Vortia got a paid-internship at Father's shipping company.\" The pea-shaped alien said as she released her (late)childhood friend, who instantly began taking in deep breaths to recover from the suffocating ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When-huff-Mr. Periodia said-huff-that he was looking for people to help-wheeze-find you after- huff-your distress beacon was picked up, I-gasp-volunteered to come look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my message did get through?\" Meitty said looking positvely elated. \"When I got ahold of my dad all those weeks ago, I wasn't quite sure that he managed to get my location through all of the static- where is he by the way? is he here with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well... he really wanted to find you, but something came up at work and he couldn't come here in person, but he let me drive his SUV so that you would recognise it if I managed to find you. Like I said earler, your signal came in rather weak, so it was pretty much by chance that I managed to get a lock on you're location.\" The smaller metalean said as her breathing returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom breathed a sigh of relief. Atleast some alien bigwig wasn't going to vaporize him for (mostly)accidently fattening up his daughter. For now, atleast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... anyway M,\" Vortia half-mumbled as she slid behind her engorged friend, as if to use her as cover against the other two lifeforms in the room. \"Who are you're friends? And how did you get to be this big anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

(This minor hump in the story took quite some time you see, as on Metaelement all stars in the visible sky as well as the solar systems surrounding the little planet have been charted, commercially named, and in some places colonized with cookie-cutter solar systems of their own, you can imagine why the young alien couldn't fathom any sort of entertainment in watching stars given her situation and upbringing. Tom later expressed a similar opinion, though only on the grounds that stargazing was dull as doornails.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween both the \"lanky\" and \"dwarvish\" members of the \"carbon-based thingies\", as they had come to be known to the least earthly of the two aliens in the room, Tom and Jerri took turns filling in any pieces of the grand puzzle that was their extraordinary situation. Tom, for instance, took the duty of explaining where Meitnerium had been sleeping and that she had been treated as an earthling with a \"skin condition\" (it helped when Meitnerium likened this disease to the Epidermic Pox that one got after sleeping with a Transylvanian) while Jerri, who took some offense to being referred to as the \"little one on the right\" , did her best to explain why it was that Tom and his family had been keeping her existance a secret. Vortia did not quite understand, granted she was a little biased, but took it upon herself to fill in her own blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting a lock of ruby red hair around one of her long green fingers, Vortia took a deep inhalation of the <i>barely</i> breathable air before beginning. She explained that it was, of course, <i>her</i> who had crashed the strange vehicle in the midst of that camping site (\"trust me, it was my Dad's. I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing if I wasn't looking for my bestie!\"). This fact was relayed slowly for the coherently-challenged earth-walkers who sat before her with half-slitted gazes of what must have been utter shock, as her disguise had been just so <b>perfect</b>. She went on to explain the silver orbs clipped to the tips of her antennae which, now unclipped for earthling observation, created her disguise using programmed light displacement. Once freed from their metal prison, the bulbs on her stalks were revealed to be very bulbous and quite different from Meiterium's itty-bitty dibbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you have any of those?\" Jerri asked, having grown long accustomed to her mysterious duffle-bag of alien goodies stashed in her room, \"You've got spray on clothes, but no light displacer what'chamacallits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith no, those things hurt like a bitch!\" the sensitive and swollen alien winced at the mere thought of getting her perfectly petite buds pierced, \"They've gotta drive a needle through them to get the magnets in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so its like getting your ears pierced?\" Tom asked rationally, breaking away from the conversation at hand in hopes of understanding a bit more about alien technology (truly his father's son) \"Do a lot of girls have those on your planet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only rough tricks like Erbium here!\" Meitty joked as she hefted her fat body over to her skinny green friend and draped her immense weight over the seated girl's shoulders, \"Always jealous of my awesome buds, so she's gotta make hers all flashy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that!\" Vortia whimpered, turning a darker shade of green as Meitnerium placed a big fat friendly kiss on her cheek, \"You're embarassing me in front of the Earthlings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erbium?\" Jerri parroted, \"Sounds like that kid who used to get beat up in high school, remember him Thomas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Irv? Yeah, huge nerd.\" Tom agreed, \"Nice guy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, similar situation on our planet too.\" Meitty jeered as she looked up at Tom, still attached to her friend by the shoulder, \"That's why poor little Erby-derby here goes by Vortia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why when people call you Erby Derby.\" Jerri agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off Meitty!\" Vortia squirmed underneath the addressed alien's incredibly oversized upper half to no avail. \"Faith, you're heavy! You look like a Saxxonian dipped in Guacamole!\" (yes it's from space, you really shouldn't be all that surprised. And here, its read \"Gwa-cah-mole\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm... I could really go for some guacamole right now, actually.\" Meitnerium purred as she relinquished her skinny-minny friend from her titanic girth in leiu of searching the kitchen cabinets for some of the aforementioned topping. Vortia looked onward at her friend, in horror, as she found a bottle of the stuff and wrapped her lips around the neck of the small plastic container and guzzled it down like it was... was... <i>edible</i>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty, what have these poor country bumpkins convinced you into <i>doing?!</i>\" Vortia gasped as her longtime friend halfed the bottle, \"That's for your hair, you know that!\" she grabbed the bottle from her friend and turned towards the two lesser life forms in the room (still a little entranced by seeing Meitnerium eagerly gulp down the thick green paste) \"Is this what you do to visiting explorers, huh?! You tie them up with your centiropes and brainboggle them into drinking shampoo? You're both <i>sick</i>!\" here Vortia grabbed Meitnerium's chubby hand and started tugging towards the exit portal, \"Come on Meitty, let's get you back home and squeeze all that stuff out of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not all that's inside me.\" Meitnerium giggled as if she had a secret, unmoving despite being pulled on by the much lighter girl, \"Chili and rice, meatballs and iced cream, hot dogs, hamburgers, ughh...\" she let out a small moan as her free hand began traversing the plump green apron that was her overhanging stomach, \"pixxa and france fries, soda pop and twonkies-- oh frickin' faith, Vortia you've gotta have a twonkie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Faith are you talking about?\" Vortia asked as she observed the strange behavior of her once sane friend, \"Look, we've gotta get you back to Mr. Perioda, and I really don't want to know all of what's been put inside you since you've been stranded here on this little blue rock. And since I'm going to assume that a \"twonkie\" is Earthican slang for whatever's in the monkey-man's trousers, I'm even less inclined to be interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Vortia, a Twonkie is <i>food</i>!\" Meitnerium corrected her friend excitedly, \"Faith Tom, Jerri, was I this deprived when I landed here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.\" Tom agreed with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know since <i>someone</i> decided to keep you a sexy little secret.\" Jerri purred with a chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\" Vortia parroted stupidly, \"Like... pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dummie, just food.\" Meitnerium said with a raunchy little giggle of her own<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-oo-d.\" Tom sounded out, his turn to be condescending<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this... food?\" Vortia asked, her interest piqued in this alien custom...</span></div></div>",

Meitty's pudgy hand and beaming gaze didn't waiver as she brought the expertly cradled twonkie even closer to her gal-pal. Willing to try anything once, even this very strange food concept, Vortia plucked the gross looking (it looked like a baby grub Alternian!) yellow sticky thing  from her friends hand. Three sets of eyes intently watched Vortia as she brought the snack to her red lips...she opened her mouth slowly, and then took the tiniest bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Whoa</b></font>!...What was happening in her mouth?...this...Sensation! Everyone watched as Vortias eyes widened, her first reaction to human food. Her mind was going haywire trying to process this food, it was almost like smelling something...except it was physically there...She gnashed the white sticky substance in her mouth letting her tongue bathe in the mixture, letting her tongue soak up every sugar molecule and chemical inside of this delicious object. Vortia went to speak trying to ask what was going on, but realized she had to swallow first to make room. In an instant the substance was gone leaving just a faint memory of sweetness dissolving on her tongue. Tom and Jerri watched as the stalks on Vortia's head began to rise slowly before standing tall and erect, her bulbs pulsing and throbbing in apparent delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty...What?...What was that? That was <i>amazing</i>!\" Exclaimed Vortia sounding winded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? Go on finish it.\" Meitty offered. \"We can all kinda tell how much you\u2019re enjoying it right now.\"  She said smirking and pointing to the twin antenna towers. Vortia didn't seem to care as she began to finish the twonkie without another word.  While Vortia was wrapped in pleasure, Meitty decided to explained her own grasp on humans and their food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is just one type of food. Here on Earth basically <u>each </u>of these foods tastes different. <i>That's what your tongue is doing right now by the way it's tasting</i>...Well each food tastes so completely different than any of the others.\" Said Meitty wide eyed and em(phat)ic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Shut. Up.</b> No way!\" said Vortia slurping up the last remnants of the twonkie from each of her fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! Here, have another.\" said Meitty handing Vortia another and feeling like she was already catching up on all the lost time  she'd missed. \"Vortia there's cold foods, hot foods, sauces, sweets, chocolate!\" Here Meitnerium gave herself a hug and cooed in excitement! \"You're just gonna love trying them all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom and Jerri both shared a sideways glance at this remark, their faces deviously smiling, both looking just as excited to see Vortia enjoying another twonkie as Vortia herself.  Three sets of hands were about to reach for another box of twonkies when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look!\" said Vortia suddenly pointing at Tom's TV. set. \"That's my car!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom saw that once again the oddly designed car was being featured on the news, and once again a deep sinking feeling began to enter his stomach. This time the hispanic reporter stood before a small group of people, including one sporting a pair of sunglasses and a MACK trucker\u2019s hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still live here covering what appears to be...some sort of viral advertising. Some here are calling it an Alien spacecraft, while others believe it to simply be a tricked out ride. One local Texan a self professed  Xenophobe, Roboophobe, and...Psuedophobe. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Is that even a word?</font> Anyways he drove all the way from Arlen as soon as he saw this report, and is with me now. Tell us mister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rusty. Shackleford.\" Said the scrawny cigarette of a man, \u201cAnd while I have no prior knowledge to the invading Martian people of the year 2972, I would very much like to welcome them with\u2014\u201c here the man grabbed the microphone from the newscaster, his tone changing almost immediately to one of hostility towards the invading \u201cMartians\u201d, \u201cNow you people listen and you listen good, I know you\u2019re here to harvest our atmosphere to drop your planets temperatures and breed with our women. But I\u2019m taking a stand! We fought you once in 1972 when Neil Armstrong <i>actually</i> landed on the moon, and you signed a treaty to\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's very... interesting Mr. Shackleford. But whatever the case is, we're sure the police will have some questions for the vehicles owner for sure.\" Said the reporter as he wrestled the mike back from the scrawny individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporters voice faded from Tom's attention has he slowly began to panic. He'd forgotten that Vortia's landing here on Earth had been has secretive as Meitty's. He didn't doubt it wouldn't take long for the police to show up, and then the government, and then he'd have the FBI knocking on his front door asking questions. That was another nightmare scenario he had forgotten about since Meitty had blended it so well (for the most part.) He lmost preferred to deal with whatever Meitty's race would do with him, rather than deal with the cold and caustic F.B.I. Looking to Jerri, Tom saw she shared his sense of worry and dread but surprisingly it was Meitty of all people who spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortia, we've got to pick up your car, like, now!\" she said getting up from the table as fast as her wide body would let her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hurry M? I'll just go move it later after we finish this box...\" said Vortia, getting up from the table and away from this new found love called food on the bottom of her to do list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand...The people here...Earthlings I mean, they don't really <b>know </b>about other planets. In fact, there kind of afraid of any outside life.\" said Jerri sounding on the verge of panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia stared at Jeri in disbelief. Were there really still planets unaware of ANY outside life? She turned her surprised eyes to Meitty. Meitty gave a shrug of her miniature ham like shoulders and shook her head dismissively.  \"Listen, I don't get it either but from what I can tell if we get caught it's super serious business. Faith, they <i>should </i> be giving me a medal for like, discovering their planet and all, but noooo, it's a planet full of xenophobes. At least I was found by a family that was cool with the whole \"girl from outer space thing.\" I mean wait till you see what they think some of us look and act like in their movies, it's crazy! Always wanting to take over their planet like it's sooo great and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell her later Meitty. Listen Vorita it just works out a lot better for everyone if we go get it now.\" Tom said trying to stay calm but sweat starting to form beneath his curly hair already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...\" bemoaned Vortia getting up, \"It's not even that far from here, but let's go pick it up so I don't scare all the hicks on this planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her words Vortia's car was indeed close by. It had fortunately landed in a vast nature park, hidden amongst the trees and out of the view of most of the town's population. And so after piling into Tom's car (not without a few scathing judgments from Vortia) they arrived on the outskirts of the crash site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Vortia's car...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All equipment had since been moved by man or by the vehicle, as there was a large crater than grew deeper as Vortia\u2019s car (sorry, her <i>father\u2019s</i> car) went further and further into the ground. As had been expected by the ever-pessimistic Tom Parker, there were cops everywhere. Blue suits with authoritative looks and sunglasses surrounded the vehicle, as well as some shady looking men in black suits, whose sunglasses were infinitely more terrifying and reflective. The earth man was terrified, barely able to process the simplest of thoughts that weren\u2019t related to not relieving himself right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom, what do we do?\u201d Jerri asked, now worried as she shook her friend\u2019s arm, \u201cThey\u2019ve got it!

With a mighty grunt from both the passenger and gallant (though primitive) vehicle, Meitty hoisted herself up uneasily and tottered over to her friends, \u201cCan\u2019t really see from\u2026 woah, headrush\u2026 got up too fast\u2026 Oh, hey is that the\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tom answered quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty whistled, much like Jerri had before her, \u201cSo, that means\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Jerri quipped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLovely.\u201d Meitty sighed, \u201cWe\u2019re screwed. And not in the fun way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them stood there silently for a while, looking over the hill as the strange men and police officers took shifts keeping the crowds away and attempting to find a way inside the seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d vehicle. Between them, the sense of dread was mutual and overwhelming. Sure enough, they would trace whatever signal Vortia had used to track down Meitty too. Soon the two of them would be sent off to some placid white room to be tested and cut open like pumpkins, while Tom and Jerri be taken in for questioning and charged with harboring extraterrestrial fugitives! It was only a matter of time before their lives were ruined. All of them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Faith is everyone looking at?\u201d came another voice from behind them, one insensitive to their collective plight acting as an impartial onlooker, \u201cAnd what are those apes doing to my Dad\u2019s car?!\u201d suddenly passionate, Vortia stepped up ahead of the three to get a better look at her injustice, \u201cI swear to Faith, if they put a scratch on it\u2014well, any more scratches on it\u2014I\u2019m gonna stick my boots so far up their<i> x\u2019hals</i> they\u2019ll <i>kerbitz</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom watched as Vortia fumed, stomping up and about the hilltop in her anger, when the sight of two metal balls caught his attention. Dangling from her hip, the Light Displacement Spheres were attached onto the belt-loop of her jeans! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kerbitz yet!\u201d Tom said with a renewed sense of hope, \u201cVortia, do you think you can still use those Displacer things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, <i>yeah</i>.\u201d Vortia answered, still a little huffy but more surprised that the monkey-man could pronounce such advanced language, \u201cLike, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you put on a disguise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, I get it\u2014flirt with them a little! Maybe show some cleavage, get my car back! Just like junior prom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tom corrected angrily, \u201cCan you, I don\u2019t know, <b>become</b> one of those guys down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just scan \u2018em with my phone and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, do that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom, what are you getting at?\u201d Jerri asked, a little confused by his plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVortia goes down there as a cop, gets in the car; we\u2019ll hide behind the hill when she swings by and picks us up!\u201d Tom explained vigorously, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cloaking device, right? Some kind of security system like when you\u2019re driving through a rough neighborhood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia scoffed...</span></div></div>",

I'm impressed!\u201d said Vortia unshackling the pinball like objects from under her belt. \u201cDad doesn\u2019t even know that I had a stealth generator snuck onto his ride.\u201d \u201cMy, <i>my </i>impersonating an official and stealthily sneaking a car out, I hope you Earthlings  aren\u2019t getting the impression Meitty and I are a pair of trouble makers.\u201d said Vortia giving a mischievous laugh, the sort of laugh troublemakers give right before they are about to in fact make trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I <i>know </i>Erby-Derby, I hope I haven\u2019t been rubbing off on them.\u201d Agreed Meitty draping an arm around both of her Earthling associates, both slightly buckling under the sudden weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s just \u2026you know, L<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">ight Displacement and all that</font>\u2026\u201d said Tom suddenly feeling a bit embarrassed not just from the amours antagonizing, but also for once again displaying his geek sci-fi repertoire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long fat antennae nubs re-pierced and slightly bowing under the weight of the Light Displacement Spheres, Vortia now reached into a pocket and pulled out a slim, very much Earth Smartphone looking devise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty seemed surprised by the device and hurried over to Vortia\u2019s side. \u201c<b>Faith</b>! Is that New GnusMas Universe S3 phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <b>know</b> it.\u201d said Vortia a cool smile at her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll show it off later, right now just stand back and let me work.\u201d Aiming her genius-phone\u2019s camera at the officer farther away than from the rest of the group and tasked with keeping back any onlookers, Vortia pressed the red button on the bottom of her phones screen.  A green bar overlapped the man\u2019s image, tracing over his overall outline. Suddenly a short \u201cPing\u201d was heard from the device. Vortia gave small nod glad things we\u2019re going well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom and Jerri watched as the silver orbs began to glow and a rainbow of lights began to emanate from them. The lights began to swirl, overlapping Vortia\u2019s body in a technicolor blur. Soon colors began to splotch and stick onto Vortia\u2019s frame like an incomplete jigsaw puzzle. Here a blue eye, there a patch of Caucasian white skin, and now the unmistakable threads of a police officer uniform seemed to be weaving themselves together right in front of the group. A minute or so later of this spectrum spanning spectacle and rather than Vortia, a short and stumpy looking Policeman was now standing and smiling where she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how\u2019d it work?\u201d asked Vortia in a much huskier and manlier voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the only member not to be left in a state of awe at the technological feat that had just taken place, Meitty spoke up first. \u201cPerfect. Just like an Earthling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll give them the old H.Q. routine then.\u201d said Vortia voice still disguised from underneath the hologram, \u201cWish me luck!\u201d and without a word in edgewise from Tom or Jerri she sauntered down the hill. Tom gawked as Vortia awkwardly tried to copy the officer\u2019s walk; hands placed haphazardly on her sides, elbows outwards, and a long straggling gate, Tom\u2019s brain told him just one thing: <u>They Were Fucked</u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the hill standing closest to the guarded car, Deputy Jones sighed to himself. He really didn\u2019t want to be here today, days like this were meant to be enjoyed with his family, not standing in a rodent infested woods standing around some sort of tricked out car. Sure, it beat the more violent days on the force, but at least those days required his full attention, today he was outside where the day\u2019s beauty seemed to be rubbed in his face, standing about dumbly like a bouncer at a club. Jones\u2019 sleepy mind was shook a bit as he watched Lutienent Dan oddly stumble down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Dan, y\u2019all right? I thought you were gonna fall there for a sec.\u201d asked Jones taking a step away from the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that no one else was in the man\u2019s immediate line of sight, Vortia decided that this human was in fact talking to her. \u201cOh, yeah, this hills tricky.\u201d said lieutenant Dan XXX Vortia gruffly. Having been in this situation a few times before, she knew that the less she said the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be on \u201ccrowd management duty.\u201d said Dept. Jones to his superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... Officer Prime just called in and says we\u2019re done here.\u201d  Not realizing that terms for higher ranking officials didn\u2019t translate across all life forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Asked Jones, eyebrows raised in confusion. Dan had always been mumbeler, that, his damn mustache, plus his old age, had forced all the men on his squad to have to really listen whenever the lieutenant had given instruction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeadquarters\u201d Said Vortia quickly and vaguely before too much suspicion could arise \u201cTake a look.\u201d And without a second thought she reached into a pocket and displayed her car keys. The neon green sparkling device rigidly jutted towards the sky, it hooked and bent a little near the tip exactly the way a regular car key didn\u2019t. Realizing her mistake all too late Vortia went to put the key back into her pocket when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see that.\u201d said Dept. Jones, taking the outstretched key before Vortia could pull it away. He eyed the key suspiciously, frowning and turning it over a few times in his hand. Vortia stood paralyzed. The \u201cshow the key as proof\u201d trick may have worked all the times before, but she had forgotten that here on Earth, people here had never seen a key like this! Now she\u2019d signed her own autopsy papers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn foreign cars! All that shit, just looks so stupid. I knew it wasn\u2019t a flying saucer. I mean if it looks like a car it\u2019s probably a-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Well\u2026I\u2019ll go impound this.\u201d said Vortia snatching the key back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d said Jones, a little disappointed his rant had been cut short. Glad to have something other to do then guard a car, Jones went to join the other officers keeping any onlookers at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia walked and opened the car door, quickly slid inside, quickly shutting the door behind herself. She breathed a huge sigh of relief finally feeling safe inside her familiar ride. Now it was time to get out of here! Pushing the start button with the tip of her key, Vortia heard the welcoming sound of her car booting to life. Outside of the vehicle, the car engine started with a sound unlike any onlooker had heard before, the engine sounded much quieter, then a low eerie hum like the sound of a finger rubbing the outside of a glass of water. A few officers turned around as the car started to life, some a bit frightened by its sudden start.  Vortia started the car slowly and carefully pulling the car back over the same steep hill she had sauntered down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Damn</b>!\u201d said Deputy Jones, the car may have looked god awful on the outside but it sure had one hell of an engine to make it back over the hill. \u201cAll right shows over people-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, Jerri and Meitty had been holding there breath as Vortia worked her magic. The plan looked like it had worked; Vortia had gotten control of the car. The relief was only momentary as the three realized she was not heading for the road but instead up the hill and straight for them! Getting out of the way as fast as they could they could, Vortia expertly stopped the SUV with only a minor bit of distance between the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet in!\u201d shouted Vortia still in disguise, and popping all three doors at once. The three scrambled in, hearts and other alien organs all pounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVortia Why did you-\u201c began Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax! I got this!\u201d assured Vortia. With a flick of a wrist and a button press another slow hum joined the sound of the engine as a change began to overtake the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s disappearing!\u201d said Jerri breathlessly looking about the car. Tom looked upwards at where a \u201ctrue\u201d moon roof had been seconds ago. Now there was nothing\u2026only the sky above them. In a matter of seconds the alien vehicle had disappeared all together before he\u2019d even had a good look at it, leaving the quartet looking like they were floating in midair above a leaf strewn ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026we\u2019re invisible?\u201d asked Tom reaching for where a car door had been moments ago, he could feel that it was still there, but was still unable to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we\u2019re good.\u201d said Vortia slowly stepping on the accelerator. \u201cWe can see out but they can\u2019t see in. Cool huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had to take her word for it. It may have been cool, but it still felt awful weird though. As she slowly reached the outskirts of the park were Tom had parked his own car; Tom once more held his breath. One lone cop car now loomed on the other side of the park exit, the officer inside   probably tasked with guarding the area. Tom\u2019s worrying mind looked for something for his hand to grip on, his stomach began to ache, and his eardrums began to pound, every ounce of his body on edge hoping that they'd be able to get Vortia's SUV out of here without attracting this last cop cars attention.  \u201cWhat if they had a radar gun? What about the tire tracks? What if it was FBI? Didn\u2019t they have ways of discovering cloaked planes? Did that work for cars? What if a car tries to pass into our lane?\u201d Tom\u2019s mind worked a mile a minute waiting for the answer; Would they be able to escape this last car?</span></div></div>",

I thought you said you were the first non-Earthling here.\" said Vortia deactivating her disguise and a bit of a whine in her voice. She had already pulled out onto the main road with absolutely no hesitation, and more importantly without disrupting the officer\u2019s car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I mean- <i>at least I think I am</i>. On TV here they've interview these crazy hick farmers who're always complaining that their cows are missing or that-\" ranted Meitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm talking about these other cars. Look!

He looked about the invisible car and saw Meitty beaming at him, looking as if nothing were at all wrong, and then he noticed Jerri had fainted, slumped over and apparently leaning against an unseen car door.  The rumbling now reached what had to be its peak, his eyes shook in his very head. He clenched them shut unable to concentrate on the blenderized mess the world had become.  Suddenly\u2026 *<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Bang</b></font>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling had immediately stopped, at the sound of a car backfiring. Tom ventured to open a single eye, expecting to be gazing at a universe of lonely stars out his window. Instead, the view outside was a familiar one for any Texan: Sun, trees, dirt, and road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026What happened?\u201d he asked still feeling as if he were going to puke at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood question\u2026\u201d garbled Vortia sounding none too pleased. She pushed a few buttons again and then tried the shiny red one again. Now there was no rumbling at all. <br>\r\nMeitty frowned at the lack of action. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it\u2019s the ISD. Oh, I\u2019m going to get it from my dad.\" Vortia grumbled. \"I told you to watch for the ionosphere shield disruptor honey....\" she said in a lower adult sounding tone. \u201c \u2018I guess you\u2019re not responsible enough to be driving on your own.\u2019 Then he'll probably use this as a chance to take away my card.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, now busy with bringing Jerri to, spoke up. \u201cLook let\u2019s just go back to my place\u2026Please!\u201d said Tom feeling exhausted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess you can give me a jump when we get there.\u201d griped Vortia as she pushed a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri\u2019s eyes fluttered open and she suddenly sat up with a start. She quickly glanced out the window \u201cTom! What just happened? Are we?\u201d she asked, her face still a sickly white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not...\u201d said Tom as a wave of relief washed over the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes the autopilot was re-engaged and expertly steering the still invisible car back to Tom\u2019s house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Meitty, I didn\u2019t know Earthlings could change colors!\u201d Marveled Vortia, gazing at her two pale faced backseat passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know. Cool right? Usually Tom turns red, but that\u2019s only when we\u2019re-\u201d Meitty\u2019s voice faded from Tom\u2019s consciousness as he closed his eyes, his brain deciding to take just a short nap\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom\u2026 we\u2019re here.\u201d Whispered Jerri\u2019s voice in what felt to Tom a few seconds later. Tom opened his eyes and suddenly gave Jerri a short peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Asked Jerri blushing and rubbing her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026for all that we just went through?\u201d Tom said unsure himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's sweet you two.\" said Vorita seat again already reversed to face them. \"But does someone want to tell my where you keep the dilithium crystal jumper cables before this turns into a smooch fest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, they don't exactly have those here...\" said Meitty.\"Earth hasn't gotten the whole \"Faster Than Light\" thing down yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding!\" shouted the red head putting her hands to her head in disgust. \"How the Kerbitz do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd actually just like to talk to my parents if we could. Let them know you found  me at least\" said Meitty a hint of exhaustion creeping into her voice now too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" shouted Vortia,  \"Oh of course Meitty. I totally forgot babe, give me a sec. The cars got enough juice to last a while, but we won't be getting it off the planet till I can get a jump.  We still have plenty of power send a signal. Tom watched from the backseat as Vortia pressed one of the hundreds of buttons on the dashboard, this one labeled *Near-a-star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Near-a-star, how may we help you?\" Asked an omnipresent voice coming from the car's stereo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connect me to Perioda family please, Metalement Galaxy.\" Commanded Vortia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away\" came a robotic voice, which unlike call center personnel was actually a robot that was actually dead inside not a human that just felt like he was dead inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh this must be like Onstar!\" said Tom noting another of the numerous similarities between his and Meitty's cultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onstar?\" asked Vortia \"Who could possible operate On a star? ...Backwards Bumpkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...Vorita?\" Came the deep voice of what Tom assumed to be Mr.Perodia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who I fooooound?\" Vorita practically sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dad?\" came Meitty's voice as soft as a whisper and then a shout \"Dad! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith! Meitty it's you!\" said the voice on the other side now breaking a bit in a state of emotion. \"Faith above! Let me get your mother....\" there was a momentary pause and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty?\" came another voice over the speakers this one sounding a lot like Meitranium's own, except a little more older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" shouted Meitty her eyes welling up with whatever was the alien equivalent of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Meitty!  Don't worry we're coming!\" shouted the voice excitedly and equally cracking with emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortia we have a lock on your location! Don't go anywhere!\" Came the gruff voice again. \"Don't worry sweetie, daddies coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! See you guys after the hyperspace jump.\" Vortia flipped a knob and a bleep was heard on the other side of the stereo. \"Well...\" sighed Vortia feeling as if her work was done for the day. \"Now all we have to do is wait...You gonna be okay Meitty?\" she said noticing the green girls...green tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Meitty said after a moment and a sniff, \"I just....really miss them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Don't worry...\" Came Jerri's consoling voice placing a comforting hand on the tear shedders shoulder.  \"They're on their way right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she agreed wiping away a tear with a chubby finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we here until they get here.\" said Tom joining Jerri's hand.  \"Uhh- How long do you think it will it be till they get here?\" Tom asked turning to Vortia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few seconds.\" she answered plainly, more interested in the well being of her friend and getting out of the car. Tom and Jerri both looked confused, and it was Meitty who once again spoke up to explain the differences across cultures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortia, no FTL travel yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia smacked her head with a green open palm hand. \"Bumpkins! Okay, you two, you understand how time is relative and all that, you understand that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay...\" answered both Tom and Jerri slowly sharing a basic grasp on the technical idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a few seconds for Meitty's family going at Warp speed would be...um...What <i>does </i> that equal in Earth time Meitty?\" asked Vortia <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty did some number crunching (her least favorite type of crunching) as she was the only one familiar with both space time and Earth units of time before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dad insists on driving that \"vintage ride\" of his, more like \"junker\" model if you ask me...Anyways, it only has Warp 1 drive rather than all the new models with Warp 2 and even 3, not a big difference if your going from one side of one galaxy to the other, but across the universe...That's a bit farther distance to cover...So that means it would take about..\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she was no science major back in Steez (it was an Arts college, after all) any mathematical abilities she had retained that would have allowed her to crunch the vast amount of numbers required to jump from one corner of the universe to the next had surely gone rusty after her extended period of time on a primitive planet such as Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point she was more asking herself than answering Vortia, whose dainty emerald-cut chin fell in shock with a furrowing of her heavy burgundy eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I could be wrong!\" Meitty was quick to smile, her chubby cheeks dimpling as she giggled nervously, \"We all know how good I am at math, right Erby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you Erby me!\" Vortia shot back distastefully as her head sunk into the steering wheel, \"Three Earth months?! That's freakin' insane\u2014<b>please</b> tell me that Earth is one of those planets that have, like, thirty day years?\u201d Vortia begged of the two native earthlings in the back seat, \u201cFaith, I\u2019m gonna miss so much!

This is total <i>kerbitz</i>! Lemme get out my phone and add this shit up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the newly marooned member of the Metalean species reached into the front pocket of her jeans Tom, Jerri, and Meitnerium were all left to themselves, as Vortia was hardly in the mood for any discussion whilst trying to convert the difference in planetary timespace. The two earthlings simply exchanged placid glances to one another, finding this the least enjoyable (and understandable) part of their epic excursion with Meitnerium, who could barely contain herself from wearing a grin almost as big as her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hear that guys?\u201d she asked excitedly to the tension-sickened humans in the back seat, \u201cI\u2019m going home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s great Meitty\u2026\u201d Jerri groaned, clutching at her aching head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuper tops\u2026\u201d Tom concurred as his breathing hastened, \u201cCan we just go inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on guys,\u201d Meitnerium said with a smile as she whipped the seat around again to face her friends (rather than exert herself by attempting to twist her noncontortable bulk in the seat) \u201cI\u2019m going home, for real! This has got to be one of the happiest moments of my life and you two look about as green as I do\u2014is there something you\u2019re both not telling me?\u201d her face fell to a frown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, really.\u201d Jerri started in as best sympathy as she could manage, \u201cWe\u2019re totally excited for you to be headin\u2019 home\u2014 it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarthlings aren\u2019t built to handle the stress of getting chased by the cops and almost getting taken to another galaxy far far away.\u201d Tom said with a heavy breath of fresh air, \u201cI\u2014er\u2014we love you and all, Meitty, but it\u2019s just been a\u2026 <i>stressful</i> day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Very.</i>\u201d said Jerri<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I forget you guys still don\u2019t know that much about my planet and all our cool tech.\u201d Meitnerium said with perceived modesty, \u201cWarp speed\u2019d probably flip you two of your <i>gobbers</i>! I\u2019m sorry Tommy-Tom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her apology, Meitnerium unbuckled her bulk from the seat; the black belt sliding across her fleshy green expanse quickly to allow her release from its confines. Her bottom half was bursting from every angle possible, namely from underneath the armrests, her gray sweats making Meitnerium\u2019s prized bubble butt look like the blandest (but largest) balloon ever conceived. She outstretched her thick flabby arms, her wobbling green bingo wings shimmying as they adjusted to their new altitude<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor real guys, I mean it. Thank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d She said kindly with wide eyes as she motioned for a group hug. The two obliged her, unbuckling their own seat belts and stumbling over to Meitnerium\u2019s seat to wrap the big wad of guacamole in an even bigger hug, \u201cI love you so much.\u201d She said quietly (with a pinch of Tom\u2019s tuckus.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFLIPPIN FAITH!\u201d Vortia howled as her math yielded the same results as Meitnerium\u2019s wildest of guesses, \u201cThree months on this Faith-forsaken ball of saltwater! I\u2019m gonna <i>die</i>!\u201d she moaned as, once again, she fell into the steering wheel of her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad\u2026 once you get used to it.\u201d Meitnerium said with a smile, releasing her two friends from their embrace, \u201cBesides, you\u2019ll find out that life here isn\u2019t so different than back home\u2026 it\u2019s really weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, except the cars don\u2019t fly, we can\u2019t break the atmosphere, and oh yeah, <b>everyone\u2019s pink</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a pale Caucasian myself.\u201d Jerri corrected gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhite as a sheet.\u201d Tom added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d Vortia said sadly, \u201cOhhhh\u2026 I\u2019m gonna <i>die</i> before your pops even gets here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium swiveled the chair back around to pat her friend on the shoulder, \u201cThere there, it\u2019s gonna be fine.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the quartet exited the car, (now parked around the backside of Tom's house less a car accidentally crash into the re-cloaked vehicle) the two earthlings were still feeling rather green around the gills, while the other two, (who were actually green,) were now feeling rather perky about this new situation. Tom watched sluggishly, as Vorita reached into the car and pulled out a glowing white object from underneath the drivers seat, she slung the strapped object over her shoulder (very much like an earthling would a purse) and then without pushing a button somehow shut all of the doors on the vehicle. With Vortia's SUV secluded from the rest of the world, the four then headed into the house, Meitty still gushing away about the many various earthly delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't <b>wait </b> for you to try foods Vortia. Yep, I can still remember one of the first I had. It was Louise's chili. It's still pretty high up there on my list of favorite's too! Tom, let's ask your mom if she can make some tonight.\" Meitty turned to face the curly haired boy just as he was entering the house (which was only after he had held the door open for the three girls to enter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" said Tom flatly putting it on the bottom of his to-do list tonight. He still had to introduce Vortia to... Tom froze in place, remembering something...\"Wait, Oh no.\" He went to the kitchen and checked the calendar where sure enough a red line had been drawn through a number of the ubiquitous white boxes. Tom's mom and dad had just left on their yearly summer vacation, a trip to a small cabin timeshare. usually Tom would have accompanied them on this yearly trip but considering Meitty was still here it was decided that Tom was responsible enough to house sit while also keeping Meitty <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">out of trouble </span> company. That was why he'd been able to \"join\" Meitty for the night, without having to worry about sneaking out before the morning. They'd sure be surprised at what was waiting for them when they got back. He didn't think his mom would mind...too much, she understood the whole stuck alien thing, but she'd be worried more than anyone else. And dad...Dad would buy her a box of twonkies everyday <u>for life </u> if he could get beings the wheel of the inviso car just once. Tom smiled at that thought. Then there was another flash of pain in his temples as Tom rushed to his cellphone. He knew that if his parents had watched the news they would probably be freaking out right now...Scrolling through his texts, he saw only one had been sent by them no more than 15 minutes ago. Opening it read rather differently than he'd expected;  \"<b>hey Tom mam &amp; I r having fun time here hope your \"having fun\" 2. Love-Dad</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom thought that seemed like a normal text from dad, news of the car must not have been a big deal after the cops had pulled it away...He breathed a sigh of relief things seemed to be settling down a bit, bar a FBI agent showing up at his door, Tom felt like he could finally <i>finally </i> relax. Sure he still had to pick up his car tomorrow, but that wasn't a big deal, park goers did that all the time when they were camping....Yes this new green knot of a problem had been neatly tied into a bow and safety tucked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay..\" was all he said as slipped into the living rooms leather recliner. Meitty and Vortia followed suit, sharing the couch in front of the t.v. As he eased into the chair he could already feel himself on the edge of falling asleep once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I could stay and help, you know....If you want to take a nap or whatever...\" said Jerri still standing looking both tired and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm okay Jer, just tired.\" he propped his head against his hand, his eyes turning to where Meitty and Vortia had plopped on the couch looking like two globs of Giacometti on a chip. If he <i>did </i>fall asleep who knew what sort of accidental mischief the two could cause while unsupervised. He looked back to Jerri. \"You think, you could...spend the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure let me make a phone call.\" Jerri took out her cell and after a few button pushes...\"Hey I'm at Tom's, we're goin' to a midnight showin'. I'll Be back by morning got  a key so you can go ahead and lock up. Call me when ya get this. Okay love ya!\" She clicked her phone shut. \"All set. I left a message, good thing they sleep in on Saturday morning.\" She gave a wink towards Tom, and then turned her head to the two seated aliens \"Now....I'm cooking supper tonight. What're you up for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty looked to Vortia then to Tom looking ready to read off a shopping list of possible dishes when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Tom's back groaned and the leather lay-z boy shifted as he reached into his back pocket, producing his wallet, which itself produced a neat set of twenty's. \"Why don't we just order out? Dad gave me some money in case we wanted delivery, he didn't say it couldn't be all on the same night... We could get Pizza or Chinese...or both\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious..\" said Jerri racing an eyebrow as she noticed the crooked smile worming its way across Tom's otherwise weary looking face. \"You're really up for something like...<i>THAT</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I am! We can Give Vortia an awesome welcome to Earth party, with a little bit of everything. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does!\" Meitty said emphatically the weighty task of picking her friends first meal lifted of her globular shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia just shrugged \"I'm not sure how anything else could top this the taste if townkies. What whit that creamy stuff inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can think of a few...\" said Meitty began voice dripping with innuendo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Tom said suddenly reached for Jerri's cellphone. \"Yeah, show time pizza? Could I get your special? Yes a large \"It came from the Deep dish\" extra cheese extra pepperoni. And your M <b> E.T.</b> lovers. Yes I know free Reece pieces bag.\"  Tom then made a call to a local buffet China King, all the while knowing by the end of things he would be spent both financially and physically but it would so be worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom finished placing orders Vortia and Meitty picked up on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vortia, I'm...sorry. I should have warned dad about the warp distance, everyone was just...emotional.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia placed an arm on her old/now new again roomie. \"Hey...it's going to be okay, I understand. There's really no point on calling someone else when your parents are all ready on the way.\" Vorita pulled out the silver object she had retrieved from her car...\"Plus everyone is gonna be SO jealous when I start posting pics from a whole new planet? I'll be coolest girl in the galaxy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean second coolest.\" said Meitty giving Vortia a hearty heavy shove. Meitty eyes suddenly widened as she realized what Vortia was holding. \"Oh Vortia! Awsome!\" Her greedy hands outstretched for the white object (which Tom had decided was indeed a purse) Meitty reached for the bag but Vorita pulled it away at the last moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia dug trough her purse, and pulled out a long cylindrical object...Tom gasped, maybe he was wrong! This looked more like the barrel of a space gun! Vortia pressed a button on the bottom and suddenly a large Cherry red lump of lip stick ejected with a click. Vortia clicked it again, the red lump retracted and returned this time in the shade of purple, another click, and it turned green! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly brought more than what I got left with!\" marveled Meitty. \"Let's say we see how much I remember from Cosmetology classes? We could give Jerri a Metalean makeover!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two aliens began giggling as the turned towards Jerri. She smiled weakly before saying \"Sure maybe later... Hey Meitty since I'm going to be spending the night, mind if I borrow some clothes? These ones are a little sweaty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Meitty excitedly babbling a mile a minute. \"I've got a closet full of free t-shirts and an old pair of sweat pants that <i>might </i> just fit you, in my room.\" As Jerri disappeared into the house, Tom heard an all too familiar sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was defintely Meitty's as the billowing shirt looked big enough to hold three Jerri's inside of it. Jerri's bottom half was having a similar problem, sure the drawstring on the sweat pants she was wearing helped keep the pants on, but without a belly or a badonkadonk to fill them out, the pants still looked gigantic on Jerri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom brought the box in front of the two aliens, everyone in the room anxious to see Vortia's reaction to some REAL food. Tom opened the lid, a mist of steam evaporated from out of the box, a wonderful warm smell wafting up and filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hot!\" said Vortia picking up the oddly triangle shaped object. It certainly smelled exotic though! Unlike townkies which smelled...well like one plain sweet note, this...this was a complex orchestra! She raised the floppy triangle to her lips and then took her first delicious delicious bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect. Warm and bubbley, peppery, salty, cheesy,spicy, all were words Vortia wish she knew as without them she was unable to describe these tastes. She took another bite, a nice solid crunch. This-this food was like a whole new sensation! How could she...how could <u>any </u> Metalean live without having experienced this unreal feeling! \"Mmmmpph!\" Vortia moaned munched to the rooms delight. \"And you said there's even more?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you could ever imagine!\" said Meitty opening her chubby arms as wide as she could. Then having done enough waiting, helped herself to a slice as well no longer able to hold her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's sooo many different food and ways to make it!\" said Meitty munching along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I don't know what to say...\" said Vortia eyes wide and obviously awestricken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't.\" said Meitty \"Eat it while it's hot and enjoy it. Just make sure to say something nice afterwords like 'thank you.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...Fantastic...\" Vortia moaned again, chewing down all the way to the warm pizza's thick crust. Her antenna grew erect once more pulsing to an inaudible beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wow </b> Meitty heard Vortia say aloud...only Vortia's mouth was full of food. How? Antenna Talk! How could she have forgotten? Meitty hadn't been around a Metalean in <i>forever </i> that's how. Long ago the Metalean race had developed their characteristic antennae, it had provided their race with a way to communicate silently without attracting predators. Said antennae were now hardly used for conversations in the modern day. Being able to send thoughts was always exciting at first, but as a Metalean grew older usually just stopped finding speech much more enjoyable than transmitting thoughts, and so said transmissions were usually shutdown and left unused or \"untuned\" all together. Which isn't to say that antennae were useless, no, much of Metalean technology allowed for this wireless signal to operate and control objects. For example, unlike TV sets on Earth, a Metalean never encountered the annoying issue of a lost remote for the t.v., it was literally as easy as thinking of changing the channel. In short the modern view on Antennae talk was that it was good for a quiet conversation across a crowded room, but not too far as the signal was pretty weak, it was very god for tech, or for chores around the house. (The size,shape,and overall attractiveness of a Metalean's stalks was another rather complicated story best staved for a later chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the summer the trio had done some experimenting with the ability after Meitty had mentioned it. They had found that a signal did nothing for modern t.v.'s and could only blur the picture on an old 'bunny eared' TV set. Tom later  found that he could  pick up on some of Meitty thoughts on the highest setting of an AM radio but only if she really concentrated her thoughts; These included messages in Meitty's voice saying things like unsurprisingly \" I'm hungry.\" or \" The coast is clear now get in bed you sexy beast\" (But those transmissions are again better saved for another chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Jerri was also quite famished. She helped herself to a slice of the deep dish, using a napkin to cover any extra cheese under chin. She softly and slowly placed herself onto Tom's lap where he was enjoying some sweet and sour pork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oohf!</b> Might I say Jerri that your butt feels considerably less bony than I remember it?\" said Tom in a stuffy British accent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuf fup\" she growled through a mouthful of pizza. Then after she had chewed and swallowed, and in a British accent of her own \"Your felling quite <i>BONEY </i> yourself, for someone near exhaustion\" Tom gave a short barking laugh, one that cracked from nervousness causing Jerri to smile approvingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both eased into the leather lounger, warm food filling their insides, tiredness showing on each of their faces. The  had almost been launched into space for three months earth time...-about three-wait that wasn't right either- Vortia had said her car had a warp two drive and from the way she was describing it the difference was like driving a big rig vs. a Porsche. It was a harrowing thought either way how close they'd almost been launched into space. Two or three weeks off of Earth without anyone knowing what happened to you...Tom could only imagine how Meitty must feel. Soon enough though her dad would be here and Tom had three long months to prepare for that long put off reunion. At least her dad would hopefully be wise enough to know to arrive at the planet with caution and avoid any other crash landings/parking jobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia paused on her third slice of pizza, no more than fifteen or twenty of these earthling minutes into the feast when she noticed something odd about the two earthlings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were...</span></div></div>",

This one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like the crust?\u201d Meitnerium guffawed, \u201cI realize that we\u2019re \u201caliens\u201d and all but\u2026 come on! That\u2019s like, the <i>best</i> part!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia crinkled her green nose (which was a bit longer and pointier than Meitnerium\u2019s) at the piece of plain stick of baked dough in disgust, \u201cI tried it, don\u2019t really like it. It\u2019s all bland and junk. Not when there\u2019s <i>all this</i>\u2014\u201c she said with a greedy snatch of Meitnerium\u2019s remaining fraction of pizza, \u201c\u2014to enjoy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVortia, you little<i>rothghar</i>!\u201d Meitnerium said with a friendly jab at Vortia\u2019s arm, \u201cThat was the last piece!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m a <i>guest</i>!\u201d  Vortia said with a greedy smile as she bit into her steal, \u201cBesides, you\u2019ve still gotta do the thing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium sighed, though it was not one of genuine weariness. She was earnestly glad to have Vortia around, knowing that she would be spending her last three months on Earth with a friend was an enormous comfort to the expanding extraterrestrial. Her little puff of air was one of pure precociousness as she prepared to give into the unrelenting demands of the ever-mysterious \u201cthing\u201d that Vortia wanted her to do. For a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what you want,\u201d Meitnerium said as she repositioned her bulk away from the television set and towards Vortia, \u201cbut <i>I</i> like the crust. You\u2019ve been saving yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last three, yeah.\u201d Vortia said dismissively as she leaned over to grab the Styrofoam plate (\u201cHa, we use this stuff for wiffle ball bats!\u201d Vortia earlier surmised, \u201cWho knew you could make tiny trays out of it?!\u201d) \u201cWhy, you want \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGimme your crusts and I\u2019ll do the thing.\u201d Meitnerium said with a sly grin dimpling her plump aguave cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Vortia said as she handed over the plate to Meitnerium, \u201cNow\u2026 do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium took a deep breath, causing her mighty chest to billow out even further before she released it. A long time had passed since she had even <i>attempted</i> to use most of her muscles, let alone these ones. In fact, the last time she could place was at Gallium Brown\u2019s Barium-Faithsvah, where her unique \u201ctalent\u201d garnered lots of attention from horny high school boys as well as their lecherous uncles and female relatives with butch haircuts. Back then they were pretty big, but it wasn\u2019t much of a challenge to move them then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium clenched her flabby arm to her chest as she flexed one of her long neglected pectoral muscles, causing one of her massive mammary to jerk upwards with a sudden heaving jiggle. She attempted to do it with the other arm, getting more or less the same reaction- much to Vortia\u2019s delight. The newer alien clapped her hands and fell backwards in laughter as the more local alien continued to bounce her fat breasts up and down in rhythm until she tired (which was quite soon.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s so freakin\u2019 <i>gross</i>!\u201d Vortia laughed, nearly falling from her seat on the couch as she kicked her voluptuous legs, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do that but\u2026 just ew! Why do boys like that so much?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitnerium stuck out her tongue, which was still very slender, and bit into half of one of Vortia\u2019s discarded crusts, \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because all you can do is that thing with your\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in front of the Earthlings, you skank!\u201d Vortia shushed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re asleep!\u201d Meitty rolled her eyes playfully, \u201cBesides, if anyone knows about Metalean biology it\u2019s Tom.\u201d She said dismissively before stuffing the remaining crust into her mouth, \u201cBut I\u2019ll bet if I showed him what you do, he\u2019d be afraid to go near my\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShsshsshh!\u201d Vortia covered Meitnerium\u2019s plump lips with one perfectly manicured hand, \u201cYour naughty words will wake the monkey people!\u201d she said quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not monkeys, Vortia, they\u2019re human beings.\u201d Meitty chided defensively, \u201cWhich are\u2026 kinda, almost like monkeys. But still. They\u2019ve been really good to me and\u2014hold on\u2026\u201d she brought a thick hand to rest on her gelatinous busom and let out an unladylike belch, \u201c\u2014\u2018scuse me\u2026 anyway, play nice. You\u2019ve still got three months here. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to get out of your bubble. Their culture is really cool\u2026 remarkably similar to ours actually.\u201d With a raunchy smirk, Meitty quickly changed her tone, \u201cHeh, in fact, that\u2019s not the <i>only</i> thing that\u2019s similar to\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww!!\u201d Vortia cried out as she shielded her ears with her hands, \u201cDon\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d Meitty stated before another quiet burp. She brought one of her hands back to her stomach and began churning the mush inside of it delicately, kneeding on it with pudgy green fingers like an overfed feline of the Amenhotep Quadron. As she stroked and pampered the jiggly green gut, she found herself wishing that Tom was indeed awake, so that he may be able to do this for her. After that little show she put on back there, her arms were really tired\u2026</span></div></div>",

Like the Saxxonian women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. You can totally \u201cget fat\u201d.\u201d The large jiggly pea consented, \u201cI\u2019m living proof of good ol\u2019 fashion overindulgence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird.\u201d Vortia said as she examined her own stomach. It was not soft and pliable, nor multiply tiered like Meitnerium\u2019s. Instead it was hard and rounded slightly, a warm  bulge where her once slender waistline once rested, \u201cSo, like\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no way, that\u2019s not fat.\u201d Meitnerium said with a point towards Vortia\u2019s middle, \u201cThat\u2019s just where all the food goes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I wondered\u2026\u201d Vortia said as she brushed her long red locks behind her shoulder, \u201cAlright, I think I get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, \u2018cause sometimes even <i>I</i> have questions.\u201d Meitnerium said with a roll of her eyes, \u201cEarth food is so complicated\u2014and the people are so ungrateful. Why would anyone want to count calories \u2013I don\u2019t know much about \u2018em, but the more of them there are, generally the tastier the food\u2014when they could just enjoy themselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre the other people as fat as you on Earth?\u201d Vortia inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTons. I was watching this show called \u201cMaury\u201d and they had people even fatter than I am one time.\u201d Meitnerium said to a wide-eyed Vortia, \u201cI mean, to <i>think</i> of all the food they had to eat to get to that size just makes me want to\u2026 \u201c here Meitnerium shivered a bit, her head leaning back a bit as a small moan escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, like, is it bad for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat.\u201d Vortia continued, \u201cIs it, like, attached to your body and sucking out your life force or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve <i>heard</i> from all those diet commercials and stuff (\u201cHa, imagine <i>limiting</i> yourself to only eating fruits and vegetables!

But I hardly leave the house anyway, Tom\u2019s real paranoid. And he and Jerri make sure that I hardly have to get up, so no I haven\u2019t really noticed any downside.

Her tiny bump of a stomach gurgled in a mix of disgust and contentment at being filled to such a capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All...urp.done?\" asked Meitty noting the woozy look on he friends face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I I don't think I could get up!\" moaned Vortia still analyzing and agonizing over her sensitively stretched stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that'll happen.\" smirked Meitty getting up ever slowly. Then as gently as she could the obese olive colored ovaloid reached for the rooms light switches. \"Fortunately for you, you're friends with the smartest alien on earth! Someone who know her way around these confusing ape's and their tech\" gloated Meitty. Vortia heard a squeak followed by more spring like noises anfrom the seat next to her as began to slide back. Suddenly Vortia's own seat was sliding back! They were falling backwards! Only they didn't fall... the couch had somehow caught them, and had even raised outwards to support the girls legs. It was a recliner! The two practically horizontal now, were in perfect placement to fall asleep right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...oh<i>hmmmm</i>. That's nice.\" noted Vortia relaxed into her new position. \"Clever girlllll\" she mumbled before passing into a warm food cocoon of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri was the first one up the next morning. Her phone had buzzed her awake, reminding her of the appointment she'd made with her parents. Her rustling and stirring had roused Tom from a rather restful sleep, but he too got up from the shared lazy-boy/bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going Jer?\"he asjed rubbing a bit of either pizza or eye crust from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm...just got to go say hi to mom and dad for a bit. Can't let them think I'm spending <i>every</i>night over here.\" said Jerri already grabbing her coat, and hoping her parents wouldn't notice the XXX-tra large shirt she was wearing wasn't actually hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we wouldn't want that...\" said Tom slowly easing out of the chair. \"Umm...are you going to be back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try maybe stopping by this afternoon.\" she said with a brisk peck on his cheek (having to stand on her toes just a bit to do so without shoes on.)  \"Are <i>you</i> going to be okay? is the real question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who me? Home alone with two lonely space vixens? What ever shall I do?\" said Tom, ever the joker and holding his hands up as if to ask for help. The two turned their heads to the other two, still resting on the couch their bellies up and exposed out like a pair of sunbathing walruses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" said Jerri flatly turning her eyes back to Tom. \"But you know that's not what I meant.  Just look out for any strangers okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I'll call you when the Men In Black show up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom!\" said Jerri getting a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Look I lock the front door and keep it locked till you show up. I don't think either of them will be in much of a hurry to go outside anyways.... I mean, think about it. If the FBI had found us, they would have come after us as soon as possible right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Okay...said Jerri turning and reaching for her jingling car keys. Suddenly a small ruckus arose from beside them. \"Hmm-What...\" said Vorita slowly waking up. She looked shocked for few seconds quickly scanning about this foreign room. \"Oh...right...\" mumbled the redhead recalling her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Hey. said Tom for lack of any better words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" said Vortia remembering this life-form and the shorter one beside him. \"You two leaving?\" she asked, as she tried to get up and out of the recliner, (a strangely difficult task she frustratingly found.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just me. I'm going out for a bit to see my parents. They might have me do some grocery shopping, and then I'll be back. Don't give Tom any troubl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping!\" said the Alien antenna and attitude perking upright at the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some groceries. N-nothing special!\" said Jerri already knowing where this conversation was heading and trying to stop it before it got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are gross-eries? That doesn't sound to fun... But if it's shopping...Can I come? Please! Please! Please!\" said the green girl now out of the chair and brushing herself off.  An earnest pleading look already crossing her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri looked to Tom for assistance, but he simply shrugged.  \"She's going to be here for three months. We can't exactly keep her locked inside forever...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri could feel her argument swaying a bit, but still held her ground. \"But it's so soon! and You don't even have a disguise! The officers getup would look out of place shopping at the store with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's no problem. Look!\" and in an instant Vortia had reached for her bag of holding. Reaching for her phone she aimed it at Jerri who, having just awoke, was a little slow to react at what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait!\" said Tom and Jerri unanimously as the photo was snapped. Too Late! Soon a kaleidoscope of colors again began to whirl about the alien. A splotch of colors began to stick here and there, and soon the process was over. There now standing in his room were two identical looking Jerri's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops just a second.\" said the cloaked Vortia. She fiddled with her phone a bit more and... Slowly the Jerri on the left grew! Inching upward bit by bit till the projected Jerri now was at the same height as Vortia \"was.\" More button presses and a pair of mounds were soon straining the front of  the Jerri #2's shirt.  \"There!\" she said in job-well-done tone. \"Why hello, younger  twin Earthling sister Jerri!\"  said the taller clone, now looking down at her original version. Tom looked from one to the other they were almost imperceptible in any differences, well except for the pissed off look on the one's face. \"I know what your thinking, and I'm flattered but it's a <b>hell no</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" asked Tom blushing, but not <i>exactly </i> shocked that Jerri had been able to read his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>too </i> freaky.\" Said Jerri looking up and down at the light manipulated version of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me I can go with you <b>please</b>! I want to see what Earth is like!\" said the taller version of Jerri two, making the puppeteer version of Jerri bend into an uncharacteristically pleading stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Fine.\" said Jerri mentally figuring if Vortia was going to leave the house one way or another, it might as well be under her supervision. \"But it's going to be under my rules and you're going to do <u>exactly </u>as I say so you're not...exposed. <i>Understand</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I promise!\" shouted Jerri#2, mischievous grin crossing her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" said Jerri taking a anxious glance at her watch, knowing she didn't have long till her parents awoke. \"Look we'll talk about it in the car. But first sign of trouble I'm driving you right back here. Understand?\" Jerri explained as she hurriedly made her way to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, younger sister earthling Jerri.\" said Vortia following behind her, obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing about a fake name we can't both be called Jerri so-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was unable to hear the rest of the conversation as the two were already walking out the front door and had closed it behind them. Fortunately, there appeared to be no FBI agents waiting for them directly outside of the house, and soon the two were in the car chatting away. Tom would be lying to himself if he didn't admit he was <i>a bit</i> nervous with the two going out together alone. But the two were smart, and there was no point in being on Earth if you didn't get to go out and see the dang planet! Life was for the living!  And besides it was just grocery shopping...What could possibly go wrong? Tom gulped and made sure his own phone was charged, just in case he'd be getting a call soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty, hearing Jerri's car starting, was now was aroused awake. Sitting upright and giving a full lion like yawn and stretch, she smacked her lips a bit as she looked about the room. \"What'd I miss?\" she asked looking a bit perplexed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Jerri and Vortia's trip start out? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>These Earth bumpkins were strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely in their obsession with \u201cgrossrees\u201d, to which purpose Vortia still had no idea that they served, only that they took this stuff seriously. There was an entire building, about a fourth the size of her old grade school back home, dedicated to the procurement and storage of the eclectic style of shopping. \u201cGrossree\u201d was apparently the singular form of the word, but it covered everything in the store until it was mentioned by name. Her teeny-tiny escort was pushing around a metal box with wheels, which must have been either defective or placed in an impoverished \u201cBuy-Low\u201d (as Jerri had referred to it several times) because it was full of holes. If these things were so important, the Earthlings buying them were in for a shock when a Sphyxian Anacondoid Constrictor could wriggle through and pilfer their precious cargo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m bored human earthling sister Jerri.\u201d Vortia, disguised as human earthling sister Sherri, whined as she walked down the aisles with her diminutive guide, \u201cYou said you were going shopping, but you haven\u2019t tried anything on. This isn\u2019t shopping, I wanna go shopping!\u201d  she whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush!\u201d Jerri said as she looked around, silently dismissing the confused stares that the \u201colder\u201d girl was garnering from the remaining Bi-Lo customers within earshot, \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going shopping for anything big, just groceries!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what they dooooooo!\u201d Vortia yowled with a stomp of her boot, sending her artificially inflated bosom wobbling about behind her incomprehensible band t-shirt\u2014fresh from her private collection of spray-ons from Metalement\u2014and a ripple between her enhanced thighs stopping at the frill of her daisy dukes. \u201cI\u2019m so bored I think I\u2019m gonna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Sherri</b>. Knock it off and I\u2019ll take you to\u2026 uh, McDonalds after we get done. <b>Okay?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t even know what that is. Is <i>that</i> a mall? Because that\u2019s a really lame name for a mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri let out a little groan as her head fell to the handlebar of her buggy. Vortia had been insufferable all day in every way possible. She complained about having to wait in the car while Jerri met up with her folks, <i>even though</i> she was very adamant in not letting her Mom and Dad see a taller, bustier version of their daughter hopping around in daisy dukes and a leather jacket. On the way over she insulted her taste in music, Earth\u2019s inability to beam said music into one\u2019s brainwaves accordingly (she had peeked into the AM frequencies around her and found herself quite disturbed), and then went on a rant about how the AC was broken. It was Texas in Summer, what did she expect?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaith, don\u2019t you Earthlings have air conditioning? Or at least controlled weather?\u201d Vortia asked rhetorically as she tugged at the collar of her t-shirt, \u201cWho\u2019s head do I have to bust to get it to cool down a little in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one in a leather jacket and thigh boots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I pull them off pretty good.\u201d Vortia said with a crinkle of Jerri\u2019s nose and a wicked smile, \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d dress like this every now and again you and Monkey Boy would be able to hook up and leave my friend out of that\u2026. <i>that</i>.\u201d she shuddered at the thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri stopped in the middle of the aisle, her lips tucked in and her brow flat with anger. She flared her nostrils, taking a deep breath as an exercise in passive aggressiveness towards a foreigner, and walked it off without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia raised one of Jerri\u2019s eyebrows flashed another wicked grin, \u201cOhh\u2026 I think I get it now.\u201d She said coyly as Jerri went down the list in hopes of ignoring her \u201csister\u201d, \u201cYou <i>do</i> like Monkey-Brain, and you\u2019re just waiting for Meitty and me to hit the bricks before you make your move, right? Am I right? Tell me I\u2019m not right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long exhale before Jerri continued, her pace quickening in an attempt to escape Vortia. To no avail, as she started after her at a matching pace, her heels clicking loudly behind her. \u201cHey wait, no fair! You can\u2019t just pump me full of food and expect me to catch up with you!\u201d Vortia called out with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m lagging over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you!\u201d Jerri said, face cherry red as she fought back any justified bouts of anger that she wouldn\u2019t exactly have been a stranger to, \u201cYou can\u2019t just say that stuff! I don\u2019t know how things are on <i>your</i> planet, but here we\u2019ve got manners! We treat eachother with respect when we\u2019re friends! You\u2019ve been a total bitch this entire time, I am <i>never</i> going to speak to you again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the aisle, \u201cSherri\u201d stood with her hands on her hips, kicked out to the side as if in defiance. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty smart idea.\u201d She said with a clack of her lips and a cheeky grin on not-her face, \u201cBecause if you stick around with Tom any longer, you might end up like Meitty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia pulled out her Light Displacer and pushed a couple of buttons, more colors splashed onto her holographic disguise until \u201cSherri\u201d much more resembled \u201cJerri\u201d in stature and \u201cMeitty\u201d in girth. Jerri\u2019s curly hair fell around an oblong face donning two soft chins, two heaping melons of flesh that fell on either side of a truly monumental stomach, supported by a bottom half that truly deserved its own zip code. The clothing around her had been stretched and even torn in some places, leaving lots of \u201cJerri\u201d to be exposed to the unsuspecting public of Bi-Lo\u2026 who may or may not have been watching the strange transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou BITCH!!\u201d Jerri roared as she got a head start, abandoning her many groceries in favor of charging her fat twin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring it short stuff!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vortia had been caught off guard as she found that \"short stuff\" could certainly give a <u>big </u> push! Vortia found herself tumbling over and onto the stores' sticky linoleum floor. Jerri, her anger not her thoughts fueling her actions, reached for something, anything to push, punch, punish or pull. As Jerri dove at the heavier set version of herself, (which was not technically heavier as this wasn't a 'hard light' based projection which in fact had not yet been full invent- you know let's get back to the story.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two crashed onto the floor Jerri found that it was hard to tell where Vortia actually was. It was truly odd having to slap the sass out of her blonde bulgier clone, and watching her own face react in pain. Eventually, her hand wriggled through the hologram and was clutching what would be red hair and then yanked! This elicited a huskier version of Jerri's  own voice to scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing every ounce of  her strength Vortia flipped the furious girl over, the two tussling squirming and kicking the entire time.  Using her longer legs Vortia squeezed the tiny Texas twister as she went too grab Jerri's own curly hair, babbling a bunch of alien curse words along the way.  \"You <b>glarken </b> rothghar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tan hand blurred by Vortia's face not to gouge eyes or lips but now to grasp Vortia's now exposed and low hanging dangles. \"Don't you dare you Widsith!\" With her own hand, Vortia went to stop the girl from gripping and grabbing her antenna, but was only quick enough to leave a scratch on the girls arm. With one hard squeeze she had busted Vorita's balls, er ball. The projection system was now in a state of short circuiting, sparking certain images over Vorita's outline. A black nose, a pair of tiny blue eye's that belonged to a baby, then apparently cycling trough a list of other alien races a pair of six sideways slit eyes, then a large elephant trunk like nose. Leaving her grip on Jerri, Vortia went to her cell phone like device and simply shut it off.  \"Great you broke it!\" she spat her eyes still spinning a bit as she attempted to readjust to her normal vision.  \"Now I'm gonna break yo-!\" Vortia's raised fist never made contact with the still prone Jerri, instead it was now in the hand of another one of these humans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"  said a separate voice from behind the two of them. Both froze as they got a better gaze of the punch presenter. Stern and old were the first two words to come to mind at the sight. With frizzy gray hair and with glasses, this seventy(?) year old store greater looked like she was not in the mood to play....ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA now full exposed Vorita was led by this surprisingly strong armed women, leaving a speechless Jerri to gape on the floor.  Vortia unable to struggle free from this gruesome humans grip, nor having the audacity to flat out punch the clearly older species, simply let herself be led to wherever she was headed. Maybe she would be busted....that might actually be...fun! Humans were so closed minded anyways she outta shake things up here and blown their minds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" came a hurried cry from Jerri as she caught up with them. As she quickly glanced around Jerri was aware of how empty the Buy-Low was at three in the afternoon on a Wednesday, if she could only convince this one worker....\"Listen, um...it was my fault. I was the one who teased her. We were both fighting. Please. We'll just go...\" Her pleading seemed to fall on empty ears, as the infinitely frowning woman never eased her grip on the green girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I saw the whole thing!\" said the woman as she headed through the rubber double doors that led to the stores back rooms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, I may be old fashioned, but  you're both going to apologize. Even if you're dressed as a martian and some...lord of the rings hoobity-hobbity-girl or whatever you're dressed. You're not going to do fight it out in my store understand?\" The woman had finally relinquished her iron like grip on Vortia, and now had taken a step back, arms folded and waiting for the two to kiss and make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errm...I'm sorry.\" said Jerri turning to Vortia eyes wide and teeth gritted into a grin to show how nicey-nice things were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...me too\" said Vortia eyes quickly darting back and forth between Jerri and the Buy low worker for clues on what to do next..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act seemed to appease the stern worker as a smile finally graced her wrinkled face. \"Now, I don't know what \"comic can' \" yall're suposed to be arguin' and fightin' over, but you have to remember they're not real. Okay? Nothin' like that s'worth losin' a friend over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam' \" replied Jerri signaling  Vortia to follow her with a jerk of her head. \"We're sorry..\" and with that the two lumbered out of the dank back room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nerds. *Spit* \" was the last thing the two  heard as they left the room.  Without a word to one another thy both clambered into Jerri's car, the bad blood that had boiled over between them simmering  a bit by the threat of imprisonment... There was a long silence as Jerri started the car and simply drove keeping her mind off of he passenger next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to help me back there...\" Said Vortia suddenly, although without emotion, sounding more like she was expelling facts than giving thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...s'all right\" said Jerri catching Vortia's drift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to set thing straight, I'm not a Martian either.\" said Vorita again spurting facts of the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>I'm</i> not a hobbit\" said Jerri pointing a thumb at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that slang for bitch? Cause you sure don't hit like one...\" said Vortia bringing  a hand to her sore cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. <i>That's</i> cuz, I'm from Texas!... \" said Jerri grimacing a bit as she felt the A.C. blow over the scratch on her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Bumpkin.\" grunted Vortia, taken aback by this human and how she seem to share Vortia's own 'take no shit' attitude. \"I guess...If you want to do your grossery shopping or whatever I guess I could stay in the car and try to fix my light displacer...Which you broke.\" noted Vortia who refused to give an out and out apology to this lower in stature life-form. A broken silver bulb in hand, she was already at work trying to fix the object's innards...fortunately it didn't look <i>too </i> damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, said Jerri, who was now pulling off into a separate Buy-low parking lot, (the damn chain was practically everywhere!) instead of back at Tom's where she longed to be. \"Well maybe afterwords, if you can fix that thing we can stop somewhere to eat...maybe even the mall....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" asked Vortia now intrigued by the word mall once more, even if it was of inferior Earthen quality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe!</i> If we don't end up sending each-other to the hospital first.\" added Jerri unbuckling her seat belt. \"I might even gossip a bit about Meitty and Tom...and myself if you're good.\" she teased. It would probably feel god to tell someone else of their obviously...\"unique\" relationship. \"Be right back!\" shouted Jerri as she took off towards the store, leaving Vortia alone in the still running air conditioned car. </span></div></div>",

All of her fancy toys and electronic doo-dads were silent, there was not a sound to be heard in the interstellar squatter\u2019s chambers. Or the house, for that matter, what with the increasing absence of Mr. and Mrs. Parker. There was only the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith, Faith oh fuckin\u2019 Faith!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was not quiet, as anyone with an ounce of perception to them could tell. When the parents (and other star-crossed acquaintances) were away, teenaged lovers do often play. The heavy thuds of their rhythm beating against the wall echoed throughout the empty house, their love sounding a drum of passionate intercourse. It had been too long since they\u2019d gotten to do this\u2026 like <i>this</i> anyway. Tom always seemed to worry about the presence of his parents, or the impending arrival of Jerri. With Vortia in the house now, neither of them was sure they were ever going to get to do this again before Meitty left\u2026 but they didn\u2019t like to talk about that. In fact, only Meitty liked to talk right now. It was kinda her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the patchwork, the two of them had stripped down to only their skin. Tom\u2019s plaid overshirt lay over the chair at Meitty\u2019s vanity, his pants were\u2026 somewhere, and he had the distinct recollection of throwing his graphic-tee over the plant. Meitnerium had no concerns over where the remnants of her own clothing lie, content in knowing that there would be no interruptions. Nothing to come between her and Tom, and nothing to keep either of them from holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerocity filled the room, the temperature rising higher and higher as their collective body heat joined forces with the naturally overbearing Texas heat. Within the dark damp room time seemed to stand still, only to grow morbidly warm throughout the course of their passionate lovemaking. Had they been paying any attention at all to anything other than eachother, no doubt someone would have had something to say. But no, even the meticulous Meitty was at a loss for words\u2014lost in a sea of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck\u2026 fuck\u2026 mmmhmm\u2026 goddamn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he was doing. He had never been with another woman (?) before the big green apple of his eye came around. And while they weren\u2019t exactly slackers in the sack, everything Tom did was by ear. All he knew was that, whatever he did, Meitty liked. And so he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some maneuvering to wedge himself into what vaguely resembled a human vagina (its technical name is unable to be spelled out on the conventional keyboard but loosely translates into \u201cdocking bay\u201d) but Tom, ever resourceful, managed to find a position just right for he and his super-sized lover. With her sweaty green rolls pushing him away and her thick green arms pulling him close, it was quite the difficult position. But still he pumped and thrusted his way into her, invigorated by youth but exhausted from exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed and pulled quite often, much to his woman\u2019s delight. The sensation of that smooth thing going in and out, in and out, it wasn\u2019t unlike sex with a member of Meitty\u2019s own species. With every passionate thrust of his Earthliness, a loud clap would sound as his body slapped against her own\u2014causing a ripple to go through her great globular gut at each round. She liked it. She <i>loved</i> it, Tom knew just how to push her buttons. But it was his hands, <i>they</i> were what made him so\u2026 <b>good</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon her insistence, Tom was to fondle her at all times. Somewhere on that fleshy green expanse of hers, Tom\u2019s hands needed to be there. He would squeeze her tummy, kissing it lightly (or not so lightly) as he kneeded the doughy mass on either side of her flabby flank. He would stick his tongue in it, \u201cFrench kissing\u201d it, as it was called. Meitnerium liked that. Of course that wasn\u2019t the <i>only</i> thing she liked for Tom to do with his tongue, but I digress\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty often just lie there, far too entitled to contribute much to their sessions. Which was fine. Tom liked it, though he couldn\u2019t quite explain why. It meant he had to try harder, learning more and more about this strange lover he had made for himself. Exploring more and more of her enormity, finding new ways to incorporate her overall girth into their love life. But he knew that there was always a way to speed things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill pumping her full of his Lone Ranger, Tom lay across his lady like a giant agave mattress and pinned her down by the chubby wrists. She laughed, her breathing becoming more erratic. She loved this, this particular Earth Thing that she liked. Despite her knowledge of this little routine, she would always always <i>always</i> let him get away with it.

She instinctively held him closer, forcing him back inside just a little more. His tongue rolled around her bud, his teeth nibbled on her stalk\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaith\u2026faith, faith, Faith\u2026Faithfaith\u2026oh faith\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe felt herself tighten and clench uncontrollably, her mighty cheeks brought so tightly together that they lifted her off of the bed slightly. Her buds, God she loved her buds! They were so\u2026 satisfying. Even after the many (much more than she would ever admit) suitors that had tried to do her, none had been so satisfying as Tom. And that was saying something, considering he was nothing more than a housepet to the civilized parts of the universe. She grew silent as her lower lip quivered, holding Tom tighter and tighter\u2014eventually he let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had regained her inhibitions, simply brought Tom closer in their embrace and rolled over onto her mighty side.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After entering the air-conditioned mall, it had only taken a few moments for Vortia to admit that the human aspect of shopping was pretty similar to most of the Saxxonian galaxy. Though the oddly beige skinned models, which  were adorned with frightening doll like faces, some even sometimes faceless, were no comparison to 3D holographic displays of her home world, but she supposed a race had to start somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia was feeling pretty good, (being the so called \"most advanced life form on a planet\" could to a woman) and had even managed to get her bulbs fixed, although much to Jerri's chagrin, the still slightly malfunctioning settings were now severely limited and could only revert back to he last saved configuration. So, Jerri was again now stuck shopping with her tubbier \"twin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had only browsed a single store in the mall; A Victoria's Secret. Vortia had been instantly drawn to the store on name alone, but was greatly disappointed to find it was not actually <u>Vortia</u>'s Secret, inside however she was more than pleased with Earth's choice in  risque clothing. After a few minuets of entering, Jerri was sure the two had earned a few stares, and unfortunately, Vortia could only guess her Earth side sizes, (the non \"corpulent-copy\" kind at least.) Also, there was to be no trying on of clothes (especially after Jerri explained the anti-theft cameras in most dressing rooms, ) but Vortia did end up talking Jerri into springing for a few of the Earth clothing chotchkies (getting other to buy things for them an ability Vortia and Meitty both seemed to share.) A shopping bags now in hand, Vortia definitely felt right at home here in an Earth mall, even if \"here\" was the farthest she'd ever been from her home planet, although Jerri had yet to show her what was probably the greatest difference between Earth mall and Metalean malls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now settled at a table in the food court  where a commingling of international food commodities had  brought a scent so heavenly, it was like a miniature version of world peace.  Jerri was in a better mood, although still a bit paranoid about anyway wayward glances the galactic girl was getting, and wondering what to do if the hologram projector bulbs should short out. Such worries were quickly forgotten as, after only earning a tiny bit of Vortia's admiration before,  Jerri now found herself explaining the simplest of  food based customs to the \"superior\" lifeforms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shake? As in the vibrations of molecules as to...\" began Vortia as Jerri placed the large semi-liquid in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not like that...Well, not exactly... \" Began Jerri. To start,  the interview had begun over a burgers and fries meal. Vortia's tough 'tude was slowly starting to relax, as Jerri began pumping Vortia for alien life info while pumping calories into her at the same time.  Jerri had brought her now well filled notebook along and was finally getting some Metalean info from a second source. (Not that Meitty didn't give good info when she felt like it, she was just often vague, and more focused on High School level gossip,  and in the end,Tom, Meitty, and Jerri would eventually get...distracted.) Jerri felt like she was getting the deal of a lifetime, as the exchange of information seemed almost unfair for the \"level\" of factoids they were trading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shake-machine huh? Well how come it looks weird? And how come there's no smell to it like the rest of the foods here?\" asked Vortia, her holographic nose nearing but not entering the frozen delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foods are different. It's like...Like clothes! They're made of different materials and in different ways right? That's not really the best way to put it but...\" Jerri hoped the clothing comparison would work, Vortia only seemed to be partly paying attention, nodding her head as she still studied the shake. \"Um...Could you tell me again why it's taking so long for Meitty's parents to get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia set the shake down and instead grabbed a handful of fires, looking not to out of place in the hands of her double chinned doppelganger. *Munch.* \"Simple time dilation warp. Space is 4 dimensions right? Well, time is sort of like the 5th. Now think of a sector of space where there's less traffic *Nom*...Gravity  is less dense there. Now  space travel through populated areas are on these instituted paths, or Highway's  means that it's not necessarily the shortest way, but <i>it is </i> the quickest... \" It was Jerri's turn to nod her head trying to keep up with the info as fast as she could write it down. \"Now *munch* Meitty's parents, are going through a less dense area...Here let me show you with this emergency induction port.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a straw?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staw? You mean you don't use these to...whatever. Okay so this \"straw\"...the first time it goes through this shake, it's thick so it's harder. But the second time it's a lot easier, and even easier the next time  So with Earth being out of the way, it's going to take a while, especially since most people thought it was uninhabitable...like this shake thing. \" Here she eyed frozen concoction wrapped in Styrofoam and looking as cold and lifeless as one of the Saxxon galaxies many moons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called vanilla ice cream. It's actually-. \" said Jerri sounding like a mother explaining something to her child. She really had to wonder how Tom had the patience to explain everything to Meitty.  opted for the shorter less scientific answer. \"Just try it you'll like it. It's one of Meitty's favorites...\" This had been enough to goad the green girl into opening the prototype liquid transfer machine, the white liquid slowly went up and past her lips. Jerri wasn't sure, but if she could see past through the hologram she'd bet Vortia's antenna would be sticking straight up in delight! The girl guzzled, and gulped and slurped the frosty un-choclate milkshake, barely stopping to catch her breath. Metaleans were apparently not susceptible to Ice Cream headaches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we can go through all the goodies I have, well any that still work, if you can get me more of these...\" said Vortia breathlessly enraptured. Jerri was more than happy too, and Vortia was glad to be fawned over by the maybe not-so unintelligent life form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What do you think will happen? said Jerri, returning with another shake in hand, and a now more serious look in her eyes. \"I mean after Meitty's folks take her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well...servitude I guess.\" said Vortia suddenly looking  a bit unconformable in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Metaleans <i>are </i> a conquering race. It's in our blood.\" said Vortia matter of factually as she began sucking on her chocolate shake. \"We find a planet, and either conquer it or enslave it, that's how we got to be such a great empire. I mean...It's not like your planet has much of a defense system anyways. And...Tom was it? He's practically already under Meitty's control. So I guess she has dibs on him. I mean if Meitty's dad doesn't put him in galactic prison first for kidnapping. He probably would have blown up a good chunk of the planet If anything had happened to her! And by the law he'd be right too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..\" said a much paler Jerri<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-He, probably <b>still </b> will on the grounds of theft. Don't worry though. I'll make sure you two aren't put in too harsh a prison. What is the average lifespan of a human anyway? 100 solar sweeps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen... Vortia\" said the frozen Jerri unsure of how to react to this new bit of info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lady </i>Vortia. As a first pioneer of a new planet, I and Meitty receive an honorable title from my people, and I already like the sound of it. Hey, you wouldn't mind being a servant to me would you? You seem nice enough and you take orders really well. It'd be better than prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,sorry.  <i>Lady </i> Vortia. Is there anyway I could..maybe get in touch with Meitty's parents again. Maybe in a way so they don't have to enslave Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. They're in hyperspace so there signals gone. And these fries are  going to be gone too. *MMph*  she moaned taking one final large handful. \"They were delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I think we should go- I've got to go talk to Tom now. Like, <u>right now</u>.\" said Jerri getting up and going for her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hurry?\" said a forlorn looking Vortia. \"Look, Meitty's fine, but I thought she would have explained this.  It won't be <i>so </i> bad. I promise. A whole race of humans serving us Metaleans doing our hard labor as we eat your food and eventually grow  to Meitty size.. It'll be wonderful. We'll be your bosses, but we'll treat you well. I, <i>certainly </i>don't think Tom would mind, and from the way you've been staring at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said Jerri a bit of hysteria cracking into her voice. \"We have to go! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia saw the panic in the human and..</span></div></div>",

You-you actually said it!\" she gasped in between belly laughs and a bouncing double chin . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What-I-I-don't.\" said Jerri unsure what to do next at this odd reaction. She had to get out of here, she had to go! She was taking a step towards the door when Vortia's hand quickly grasped her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down. Relax. I was just kidding.\" said Vortia looking a bit sheepish but still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?-What?-I! You had me ready to... Why!\" said a still very flustered and confused Jerri unsure if this was yet another trick, her xenophobia reaching peak levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay....I'm sorry...\"*Whew* \"I-I couldn't help myself....*giggle* I'm sorry...Alright. Honestly, I'm a bit frightened too. Meitty is my number one gal pal and she trusts you, so I'm pretty sure you two are okay, but with everyone else here I'm a little on edge. At least till our *reinforcements* arrive, I just don't want to be the ones who have to negotiate. I'm not really sure what's going to happen. Really, this is the first time a cultured alien race has been discovered in like, hundreds of years! I'd be more in the excited side of things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What's really going to happen?\" said Jerri still a little cautious but taking her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade most likely. Bo-ring. The Galactic Federation, they like, oversee everything every planet does so nobody ever ends up destroying anything. Anyways, they'll make sure you Hu-mans? Am I saying that right? Humans, will be greatly taken care of and watched over. You'll be coddled! The darling of the universe! Far from destroyed! Yep, you stand to make some serious profits when people come looking for one of those Pizza things, you'll be the only ones who make it! Well before the knock off start. I don't think you deliver to the other side of the Universe, at least not yet. And It'll probably be a shock to you humans, some offended, maybe even a bit offensive, but in the end I suppose you'll be welcomed in and as advanced as the rest of us. \"Us\" as in the other alien races, there are more than just Metaleans you know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you for scaring me like that!\" said Jerri suddenly and sharply the color in her face not only returning but turning redder by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably deserved,that, whatever \"fuck\" means. Meitty and I...we're pretty much trouble makers in case you haven't figured it out by now...\" said Vortia a true trouble makers grin again crossing her face. \"But to finish... You'll be given anything you need, access to billions of different designs, gadgets, and tech. Oh and fashion too, it's so hard to stay trendy when there's a hundred different races to keep up with, but it hasn't stopped me yet. Plus, when Earth fashion does becomes chique. I'll be ahead of the curve, and already have someone on the inside.\" said Vortia with a wink. \"But yeah for the most part both boring and exciting. A lot of long speeches and papers. And not a hair harmed on any of your heads. Let's just hope you humans can do the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri paused for a moment considering for a bit what she'd just heard. \"...Tom doesn't know a thing about fashion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was talking about you.\" said Vortia <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" said Jerri feeling the twinge of friendship she'd first had when she'd actually met Meitty 'the alien' not Meitty 'the foreigner.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a deal is a deal. Let's head to Tom's and I'll show you everything about the Galactic Federation I have when we get back. It'd be the first time that expensive e-school pamphlet would be useful for anything.\" grumbled Vortia now finished with her second shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we don't have to...Meittys shows aren't on till 3:00<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. What happens then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell..you've never seen Meitty eat...It's amazing! gushing. She said she's going to set a record.

Go get some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 go and get more?\u201d Vortia said with a look of arbitrary disbelief on her supple Sherri face, as if Jerri had told her to pray to some pagan god for crops<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you just go over there\u2014\u201c here she pointed to the Chick fil a across the food court, \u201c\u2014and ask the guy for a refill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it doesn\u2019t, like\u2026 refill?\u201d Vortia asked quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri let out a little laugh, forgetting that she was dealing with a tourist. Vortia had only been on Earth for a few days now, hardly the veteran in enduring Earthly customs that Meitty was. Excitedly, the curly-cued cutie smiled and placed her notebook down on the table next to Vortia\u2019s shopping bag\u2014making sure that it was quite closed lest peeping eyes be about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll give you a grand tour.\u201d She said, scooting her own self out and making her way over to her doughy doppleganger, \u201cWanna get another burger while you\u2019re up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.

I am the <i>last</i> person who wants to raise any eyebrows \u2018round here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you bitch.\u201d Vortia grumbled, distasted in Jerri\u2019s sudden sneakiness but very eager to substitute it with the much more pleasant sensation of a hamburger, \u201cCan\u2019t beleef I wush outshmarded by a monkey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri, the earth-twin-sister of Jerri, certainly didn\u2019t raise any eyebrows. Now if she had been the taller, leggier, significantly greener Vortia at the time then it was a distinct possibility. But no, seeing a 5\u20194\u201d butterball of normal Caucasian persuasion was significantly easier for their fellow mall patrons to stomach. No, the only eyes on \u201cSherri\u201d belonged to her escort for the evening, who reveled in watching her faux-fat friend indulge in every bite\u2014even if it <i>was</i> as a version of her that had to be at least double her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri watched as Vortia began to partake in the little meal she had acquired for her. The disguised delinquent seemed a little puzzled at first, only having eaten a burger just a few minutes ago. But it seemed to come naturally to her\u2014first she would lift one arm, grab the burger, reel it into her mouth\u2026 every bite slowly evolving from something practiced and mechanical into a more natural motion. Quicker, sloppier, more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was getting the hang of things, to say the least. The overload of taste on her poor deprived Metalean taste buds was to be noticed easily\u2014a trained eye like Jerri\u2019s had no problem picking out the little pauses of appreciation, nor the small noises she made throughout her feasting. It wasn\u2019t odd, getting such enjoyment out of seeing a version of herself getting stuffed silly, right? Jerri had seen the green eating machine underneath the hard-light dowhatsit, hardly convinced that her tubby twin was some sort of reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Vortia had made her way through the burgers, their large size intimidating and their buns quite filling. The fries were a much harder matter, after having filled up on the sandwiches and such tackling such a daunting task of seemingly endless potato-chunks definitely looked impossible. She had at them with less enthusiasm, noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does\u2026 Meitty\u2026 do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe girl\u2019s a pro.\u201d Jerri said with a smile as she nudged the plate closer again to her newest subject, \u201cEats our Earth-food like she\u2019s been doing it all her life, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s\u2026 so frickin\u2019\u2026 so frickin\u2019 fat.\u201d Vortia wheezed, unable to restrain Sherri\u2019s doughy left arm as it stuffed another handful of French fries into her mouth, \u201cOh Faith\u2026 It\u2019s all just so\u2026 <i>gooood</i>!\u201d <br>\r\n\u2018Sherri\u2019 began massaging her bloated, pale dome of a paunch. Her breathing was heavy, but the hard-light construct was too damaged to accurately capture Vortia\u2019s true expression\u2014despite her extreme exhaustion, \u2018Sherri\u2019 appeared not to be flustered or sweaty. However beneath the simulated skin, Vortia was sweating buckets in her leather jacket. She hadn\u2019t yet gotten accustomed to eating quite so much so fast. It was all a little\u2026 strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jerri\u2019s eyes could have gotten any wider, which was doubtful, they would have. A small white crack in the hard-light construct flashed for half a second before disappearing, the projection of her earth-twin-sister-Sherri becoming snowy in certain parts for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh faith\u2026oh frickin\u2019\u2026MMMmmm\u2026\u201d Vortia sang as she continued stuffing handful after handful into her kraut, massaging more vigorously now on both sides of the simulated spectrum. Beneath the construct, her antennae (already quite large) began to stand erect as she passed her threshold for her appetite<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uh, Sh-Sherri\u2026\u201d Jerri stammered, quite red in her own rights for her own reasons, \u201cY-You might wanna slow down, there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d the alien ignored her friend\u2019s warnings, \u201cAlmos\u2026done\u2026\u201d Vortia managed through increasingly vigorous amounts of fries, \u201cThese things are\u2026mm\u2026sogood\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Sherri</i>.\u201d Jerri said sharply, \u201cKnock. It. Off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the breaks in Vortia\u2019s charade became more apparent and frequent, she also became increasingly engrossed in her own gorging. Her antennae slowly getting straighter and taller, and straighter and taller until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BEEP BEEP BEEP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Faith.\u201d Vortia said suddenly, snapping back to reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?!\u201d Jerri hissed as she watched her \u2018twin\u2019 disappear from thin air, replaced by the skinny-minny redhead with the throbbing stalks sticking out of her bright red locks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I just overloaded my hard-light projectors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Faith.\u201d Jerri said flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a second later that the two of them were out the door, Vortia\u2019s jacket pulled up and over her head (a <i>very</i> painful attempt at hiding her antennae) running to the car like two women possessed. They had managed to be here for a whole hour and not have any kind of mishaps, but of <i>course</i> something like this had to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to your projectors?!\u201d Jerri whispered as they ran to her sedan, clinging desperately to her notebook \u201cWhat good is all your alien tech if it keeps breaking down?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know!\u201d Vortia puffed, having some difficulty keeping up on a full stomach and the heavy Victoria's secret bag, \u201cI guess when they shorted out they couldn\u2019t\u2026 and I\u2026 and those fries\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind!\u201d Jerri barked as she opened the door, \u201cJust\u2026 get in the car and keep your head down, just in case!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d Vortia cried out suddenly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never got me another milkshake!\"</span></div></div>",

This is hopeless!\" she said again throwing the pen down in frustration. \"I don't suppose that Tom has any ion heating nano sized soldiering tools?\" she asked arms crossed and turning to Jerri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, but His <i>Dad </i>might have the earth equivalent-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>simian </i>tech <i>sure</i>! Why don't I just get a rock and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Hey! Watch yourself.\" said Jerri raising her tone once more. Vortia took a long straw sip from her shake and that seemed to quell her nerves .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just joking (siiip) I'm just...frustrated is all. I'd hope to be home by now.... And now these are broke...No thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike two... One more and you're walking.\" said Jeri shooting a heated look towards Vortia.  \"And need I remind you that it was thanks to me, we made it out of the mall just fine without you getting caught. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Siiip) You're right, I still don't see what the big deal is...\" said Vortia sighing softly as she set down her drink and tucked her silver orbs away, focusing solely on the sweet treat in front of her. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nMinutes later, and more happy then ever to pull up to Tom's house, Jerri crab clawed the allotment of shakes and was relived to enter the peaceful air-conditioned home. Promptly re-locking the consistently locked front door behind Vortia, she found that a sleepy eyed Tom was the only one up in the oddly quiet house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said quietly taking the tired looking Jerri into an embrace. \"Everything go okay?\"   Jerri momentarily enjoying the embrace, gave Tom a quick peck on the cheek before setting the now 5 shakes into the fridge. Vortia meanwhile was now couch bound, busy reveling in her most recent new flavored shake and rummaging through her bag of mall treasures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... No...Well...It's a long story.\" whispered Jerri as she continued into the kitchen before slumping on a dinner table chair. Jerri then explained how her trip with Vortia had gone; The frequent fights, the mall meltdown... only leaving out maybe a few specific Tom centric details. \"-we'll be okay now though, I think we're okay. My parents think we're at the beach again, and I decided to generously buy milkshakes after we made it out of the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't <i>too </i> worried about you two Jer. I mean, I know <i>you </i>can handle just about anything, but  I was mostly worried about Vortia causing a scene. \" said Tom now letting his hand intertwine with hers. \"I'm, just... glad you're both okay....This is-it's getting a little weird isn't it?\" he asked voice choking a bit on a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..It was beyond weird a loooong time ago\" said Jerri smiling before sharing a deep lip locking kiss with Tom. There was something about the way they kissed now that was unlike  any of their many previous kisses. For one thing there was a sense of urgency and yet somehow welcoming in this kiss, the subtle movement of his head to be closer to her, her arm reaching around his back to bring him in tighter, and for another, it wasn't in the shared presence of a certain olive skinned ogling onlooker....Well at least one named Meitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmph\" said Tom breaking away from the blissful kiss. \"Since you hurried on over here, shouldn't we wake her royal alien-ness up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri sighing slightly and who wouldn't have minded a little more 'alone time' with Tom, eventually agreed. \"Well we'd better. <i>Remember last time?</i>.\"  Tom actually needed no reminding, Meitty had missed a single episode of her favorite TV soap, and the resulting complaining and minor temper-tanturm she'd thrown was enough to give anyone who even <u>thought </u>of it a recurring headache. \"But let's make Vortia do it. Since <i>she </i>seems likes joking around so much. Let <i>her </i> deal with a cranky Meitty.\" Tom nodded  and they both walked towards a very satiated looking Vortia. A satisfied smile graced her lips, lips that were covered in pink ice cream residue. Vortia had apparently removed the lid off of her shake and decided to chug the dang thing in an attempt to get as much frozen goodness in her as quickly as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerri, *hic* tell me...What...what was this pink kind again? The one that matched my cute  new Vortia's secret clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strawberry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think <i>that's</i> my new favorite...\" Now finally wiping and licking the last bit of strawberry goo from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Great....well...Want to wake up Meitty? Her soaps are just about to come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" said Vortia half moaning as she hefted herself off the couch and down to the room Jerri pointed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was still rather dark from earlier events, and the smell of the room while not exactly unpleasant, was unlike any Vortia had known. Making her way to the large bed-lump covered by blankets Vortia gave her gal pal a playful nudge.  \"Meitty. Hey! Don't tell me you and the Tom thing were in here...Oh Faith! You <u>were </u>weren't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty meanwhile remained snoring regardless of the goading. Vortia resorted to one of her favorite tactics having been stuck with Meitty in a situation like this a few times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem* This is Mrs. Henderson and if you're tardy for one more of my classes I'll have no other choice than to-\" It was obvious that the impression was having little to no effect. \"Heeey!\" she shouted again, giddy to gossip once more about all the new \"Earthling\" things she'd seen and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu nuhh.\" said Meitty, her huge body shifting as she was finally waking up a bit. \"Oh hey Erbi, *yawwwwn*  Have a good time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I <i>tried </i> to-\" said Vortia with a dismissive roll of her eyes. \"Oh, before I get started, those Earthlings in the next room said something about soaps?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>This </u>seemed to grab Meitty's attention. \"What? 3:00? All-ready?\" She sat up, best as she could with her rolly-polly belly, and rolled off the bed. As her tender toes hit the carpet she realized what the bed sheets had kept hidden from her BFF, she was completely in the buff. Again to Vortia this was not a completely odd state for Meitty to be in, but it was one Meitty would rather change. Quickly grabbing her largest sweats she poured herself into the pair of pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't happen to have any spray-tex would you? My can's almost out.\" said the breathless beauty, her white hair teased and tussled in the traditional 'morning after' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meitty what's the rush?\" asked Vortia moving just out of the way as Meitty hurriedly struggled to fit inside of a t-shirt. \"I wanted to show you some of these cute tops from this store, and now I find you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time,\" said Meitty now no longer topless, but from the look of things squeezed into one of her older t-shirts. \"You can tell me all about it later Erby-Derby. \" and with that she disappeared out of the bedroom leaving a puzzled Vortia behind her in her haste.Vortia couldn't see what the big deal was, having never personally basked in the glow of Earthling based trashy TV telenovellas. Confused for what to be her hundredth time that day, Vortia followed her friend back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty's bra-less bosom wasn't <u>un</u>noticed and it certainly wasn't <u>un</u>appreciated. Her big breasts bouncing gloriously just underneath her t-shirts stretched fabric were given appreciative glance by not one, but two sets of human eyes. Guilty grins spread across two faces as well, as Meitty took her well 'earned' spot back on the couch. Vortia meanwhile had lugged her many tools and gadgets into the living room, figuring she rather keep herself busy than watch any of this Earth life TV, well maybe a few seconds...Oooh who was that?  <i>He </i>certainly wasn't like this Tom Earthling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of the two aliens eying the TV set Tom and Jerri's grips increased in intensity.  A look slowly began Tom's face, one that Jerri was very,very, familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom. No.\" said Jerri, although not with much passion, more by habit than with actual passion. \"You can't possibly be thinking about...that.\" said Jeri trying to hide a very similar look from her own blushing face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, much to Jerri's surprised, Tom stopped. He turned and looked Jerri right in the eyes right before saying, \"Look Jerri everybody's been on edge lately, but I think things are going to be okay now. Meitty's parents are on their way, the blinds are closed, I don't have any work till next week, we've got a life time supply of twonkies in the kitchen and you even brought milkshakes.  We've got nothing to do <i>but </i>relax and wait for Meitty's parents to show up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" said Jerri relaxing a little more in Tom's arms. \"I think we've earned a little more summer vacation. It's just to do 'that'  when Vortia just got here....It feels...I don't know...You know Vortia said she's got  a box of tech-tools with her. You want to take a look at some of her gadgets? Oh and that Codex! Tom! We could see what other aliens are like! Your Dad is going to die when he see this stuff!\" sheepishly Jerri turned her head, at odds within herself on what she wanted to do next, and what she REALLY wanted to do with Tom,and with Meitty, all the time... Well there was plenty of time for both, but what did they want to do first? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do Tom and Jerri ending up sitting next to?</span></div></div>",

His brow furrowed as he looked away from the makeshift workshop that his newest houseguest had made for herself in the Parker\u2019s spare bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dUgh! I can\u2019t hear the TV!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dTom, why don\u2019t y\u2019all go... somewhere else? You\u2019ve had Meitty all day\u2026We\u2019ll switch!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mouthed the word \u2018switch\u2019 in exaggerated disdain, hardly paying attention to the little bursts of electricity that sprung from Vortia\u2019s little light-bending balls. Whatever they were, they didn\u2019t really seem to like it when she poked them with his dad\u2019s soldering gun. Not that he cared. These definitely weren\u2019t the two orbs he wanted to be watching right now. And \u201cassisting\u201d Vortia was definitely the last thing on his mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRassen. Frassen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia sat in front of him, hunched over on the floor with various Earth tools scattered around her. She said she didn\u2019t need a table, that the carpet would work fine, but the fact that her Hard Light transmitters were so wonky (and liable to spark) didn\u2019t lend much faith to the promise to his parents that they wouldn\u2019t start any house fires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrickin\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere hadn\u2019t been much conversation between the two of them, generally because there was little to talk about. That awkward \u201cfriend of my friend\u201d thing on a cosmic scale. Tom had already met a beautiful alien girl, and she\u2019d told him lots about her culture. Vortia had spent the afternoon getting acclimated to Earth and junk, and she\u2019d taken much more to the familiar Jerri. Tom wasn\u2019t much of a tech-head (he\u2019d never pegged Jerri for one either) and wasn\u2019t really interested in how Vortia\u2019s miracle camouflage device worked, only in that it got <i>fixed</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny maybe wondering why Meitty hadn\u2019t crashed with such a useful device earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Vortia flapped her arm and shook her hand as she recoiled from a particularly nasty shock, emphasized by a loud KZZT and a puff of smoke, \u201cFreakin\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, uh\u2026 you got it fixed yet?\u201d Tom inquired, craning his neck slightly as if to see over Vortia\u2019s hunched shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that <i>sound</i> like I fixed it?\u201d Vortia glowered back at the boy, \u201cI mean, just statistically speaking, is that a noise that you Earth Apes <i>like</i> hearing your electronic devices make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, sorry.\u201d Tom rolled his eyes (apparently <i>all</i> Metaleans had something of an attitude about them) \u201cJust trying to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia rolled her eyes and shuffled around, using her long legs and gluteal muscles to rotate while still remaining seated. The damage from her earlier binge was still very much visible, the swelling of her stomach had yet to die down as it bulged prominently between her upturned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re <i>trying</i> to huff and puff your way back into the living room so you don\u2019t have to sit here with me.\u201d She said flatly, putting her shiny silver balls down on the carpet, \u201cI mean, I get it. Good host, trying to make sure no one feels like a third\u2026 fourth?... wheel. But really, it\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked off to the side, which coincidentally happened to be the direction of the door. The thought appealed to him, much more than he cared to admit, but ultimately decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s cool.\u201d He said with an apologetic smile thrown Vortia\u2019s way, \u201cSorry it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooope.\u201d Vortia scooted back around, \u201cDon\u2019t wanna know what you and Meitty were doing in here, don\u2019t wanna think about it, don\u2019t wanna hear a word pertaining to it! Just\u2026 make yourself useful and grab me another milkshake, wouldja?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bemused smile crossed his lips as he reached over to Vortia\u2019s hoarded cache of human milkshake, having claimed no less than three of the delicious dairy cups out of the remaining five before the two of them had been relocated to Meitty\u2019s room. She\u2019d already downed one while she tapped away at her image inducers, leaving one left for him to innocently sip on while she continued to fiddle with her tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it from him eagerly, placing the straw to her lips before she even turned back around. More sparks soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 why exactly do you have to crack them open like that?\u201d Tom asked, attempting to make conversation, \u201cI thought they were just abused a little. Can\u2019t you just\u2026 reboot them? Or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible sigh, then Vortia turned around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerri and I got into a little catfight\u2014contain yourself, please\u2014and they got a little more than \u201cabused\u201d. I got them working long enough for us to sit down in the mall, but the construction bulbs burned out. I\u2019m <i>really</i> hoping that I don\u2019t have to jury-rig some kind of appropriated... No, I can\u2019t reboot them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re\u2026 really into tech, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m just a pair of long green legs? There\u2019s a brain holding up these antennae you know.\u201d Vortia rolled her eyes, \u201cNot all Metalean girls are dumb enough to try and go to art school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long awkward pause. Another one, anyway. This was\u2026 much harder than talking to Meitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in art school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaaaaaith.\u201d Vortia let out a laugh, \u201cSorry Earthman, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. Y\u2019know? I mean Meitty\u2019s had plenty of time to get used to\u2014URRRP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden belch escaped the svelter extraterrestrial, taking the both of them off guard. One hand flew to shield the air from her sudden gastric release, her eyes widening in surprise as yet another of her body\u2019s vestigial biological functions was revealed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Faith was that?!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cHave I had too much of something? Oh frick, I probably have\u2026 My body\u2019s rejecting your Earth food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, it\u2019s just a burp.\u201d Tom laughed, \u201cWe Earth folk do it all the time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a disgusting culture!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia fell back on the floor, the green dome of her stomach pooching high into the air. She hit the ground with a \u2018thud\u2019, and an awkward silence filled the room before the two of them started laughing. Eventually Vortia wriggled her way tummy-down on the floor, her head propped up by her hands. She felt more at ease with this earth man. Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me, Tom\u2026\u201d she asked with a smile on her face, \u201cYou and Jerri, are yooou\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Tom answered back hastily, \u201cI mean, maybe. Kind\u2019ve. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like really, <i>really</i> complicated. Literally the most complicated thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. Ever. Not that I\u2019m complaining, just\u2026 don\u2019t tell Meitty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo\u2026 she\u2019s single?\u201d Vortia asked with a wry crinkle of her nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJuuuust checking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia kicked her legs playfully while she tinkered with her toys idly, Tom left breathing heavily on the couch. That was an armor-piercing question if there ever were one. Tom hardly liked his personal life\u2026 romantic life\u2026 coming under fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaith, don\u2019t be such a prude. It\u2019s not weird.\u201d Vortia said flatly, \u201cOn our planet anyway. I don\u2019t know how <i>you guys</i> deal with dating, but it\u2019s normal to play the field a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 You\u2026 can we change the subject?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrickin\u2019 monkey\u2026\u201d Vortia cursed as she went back to playing, causing more sparks to fly from the opened spheres on the floor, \u201cDo you think you could \u201crassle\u201d up some kind of wiring? Why-err-ing? The little strings inside these little thingies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe filament in these things are busted. I need Tungsten, but just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, get me anything you can find. I don\u2019t know <i>where</i> I\u2019m gonna get Tungsten out in the boonies of civilized society\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCA-LICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could just break a lightbulb.\u201d Tom shot up off the couch and reached into the lamp by Meitnerium\u2019s bed, \u201cHow much of it do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much\u2026\u201d she watched as Tom\u2019s hand emerged with a fragile glass bulb, white as snow. He held it up above his head with a smile on his face (she didn\u2019t quite catch the reference\u2026 there seemed to be one\u2026) and promptly threw it to the ground, \u201cWhat are you doing you primitive\u2026 <i>genius</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, amidst the mess of pearly white glass, was <i>just</i> enough tungsten to act as filament!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly scraped up the remains of the lightbulb while Tom applauded himself, cut herself a miniscule amount of the wire provided, and placed said clippings into their respective opened transponders. Forcing them shut, the little things hummed slightly in her hand as she placed them back over the buds of her antennae\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stepped back as a mountain of simulated softness surged forward, Vortia shrinking down to just over five feet as her disguise as \u201cSherri\u201d returned. The rotund little blonde took Tom by quite the surprise\u2014the last time he\u2019d seen \u201cSherri\u201d she had been much taller and leggier. Her soft features and round face became a sheepish smile as Tom drank in every last inch of the suddenly expanded reflection of his \u2018sometimes\u2019 girl\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I can explain\u2026\u201d Vortia held up Sherri\u2019s doughy white hands, \u201cShe was being a really big bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For one thing Meitranium was eating which always put BOTH of the girls in a happy mood. Moments when the two were without Tom were rare and at first been pretty awkward, but as time passed with Jerri learning almost everything there was to know about Meitty and her alien culture, as well as all of Meitty\u2019s feelings towards food, Jerri  had learned \u2026a few personal thing about herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake now for instance. Meitty had entrenched bulk down onto the couch with Jerri friendly lounging close by to her could watch her eat\u2026and eat\u2026and gorge and practically <b>swell </b>right before her eyes...There was just <b>SO </b>much of her now compared to when they\u2019d first met. While Meitty would hardly bat one of her own olive green eyelids at the mass quantities she\u2019d become quite accustomed with consuming. She\u2019d pause casually to add a snarky sarcastic remark about whatever was on the TV or to answer on one of Jerri\u2019s questions or even ask questions of her own, mostly about Earth culture, but often more like: \u201cAny more Pizza left?\u201d and \u201cCould you bring me some more Pop...<i>Please</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure before all this, Jerri had been all in on TOM. \u2018Her and Tom 2-gether 4-Ever as it had been scrawled in nerdish fashion along the margins of her class notebook.  But then in plopped a Green Gal and non-physically booty bumped Jerri to the side. Sure Jerri was a bit dejected, but she then determined turned determined to make Tom hers!  That was until  a certain day at the beach\u2026Meitty revealed she was an alien, Tom reveled he had a certain preference in the \u2018shape\u2019 of women he liked, and Jerri well Jerri had unintentionally found out the same about herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2026now\u2026Jerri was more than okay with having Meitty as a friend, occasion science project/science an unofficial encyclopedia of an entire Alien race! And\u2026And\u2026 Jerri was also more than okay when it came to Meitty as the third pillar between her and Tom and their Love\u2026well it wasn\u2019t exactly a love triangle now was it...? Maybe a love stool, or tricycle? Gosh that was putting it weirdly, which oddly fit since they were in a weird\u2026thing\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea had been rattling around in the back of her mind since the mall trip with Vortia; Yes.  It had been an interesting summer of discover so far; watching Meitty grow larger on an almost daily basis, getting to cop a feel every week for fully \u201cscientific purposes\u201d\u2026 And now there were two of them! Jerri could feel her head and heart pounding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty had finished the last of her shakes, which matched perfectly with the show cutting to commercial break\u2026\u201cListen Jer, I hope Vortia wasn\u2019t too much of a hassle she can be bitchy when she\u2019s not getting what she wants. \u201cSaid Meitty licking the leftover strawberry red remainder from her luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not like I\u2019d be happy about being stuck on a plane and almost getting captured.\u201d Said Jerri <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it wouldn\u2019t be our first time\u2026\u201d said Meitty almost wistfully but with a mischievous grim as she recalled a fond memory.  \u201cShe is really nice if you can put up with her. Just saying\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri gave a nod of her head remembering the adventure she\u2019d just been on, the fight in the grocery story, the hot breath steaming down Jerri\u2019s face as the both struggled against each other.  \u201cShe\u2019s pretty much Earthbound now so she\u2019s gonna have to grow to like it\u2026You certainly did\u2026\u201d said Jerri with a playful poke of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaith yes I did!\u201d Added Meitty slapping her bulk for emphasis\u2026 \u201cGoing by the way she was putting away the pizza last night I think Erby-derby might even-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSettle down you Simian slob!\u201d There was a loud tumbling and then a rumbling of footsteps from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSettle Down? Settle down!\u201d Tom voice sounded out of place when it got angry, he was so rarely forced to get loud.  \u201cBecause Jerri offers to take you around and <i>THIS </i>is what you do to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri and Meitty watched in surprise as \u201cSherri\u201d the chubbier and chunkier version of Jerri tumbled from the room next door. Jerri uneasily gulped knowing what would follow. Tom came blustering in, his lank appearance looking a bit more muscled as his wiry torso puffed with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026only a joke\u2026\u201dOffered Vortia as she undid her spheres and ended the overweight illusion once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s <i>too </i>far!\u201d boomed Tom. However when he snapped his attention to Jerri, his voice was back down to his usual tone. \u201cI should have gone with you two-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Tom. Really.\u201d Jerri cut in standing up\u2026\u201dIt was my fault too\u2026We bot got to tauntin\u2019 each other and  we both got a bit cranky is all \u2026You know  how stubborn I can get\u2026Really though we patched things up\u2026\u201d as she spoke she\u2019d crossed the distance from the couch to where Tom stood, meanwhile Vortia had stood up and neatly pocketed her orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw...Jer come here\u2026\u201d said Tom offering a hug with his arms wide open. Jerri embraced him, she found such comfort and so safe when he held her like this\u2026in lean arms both their hearts thumping loudly. He leaned in close, Jerri leaned in closer and they kissed. Long and true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a room you two\u2026\u201d Added their impromptu audience Meitty from the couch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJerri you know I\u2026You don\u2019t have to...- You and\u201d Tom spluttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhshh\u2026\u201d giggled the curly haired blonde placing a finger to his lips. \u201cTom I know\u2026That was just her way of pissing me of and well it kinda\u2019 worked. We toughed it out, and it\u2019s kind of hard to explain, but we sorta have a mutual appreciation for each other now\u2026Isn\u2019t that right \u2018Erby Derby\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia stuck out her forked tongue and made a rude gesture featuring her fingers, before breaking into an innocent smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sort of like us\u2026We\u2026don\u2019t really have to explain it\u2026\u201d offered Tom before leaning in for another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh good one Mr. Suave.\u201d Said Jerri before returning with a few kisses of her own.  The kisses grew shorter apart; until they were both full on lip-locking and spit swapping. Soon their hands were on each other probing as-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t let us stop you!\u201d Again chimed in Meitty, much more enthralled in this mini soap opera than the one on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026She\u2019s probably right\u201d said Jerri a bit breathless. \u201cWe probably should wait and do this later when we have a little more...privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom thought a minute before answering\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Everyone had slept quite well after another large dinner this time featuring an extremely large batch of Chili, accompanied by loaves of oven baked Garlic bread. Vortia\u2019s analytical mind was starting to grasp the fact that yes in fact <u>ALL </u>Earth Food was equally as delicious and yes there was <i>sooo </i>many new tastes she could not begin to imagine! Yes there were seconds and <i>thirds </i>still left! Yes, even a meal <i>after </i>the meal called dessert! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm *<b>Burrrp</b>* was was that called again?\u201d asked a very full and fulfilled looking Vortia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCheesecake\u201d added Jerri having begun taking notes in a separate notebook, focusing on the second foreign foodie. \u201cNow you\u2019re <i>sure </i> you don\u2019t feel any sort of sickness? Like any sort of virus or Earth based germ wise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia gave a slight moan\u2026\"Now that you mention it\u2026.Ohh\u2026I\u2019m beginning to see the slight downside of being so full\u2026\u201d  This remark got a laugh from the whole dinner table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had continued in much the same way the rest of that week. That was until Mr. and Mrs. Parker arrive back home. They were a bit surprised to say the least when they arrived back from their cruise only to find another green guest had arrived. The did breathe a sigh of relief however after Tom had explained how Vortia had arrived, and assured them things were fine. (Tom having left out a few FBI related details here and there.)  Finally he got to the main point that Meirtty and Vorita were soon in fact going home. So soon Mr. and Mrs. Parker settled back into their normal routines. That was with another hungry mouth to feed of course. Mr. Parker awe stricken by Vorita\u2019s orbs (you know what I mean) was more than happy to deal with another dip in his paycheck, in exchange to watch them work. And as for Mrs. Parker, well, although her time cooking in the kitchen had increased, so had the amount of help she was getting. Vorita was more interested in cooking the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">lazy </span>energy efficient Meitty, and Mrs. Parker grew to appreciate the extra helping hands. The red headed space babe, had been given a tour of the kitchen by Louise who ended up explaining a few of the objects Meitranium had confusion with; thinking the fridge was some sort of cooling bay for a mainframe computer, the oven was a resonator generator device, and the microwave some sort of antennae field scrambler<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you don\u2019t scrub all the pots and plates by hand?\u201d inquired Vortia when they\u2019d arrived to the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Well at least since the dishwasher went out. And don\u2019t I have the dishpan hands to prove it? Well Tom helps most of the time too but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me take a look\u2026\u201d Vortia had cut of Tom\u2019s mother in mid-sentence, but was already hard at work studying the inside of the broken washing machine. There was clinking and clanging, and Ms. Parker had gasped a few times at the sight of washing machine parts being flung across the usually spotless kitchen floor. As she worked inside of the machine tearing and unscrewing as she pleased, Vortia realized something was\u2026distracting her. Usually the lithe alien moved with grace, but now she was fighting and fidgeting with her own paunch. Yep, it was definitely there. She realized with a bit of excitement she was on her way to starting to look like Meitty. Not that she minded, she in fact wondered what the extra weight would feel like instead of being holographically projected onto her frame\u2026She couldn\u2019t wait to find out. And it wasn\u2019t like she was going to give up on food back to food pills. Oh <b>FAITH </b>no! She\u2019d eat as much as she could, and enjoy the gains that came along with it. With food this good one couldn\u2019t help but love these humans, clearly a food based tactic could bring about Galactic peace she marveled a bit as she continue to work, ignoring Tom\u2019s offer to get a screwdriver , or the shrieks Mrs.Parker was forced to stifle as Vortia went on tearing more and more from the machine. \u2026Eventually after some work with her trusty mini soldering iron the dishwasher was done, up and running better than it had been before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the days of summer flew by, with each day seeming to bring a mini adventure, and almost each and every night filled with Netflix and Chili. Food, fun, and a certain other f word became the focus, as their three feeder feedee whoopee, turned into a gastronomical orgy for four. That was until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as normal as normal got for a household filled with two still growing alien girls, that November day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on step on the scale Vortia\u201d urged Jerri, now a common face at the Parker household, coming over just about every day she could.  Inside of the Parker residences bathroom she held a king size candy bar with one hand just out of Vortia\u2019s eager pre-chocolate smudged mouth\u2019s reach.  The now increasingly more voluptuous Vortia plodded and stood on the digital device, arms crossed;  part of her really enjoyed the almost reverence the humans had for her now, but she was also a bit miffed she was still treated like a model they could dress and undress, she supposed she\u2019d never fully understand this inferior simian species.  The lights blinked a bit before the display finally revealed 264lbs. Jerri took a quick moment to scribble the statistic into her notebook, then did a double take as she realized Vorita had now officially just more than doubled her weight since landing her on Earth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*<b>Munch</b>* Ish that like a big deal or shomthing?\u201d asked Vortia happily tearing open the second of many discounted Halloween surplus she\u2019d planned on eating that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalloween had been quite a fascinating night for both Extraterrestrials\u2026Free to show off their antennae, the duo roamed about the sparse city streets Meitty and Tom watching and laughing all the while like parents watching their toddlers discover trick or treating for the first time. Fortunately \u2018sexy alien babes\u2019 seemed to be in this year, with Jerri and Tom donning alien makeup of their own, in a form of intergalactic cosplay. Meitty and Vortia were less that pleased at the sight, but had ventured out none the less. As they went about, many a household stood and lingered a bit longer than normal at their doorstep ogling the pear colored and pear shaped pair, some were even giving out a second handful of candy if it meant they stayed that much longer\u2026 That night the duo had devoured their entire humongous haul, and it was agreed that this was the best Earth custom they\u2019d discovered yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerri awoke from her brief reminiscing, \u201cIt\u2018s just for science.\u201d She said a little too quickly, and letting a smile cross her face. Jerri and Vortia\u2019s mutual respect had grown from admiration and then straight to affection. Jerri, struck with an intensely erotic and fleshly idea, went back over both notebooks and compared statistics. Vorita had indeed enlarged with fat even faster than Meitty had, comparatively speaking. It was thanks in no small part to Meitranium\u2019s seemingly endless hunger spilling off onto her favorite friend, along with Vortia having no concept of \u201cnormal\u201d portions, just doing what Meitty did and continue to eat adding more portions to her plate at every meal. It wasn\u2019t like Tom and Jerri were saying no, and neither was Vortia\u2019s own gut. In fact she\u2019d even taken a liking to studying the skills of food preparation; it was a relative to chemistry in the way things came together and added only at certain moments of preparation\u2026She\u2019d begun taking notes anytime she could; weather it was from Tom\u2019s mother, Jerri, or quite often Tom himself. She had even started collecting them together in a notebook of her own in to her so called menu- (which was then was quickly corrected and labeled as a cookbook.) Pre-made delivered meals weren\u2019t without their own perks though; Pizza was still an amazing creation to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow I doubt that science involves so much <i>touching</i>\u2026\u201d hinted Vortia as Jerri begun to bring out an overtaxed roll of measuring tape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said a lush and husky voice from not too far away.  Judging from the small rumbles, Jerri could tell Meitty wasn\u2019t too far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tom was actually next entering the bathroom. \u201cScience is great and all Jerri, but Mom and Dad are going to be back any minute now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u2026Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t love this as much as I do\u2026\u201d answered Jerri now biting her lower lip as she measured the circumference of Vorita\u2019s hips letting her hands brush up aside every inch of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has a point\u2026\u201d added Vortia who\u2019d already gobbled down the candy bar. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you having a problem last night\u2026\u201d Teasing Tom like this had become a bit of a habit among the three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks...But I\u2019d rather Mom and Dad didn\u2019t exactly know about this.\u201d Tom said sweat beading upon his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been keeping it a <b>BIG </b>secret. I\u2019m sure your parents know <i>SOMETHING </i>is up.\u201d Noted Jerri as she finished scribbling in her notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHar-de-har-har. Good one Jerri,\u201d said Tom sharply, \u201cI\u2019d rather not think about my parents thinking something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Tom \u2026Why would you want to hide <i>all </i> this?\u201d In marched Meitty. Well not so much marched as poured through the door way, her big green form and frame shook and jiggled with every step as she slowly trudged her way into the bathroom that was increasingly running out of free space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow exactly <b><span class=\"cbgreen\">BIG </span></b> was she now?</span></div></div>",

Far from the lithe survivor she'd been so many months ago, now four of her former selves could probably fit inside this Meitty. So many folds to squeeze and explore to touch and feel inside and out. She was past 400lbs by now, <i>easily</i>, in fact Tom felt slightly warm as he readjusted his calculation Meitty had to be near halfway towards the big 500.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can find clothes big enough to hide you\u201d said Vortia sarcastically, as she began stepping off the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve come to appreciate so many Earthling\u2019s all lavishing me with attention\u2026\u201d Meitty said with a husky chuckle, \u201cBesides I believe you\u2019ve gone native yourself, Erby-derby.\u201d She added jutting a plump finger into one of Vortia\u2019s own fat folds. Truly everyone (well apart from Mr. and Mrs. Parker) could marvel in varying degrees of awe at so much poundage smushed into so small a room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty smiled and took it all in stride as she raised a green foot and lowered it onto the waiting scale that seemed so small in comparison to her. The numbers flashed on the scale, and then an alarm sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">*BEEP BEEP BEEP*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe broke it? Said Jerri breathless with a shocked look towards Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI broke it? ...Awesome!\u201d  Said an amazed Meitty, raising her chubby arms up as high as she sluggishly could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat scale is supposed to go up to f-five hundred p-pounds-\u2026\u201d Tom sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou yammering simians!\u201d said Vortia suddenly, (and only after giving an appreciative gaze to her big ass BFF.) \u201cThat\u2019s not the scale, that\u2019s the sound of my resonator going off\u2026That must mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them quickly shared a glance; everyone was thinking the same thing. Slack jawed; they wordlessly understood that Meitty\u2019s parents were now very close by! Tumbling and stumbling, they all quickly followed out the front door, so fast that they had barely noticed the sound of Tom\u2019s parent\u2019s car parking in the driveway at the exact same time. Looking for some sign of a space craft in the afternoon sky, they caught a flash as Meitty parent\u2019s space car blipped from invisibility to visible. It rocked down, then seemingly stopped instantly, hovering briefly in mid-air before slowly sinking downwards and landing perfectly neat on solid Earth ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom?...Is...that...?\u201d asked Mr. Parker getting out of the car as fast as a missile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn\u2019t have to answer, as the doors to the Sedan looking spacecraft quickly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitrainum!\u201d said Mr. Perioda seeing his little girl for the first time in ages! Quickly Mrs. Perioda followed out of the car, the three reuniting in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Dad!\u201d said Meitty tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetie. We missed you so much. Are you all right?\u201d asked her father as they continued to embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Oh faith yes! Especially since you two are here.\u201d Meitty said only gave the slightest of sniffs to hold back her tears of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetie.\u201d murmured Meitty\u2019s mother. Soon the hug broke and the three were able the family was able to take each other in once more, and they realized there was a LOT <b>LOT </b> more of their daughter than there was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, take off that projector orb disguise they have you wearing, you\u2019re safe now\u2026 \u201c Offered Meitty\u2019s father thinking a disguise could be the only excuse for such a change in his little girl\u2019s size and shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um, actually, this is how I sort of how I look now\u2026.\u201d Stated Meitty hands griping a good layer of fat to assure her parents that this was the real deal they were seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said her mother clearly taken aback a bit by the sight of the swaying stoutness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well\u2026You are still...<i>healthy </i> then?\u201d her father asked, the puzzlement in his voice obvious. \u201cI mean this isn\u2019t some sort of planetary side effect or\u2026\u201cand here he lowered his voice a bit more \u201cYou aren\u2019t \u2026<i>expecting</i>...are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Ugh! No way! I\u2019m fine, <i>really</i>! Never healthier!\u201d she added with a grin from a mouth that had swallowed thousands of calories before noon that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents had to wonder though\u2026What had happened to their Meitty? The once harsh and bratty teen who lashed out any chance she could when she felt her parents were being too clingy, now insisted on another hug. She\u2019d somehow gone \u2018soft\u2019 on this planet Earth, in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo everything\u2019s, been fine..?\u201d Meitty\u2019s father asked still a bit skeptical Meitty had the fortune of falling onto a friendly planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaith yes it has! These \u201cEarthlings\u201d here as they call themselves are great! They\u2019ve only been nice to me, and maybe there a tiny bit underdeveloped in technology department but, they\u2019ve found this replacement for food pills that you won\u2019t believe-\u201c Meitty continued on as she explained in brevity the warm hospitality she\u2019d received on the day of her crash, and from everyday onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom watched from afar letting Meitty and her family have their first conversation together in private as they reunited. He walked over to his own parent\u2019s car, where he joined Jerri hand in hand. Vortia meanwhile gave a short wave towards the headed towards the Perodia family before opening the hatch of their space sedan and rummaging through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitranium pointed towards them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is\u2026Rhodium. This is my partner Ruthenium. You\u2019re the human who\u2019s taken care of my daughter?\u201d said Meitty\u2019s father approaching Tom\u2019s own father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr? Why yes I a m, in a way I guess. My names John Parker\u2026But I think you really want to speak with him.\u201d Tom\u2019s dad motioned to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, oh him?\u201d Said Mr. Perioda correcting his course of action.  \u201cAh! So <i>you\u2019re</i> theTom my daughter Meitty has talked about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-es sir\u2026It\u2019s an honor to meet you\u2026\u201d Tom didn\u2019t know why he was afraid, it wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t met an alien before\u2026He supposed it was the same nervousness anyone got when they were first meeting their lovers parents for the first time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonor? I\u2019m just a ship dealer!\u201d said Mr.Perioda with a laugh, a bit taken aback by the high regard the humans seemed to have for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh..right\u2026Still though...We are\u2026.You know the first meeting between\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201dsaid Mr.Peroida scratching the back of his head nervously. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda breaking a few dozen laws being here and visiting this planet before the Federation does but\u2026you all seem like nice reasonable people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026Well\u2026Uh\u2026We come in peace\u2026and we\u2019d sure love to join The Galactic Federation, if you\u2019d have us.\u201d Offered Mr. Parker breaking the ice by showing that he\u2019d been paying very close attention any time Meitranium or Vortia would talk of their home world and its\u2019 ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we like Earth already! Isn\u2019t that right darling?\u201d Said Mr. Perodia, his own tone brightening as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSure do!\" Mrs. Perioda took a second looking briefly around Earth landscape, the orange leaves, the blue sky, it was so breathtakingly different. More importantly...\"Anyone that can look after our Meitty is fine by us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo.... what exactly is going to happen?\u201d asked Tom sensing that things were going to get very different very fast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the way I see it, we have a few options\u2026\u201d Said Mr. Perodia now feeling quite casual here he slipped into his persuasive and articulate ship-salesman voice. \u201cOnce we take Vortia and Meitty back home, and we say Meitty sent a distress beacon from a planet she\u2019d crashed on, we immediately picked her up, and she had no human interfering at all. Then we let The Galactic Federation oversee everything from there, they meet with your planets leaders, and let them sort out the negotiations from there. Then once the Feds give us the okay, we all meet together again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy that would take <u>FOREVER</u>. It took you forever just to explain it!\u201d whined Meitty as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, sweetie\u2026\u201d came the soothing tones of her mother. \u201cThe Council can be a bit sterile and drab but they eventually make the right choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d offered Meitty raising her voice a bit. \u201cI was thinking\u2026maybe Tom could come back with us?\u201d asked Meitty hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Earthling boy?\u201d asked Mr. Perioda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sure Dad, I mean, he <i>does </i>know Earth better than anyone else outer space\u2026 Plus I kinda <u>love </u>him\u2026\u201d said Meitty bringing her hands together in a syrupy sweet manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Meitty I don\u2019t know if-\u201c began her father, nervous at what possible outcomes he\u2019d have to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more sweetie.\u201d Meitty\u2019s mom said cutting in and deciding for the two of them. This Tom boy might have to answer a few questions in front of The Galactic Federation  but just the idea of the two of you together just makes me so happy I could...\u201d she caught herself and tried to not sound so excited as she started speaking again. \u201cI mean that is if Tom <i>wants </i> to go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's life had already become an adventure, and his series of choices had all led him up to this moment, but this was the most important choice he might ever make...</span></div></div>",

A million thoughts were racing through his head, his heart thumping, would he, could he really do it? Go to space! More than that, go farther than any Earthling\u2019s every gone before? It was the chance of a lifetime, no, a billion lifetimes everyone on Earth who\u2019d ever looked up in the sky and wondered if there was ever anybody else out there in the vast space above\u2026 But speaking of lifetimes and everyone on Earth\u2026Maybe it would be better if he just stayed here on Earth with Jerri. Tom felt like he really wasn\u2019t exactly the best example of the human race. Maybe his dad should go, or wait, nobody had to go, he could just stay here and let each of their governments work things out as Mr. Perioda had suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you Meitty...\u201d Tom finally breathed as he uttered his decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright son!\u201d said Tom\u2019s father with an agreeable hand on his sons shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tom.

Oh thank faith!\u201d said Voirta darting towards them and away from the car. \u201cMind if I take these?\u201d she asked holding two long black tablet like devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re a bit outdated but why would you need to take them?\u201d asked Mr. Perodia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh yeah I forgot to mention\u2026\u201d began Vortia letting a finger curl one of her curly red locks as she trailed off. \u201cMeitty and I were talking...and...well I decided to stay here on Earth\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Jerri her eyes bulging a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat!\u201d echoed Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah. I mean, like, if the Parker\u2019s are willing to have me\u2026\u201d Vortia turned and offered up an innocent smile toward her human house-owners.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sure, you\u2019re the best plumber and electrician in the whole state.\" said Mr. Parker. \"You all are always welcome, but...Why? Don\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know\u2026It\u2019s sort of like when two races would betroth each other\u2019s prince and princes to ensure peace between their planets.  In a way it\u2019s the same thing with an Earthling on our planet and a Metaliaen on Earth\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Vortia?\u201d said a skeptical sound Meitty complete with an arch of her eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVortia remained silent before finally blurting\u2026 \u201cOkay! So, Really, I just want to be the most popular girl around when everyone see Earth culture!\u201d she said with an exasperation. \"When everyone else shows up, I\u2018m going to be soooo popular. \u201cHuman\u2019s yeah, I know everything there is to know about them. Great race of people.\u201d There was a shared a glance between Vortia and Jerri that thankfully Mr. and Mrs. Parker didn\u2019t catch\u2026. \u201cBut then I\u2019m going to be like Earth, been there done that, got the t-shirt. No offense...\u201d  She added with a grin. \u201cPlus, now that I have a firggen one of these babies!\u201d she booted up one of the devices she'd retrieved from the Periodia's space sedan and took a picture of herself and nodded approvingly that the device did work. \u201cNow that we finally have some tech that actually works beyond Earth\u2019s plasma sphere, I\u2019ll be set for all my cosmic communication needs. I figure won\u2019t be too hard to switch it over to charge on Earthling\u2019s alternating current sockets. It\u2019ll feel just like home\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome\u2026\u201d Meitty uttered suddenly a bit under her breath at the word. She really, really, had missed it. Just the word was enough to give her a quiver of dreamy homesickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, not to ruin the moment or anything but like I said before...kinda not supposed to be here.\u201d Added Mr. Parker noticing Meitty\u2019s melancholy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hell son better get packing!\u201d said Mr. Parker clapping his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father\u2019s right! It\u2019s not every day you get to go offered a trip to an alien planet. Just be sure to bring plenty of clean underwear\u2026\u201dsaid his mother giving him a swift swat on his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMooomm seriously? School was enough but now you\u2019re embarrassing me in front of people from another planet!\u201d  Said Tom turning red. <br>\r\nThe teasing was enough to put everyone in a fit of laughs, a parent\u2019s love for their child effortlessly crossing all inter-species culture barriers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div></span></div></div>",

Jerri and Vortia explained to the Parkers that such a trip to Meitty\u2019s home planet wouldn\u2019t take nearly as long as the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Hmm\u2026\" said Vortia as she finished counting figures in her head. \"Given reflationary space time distillation along with Council hauling one of their cruisers through here, I figure it\u2019d be the equivalent of\u2026An Earth week?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s-that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d lauded Mr. and Mrs. Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019d been even shorter if they decide to bridge the superhighway out this way\u2026.\u201d Said Vortia continuing on. Later, while the Parker\u2019s were listening as  the Perioda\u2019s explaining their whole side of the events to each other, Jerri had caught a glimpse of Tom from the corner of her eye, waving for her to come back into the Parker household with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Jerri, I just wanted to talk to you.\u201d Tom began immediately as the door shut behind Jerri. \u201cEverything\u2019s happening so fast, I just wanted to know\u2026\u201d he looked solemnly from his two suitcases, back to Jerri, \u201cDo you think I made the right choice to go with Meitty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tom, I think it\u2019s awesome!\u201d said Jerri eyes bright with sparks of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tom asked turning to her \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026You\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d Perplexed had become quite the common look on Tom\u2019s face today, now was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, it makes sense to me.

They\u2019d both talked about something like this happening before in wispy day-dreamy conversations over the summer but, now that it was actually here....Well...Jerri was putting on her damnedest to make this as painless as possible; he\u2019d better keep his own composure \u201c...Did you mean know in the <i>biblical </i> sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShut up you jerk..hah\u2026I\u2019m trying to be serious here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026I know\u2026I\u2019m just\u2026kind of scared\u2026 you know\u2026Kind of nervous but excited too? I mean who knows what\u2019s going to happen\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all so exciting....And I can\u2019t wait to hear all about it\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yeah</i>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I mean, it\u2019s going to be weird having to keep things a bit of a secret for a tiny while longer, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not gonna\u2019 stop talking to your Mom and Dad either. Vortia\u2019s here so we\u2019ll have a way to keep in touch. Plus this way I can go over my notes, and we\u2019ll see has the exclusive first big exclusive on the new Metaltian species. Me! My name in lights, television interviews, by then I\u2019ll be probably too busy swimming in big bucks to even talk to you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Jerri. Seriously though we\u2019ll...uh\u2026\u201ddrive\u201d back just as soon as thing get settled on Metaltian...You know that. And I promise I\u2019ll give you the interview of a lifetime!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026know\u2026I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, or even exactly when you\u2019ll be back. I know things have all gotten crazy...But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.  I mean it\u2019s not like I DON\u2019T 100% trust you with the fate of the Earth and all, but I figure with Meitty on your side you can\u2019t mess it up\u2026too much.\u201d They both shared another short laugh, before their eyes locked on each other once more. \u201cI mean that\u2019s sort of why I was attracted to you in the first place\u2026your kind\u2026sweet\u2026your gentle.\u201d Jerri could feel her eyes welling up a bit. \u201cFuck, why is this so hard for me\u2026Tom, you know, we both sorta knew something like this was gonna happen.\u201d In an expert manner she grabbed him and brought him in close. *<b>Kiss</b>*  \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine. I know you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if your big brains think I can do it. Then hey, I don\u2019t think anything can scare me.\u201d The two shared a few minutes in one last long embrace, savoring the moment and the passion they each had for each other. The moment could have lasted forever if not for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTom-Turkey!\u201d cried his dad from just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that sounds like Meitty's parents are getting rearing to go...\" said Jerri, backing up slowly before finally breaking from Tom's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Jerri...To the stars and back...\" said Tom before bringing her in for one more kiss. Jerri melted, hearing those words and into his kiss one last time for who knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div></span></div></div>",

Rhodium Perioda was nervously checking the Metalean equivalent of a watch as he hurriedly finished talking with Tom's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate to cut this moment short, but if we're going to do this we've got to go now...\" he explained looking to Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been wonderful to meet you humans, we really must meet again the first moment we can.\" added Ruthenium Perioda as she thanked Tom's parents a final time before heading to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make us proud son.\" said Mr. Parker giving his son a solemn nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome kids go backpacking around Europe when the reach College age. Mine gets to go to an alien planet. Somehow I blame your father for this.\u201d added Louise Parker, tearing up a bit but keeping her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, Mom\u2026I love you too.\u201d Said Tom taking each of them in for one last hug that would have to last him a while. Then, suddenly the entire family was embraced by a pair of fat flabby arms. Meitty, had come in for a hug for her two carbon based life form caretakers. \"I...I love you too.\" she said choked up as they embraced. \"...Thank you for putting up with me..Thank you for everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually even that hug eventually ended and Tom and the Perioda's climbed into the space sedan and made sure every detail was taken care of. With that the engine roared to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, I sincerely can not thank you enough for your daughter.\u201d Said Mr. Perioda opening the hatch door to the Space Sedan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, We\u2019ll take utmost care of your son.\u201d added Mrs. Perioda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d said Mrs. Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the backseat Meitty was finishing her chat with Vorita \"Hey, don't get too cool for me here on Earth. At least have time for a talk when we get back to Metalean Galaxy. I want to talk to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will.\" assured Vorita. \"And I might not be able to catch up with everyone else in the galaxy just yet... Well, I know I have at least one person on Earth here who likes me...well you know <u>REALLY </u>really likes me\" added Vortia her eyes darting quick to Jerri who was saying her final goodbyes to Tom. \"Besides I got to make sure the Galactic Federation doesn't do anything too crazy. Sure, I'll have to make up some story about crash landing here minutes before they got here, but that's only if they find me...Which they won't.\" she added with a wink and wave of her orb pierced antenna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile from just outside of the front driver-seat Tom\u2019s father was searching for the right words. \u201cWe\u2026uh\u2026look forward to the future between our two planets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs do I John Parker of Earth\u201d sharing a father to father nod with Tom\u2019s dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd uh-well-shoot we\u2019d love to have you over for dinner!\u201d added Mrs. Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm an interesting proposition as well.\u201d Noted Mr. Perioda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeitty will have to tell me more of this dinner and food concept.\u201d chimed Mrs. Perioda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026until then\u2026 May you live long and prosper.\u201d Finished Mr. Parker, patting himself mentally on the back for his quick and excellent choice of words, it took all he could to not do the traditional Star-Trek Vulcan hand salute as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d said Mr. Perioda approvingly. \u201cAn excellent phrase Earthling. May you also \u2018Live long and prosper.\u2019\u201d Tom gave his dad thumbs up from the back seat, which his father goofily returned. The vehicles engine roared to life, and Tom felt his stomach drop a bit as he realized they were beginning to levitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you!\u201d Tom said over and over again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when we get there!\u201d he assured his family waving as hard he could! So the ship was higher than the roof of his house, his parents, Vortia, and Jerri smaller and smaller versions of themselves standing on his front lawn waving all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell are you two ready?\u201d asked Mr. Perioda, seconds from engaging the hyperspace drive. The two shared a glance then nodded. It was a perfect lift-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty turned and gazed at Tom then out the window, now truly no longer stranded or earthbound. What were the chances that in all that black vastness of space she\u2019d ended up on this blue planet, and on top of that what were the odds she\u2019d meet such a kind and hunky Earth male?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFricking Faith! Faith\u2026 Well, she\u2019d certainly had a happy turn around having gone from one of her worst days ever, to now officially a planet discoverer, yep, she could live with that. She wouldn\u2019t even brag about it to her friends\u2026that much. She would show off her now \u201cvery very close\u201d exotic Earthling boyfriend, oh and her new Earth transformed body too. OH! And tell of all the wonders of Earth foo-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFricken faith!\u201d said Meitty aloud suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Meitty?\u201d asked Tom with a sense of urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe f-f-orgot food!?\u201d said Meitty her face down-turned into the deepest pout ever. How could she go back to food pills now!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Well, I certainly didn\u2019t.\u201d said Tom, finally his turn to put on a braggish tone in his voice. \u201cI maybe happened to sneak in some twonkies, and of course a Tupperware of chili\u2026You\u2019ll have to ration it a bit but- <b>Geze<i>mmhn</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeitty\u2019s full face had met his at full force for an impactful succulent kiss. \u201cOh, Tom have I told you lately how much I love you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was going to say it\u2019s nice you\u2019re thinking more about your family over food\u2026\u201d He added, \u201cbut I just guess it means will just be heading back to Earth with more storage next time... Until then I think the both of us can make it together? What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTogether.\u201d Agreed Meitty firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both watched as the pale blue dot that housed the entire human race shrank and shrank behind them, till finally it was out of sight. Tom and Meitty squeezed each others hands in the backseat of the car, ready for all the excitement that awaited them, not just when they arrived on Metlanium, or returned back to Earth, but for all the rest of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><div align=\"center\">The End</div></span></span></div></div>",

She is groggy from sleep, and starts to drfit off. She suddenly realizes that her belly is bugger than she remembers. She opens her eyes and looks at it, a green hill of flesh. She rubs it, trying to guess how much bigger it is. She gropes, prods, shakes, and smacks her belly, watching to fast ripple and shake. She shifts, lying on her back, staring at the trio of mounds before her. Her breasts push against her double chin, a vast canyon of cleavage smooshed together by her shirt. After her swollen breats is the real champion, a stomach that towers above her as she looks at it. It rises and falls as she breathes, and it quivers and ripples with every move she makes. She puts a hand on each side, gently squeezing it, then quickly releases, making it wobble and shake.

Don't worry, she's generally pretty angloid. It's okay if you think she's hot. You decide where she crashes, the kind of people she meets, and in turn the kind of person(?) she becomes. Add your own chapters, your own characters, and more importantly your own ideas to help make your own alien fat-girl fantasy come true~!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...With a few simple rules.<br>\r\n1.) This is a straight-up weight gain story and I'd prefer to keep it that way. <br>\r\n2.) That being said, try to make our little alien heroine's gain believable? I realize its an alien story, but let's not have her gain more than a pound in a sitting okay?<br>\r\n3.) She's stranded. Completely and totally. This means no home planet technology. It's fine if, after a while, she stumbles across something that isn't totally destroyed in the wreckage. But she can't start off with anything more than the clothes on her back.<br>\r\n4.) Add. And add right. None of this two sentence garbage, really put some thought into your additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, I don't think there's anything much else left to say other than have fun taking our sweet little heroine crashlanding into obesity. I wish you all well and hope you enjoy this interactive~</td>",
