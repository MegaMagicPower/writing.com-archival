Although he loved his TARDIS, he knew full well that it could be very tempromental at times. He had just returned to present day Earth with his faithful companion  Rose Tyler following an adventure in 1950s London that involved a face-eating television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, the Powell Estate. See, I told you we'd get here\" The Doctor laughed. Rose giggled. She knew by now that it was down to pure luck whether they actually arrived where they wanted to go or not. She had been enjoying her time with the Doctor but she hadn't visited her mother in a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd love a big reunion, I've got to pop off quickly\", the Doctor said. \"The TARDIS needs refueling so I'm going to pop to the rift and fill up. I'll come back tomorrow and pick you up.  And then, we'll go to the planet Astor IV, where the Sky is constructed out of emeralds. How does that sound?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing\" replied Rose, as she exited the blue box. It seemed that the planets she visited with The Doctor continued to get better and better. It was almost a pain to leave they're lifestyle of finding new civilisations and fighting clockwork robots and Slitheen, but Rose did want to see her mum. After all, her old life seemed distant since she began her travels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of trouble!\" called Rose to the Doctor. The Time Lord grinned as he fiddled about with the controls. <br>\r\n\"Now where's the fun in that?\" he replied as he set off. The TARDIS began to wheeze and groan as Rose began to walk towards her flat. She was finally back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Previously, he would have been stuck in the Welsh capital for 24 hours whilst his ship recharged, but as the Rift had been active recently, he could recharge the TARDIS in about two hours. This was ideal as it meant he could quickly pop off on a test run before picking up Rose the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, Allons-y!\",  yelled the Doctor as the TARDIS locked on to the Rift and began to land. At first, things seemed normal but then, the cloister bells began to chime, which the Doctor knew was bad news. He kept forwards and checked the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he cried as the TARDIS began to judder violently and groan.  The Doctor stumbled backwards. \"I must be stuck in a Time Eddy!\" he shouted as he tried to regain control. Time Eddy were a rare occurrence. In fact, this was only the second occasion in which the Doctor was trapped in one, the first instance being when his fourth incarnation was trapped due to a time scoop gone wrong. However, the Doctor knew he could still escape. He quickly flicked some levers and glanced at the monitor. \"Come on old girl, let's calm down a minute, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled another lever as the TARDIS began to dematerialise again, locking onto it's last location, the Powell Estate. The Doctor looked on with relief as the cloister bells stopped chiming and everything seemed to settle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. I'll have to give it a rest but I think we're OK for now.\" He ran to the chair and picked up his long brown coat before racing outside the spaceship, not realising that the monitor showed that the Time Eddy forced him six months into the future. </span></div></div>",

Usually, there would be plenty of people bustling about, going about their business. However, it looked more like a ghost town that a council estate in the heart of London. He also noticed the large amount of litter scattered around the place, in particular fast food packaging such as burger wrappers, fired chicken buckets and large Pepsi bottles. The Doctor stared at the mess inquestitively, not noticing any of this earlier on. He quickly opens the door to the block of flats and paces up the stairs, noticing it was equally messy inside the building too, indicated that the rubbish hadn't been cleaned out for weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor soon reached Rose's door and briskly knocked on it but received no reply. Impatient as he was, the Doctor decided died to open the locked door using his sonic screwdriver which whirred as it completed the task. The Doctor stepped into the front room, finding it in an extremely similar state to the outside of the building. It was littered with pizza boxes, drink cans, wrappers and more, with the floor barely visable beneath the clutter. The bemused Doctor then headed towards one of the other rooms. </span></div></div>",

He wandered around for a moment, aware of the large array of odors that the room was producing. He picked up a half drunken bottle of Pepsi and decided to analyse it using his sonic. He pointed his screwdriver at the bottle but found no suspicious readings as a result. \"What's going on here then?\" muttered the Doctor, knowing something was up. After all, Rose's mum Jackie was somewhat of a perfectionist and would never allow the flat to get so messy. The Doctor continued to ponder and suddenly he heard the front door open. It was quiet for a moment before the Doctor heard a loud noise that nearly burst his eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!\" cried an unknown figure from the other room, much to the Doctor's surprise. Then, the room began to shake violently as the figure moved across the flat and began to open the door to Rose's bedroom. The Doctor was frozen to the spot as the door burst open, as the figure emerged from the darkness. Suddenly, after a moment, The Doctor, still in shock managed to recognise who it was. </span></div></div>",

Rose who usually had a slim figure that most women would die for had ballooned. She looked like she now weighed about 350 pounds. Her cheekbones and enviable jawline had been replaced by extremely chubby cheeks and a large double chin that was slightly stained by some of the food she had been eating. Her breasts had expanded as well, now at least an Double D cup with Rose's hoodie struggling to contain them. Her arms were now very flabby and sported large love handles, which were useful in helping her carry vast quantities of food. Her tiny waistline had been replaced by a massive jiggling belly consisting of two large rolls, with the bottom on hanging out of her food stained goodies and over the waistband on her very tight jeans, with the button still manging to hold s despite Rose's massive girth. Her lifestyle of running with the Doctor was now well and truly over, with her huge thighs, wide hips ad almost 2 foot ass preventing her from running anywhere and she could barley waddle now. She was munching on a large portion of chips and chugging down a 2 litre bottle of Pepsi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was completely taken aback by his now obese companion. He swore he had only been away for a matter of minutes, but clearly by Rose's swelled form, he had been away for much longer than that. </span></div></div>",

It took a while, but he managed to find one, but it was really big. About a full foot and a half in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, ma'am,\" the clerk said to Amy, handing her the pie in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the pie with wide eyes. It wasn't out of shock about the size of it, though. It was out of shock that she was actually hungry enough for something that big. She was a little hesitant about eating it at first, but her hunger overruled any other sense in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was so hungry she even through aside all use of manners. She threw aside her fork, grabbed the pie from the clerk, and started eating it like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk himself was surprised that the redheaded woman in front of him so quickly rid herself of all reason and mannerism and started eating one his pies so quickly, and so messily. He knew she would probably want more, and he couldn't have her eating all his wares, so he crouched behind the counter and put up the closed sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy didn't notice, through. She was too busy gorging herself on the large meat pie. Surprisingly, she managed to make a total pig of herself, and not get a crumb of food anywhere but down her maw. She was so busy eating, that she didn't even realize how much she had eaten until she bit down and felt pain in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Amy said as she opened her eyes and saw that the big pie was gone, and she had taken a bite of her own hands. Sad that the meat pie was gone, she started licking her fingers to get the rest of the taste off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, however, Amy saw that she was slowly swelling a bit. Her eyes widened as her breasts grew two more cup sizes, causing a valley of cleavage to pop out of the top of her already too small shirt. Her breasts had grown to nearly a D cup, making her bra extremely uncomfortable and eclipsing the view of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then noticed a mirror nearby and looked at her reflection, seeing what other places she was growing in. Her stomach had swelled a bit more and stretched out her shirt. Said shirt was already having trouble covering her new breasts, so it rode up her bigger stomach until it uncovered her belly button. Her stomach had grown enough to make her look six months pregnant, but couldn't stop jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned to the side to see where else she was growing. Her butt was sticking out more, and she had to hold back a gasp. It was now a ghetto booty that was stretching her short skirt tight. She could actually hear seems popping as her ass finally stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new weight was evenly distributed across her body as her cheeks were softer, her thighs now rubbed together and stretched her leggings, her hips widened to support her butt, and she had a double chin forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked down at her new, larger body, figuring she now weighed about 160 pounds. She looked at how much chunkier she was with a look of...</span></div></div>",
