She has beautiful emerald green eyes and has a violet tail and wings that are dragon-like in appearance.  She can produce an icy snow like breath from her mouth by using her pure bred draconian genetics.  She stands at a height of 5'3\", has a D-cup chest and is 30 years old, though due to her genetics she still looks like she's in her late teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNazza is a girl with medium length dark brown hair that comes down to the bottom of her shoulder blades.  She has pale green eyes and an F-cup chest.  Nazza stands at about 5'6\" and looks to be about 26 years old.

Quite slim and very attractive, wearing azure tube shirt that shows her cleavage and belly button and an azure mini skirt that match with her azure ballet flats.  She has long maroon hair that goes down on her back with bangs between her emerald eyes. Often friendly and mischievous, but gets easily angered when people try to look up her skirt.  Has an artefact ring on her finger that can be set to shrink people to really small sizes for a predetermined period of time or until she cancels the effect.</span></div></div>",

Not much later, Elita began to feel her wings cramping up from being pressed against the back of the chair for so long. Sighing, the dragoness decided to take a quick break form her studies. Standing up, Elita stretched out her violet wings and allowed them to spread across almost the half the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elita began to turn around, however, her wings accidentally knocked into Nazza's shelf of potions. While her human roommate didn't have any special powers like her, Nazza was a genius when it came to using the potion-mixing machine. The device worked by combining all sorts of various chemicals together and fusing them into a liquid form with a powerful electrical charge. Nazza was able to use it make potions to do just about anything, and always kept a few bottles of her favorite ones on the shelf in her room. As Elita's wing slapped the shelf, the entire thing began to shake. Within mere moments, Elita found herself soaked by several of the potions that fell from the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Elita could even react to the mysterious mixture, she felt a bizarre tingling sensation flowing through her entire body. She didn't even know what was happening at first, but soon she realized the reality of her situation: the mixture of so many different potions falling on her at once was causing her body to grow at an alarming rate! Elita immediately ran to her dorm room's window and jumped outside, using her wings to land safely after leaping from the 3rd floor of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was outside, Elita's growth rate exploded. She was growing entire feet by the second, and by the time the worried dragoness finally stopped growing, she had reached an amazing height of...</span></div></div>",

She was now scrunched up in the dorm room and felt something wriggling about under her foot that had ripped free from Nazza's sock.  Down by her feet were a pile of Elita's clothes and Nazza smirked a little as she put her feet down either side of the squirming object.  To Nazza, the shrunken figure looked about 15-16\", but in truth Elita had shrunk to half her height and was about 2' 7 or 8\" tall.  It would've been better if she could've had her clothes grow with her, but it was fun to play around with the tiny girl at her feet.  Elita probably had no idea what was going on as Nazza rubbed one foot casually across the top of the smaller girl's squirming dress.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Nazza fiddled about with the device enough she managed to get a holographic display to pop up from the bracelet.  It was a list of instructions on how the bracelet could be used, even as a means to swap a male and females anatomic sizes to switch genders.  Clothes could be shrunk or grown with the people if a certain option was selected and other features were available, changing the sizes of specific body parts.  A woman could effectively steal another woman's bust if she so desired, though she wouldn't be able to steal the bust of a male unless they had a big enough pair of man boobs.  It was funny though, because it was possible to give a man a bust and still keep yours providing it was big enough.  Everything was percentage based, you lost a percentage, they gained a percentage and vice-versa.  Aside from that, the only other thing was a note on the locking.  The device could be locked around a person to prevent them from removing it, in fact the device wouldn't operate without being locked.  This allowed for a registration of the participant since the bracelet shouldn't be removed during shrink or growth.  If the participant was too small to see the collar could be resized to fit them and transported to their location.  The bracelet always locks to the wielder when in use so there is no issue regarding the control bracelet.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...interesting.\"  Nazza mused.  \"Let's see...\"</span></div></div>",

Considered a \"quiet prodigy\" by many, it was perfectly understandable that he wished to work alone, and people were used to letting him have the lab on his own. Of course, some of this work could have been done at home, but his home lab was, unfortunately, not as well equipped as the one he was located now. He had been working on this project for months, almost a year even. Experiments had been tough, and it hadn't been a few times that things went wrong and he had almost injured himself. But finally, the moment he had been waiting for had come. It was complete. The teen raised a silver ring that held a crimson gem. He inspected it from each side, almost momentarily mesmerized by the glow of the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mass...chanelling the energies around us using a focal point, this ring specifically, the power one could obtain over mass is near infinite. Making something heavier or lighter, or making something bigger or smaller...all those would be simple tasks with some practice. And the time for practice has come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen was elated and he finally put the ring in the index finger of his left hand. He knew that he had to establish physical contact with the object he wanted to affect, so he proceeded to touch a chair. He closed his eyes, concentrated and focused on what he wanted to happen. Then, with a brief crimson flash, right before his eyes, the chair became smaller, as if it was a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alive!!!!! Well....okay, wrong exclamation, but the point was made\" he chuckled and lifted the chair. He then tried to destroy it in various ways, but it proved very difficult. It had become much more durable, just as he had predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how it would work on something alive though.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleaned the mess of the lab a bit, hid the small chair and left the lab, looking for a willing (or not) test subject. Little did he know that fate is a whimsical mistress, and he might be the one who would be tasting the fruits of his hard work....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span class=\"cmagenta\">This is a story involving the people I know of who are into growth and shrink fantasies.  The story is set in an alternate Earth where science discovered how magic and spiritual energy functioned.  Not everyone in the world knows the truth about magic, but those who do have managed to craft magitech devices that allow them to harness the power of magic for their own benefit.  This story follows one of the people I know and their encounter with such a device or devices that were designed with specific ideas in mind.  (please try and keep in the theme of shrinking/growth or transformation and stick to the purpose that a device has once it is in place)</span></td>",
