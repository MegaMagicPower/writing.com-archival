Having left Nord to his own devices, the city has granted Button &amp; Braille the titles of Honorary Adventurers and Watchers in Training. Receiving medals for their bravery and resilience, the two have now settled into the peaceful life of upstanding citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut \"peaceful\" is not a word that's in Button's vocabulary! The young adventurer is always looking for new and exciting mysteries to solve.

Never found without her handy slingshot and bags of button ammunition, she is more than willing to take on any opponent that crosses her path. Trouble seems to follow this young blonde adventurer, but luckily, so does her good friend, Braille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Braille</b> - quiet and reserved, there's much mystery surrounding this 16 year old and his past. Button discovered the boy's strange connection to the evil genius Nord, being Braille's long lost father, but has kept his secret to herself. Braille has taken to following Button around and is never without his odd baton, in case they should come upon any unexpected foes. He showed his skills at fighting in the tunnels beneath Silver City, but that too has been kept a secret between the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add!
