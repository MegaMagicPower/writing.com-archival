I'm just totally spacing okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay!\" Jared chirps. He laughs good-naturedly, scratching his blond, scruffy hair in a way you find curiously endearing. You would feel weird that an adolescent kid who looks like he's in seventh or eighth grade is trying to impress you by acting suave and striking curious poses, but that would only be if you ignored the equal weirdness of the fact that you are standing eye-to-eye with him, at least half a foot shorter than you used to be. Plus it's hard for you to judge while you're still taking in the young girl's body that you've ended up in, tan, slender and with only the faintest breast buds forming underneath the triangle-shaped pink bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind,\" you say, forcing yourself to smile. \"I need to go to the bathroom right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure!' says Jared. \"Go ahead. I hope you're all right.\" His tone and posture changes accordingly, going from jovial and lively to tense and concerned. You wave it off, affecting a painfully high giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine,\" you say. \"Just give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he says, but you're already turned around before the word has left his mouth, walking as fast as you can with your short legs and tiny, bare feet. You almost walk into the men's restroom by mistake, but you course-correct at the last minute, saving yourself a world of embarrassment and awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not even tantalized by the presence of other half-dressed woman, some high school classmates you've crushed on, others older and also drop-dead gorgeous. You beeline straight towards the mirror, and are disturbed when you find that your chest barely rises above the sink, and you have to lift your toes slightly to get a full look of yourself. You are an adolescent girl, all right, in middle school, it looks like, short, not yet in the deepest stages of puberty, with her brown hair, hazel eyes, and full lips, fairly indistinguishable from many other middle-school girls you've seen in your neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl now,\" you think, \"My name is Jenna, and I'm on a date with a boy name Jared.

Trying to act as naturally as possible, you creep back out of the bathroom and to the swimming pool. The thought crosses your mind that you could give Jared the slip and hightail it out of there, but Jared spots you the moment you walk out of the bathroom, and is heading over like he's about to swoop you off your feet and hoist you on top of a white stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenna!\" he says. \"Feeling better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you say slowly. \"Although I think the sun is starting to get to me a little bit. I might want to get out of here in a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay!\" he says, rolling with the punches, not looking the slightest bit disappointed or surprised. \"Yeah. Let me just call my mom and we can go back to my house, maybe, hang out a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure...\" you say, not sure whether it would be polite to turn him down, since you have no idea what other options you have besides entrusting yourself to this over-eager grade-school Romeo. Apparently, Jared wasn't expecting you to say yes to going back to his house, because his bashful grin turns into outright beaming, and he's off to one of the lawn chairs to grab his cell phone and call his mom, leaving you momentarily to collect yourself and assess the situation before you get too deep into anything you don't want to be in.</span></div></div>",

You recognize most everyone who's still at the pool as people who were there when you first arrived, back when you were a guy (how long ago was that? only five minutes?). The familiar faces provokes a question in the front of your brain, which you hold onto only for another second before another sight all but answers it wholesale:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, swimming in the middle of the pool, going about his business like nothing happened, is your old body, exactly as you left it. Same swim trunks and anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to yell something, but what do you say? Call out your own name? Yell, \"Hey, you, the one who stole my body!\"? That would be ridiculous! You <i>want</i> to say something, but after a few seconds' observation, it becomes clear to you that your old body is not acting like a thirteen-year-old girl would upon finding herself as a teenage boy, even one who facilitated the shift of her own accord. He moves like you, pulling himself up to the edge and hoisting himself onto the dry ground, going to his towel (where you left it) and drying himself off, checking his phone... There's nothing in his behavior or choices to suggest even the slightest divergence from what you yourself would be doing if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich can only mean one thing. Your heart plummets. You became this little girl, and reality around you changed so nobody would be the wiser for it. Your old life would go on as if you were living it, only you weren't living it. You were here, going by the name Jenna, having to deal with the latter-half of a potentially disastrous first date, and that's all before you have any idea of where your home is, what your personal life is like, who your friends are, and so on, and so on. If you could right then (and you were of a more melancholic disposition), you would throw yourself into the pull and hold your head underwater until you drowned. The prospect of your new life is so huge and terrifying.</span></div></div>",

It's just me!\", and does another facsimile of a charming boy pop star's smile, before telling you that his mom is on her way, she will be there in just a few minutes, and the two of you should move over to the parking lot to wait for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, you're conflicted. You look back at your old body, which is currently yawning in a very unattractive way and scratching its mop head of hair. Should you leave right now, when you've just seen yourself? Shouldn't you approach your old body and try your damnedest to facilitate a reverse change, even if you don't exactly know how to? Again, you notice how utterly you, to the point of repulsion, your old body is behaving, and your heart sinks at the realization that you are the only person who notices anything amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't mean, you remind yourself, that there is no hope of you ever changing back. It might take a while; you might have to wait around until another freak occurrence happens somewhere down the road, another day at the swimming pool, or somewhere else. You don't know. But for now, your best bet is to stick with Jared and understand the hand that you've been dealt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your stuff on the lawn chair right next to Jared's. Pulling together everything into your butterfly-decorated handbag (you see a phone peeking out, plus lots and lots of cosmetics), and wrapping the towel over your shoulder, you slip on Jenna's flip-flops and follow Jared out of the swimming pool. Unfortunately for you, Jenna didn't come with her clothes on hand, so you'll have to weather being in just a bikini for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only a minute or two's wait before Jared's mom shows up at the curb and ushers the two of you into the backseat, saving you the idle chit-chat, which would be impossible for you to sustain anyway. Jared's mom looks like a fuller-faced version of her son. She says, \"Hi!\", waves at you, and asks how was your time at the swimming pool. Jared chips in, saying that you got ill near the end, but all in all, it was just the bee's knees (not his exact words). His mom nods, smiling all the while, and says she's so sorry you're feeling sick. Would you like her to take you home? You catch a glance of Jared before you give your answer. Everything in his eyes is asking you to please say no; please come home with him for the afternoon, and despite having no attachment to Jared romantically or even platonically, you feel sorry for him, for crashing what might have been a pretty okay date...</span></div></div>",

If she's coming down with something, it's better that we drop her off at her house. You guys can hang out another time when she's feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jared sulks in his corner of the backseat. You place a hand on his knee, your attempt at assuring him that everything's all right with him and Jenna. He looks over at you and manages a valiant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get together another time this week,\" you say, not at all sure if you (or Jenna) means it or not. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Jared says. \"I had a lot of fun today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" you say, and are startled by how demure and adorable you make those two words sound.

She drives you directly there. It's only five minutes from the swimming pool, which puts it not too much farther away than where your old house is. You recognize the neighborhood, a forested, unincorporated part of your town where you used to live when you were much younger, and where several of your high-school friends still live. The car pulls up in front of a duplex, and for a moment, you can't remember if this is the same duplex you grew up in, or a few houses down from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the car, glad to escape from the over-compensating A/C that Jared's mom put on. It's a muggy, mid-August day with hardly any wind. There are clouds moving in from the west that promise rainfall sometime later in the evening. A man walks by on the sidewalk with his golden retriever. He shoots you a quick, friendly glance, and you immediately wrap your arms around yourself. You feel more uncomfortable now, standing on a residential street in nothing but a bikini. You feel immensely out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared gets out of the car too and, like a true gentleman, escorts you to your door, his fingers brushing against your elbow. \"I'll see you Monday at school,\" Jared says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"I'll see you on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what Jared is waiting for: a kiss, a hug, something romantic. Since his mom is over in her car, watching you, you settle with a platonic kiss on a cheek and a hand-squeeze, which you hope is enough to sate his appetite. Again, Jared's cheeks go as red as tomatoes, and he's practically skipping as he goes back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, glad to have gotten the overeager, over-fawning Jared off your back. The question is, though, how you get inside now. Jared, gratefully, led you to the door to the left apartment of the duplex, so it's safe for you to assume this is the one where you live. You might have a pair of keys in your purse. If not, you can always ring the doorbell. Is anybody home, though? Without Jared, there's a lot that you have to figure out on your own without anyone helping you. You look over your shoulder and see Jared and his mom pulling out of the driveway, but slowly enough that they can make sure you get inside safely. You wave at them, smiling, then return your gaze to the door. What to do?</span></div></div>",

You're not sure, at any rate, if Jenna's parents or any of her family are home. The parking lot is empty, and the garage (separate from the duplex) is closed. Whether there's a car inside of it, you have no way of knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes a few seconds, gratefully, to sift through Jenna's stuff until you stumble upon a key that's very obviously meant for the door to her house. You pull open the outer glass door and, propping it with your back, insert the key into the main doorknob and give it a twist. You hear the door unlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank God,\" you think, as you give one last wave to Jared and his mom and go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like you were right when you figured that nobody else was home. The front hallway is completely dark. Aside from the obnoxious tick of a wall clock to your right and the faint grumble of the A/C, you can't hear anything or anyone. \"Hello?\" you call out, waiting to see if anybody around the corner comes out to greet you. Nobody does, so you throw off Jenna's flip-flops and venture further inside, towards the kitchenette and the hallway linking all of the apartment's rooms.</span></div></div>",

In between are doors leading to all of the other rooms, one of which must Jenna's bedroom. This is the room you are most interested in going into for the time being. Exploration can come later, but for now, you have spent more than enough time wearing a pre-teen girl's swimsuit. You need to find something that doesn't remind you so bluntly of the body you've been spirited into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you stumble upon Jenna's bedroom by trying the first door on the left of the hallway. You can tell it's hers because she has spelled out \"J E N N A\" in large sparkle letters glued to the wall above her bed. It is dusty, and messy, and you move to pull open the blinds before realizing that her room faces directly onto the driveway. If you open it up, someone outside might catch a sight of you changing. You decide to let your eyes acclimate to the shadows for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's very little else to remark upon about her room. Aside from spelling her name on the wall, Jenna didn't bother with too many other personalizing touches. The bed covers are a neutral, leaning-on-the-side-of-feminine violet, and the books you see lying willy-nilly on her work desk, around her laptop, are surprising choices for a 13-year-old girl--at least you would think so. Lord of the Rings and War of the Worlds and Terry Pratchett... It makes you reconsider your image of Jenna for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon throwing open the closet, you get a stark reality check, confirming that despite her idiosyncratic literary tastes, Jenna is still an adolescent girl, and her fashion taste more than reflects that. You paw through the stuff hanging on the hangars and flip through her drawers, in search of something that's vaguely akin to your men's clothing. Even something on the tomboyish side. No luck. The jeans you find are all capris or sparkly-hemmed, shorts barely cover your thighs and look to be extra tight around the butt, and skirts, dresses, tube tops, halter-tops, v-necks, and spaghetti straps dominate the majority of the space. You can cover yourself up, but you're still going to be reminded, no matter what you wear, of the little girl you've become.</span></div></div>",

You nod, replying that you are sure that you are ok now.  \"Besides.  Nothing makes feel better than being with my boyfriend\" you say out loud.  While your face shows a lovesick young girl, in your head you are extremely embarrassed that you actually said that.  Regardless it looked like what you said cause Jared's face to both light up.  Oddly enough, seeing the young boy happy made you feel good.  You don't know why exactly, but you decided to scoot up a little closer to him and rest your still damp head on his shoulders.  Jared's face gets a little red.  His mom seems glad that you seem to be feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jared's mom starts the car, she 'reminds' you that you have a set of clothes in the back to change into when they arrive at his house.  You tell the mother Thanks as you continue the rest your head on your boyfriend's shoulders.  You don't know why you're acting all lovey dovey all of a sudden, maybe this is unconsciously an act or maybe you are doing it purely out of obligation,  One thing you know however is that right now Jared is the only part of Jenna's life, your new life, that you really know anything about - vaguely as it may be - and thus right now nothing is making you feel safer than being around Jared.  Soon you feel Jared place his arm behind you, seeming to be returning your little gesture by holding you in his arm.  You snuggle a little closer into Jared.  You mentally tell yourself that this is just an act from you to avoid suspicion even as Jared's mom comments on how adorable you two look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, the car is parked in front of what you presumed to be Jared's house.  You gather your things and the set of Jenna's clothes from the back before entering Jared's home.  You had to admit that it looked like a rather nice house.  Comfy, homey, but also big.  Jared's mom gives you directions to the nearest bathroom to change in while Jared comments that he thought you looked nice in a bikini.  You say thank you to the compliment, but in your head you know you would want nothing more than to cover your half-naked young body - though that almost meant you would have to undress....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you can go ahead and keep your swimsuit on underneath the clothes Jenna, just in case the two of you feel like swimming again later on\" the boyfriend's mom says.  While it did still technically meant having to stay in the bikini, you are a little relieved that you won't have to see Jenna's nude body just yet.  you are kind of surprised at the noting of going for another swim being brought up by the mother, but after looking through a bit of text messages on Jenna's phone (which was not password protected by the way) you figure that it made sense since this date was meant to be for the whole day.  Once you entered the bathroom, you slipped on the set of clothes that were provided to you over the bikini.  You look at yourself in the mirror.  You didn't take a good look at the clothes that had been offered to you before, and you see that your are wearing a light Katy Perry t-shirt and a pair of shorts.  Not too bad you thought to yourself, personally you would have preferred a plain t-shirt over a Katy Perry t-shirt but it was not the worse thing imaginable.  Now that this body was covered up in clothing, you decide to take a better look at yourself beyond just the face.  You had to admit that Jenna had a rather good figure for a middle school girl.  and now that you think about it your brown shoulder-length hair and facial features are doing the figure a lot of justice.  You are actually kind of admiring how you look.  You could see why a boy like Jared would want to go out with a girl like Jenna.  You could easily imagine that Jenna would have ended up being one of the more attractive girls once she hits high school.  However you also had to remind yourself that this was your body for the time being and that you are trying to find a way to return to your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out to the living room, you spot Jared who was sitting on the couch, wearing an Avengers t-shirt and still in his by-now dry swimsuit.  You of course decide to would be appropriate to sit next to him.  \"My Mom is going out for a bit to get us something to eat for lunch\" he tells you.  Come to think of it, you were starting to get a little hungry, so this news pleases you.  \"what do you have planned in the meantime\" you ask.  Jared suggests...</span></div></div>",

My parents just rented it for me recently but I don't think it would be you'd be interested in it\" from the tone of Jared's words, you kind of get the feeling he is playing reverse psychology - why mention the movie if he didn't think you'd - no wait, Jenna - would respond with -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"  you say, taking the dvd from Jared's hands to insert into the dvd player.  You plop back on the couch right next to Jared.  You were never all that into horror movies, namely because you never felt scared with any of them that you watched, but you didn't see the harm in watching this particular one.  This was simply to pass the time for until you found a way to get your body back; for now you would play the role of this young girl who just happened to have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the movie seemed as you would expect from every other horror film you had ever saw, with one particular exception - \"how old is this movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually not that old.  They just chose to make the movie black and white for some reason\" Jared explains - \"Also I didn't realize that this was in spanish with subtitles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.  I don't mind having to read a little\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed along with the movie - which you had to admit was very very strange.  And it only got stranger and stranger as it went along, unsettling you would say.  You didn't like where things were going with the characters in the movie, and you actually started to worry that maybe it wasn't just a movie.  There was then one scene, a rather disturbing scene, that made you jump and - <br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\" all of a sudden you found yourself clinging and burying into Jared's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's ok.  I'm here\" Jared tells you, freeing up his arm so that he could wrap it around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, stuff like this doesn't usually scare me\" you whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I gotcha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" you don't realize what you had just said until afterwards.  \"Oh god, why am I acting like this?\" you think to yourself.  Now that you think about it, you were acting very lovey dovery towards your boyfriend - wait no Jared - well of course he is Jared and he is your boyfr - \"Shit. Could it be that the longer I stay in this body the more I become like this Jenna?\" you wonder.  Now this was scary.  It was bad enough that you were stuck in the body of a young girl, but now there was the possibility that you were mentally becoming this young girl.  You were lost in these thoughts until you realized that the credits for the movie were rolling.  You look up at Jared's face, he seemed concerned about you, perhaps now wondering if maybe suggesting the movie was a mistake.  Before Jared could say anything you - </span></div></div>",

On the lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared, being an adolescent boy, of course kisses back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are screaming in your head, trying to stop yourself, but it was as though this body was on autopilot.  There was nothing you could do to help yourself as you continue to kiss Jared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the kiss, you are utterly mortified inside.  On the outside however, you are smiling gleefully from the kiss.  \"... that was my first kiss...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too babe\" Jared replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new body giggles and blushes, even though inside you are broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WTF DID I JUST DO?!?!?!\" you thought, \"and why am I acting all gleefully?\"  Was this new body really starting to take control?  Were you losing yourself?  Were you really turning into Jenna?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth \"want another one?\"  Wait no, that was not what you had meant to say.  But alas you were left helpless as this body you were trapped inside kisses the adolescent boy once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the voice of your boyfriend's mother, the two of you freeze.  And with that, you seem to regain control over yourself.  Thank god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long, the store was busier then usual.  What did y'all do while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jj.. just watched some tv Mom\" Jared replies.  His face was red, as was your's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lunch is ready\" Jared's mom lifted up sandwich stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting hungry too\" you say, your own words leaving your mouth again!  As you got up, you notice Jared look at you - silently pleading for another quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lucky to have regained control and you didn't feel like kissing a boy who was technically younger than you - even if you were now his age physically.  However you didn't want to raise suspicion so you mustered up all the courage you could - you smile and kiss your boyfriend on the cheek.  He seemed satisfied with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, Jared grabs hold of your hand and leads you to his room.  His mother makes sure to tell y'all to \"leave the door open\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the bedroom.  Jared seemed like a typical middle school boy from the looks of his room, into the typical stuff like the MCU and LOTR.  You bump into something on the floor.  You lift it up, but Jared doesn't seem to want you to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that's noth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww.  You look so cute\" you say in a cutesy voice, turning the photo book over to reva a photo of a 3 year old Jared making a mess with a cake.  Great, Jenna was taking control again it seemed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... private...\" Jared swipes the book, hiding it away.  You compose yourself as Jared hastily hides the photo book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been a guy before, you know what it's like to be in Jared's position.  Coming up from behind him, you whisper into his year \"let me tell you a little secret\".  Jared stops to listen as you lean onto him.  \"Girls like it when boys let their guard down\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" He asks curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.  You were kinda pulling shit out of your ass with that one, but at least it was you talking an not Jenna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches your attention.  \"Is that a GameCube?\" You point at an old console<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my Dad's.  He let me have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna try it out!\" You say, sitting yourself down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing babe\" Jared replies as he turns the console on.  The two of you play some Smash bros melee, playfullg trash talking eachother as you two switch between kicking the other's ass.  You can't help but feel very close to Jared right now - and that wasn't just the Jenna speaking.  You think that if you two had been brothers, or maybe even friends, you would have gotten along very well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever right now you were a girl, and he was your boyfriend.  And every second of bonding between you and Jared is a second where Jenna could take control over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that you think about it, this whole experience, along with Jared being your boyfriend, has made you question your own sexuality anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after a few rounds, Jared's mom comes in to tell you that your mom, or rather Jenna's Mom, was here to pick you up.  Jared helps you on your feet before kissing you again while his Mom wasn't looking.  You didn't know if this was Jenna or you actinf, but all you knew was that you didn't hesitate during the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you get the first glimpse of your apparent mother.  Soon you would probably be meeting your apparent family.  You were a little worried about meeting Jenna's family, mainly cause you still had no idea who Jenna was.  If your apparant family noticed you acting strange, or out of character for Jenna, they would start asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Jared.  You feel safer around him than you do your \"mother\".</span></div></div>",

You look up, amazed about how much taller she was than you.  Before you would probably be a good foot taller than her, but now as a 13 year old girl you were a good goot shorter than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you search around the house, gazing at anything that could tell you about Jenna.  From several photos you learn that Jenna has two younger sisters and an older brother.  They also have a dog - though that didn't require any photos to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop it\" you chuckle as the corgi licks your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still wearing your swimsuit underneath, right?\" Your \"mom\" asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you change into a fresh set of clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, scared even.  Regardless, you shyly tell your \"mom\" ok before heading to find your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily it was no hard to find your new room, since it was rather obvious whose was what.  Looking around your new bedroom, everything is pink, much to your dismay.  Looking in thr closet you see a mixture of girly attire - and more tomboyish wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what your \"mom\" said, you quickly pick out some clothes, and close your eyes as you undress and get dressed.  You look at the mirror, you had chosen a pink t-shirt and black short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to looking around the bedroom, you also spot a personal laptop, several books on a shelf, a Nintendo Switch.  You continue to gaze around until you spot something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be her diary\" you say aloud, picking up the diary.  You flop onto your new bed, opening up the diary to read.  You learn a little more about who Jenna was, how she was a bit of a book worm, how her older brother always pestered her.... how she and Jared had met and started dating.  Oddly enough, you found yourself the most engrossed in the entries that were about your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the page, only to see a blank page.  You see that you skipped a page, so you assume that you are able to read the final entry Jenna had ever written before this body swap.  Opening the page to read the entry, you find some rather interesting details<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>I am so sick of my life.  Sure I've made several friends and even a boyfriend, but there's all this pressure being placed on me by everyone just because I'm a girl.

All the girls at school, wven my so called friends constantly tease me for not having \"real boobies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst part is that my big brother constantly harrasses me and treats me like a pest.

You decide to look around yourself anyway in an attempt to see anything that remotely looks like it would belong to the real Sammi. You spot a braided purse with a floral pattern on it next to the lounger you awoke on. In addition, there's a light blue towel with the name \"Sammi Doherty\" written on it. You also find a pair of sunglasses, sandals, a colorful sarong and a white crop top with a flannel pattern on it. A pretty typical sense of fashion for a girl her age. In any other situation, you would've liked to see a girl wearing clothes like this with her midriff and legs exposed but confronted with the realization that this girl is now you makes you shiver with dread instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing 'your' things, you make your way to the changing rooms, careful not to walk into the men's room. There, you see many women of all ages in different stages of undressing. What would've normally been one of your wildest wet dreams is now just momentary view that you try your best to ignore considering the circumstances that you are in. Besides, you don't feel any excitement about this at all, actually. As you put the cloth over your bikini, you experience first hand how little skin it actually covers. You feel very unrestrained and you're actually somewhat relieved how light it is considering the temperatures today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why girls like wearing this stuff. It's actually kind of comfortable! I thought they only did it for the looks\" you discover. Your eureka moment gets interrupted pretty quickly though as it dawns on you that guys on the street might now think that you're the one wearing these clothes only to catch people's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghh...I gotta get out of here as quickly as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet up with Connor again. He leads you to his car with his hand uncomfortably placed on your hip. Speaking of, why do your hips sway like that when walking? You notice that your walk cycle feels different, weight shifting from one side to the other with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that annoying thought, you make your way to his car and you drive to a seemingly aristocratic suburb. He pulls up at a modern, white-tinted mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside, admiring the nouveau-style interior design as you are bombarded with yet another kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no one else is home right now and I thought we could watch a bit of Netflix before we have our late-afternoon fun. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOOOPE. You don't like the idea of \"afternoon fun\" at all. This is reflected in your facial expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you wanna do something else, of course-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate what to say to him next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It cuts straight to chase, shattering normal routine and playing with emotions, making a game of pain, surprise and discomfort. The lesson drove itself home particularly when your dad left five years earlier, and since then you made sure to remind yourself that similar life-changers can occur at any time and without provocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing prepared you for what has happened in the span of ten seconds, since you lazily thought, <i>Being another person would be fun,</i> through the startling black-out and the menacing whisper in your ear - \"From now on, you will understand Samantha Newport inside and out... forever!\" and ending with the abrupt return to consciousness. And here you are, out of the pool on a nearby blanket, no longer wet but all dry and baked by the sun, your vision a mess of cascading, blonde curls, the new, peculiar physique containing your mind itself restrained by a red pair of satin fabric. The lower half presses against emptiness and emphasizes a lack you've never felt before, and the other half holds your new, supple breasts. Lying on your back, you can't feel their heaviness, but you know as soon as you get up gravity will push down and you might topple over into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that reason, as well as shock and your inability to process the event, your failure to rationalize the innocence of the day--the people around you keep laughing and splashing, unaware of the magic in their midst--with the obvious reality you've been thrust into. If the voice spoke correctly you are now Samantha Newport, a senior at your high school, near the top of her class and divided between countless activities: newspaper, volleyball, jazz, drama, the list goes on and on. You have no desire to confirm this transformation further, with a mirror or whatever, so you lay there, eyes closed, pretending you're still in a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This could go on all day,</i> you think, but even misfortune has a schedule to keep. After at least another minute, a pair of wet, smacking footsteps--straight from the pool--approach and nudge your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha.\" a voice says. \"Come on. We should go back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. Right above you, blocking the sun, is....</span></div></div>",

Maybe you once crushed on her, in the first weeks of entering high school, but even crushes have a sense of probability, and an outgoing senior, the most popular girl in her class, is next to \"struck by lightning\" on the probability scale. Though you know your strategy's about to break, you stick to the original plan of lying without budging.

All the foreign sensations that come with swapping genders, abruptly and wholly, attack you in that moment. The bikini straps dig into your back, into your ass--why a thong, of all swimwear!?--your bikini hugs a patch of hair that replaced your penis, a smooth region that needs filling, it needs something more, your old male friend. Your breasts, the humongo-gonzas that stuck out (a-ha) so immediately keep sticking out. The more you notice them, the more alien they feel. How do they hold to your body with such thin, connecting tissue without popping off? And then the wider hips, the thinner waist, the baby cheeks and fuller lips, your longer hair, soprano voice (you've said nothing yet, but muttering worried nonsense, you can tell how high you could belt a song)... even your feet, hands, arms, legs, where there should be some similarity with a boy's body, the softer flesh, daintier bones, delicate features... you have no frame of reference. You've been thrown into a gendered ocean and expected to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA funny metaphor, since right after thinking it, your first instinct to block the barrage of sensations is to make for the pool and jump in. A foamy shockwave spreads around you, bathing other teenagers (today, and on all Wednesdays, the pool gives discounts to high schoolers) and drawing laughs and profanity. Under water, surrounded by blue, the only sensation that survives immersion in water is the faint bobbing of your hair and breasts. Otherwise... peace, reprieve. You briefly forget you have swapped genders and assumed a life you still can't pin a name to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the surface, you wipe your eyes and laugh. You test a few paddles with your arms and find your new body is much more comfortable in the water. Maybe she's a swimmer, you think, but you set most thoughts aside in favor of swimming around the pool, maneuvering about people and focusing on the act of propulsion. Some awareness of your body returns--you can't escape it for too long--but you find a way to walk the line between seeing fully and intentional blindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ignorance can only last so long, even self-enforced ignorance.

She was dressed in a dark purple bikini, her long blonde hair tied tightly in a ponytail, and had in her hands a couple water bottles. You instantly recognized her, as would every person who went to your school. She was Tori Brooks after all, only the most popular girl at your school. Or at least she was, before graduating a few weeks ago. She had been the head cheerleader. But unlike the stereotypical cheerleader she was also smart, graduating near the top of her class. You hadn't had a lot of opportunities to talk to her, really the only time that comes to mind being when she lead your freshmen orientation tour, but she always seemed like a nice person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were snapped out of your train of thought when she lied down in the pool chair next to you, handed you one of the water bottles she had, and said \"Here you go Sam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absentmindedly thanked her as you took the bottle she was handing you and thought to yourself that you couldn't really be who you thought you were right now. The only Sam you could think of that Tori would be hanging out with was Samantha Newport. Samantha was one of Tori's best friends, also on the cheer team, and had one of the best GPA's in the class that just graduated from your school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a phone sitting on your lap and quickly unlocked it with your fingerprint. Accessing the camera, you were greeted by a surprised looking Samantha Newport looking back at you. Her long blonde hair braided and resting over your left shoulder, her blue eyes slightly widened by the shock of finding out who's body you found yourself in, mouth slightly open. You turned off the phone and took a sip from your water bottle as you tried to calm yourself. 'Ok Jack' you thought to yourself. 'You somehow found yourself in the body of a girl from your school that just graduated, and your body wasn't freaking out. Maybe this is some sort of dream. Maybe it's all in your head'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were still trying to process everything that was happening, someone walked behind you and said \"We need to talk\" before walking off. You looked around for a moment before spotting your old body ducking behind the changing rooms building. Without trying to draw too much attention to yourself, which was easier said than done, you stood up and followed your body. As you walked, you noticed the natural sway in your hips and bounce of your breasts with each step you took. Once you finally met up with your body, it said \"Took you long enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" you replied. \"This is a bit of an unusual situation to be in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your telling me\" your body replied. \"Hey, don't take this the wrong way but, um, what's your name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, Jack Anderson\" you answered. \"And don't worry about it, I would have been more surprised if you already knew who I was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So, any idea how this might have happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no. I was just floating in the pool thinking about how much I hate high school and wish I could just be done with it and then all of a sudden I found myself in your body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I was just thinking about how stressed I was getting about having to go to college next fall and was wishing I could go back to high school for a few more years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy\" you said. \"You think the universe is trying to teach us something. Like one of those Freaky Friday movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I don't think we can take any chances\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we can't risk anybody finding out we aren't really who we appear we are. Meaning you have to do your best to pretend to be me and I'll have pretend to be you. At least until we can find some way to swap back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Samantha gave each other a quick crash course in your lives before heading your separate ways. You returned to your pool chair, next to a sleeping Tori with her AirPods in. You took advantage of this time and browsed through Samantha's social media accounts to learn as much about her as possible. And learn you did. She was surprisingly single, going to attend the local university in the coming fall with an undecided major, and was the younger of her families 2 children. You only had about 15 minutes to learn more about Samantha's life before Tori woke up and asked if you were ready to leave since she had to go home and get ready for work. You told her you were ready, and proceeded to follow her to the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the locker you quickly threw the combo in and opened it up, before freezing for a moment. Samantha had never told you the combo to the lock on the locker, let alone which locker it was. And yet you effortlessly found the locker and opened it. But you couldn't linger on this if you were to keep up appearances. So you grabbed the clothes in the locker, a reddish purple tank top and ripped cut off jean shorts. There wasn't any underwear, so you just threw them on over the bikini, followed by sliding your feet in the sandals you found in the locker and threw a brown purse over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt incredibly awkward as you walked with Tori to her car. From your hips swaying from side to side with each step you took, to the bouncing of the breasts on your chest with each of those steps. It only got worse when you sat down in the passenger seat of Tori's car and put your seatbelt on, trying your best not to let your discomfort show with the seatbelt resting between your breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, Tori asked \"So, home?\"</span></div></div>",

Smiling gently you wave at her which only makes her giggle and wave back. 'Okay so I got a baby sister now, and I'm in what I could guess 12-13 year old body.' You think to yourself as you walk up to a family car. Climbing into the back seat you watch your mother open the other door and go about placing your baby sister in her car seat next to you. \"Dear I need you to watch your sister again tonight. I know you asked that you could go and sleep over at Sally's but work called and they need me at the office to go over some documents. I'll try not to be to late. I was hoping that I have the whole day off.\" You hear the lady that was climbing into the front seat state with a heavy sigh. You was getting a picture here that she was a single parent and was trying her hardest for her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sorry for her you only smile. \"That is okay, I understand mom. I don't mind. I love my baby sister.\" You respond hoping that was true that the girl who's body you was now in did love her sister. This made the mother happy it seemed and she didn't seem shocked by your words. Looking at your younger sister you reached out and gently took her hand and she only smiled and squeezed your finger. \"So it just us again, let's be good okay.\" You state and the little girl seemed to understand or you only hopped as she only giggled and stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay the number is by the phone like normal. If anything is wrong call me. I will try to not be to long okay sweety.\" She said and gave you a hug before kissing your sister on the head and wave to her. You nod your head and wave as she was leaving and closed the door behind her as a sigh finally left your lips. You was somewhat relieved that your new mother left for since you been in this body you felt it was sexually frustrated, some what like you was when you first started going through puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, I hope it not that, for girls have periods...\" You shuddered at the thought that might be it. Looking down at your baby sister you pick her up and hold her in your arms. \"Let's go have some fun.\" You tell her and smile as you carry her into the living room and place her down on the floor and sat there as well with her in your lap as she picked up a doll that could be hers or was suppose to be yours now and started to play with it. As the minutes passed and you watched your baby sister your frustration only seemed to be getting worse if anything as her head would come back and rest against your small but developing chest and was moving around rubbing against it. Then there was the fact that you watched her put the doll she had in her hands into her diaper for she wanted to play with a different one instead. You watched the soft pink bear that should be the size of your hand be stuffed into the puffy white cover that was covering your sister's bottom and cause the front of it to bulge outwards as it took up space inside. As you let her continue you watched as many of the stuffed animals suffered the same fate after being played with a bit until she couldn't fit anymore inside her diaper with out it popping off her. you smiled at her as she patted her puffed up diaper and you oddly placed your hands on it and patted it as well which made her clap her hands. This some what gave you an idea now to how you might be able to get rid of some of your frustration. </span></div></div>",

A smile crossed your face as the search came back quickly and happily for in the room at the changing table there was a half empty bag. You walked over and pulled one out looking at it's size then looked down at you hips where the skirt you was wearing was and nodded. You started to undo the zipper at the side and let the skirt fall around your ankle before looking around to make sure the blinds where closed and then removed your underwear. Your face going red once again like before for you was not use to having a female body, you pulled the pull ups on and they hugged the developing curves of your body nicely as you walked over now and sat back down and the little girl crawled over and patted your pull ups before picking up a doll and tried to stuff it inside them and only giggled as it went in and was tightly held against you but made a bulge in the pull ups. the girl only clapped her hands and bounced on the bulge in her diaper before crawling away to get more of the small animals. as she was you looked down and as a thought came to you so did a fine redness to your cheeks. You placed your hand on the smooth surface of the pull ups as you spread your legs apart and push on the bulge to make it lower until you felt the soft fur against your crotch and but your lower lip from the sensitive tickling it was giving you. \"Okay here we go.\" You said softly to yourself as you started to push gently against the bulge making the small cow that now was trapped in the pull ups tight against your soft sensitive area and just continued to apply more pressure until you whimpered and gasped as you felt it forcing you open and was entering you. You continued until you thought it was fully in and your sister came back and smiled and started to push more of the dolls that she gathered into your pull ups. It got tight fast and a few of them gathered at your crotch adding pressure to insure that the small fluffy cow was now inside you. You where sure it was for you felt it there and with each movement you did it sent electricity through your body. Though at this point it was not alone for a monkey was half way to joining it. Your sister snuggled up to you again and was pulling the dolls out of her diaper and was playing with them again as she rested against you. As she played eventually she was pulling the dolls out of your pull ups as well sadly to you for you was enjoying it. But when she was trying to find her monkey and cow she noticed that she couldn't reach them and you blushed and stood up whimpering as you removed the pull ups to show your wet lips had a soft little money tail hanging out of it and your sister grabbed it and pulled it out making you gasp as it popped out of you and she looked at you before placing her fingers against your skin and tried to push her hand inside you thinking that was where the cow was. After a little struggling she got her hand and whist in and found her cow. Gasping and moaning at having her small hand inside you and the feeling being over whelming to you, your hips started to buck lightly at her arm making her giggle as she tried to pull out and watch you buck your hips forwards and raking her hand back in. She only found this funny and thought it was a game so continued until you laid back and she got her hand out for you was exhausted.  </span></div></div>",

You felt her try to push it as deep as she could and was wigging her toes as she was up to her knee inside you. she pulled her other foot into her lap and wiggled those toes and giggled at the tickling your body's inside was giving her foot inside you as she wiggled it about. She then placed her other foot's toes next to he knee and tried to push them in which made you gasp and whimper in pain more for your body was not use to being so wide. And before you could sit up to stop her you felt her shove her other foot inside you making you sit up the best you could seeing her small hands on her leg as she was straightening it out making you gasp and whimper as you was bleeding a bit from being stretched to wide. She only  clapped her hands and wiggled her feet as she had both legs in you up to her knees. \"Having fun at my expense?\" You ask with a whimpering sigh from the fading pain and the building pleasure. You watch her as she tries to push her legs in more but couldn't but was pulling hem out a bit then pushing back in as she giggled and laughed at how her feet felt. You blushed deeply and was breathing deeply before you placed your hands on her diapered bottom and took a deep breath and pulled her closer making you wince and gasp as you felt your body eventually give way and her feet pass through an opening deep inside you and into another spot letting more of her legs to enter up to the bottom of her diaper that was nicely squished between her legs. You was taking deep breaths and gritting your teeth from pain from being so widely spread but the pleasure as well as from the legs inside you where trying to wiggle around. \"Okay, here we go. You ready?\" You ask her and she only clapped her hands and smiled with her shocked look on her face as you placed your hands on her waist and pulled her again as tears rolled down your face you felt her hips and diapered bottom enter you and start to swell up for her diaper was absorbing your body's fluids. \"It went in... How big can she get? Was she doing this before?\" You ask now wondering why your body seemed so calm over this as it if was nothing new to her. You where now wondering what this girl use to do before you got her body. The best you could now you reached down and tucked her hands inside you at her sides and pulled on her shoulder feeling her legs fold up inside you as your belly was expanding to hold the girl that was filling it until you where at her neck and she was only giggling wildly and squirming inside you. \"She not going to breath if i take her in more. Wasn't there a smorcal in the pool bag that we brought home with us?\" You pant as you lay back from the feeling and place your hands over the large belly you was having now. Slowly rolling over and getting onto your knees before standing and waddling to the bag and started to look through the bag as the girl only giggled and laughed as she was hanging upside down out of you and you found what you was looking for and went about laying back down the same way you got up and smiled at her. \"Okay use this to breath.\" You told her and placed one end in her mouth before gently pushing her head until she was fully inside. besides the end of the smorcal that stuck out of you so she could breath. you was panting and blushing as you felt her squirm and try to get comfy inside your tight body and the rumbling of her breathing on the tube against your sensitive flesh. After calming down and laying there for a bit you slowly start to sit up supporting the added weight in your belly and reach over to the pull ups and started to pull them up your legs and had a bit of trouble getting them around your new waist size but eventually managed as you stood there stroking your belly. \"You having fun in there? Does your sister do this with you a lot? For some reason this body seems to be acting normal about this.\" you ask your belly not really expecting to get much of an answer. and waddle out of the room and down the hall into your new room and sigh as you lay on the bed stroking your belly. \"A light nap should be nice.\" You sighed feeling tired and blushed at the movements inside you as you moved and closed your eyes passing out on the spot.</span></div></div>",

You slowly nod your head as you watched the lady come over and place a hand on your belly. \"Is my baby okay inside?\" She asked and felt the movement under your skin making you whimper and blush as she sighed hapily to know that you made sure she was able to breath still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mommy.\" You try and play the innocent and guilty type as she shook her head. \"If you are mad I won't do it any more.\" You tell her as you lower your head before feeling her hand gently stroke your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine dear, this is the third time I caught the two of you. Plus you told me last time that the two of you do this a lot and you promised to be careful of her and make sure not to ever hurt her. Even though I was worried about you as well.

It is summer so you be good and take care of your sister while I am gone. I will be home for dinner though.\" She told you and you only blush and nod your head as you hold your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, see you later mommy.\" You tell her timidly as you feel your sister getting comfy in side your womb and makes you shutter slightly. \"Love you mommy.\" You wave and watch her leave before taking a deep breath and looked down at your belly. \"You tricked me, and now your having to much fun in there.\" You pouted and giggled as you poked your own belly. Sighing seeing how she was still sleeping inside you, you decided to get dress as you pulled on a pair of biker shorts on which stretched to near rip as they hugged your waist and the tube your sister breathed out of was sticking out of the end of the leg hole. You then squeezed into a tight pink skirt and shirt which wanted to hug your already tight body tighter around your sister. \"Okay, let's go and eat, you may be asleep and want to eat later but I am hungry now.\" You protested and started to waddle out of your room and down the hall towards the kitchen as you where learning how to support your 'extra' weight with each step that you was taking.</span></div></div>",

If you was able to put your sister into your womb, then did that mean your sister was able to stuff hers as well. It was an idea that made your soft neither lips drip with wetness and excitement. \"come here sis, I want to test something.\" You said to her sweetly, the thoughts passing through your mind being very horny and naughty. At first thought she was to small to be able to take you into her womb but that didn't mean much seeing how you learned what these two girls been up to. Picking her up after she been feed you walk her over to where her toys where. Sitting making the pull ups you had under your spandex shorts crinkle under your weight then your sisters as you sat her in your lap. \"Time to fill your tummy.\" You tell her and she just looked up at you confused before a smile came over her face. You pick up the small cow that had nicely entered you before and moved it towards her diaper and she watched and even pulled on the waist band for you so you could lower it into her diaper. She must of thought that was all you was going to do for when you placed it under her crotch and gently started to push she squirmed and blushed before her hands went over the bulge in her diaper your hand and the cow was making. She started to push on your hand and the cow slipped into her. You smile and patted her tummy lightly making her squirm and giggle. She crawled from your lap panting and started to gather all her toys and started to push them inside herself. As you watched her you got even more horny as her belly bulged with each added animal until they where all in her tubby belly now. You got an idea and went over to the large bunny you saw before and brought it over towards her. \"How about this one?\" You playfully asked and she blushed and panted staring at the animal that was her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To big.\" She tried to say and held her tummy and you only nodded your head to her words. But she then pointed at your belly and you sighed and nodded your head. The bunny could fit in yours easily it seemed. You started to undress again and closed your eyes as you felt your sister start to push the bunny into you and fill you up again making your belly expand out back to how it was with her inside you. She giggled and patted your belly as the last of the bunny entered you and then climbed up and hugged your tummy.</span></div></div>",

This time you gently pushed her in and pulled her back out a few time using her as a large toy as her leg sunk deeper and deeper up to her hips. the movement was making her blush and pant from the movement in her womb from her toys still. Her diapered bottom that now was nicely and tightly hugged by her diaper due to her rounder belly slide into you and then back out before going back in. This caused her you moan out in pleasure along with you. Her diaper absorbing your juices each time making it expand before you finally pop her belly into you. This made her squirm and made you feel so alive that you bucked your hips now at her movements making the rest of her quickly slide back into you and now your belly was massive with her, her belly and the bunny. But you was not done. You was horny and wanted more. You sat up and crawled the best you could towards her high chair and put it on it's side. While on your knees you start to back up into one of the legs using it as a dildo and was masturbating wildly.

Frustrated, at this point you decide to ignore common logic and try to pull her out yourself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Surprisingly you could pull yourself open about a foot and a half wider, but you couldn't remove your sister because, after removing all foreign bodies from both of your wombs, your own womb formed a small barrier separating your sister from the rest of the womb. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Guess this means that I can still put things or people in, maybe even adults, but after a while they can't come out.\" As you say that you're suddenly hit by a overwhelming urge to feed yourself and your occupant. As quickly as you could you grab a box of cereal from the pantry and start eating handfuls at a time. But it's neither fast enough nor filling enough so you decide to slowly pour it into your mouth and hope you don't choke. Surprisingly you reach the bottom of the container without having choked or swallowed any of it as it simply poured down into your stomach with thousands of small plops. You hesitantly move to the next containers and repeat the process but you still hunger.

Emboldened slightly, you reach for increasingly larger fruits until all that remained was a large watermelon about as large as an eight year old child. With the watermelon you have a small amount of difficulty as your jaw began to ache towards the end of it as the watermelon reached your throat and slowly but steadily went down into your stomach until it was fully inside. The watermelon apparently fulfilled your gluttonous stomach as it settled down to digest all without any more than a small bulge adding to the bulge of your sister within your womb.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0slowly you head to your room as your body urges you to sleep, in order to digest it's meal.

You slipped off the straps of your pink one-piece and pulled it down to fully reveal your 10-year old body. You were small and slender with tiny bumps on your chest and almost nothing on your hips and butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then opened the bag and pulled out the clothes. First, there was a pair of pink panties which you decided to put on first. Then, there was a small training bra. You had a little bit of difficulty with this. \"You having trouble Sonia?\" asked your new mom with a smile on her face. She came over and helped you put the bra on. \"Thanks\" you said, still uncomfortable. Then, there was white t-chirt which was easy enough and there also was a pair of blue shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish it off was a pair of white socks and white and pink sneakers.</span></div></div>",

And I can not go naked or wearing a nightgown, so I will need to have to dress, whether I like it or not, I will have to dress in female clothes!<br>\r\nTherefore moving very slowly to prevent my boobs from wiggling I did some very small steps into the direction of the huge cupboard, where I found a drawer with her, now my things inside and I saw that this girl was only having dressing like the style from yesterday from the beach\u2026.<br>\r\nThey were mostly  t-shirts, which was totally ok for me, but I also found some very short skirts.<br>\r\nI had no intension to wear a skirt today and took some girly cut jeans\u2026<br>\r\nYes, I think. This should be my outfit for the first day as a girl and I was quite happy with my choice!<br>\r\nI removed my nightgown to reveal a totally hot female teenage body under it. I had to see my new self in the huge full size mirror and under normal circumstances I would now get a hard on, but there unfortunately was nothing anymore, which could become hard or erect. But this was not quite the complete truth. Something was becoming erect and this were my new female nipples. Now I felt like a girl when she was turned on and additionally I had some strange, but not bad feelings down there in my new groin area, there wasn\u2019t a penis any longer, but I could feel something similar, some erecting but going not outside but inside. I was totally confused and overwhelmed by those feelings at the same time and now wanted to touch this girl I saw in the mirror, for one moment I nearly forget that I was this girl in flesh and body, but not in soul, because my soul was still the same old male that I was yesterday when I did my fatal wish, which caused that the tables have turned and I was about to pleasure my new self, my new female teenage body as\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now was my moment to pretend to someone else that I was this teenage girl, in whose body I was transferred\u2026.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Linda\u201d I said pretending some enthusiasm, which could not hurt I think. I was shocked and confused to hear my new soprano voice, but this Linda talking stopped me from thinking to much:<br>\r\n\u201chello Sonia, don\u2019t forget to bring your swimwear for our trip to the beach right after school!\u201d<br>\r\nI was kind of bored, because I have to go to the beach again, it was not the pool like yesterday, but again water!<br>\r\nAnyhow I could not do or change anything right now and I just said:\u201dyes\u201d to Linda.<br>\r\nLinda then asked me, if she should pick me up in half an hour for school. I also said \u201cyes\u201d not listening before thinking, because half an hour was really not much time.<br>\r\n\u201cI need to hurry , bye Linda\u201d I said and just ended the call without waiting for Linda to replay something.<br>\r\nAnd indeed I need to hurry, because I will not be late for my first school day as a girl\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I have chosen the outfit already and when I had another look in the mirror, this was again shocking me, because I really looked girly! Even in this more or less plain outfit.<br>\r\nAnyhow Another glance on the clock told me, that there were only 10 minutes left, before Linda will pick me up for school and I had to pack my swimming issues again. Luckily this Sonia girl, I was now, was rather organized at least in her room and I found some fresh towel , a pink one and took it\u2026<br>\r\nMy one peace Speedo was dry already and I just placed it into my swimming bag\u2026 Yes a girl needs to have this\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are a short, lanky 13 year old half Japanese girl named Mia. You are sitting in your room in your mom's house playing Pokemon on your Gameboy. Your room is filled with magazines about video games and guns. Your closet is full of black baggy pants and shirts. You still have a box of toys from your childhood filled with toy trucks and Legos. You've been meaning to get rid of your old toys because you're too old, but want to hold onto because you have fond memories of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a tomboy, you never liked the idea of being a girl. When you were younger you refused to play with dolls your grandparents would give you for your birthday and Christmas. You remember when you were four years old and just able to talk you tried to tell your mom your true identity, that you were really a 19 year old boy who saw her at the pool and wondered what it would be like to live another life. You remember your mother thought it was strange that you could articulate such a clear thought at such an early age, she dismissed it as whimsical pretending. You persisted in telling her about your past throughout your youth, telling her about details of your old life. At one point, one day on a weekend when you were five, she followed your directions to your old parents house, while you told her details about your family that lived there, she didn't get out of the car to stop to talk to them. You thought it was strange that she would entertain the idea of your so called fantasies, but she thought it was interesting that your stories were so specific and everything you said was verifiable and matched reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to know what happened to your old body and to reach out to your old parents. When you were in 2nd grade you had to write a letter for class, so you wrote it to your old family, claiming you were doing it for a class and you wanted to send a letter to a random house to learn about who lived in that house. Your teacher surprisingly approved of the plan and thought it was interesting. To your surprise you found out that you got a reply from your old mom, Kathy who said that it was very nice that you were doing this for a class, but that her family affairs were a secret and would not send them to someone she did not know. That was very much like your mom you thought, very security conscious. You never knew what happened to your old body, if it was occupied by someone else or what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn elementary school being a tomboy was not an issue, but when middle school came around you were teased, you became an outcast, so you buried your self into school and got very good grades. This made your mom happy but you felt lonely. You thought that you could make your self more feminine, but you didn't like the idea of doing that, it would feel embarrassing and wouldn't match your identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were a freshman in high school. Your mom, Charlotte, was an electrical engineer at Entel, the computer chip company. She was very smart, at 28 she was a lead engineer. She had a 32 year old boy friend named Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt very intrigued about Eric, he had nice features you appreciated, trim body and a clean defined jaw line. When he came over to visit your mom your heart would beat faster, you would smile at him and want to sit at the table with him and listen to your mom and him talk. You wanted to hear what he had to say, when he would ask you a question you would smile and giggle and forget what to say. You felt like a dork when this happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel these feelings around boys at school. One boy named Quentin intrigued you. He was in your algebra class. He had a muscular body, clean jaw line and always wore a baseball cap. He was cleaver, he would always get the last word in joking with his friends. You thought it would be nice to talk to him, but the idea made you squeamish. You felt your stomach sink and your legs get weak at every notion of the idea. You would fantasize about getting close to him one day and leaning your head up against his chest, he would put his hand on your shoulder and breath down your neck. You would fantasize about feeling calm and secure in that situation and would relax, pressing your body against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts took you by surprise. You would think in this direction then wonder if that was really you thinking that or your body. You would think more deeply about the idea of men, each time being more comfortable with the idea. Is that actually me or my body you wondered. This is about the time in your bodies life for this to be happening. You noticed changes in your body. Your hips were widening, you chest started developing small bulges under your nipples, they felt sore, and you were starting to get hairs between your legs. Your body is definitely maturing you thought. You weren't sure if you wanted to accept these changes. They made you uncomfortable because you still thought of your self as a man trapped in a girls body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had thoughts and fantasies about men that you never had before. Does that make me a gay man or a straight woman? You thought about this. Can I really consider my self a man and like other men? Would this body of mine let me keep my identity as a man or will I have to give that up? This conflict was something I couldn't reconcile in my head any longer. Should I give in to this bodies urges and accept that I am fully female, or should I try to reject them and try to hold onto my identity as a man? </span></div></div>",

You begin to swap you baggy clothing with tighter clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time ever in your female life you touched yourself. You came home and instead of doing your homework, you laid down on your bed. You shimmied out of your new leggings and were laying in your panties and your tank top. Without thinking you grabbed your budding breasts and began awkwardly fumbling with them. The pleasure was beyond what you felt as a guy. This body was yours and you were going to show it who was boss. After fifteen minutes of awkward groping, you moved onto your womanhood. You slid your hand over your clit and felt a rush to you head of adrenaline as your mind begins to blur.</span></div></div>",

He's a boy in my class.  A pretty gross and stupid boy I may add.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw the book down.  \"Who cares what some dumb girl thinks of me?\" You say aloud.  But alas, curiousity got the better of you so you pick the diary back up and continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday he and his dumb friends are always causing trouble at school.  They think they can just break the rules and get away with it.  Worst of all, everyone else in class just follows along with them.  For example, if it weren't for me the entire class would still be playing with the PE dodgeballs without permission - why can't everyone just follow the rules!  It's so plain and simple!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes.  \"The pesky princess wants us to follow her precious rules?  Screw the rules\" you comment before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, whenever he and his friends get caught, they take it out on me.  The other day on the school bus, Bryan snatched my backpack and threw my homework out the window!  I was lucky that Ms Smith believed me and gave me another day to do the assignment.  But then on the bus ride home, Bryan and his goons spent the whole time making raspberries at me, from right behind!  So irritating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you begin laughing upon recalling making all those raspberries at Emily - she deserved it.  Much to your annoyance, your laughter came out as girlish giggling - another reminder of the body you were trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing there was more, you continue reading<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Diary.  Bryan is a pesk.  He is the biggest pesk at school and I despise him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet I have a crush on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I read that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet I have a crush on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several seconds felt like hours, as you process the sentence you just read.  Was this some kind of joke?  Did Emily only put that there expecting you to come across her diary one of these days?  Yeah, that had to be it.  There was still more to read, so you kept reading<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Diary, I admit it.  I like him.  Like \"like LIKE\" him.  Confusing, I know.  I could hardly believe it myself.  But lately whenever I look at him my heart races - he always looks so cool, even when he's being a pesky trouble maker.  He's also one of the fastest boys at PE and as much as J hated him taking the dodgeballs he looked so manly when he took out the opposing team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks were read.  What kind of joke was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Diary, as much as pesk as he is, I have a crush on him.  This feeling in my heart is so strong I could just run up to him and hug him.  Hug him real tight and - him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze.  \"That was not what I thought I read, was it?\" You comment anxiously before rereading the last sentence.  You read up to that word again.  That second to last word.  The word you hoped you would come across as you read slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK-I-S-S<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" You scream, throwing the book to thr ground.  Breathing heavily, you stare at where you had thrown the diary, trying to process everything you had just now read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was not some cruel joke after all.  This was really.  This was very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Williams likes you.  Like \"like LIKES\" you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to throw up really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bury your head into the pillow, hoping this was all some bad dream.  You pinched youself even.  But nope you were still here, in Emily's room, in Emily's body.  And Emily was the girl who secretly had a crush on you.  And she was probably going to try to give you cooties too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the weekend was slow and uneventful, aside from still being stuck in Emily's body.  Eventually you had to change out of the swimming suit and into pajamas - on the insistence of Emily's mother - you tried to keep your eyes shut as you put on the pajamas.  You also spent the rest of the weekend trying to forget the contents of the diary you had read, but no matter how hard you tried you could not forget the shocking revelation that Emily wanted to - you gaghed in your mouth jusy thinking of the \"K word\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the weekend was over and you had to go back to school.  Emily's mother made you take a shower - an experience you didn't want to think about either - and since both of Emily's shorts were conviently dirty you were stuck having to wear a skirt.  \"This feels so weird\" was all you could think while trying to walk in the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bus stop, you start thinking about what you and Emily would talk about in regards to the body swap - and then you remembered the contents of the diary.  You feel nauseous again.  You weren't sure whether to confront Emily on this crush of her's - she might get mad at you and just leave you like this.  However you were afraid that she might try to sneak onto you and infect you with cooties...</span></div></div>",

God, this was frigging confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have to research. Find ways to reverse this and keep trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And until then we just... keep each other lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound like you have any better ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rolled your eyes. Her eyes. Crap. \"Alright, then ground rules. You don't make me look like a little wimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't make me look like a slimy weasel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you want me looking out of character?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared daggers. \"The only reason I'm not knocking your block off is because it's my block I'd be knocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider this. \"....I'm not sure that simile works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly understandable for <i>civilized</i> people. And it's a metaphor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't know those words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs in irritation. \"Have you <i>ever</i> paid attention in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever not been a brat? No, stop, this is stupid. We're setting rules. Is there anything else we should know about each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two of you continued to exchange information. You had several siblings, one of them in college, so you quizzed Emily to make sure she got it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her, she informed you that her mom kept talking about having another kid eventually, but nothing had come of it and her dad was always busy. Sometimes, you would have to make your own meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained to her your friends and who was who and how she should behave around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe described a list of things the teachers liked and how Ms. Smith liked to eat PB and Js with her during lunch. God, what a nerd, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, the rules were established and you both shook hands on it (she refused to let you spit in your hand).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't have to do this for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back in our old bodies before you know it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three years passed. Nothing had switched you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had pretty much sabotaged your reputation immediately. It wasn't her fault, you had to reluctantly admit. She just wasn't as rough and tumble as you. And your friends? Were very rough and tumble. By the end of the year, Brian and Derek decided you got \"lame\" and avoided you. By the end of the second year, they had shifted to picking on Emily-in-you. She slowly shifted back to being a teacher's pet, although not as much of a tattletale. She read books alone at lunch until you started sitting with her. Still, she seemed as happy as someone could be for someone who looked like her life was tumbling down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family is so... energetic.\" She complained one day. \"There's so many of them and the younger ones keep wanting me to play with them. How am I supposed to keep up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you managed to get invited to your own house one day, just to see how things were doing. The parents seemed happy and content and all your brothers and sisters were eager and hyper as ever. But they didn't recognize you and Emily got made fun of for bringing a girl to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you bugged her about this life ruination, she would be quick to remind you of your own failings. You just couldn't hack the classes and her grades fell. Teachers grew concerned, then annoyed, then ignored you again. It kind of hurt. You were starting to like Ms. Smith and the other teachers being so pleasant to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered trying for sports, but the girl's teams were lacking at this school. Besides, Emily made it very clear she didn't want you <i>anywhere</i> with her body on the field. She almost joined ballet before you shut that down in turn. So neither of you tried for clubs. Pretty soon, Emily and you only had each other at and after school. You don't know if you'd call it a friendship. You had fun, once in a while, hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mom got pregnant after all. Twins, a boy and a girl, Ethan and Sophie. At first it seemed to be going well and both of the parents seemed to actually be present for a while. But eventually the moment passed. The dad went back to work and the mom did whatever she pleased. You had to help around the house a lot when they weren't paying attention. Emily was so excited to meet them. She was heartbroken when they scurried away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, you had trouble thinking of that body as you anymore. Sure, that was you, and you desperately wanted to get back to your old life. But you looked at your body and thought \"there's Emily.\" People called you Emily and you looked up. You looked in the mirror and thought \"there I am.\" It was hard not to pick up the habit. Still. Very disconcerting if you thought about it too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you met at the local playground. This was a conversation that had to go down in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Things are gonna be different this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked in surprise. You didn't think Emily would be the one to venture forth on this topic. But you waited patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" She dragged a hand through her hair. \"We can't change too much, obviously. We have to keep things within reason for when we switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... we couldn't even last a year acting like each other. I don't think we lasted a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against a swingset, blowing hair out of your face. \"Tell me about it. Even trying to study like you gives me a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" She took a deep breath. \"I want to try new things in middle school. Things outside of our ground rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared at each other for another long moment. Awkward silences were becoming a trademark of your relationship. It was hard for things not to be awkward when you were staring at what should be your own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, no ballet or the like. It's bad enough for your reputation, but I'm the one who would get bullied for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. And I won't.... I don't know, shave my head or anything crazy. I don't want it crazy long, but... I'll keep it chin-length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"...I was kind of thinking about trying an instrument.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't want to be a princess anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorts in surprise. \"Come on, I was eight! We're teenagers now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can finally change your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of anger on her face before she sighed.\"...Yeah. Yeah, I don't want that embarrassing old stuff up there anymore. If you put in a game system or something, just try not to make me look dorky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have the heart to tell her you de-pinkified the room last year. Emily's dad hadn't been happy. It was one of the few times he ever paid you any attention. \"Sooooo.... instrument?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't know what yet, but... I don't know. Something to let me relax. For at least a little bit. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"I dunno, I haven't really thought about it. Your dad bought a bunch of skirts, so I might be stuck with those whenever I can't find any jeans. Can I try for track or volleyball or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers. \"...Why not. It'd look good on paper if you keep it up until the end of high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. She always had to think far into the future. You never got why. This problem will be over soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna be in different classes this year, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"I'm aware, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't keep track of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow. \"Track of <i>me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be coy. Just keep out of trouble. Is that so hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged non-committally. \"I won't break a nail.\" You frowned thoughtfully. \"Hey, did you know breaking a nail actually <i>hurts?</i> It really pokes at you. Moves make it seem so petty, but its kind of a huge pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I haven't had a long nail since this all star- no, dammit,stop distracting me.\" She grabbed your shoulders. \"Stay. Out. Of trouble. Can you handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed her off. \"Fine, fine, don't be such a worrywart. I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began your middle school career. The two of you in separate classes, with separate people and separate possibilities, and the increasingly likely concern that this forever body swap really was forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it shouldn't be too bad. Right?</span></div></div>",

On paper, it might sound peaceful or tranquil to pass by the river on your way to school each day. In practice, it was dirty and gross to look at, polluted by various trash or even just the natural remains of nature sullying the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill. Its nice to see the ducks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the school wearing a nice blouse and a skirt. Emily's dad insisted for your first day. The only times he really seemed to pay attention was when \"his little girl\" wasn't dressing \"right\". To be honest, you had a theory that Emily's princess room was something she enjoyed mostly because it had to be one of the few things he really doted on her with. But you didn't want any hassle and there is something nice about seeing him smile as you leave. So, you go to school wearing the stupid things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you notice how much bigger the school is. In sixth grade, your elementary school was starting to feel like you were a giant in a tiny doll house. Now? Two floors, over a larger distance, with hundreds more kids in one building. The smell of hormones replaced glue and paint. God, you thought high school was the one where teens went wild, but suddenly you got the impression that middle school might be a bit different than what you expected. Boys wore jerseys, girls wore shorter shorts, and there wasn't a single goofy child's doodle pasted onto a wall. Lockers to decorate, banners on walls, and much much more. You were really growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always going to be some jackass who hadn't gotten the memo about being mature for once. Such as the slimy Joey Duncan, chatting ahead of you with some other students in the halls.</span></div></div>",

You had better things to do than to pay attention to what random people were chatting about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all quickly dived out the window when you felt a hand on your ass. You flipped around quick, glaring daggers at Joey. The best just waved smugly as he and his cronies guffawed amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sharing the love, babe.\" He retorted with a wink. \"You're sharing the beauty, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that supposed to be charming and not slimy as hell? \"Touch me again?

Before he or his cronies could react, you grabbed his head again and brought it down onto your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey tumbled to the ground, nose and jaw bleeding already. \"What the hell, you bitch?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really supposed to be a middle schooler?

Or perhaps he couldn't stand the idea of his precious little girl that he never paid attention to doing anything bad and avoided the whole event. Emily's mom didn't arrive for several hours, leaving you in the principal's office for an extended amount of time. He had already lectured you at length for the fight, then he lectured you at length for the delay in your parents arrival and how it was cutting into your class time. Then he assigned you busywork to do in the administration office while he did other work. You could only stare at math problems as the students shuffling through the halls walked by, occasionally glancing and laughing at the girl who got in trouble on her first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been in the school for ten minutes and now everyone thought Emily Williams was a thug. Awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emily's mom shuffled in, dressed in surprisingly fancy clothes. You frowned in confusion. You'd seen that dress before. That was the fancy \"impress someone\" dress Mrs. Williams wore for special occasions. Did this count as a special occasion? She could be trying to impress the principal? That'd make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or maybe she was already out and about today. But that would be insane: unless she brought them with, that would mean she left the twin toddlers home alone for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are Ethan and Sophie in the car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared down at you, with eyes that screamed <i>Don't try to distract me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the aura of an angry suburban mom, the secretary buzzed the two of you into the office. Some polite introductions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Mrs. Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Lorraine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe politeness wasn't meant for you and you were quickly targeted for another round of lectures. The principal listed all the various amount of trouble you were in, attacking a defenseless student who just so happened to be the son of someone on the school board. You attempted to defend yourself, pointing out that he really started it, but that quickly got shot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mom stayed quiet throughout the conversation, simply nodding at various points. You were only sure she was listening when she talked about punishment with the principal. Detention was the bare minimum here and she of course assured there would be some punishment at home \"to be determined.\" Hands were shaken and you were shoved out of the school into \"your\" mom's hands for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you trudged towards the car in silence, surrounded by the sweltering heat of the pre-fall weather. The car was a Taurus, cheap and falling apart but efficient enough for travel. Ethan and Sophie were definitely not in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened up the side door to see a long Men's button shirt splayed on the seat. You didn't recognize it. Was it Emily's dad's? No, that didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in already.\" Emily's mother quickly scolded, tossing the shirt into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down quickly and buckled up. Within seconds, the car was rolling down the afternoon streets and a tension in the air that was downright suffocating.</span></div></div>",

Standing up to people like that is hard for a lot of people. But somehow, it came to you naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe idly fixed your hair. \"I'm proud of you, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, feeling a surprise lightness in your body. That felt good.

It's hard not to get frustrated when he's not home. When he comes home late every single night and barely talks to any of us when he does. So... mommy's trying some stuff for herself for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you understood. \"Okay.\" You hesitate. \"Thanks for telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetie. And if anything else goes wrong and you need help? I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know if that's true.

Whatever. Its not like she was your real mom anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Real family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's shirt is that?\" You finally interrupt the lecture. You aren't looking at her but you can feel the confusion in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not dad's shirt. But its not yours either. So who's using it? Why's it in your car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car screeched to a sudden halt, your body flinging forward until stopped by by the pull of the seat belt. Before you could even recover from the stop, Emily's mom grabbed your arm harshly, digging her sharp nails into your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you give me that smart <i>fucking</i> mouth, missy!\" You tried to pull away but you were stuck in the grasp of her hand and her hateful glare. \"If you're so goddamn smart, you wouldn't be acting like a <i>thug.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say, mouth desperately moving but not coming up with anything substantial to retort with. The sounds of honking cars echoed behind the two of you and this seemed to be the only thing that forced the woman to released your arm and continue the drive. You took the opportunity to try and soothe the pain in you arm, while Mrs. Williams fumed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to learn to behave. You clearly didn't learn any manners in elementary school. Just how to be uppity and rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you again. \"If you don't shape up, we're sending you to a private school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blood go cold. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, so that gets your attention?\" She grinned smugly. \"Can't be bothered to pay attention to me before, but <i>now</i> she listens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, I can't go to a private school!\" If you were away in private, you'd be away from Emily. Then you'd never be able to figure out how to switch back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't isn't what I want to hear. I want to hear <i>won't</i>. Because you'll behave and you won't cause me any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, if I'm gone, who's going to take care of Ethan and Sophie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared again. \"So, what, you think I'm not pulling my weight? That I'm not taking care of them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You left them at home alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved a pointy, painted finger at your face. \"One more screw-up at school and any more of that back-talk? You're going to that school. Where you'll learn <i>courtesy</i> and <i>rules</i>. Things that, despite what you clearly think, do apply to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your mouth mid-retort, descending into the seat in shock. Mrs. Williams' had a face that radiated pure smug delight. \"Now, what do we say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'll behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll behave, <i>what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth together. \"I'll behave, <i>ma'am.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched your cheek. \"That's my girl.\"</span></div></div>",

She was focused on the anger. \"It's all tumbling down the drain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?!\" You fired back, slapping away her hand. \"That's your body Joey was lusting after! You'd rather I let him think you were a piece of meat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"I've met him. He's just a dude. You probably egged him on somehow. Maybe if you had worn something else, this wouldn't have even happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime froze as you processed the words. She was blaming you. She was literally, actually blaming you for this. The frustration with seeing her body in this position? You could understand that. But she was actually, factually blaming you for a boy's advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, unable to hold back at the absurdity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's so funny?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and walked away, shaking your head. \"You wouldn't get it, Em.

You cringed at make-up, you cringed at skirts, and you cringed at the getting called \"cute.\" You got used to each step and you despaired at how you got used to it. You feared losing yourself to being a girl, even as it wasn't as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here was Emily, in your body, telling a girl she should've worn something different to avoid getting harassed by a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were getting used to being a girl, she was getting used to being a <i>boy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould youhave been like that? You'd like to think not but it was hard to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Emily. She- <i>He</i> was staring at you in utter confusion. He really didn't get it.

Anybody gave you attitude? You threw it back at them. Someone attacked you? You gave them twice as much of a beating. Within a few days, you were the punk girl at school who wore nice blouses and cute skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were <i>loving it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lasted a few weeks before the teachers eventually caught you in the act. Teachers were called, decisions were made, and you were being shipped off hundreds of miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ones who took it hard was Ethan and Sophie. They weren't old enough to know what was going on, but they knew they weren't going to see their big sis for a while.

Girls in uniforms walked to their classes next to bright green lawns. The buildings and lawn were carefully maintained. You could see a decent track field in the distance and from the outside, the dorm room building looked immaculate. Entering the main building, the floors were nicely polished and glass cases of awards and trophies lined the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size of the campus, and the size of the girls' textbooks, left you feeling pretty overwhelmed already.

Do step inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sensation that this was going to be a stressful beginning, you move from the lobby to the nice office of the woman. It was a finely polished and organized room, with various plagues and commerative photos literred on the walls and desks. Pictures of grateful parents and smiling children. A framed newspaper clipping praising the school. A large portrait of another, even older looking woman. You could only imagine that one was of Agatha Willard herself on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal sat behind a wooden desk, organizing a file carefully. She gestured to a chair behind you. \"Sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, yet she still huffed in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss Williams.

Your file describes you as a good student initially yet you suddenly slides into delinquency. Are you going to blame issues at home? Bullying at school? Unfair treatment? Exerting frustration for some perceived slight upon your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really shouldn't sass, but your annoyance with this woman was reaching its apex. \"Well, I could tell you about my whole body swap situation and how fighting makes me feel like myself in a different life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how <i>hysterical</i>, Miss Williams. What a comedian you could be.\" Staunch stood up, moving around her desk. \"You know what I think, Miss Williams? I think you are just naturally a bad person. I think you enjoy being a rude little thing and you want to see how long you can get away with it. Does that sound accurate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow. \"Kinda sounds like some premature judgment I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more attitude. What a naughty little girl you are, Miss Williams. Why I do believe you are one of the naughtier girls I've ever met! Tell me, Williams, why should I bother with a naughty girl like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... I don't kno-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's my calling!\" She paced around her desk. \"Ensuring naughty little children like you learn how to behave in the real world is what I've spent my whole life accomplishing. And like many girls before you, I will have your naughty little nature squeezed out into you've become a proper young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you... please stop saying naughty? It's getting kind of uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you another glare. \"Room 212 in the dorms. You'll meet your roommate there. I'll be watching you constantly Williams. So you better not be up to any funny business. Behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod quickly, retrieving the key from Staunch's handand escaping back out to campus.

The other girls (<i>girls</i> not \"other\" girls, you tried to remind yourself) giggled at the sight when they thought you couldn't hear them. You weren't particularly looking forward to settling in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick ride up the elevator took you to your designated floor. You soon reached the door that housed your new roommate. A whiteboard hung next to the room number, with little doodles of flowers and some generic quote of inspiration. You sighed. <i>Well, I guess I'll take generic over wild.</i> Fiddling with the key, you quietly entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room itself was supremely organized. Not a spec of dust or dirty clothes sat on the floor. A single pair of shoes sat under one of the beds. On the other side was a hamper which, from your position, even seemed to have clothes folded inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the room were two desks. Sitting at one was the cleanliness queen herself, typing away at her computer. She turned at your entry, pushing away from the desk, and smiled an almost obnoxiously large smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be Emily! I got a message that you would be arriving soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, you nodded. \"That's right. And you're Glori-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, she grabbed your hand and shook it rigorously. \"Gloria Stein. Oh, I'm sure we'll get along great! Let me show you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly whisked you around the room, showing off her schedule, her charts, where she put all of her homework when she finished, the hamper, the closet, etc etc. You weren't sure how long it took, her mouth moving too fast for you to process the the time surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she lowered her voice to a whisper, bringing you closer. \"I should warn you- there's a lot of girls on this floor who used to be troublemakers. Some of them are better now but I really don't think you can just trust anyone who used to do that sort of thing. Don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat trails down your face. \"I... guess it depends on the person for me. I don't want to judge people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles a condescending smile. \"Its good to have that sort of faith. But you really should be careful. Like, across the hall? That's Vivian Brown. She's almost certainly a nuisance waiting to happen. You can smell the cigarettes on her. And her uniform?\" She pulled you in a few inches closer. \"She shortened it a few inches. I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound like... something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wonderful thing about vague comments is that the listener can interpret it anyway they desired. Gloria seemed particularly satisfied with your response. \"I almost feel bad for her roommate. Jenny is a bit of a space case so she no doubt gets dragged into all sorts of nonsense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back, she smiled once more. \"But no worries. As long as you stick with me, I'm sure we can steer you on a good path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strained to plaster a smile on your face. \"Glad to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe academy wasted little time dropping you right into its studies. Teachers quickly gave you work assignments that failed to catch you up on the lessons you had already missed. Very little sympathy was offered for your confusion. You were pretty much expected to just get right to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she was a bit overenthusiastic, you couldn't deny that Gloria was helpful. She offered some advice and tried to help you catch up on what details the teachers expected you to take for granted. Still, you weren't entirely sure yet if this was a person you wanted to befriend in the long-term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had run into your neighbors in the meantime. Vivian certainly stood out. She was one of the few students who had dyed her hair, a dark purple, against official school policy. She often wore a black leather jacket over her uniform. And you couldn't deny that the skirt did seem a little small on her. You couldn't deny, given your recent experiences with authority, there was something delightful about her general apathy towards anything an adult said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy comparison, Jennifer Fritz nearly flew past your radar. She was one of those people it was easy to let your eyes drift past. Her dreamy expressions were almost hidden behind her glasses and freckled face. At least her short hair made it easy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week into your stay at Willard's, you hadn't done much yet to engage with many of the girls. You were still a teen boy in here after all. It was hard enough handling the locker rooms, much less making conversation. You weren't even sure what a lot of them thought of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, having finally caught up enough to enjoy your lunch in somewhere other than the studyroom, maybe this was the time to do it. You entered the cafeteria, grabbing some surprisingly delicious food, and gazed over the tables. Gloria and a small posse of other girls had a table with a few free spaces. On the other hand, Jen was doodling in her notebook at a table all on her own. It might be nice to sit with someone quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, just outside the window and at the outside tables, you could spy Vivian kicking back with her own meal, fiddling with some smokes. It was hard to deny, she seemed pretty interesting. But you could only imagine Gloria getting huffy about associating with her. Did you really want that to deal with?</span></div></div>",

That was the first mostly-positive interaction you\u2019ve had with Gloria and it was\u2026 nice? Sure, she may be a little pretentious, but her heart was\u2026 close to the right place. Maybe being roommates wouldn\u2019t be tha\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden <i>ting</i> breaks the ambient noise of quiet chattering and clinking forks. Everyone at the table \u2014 and a few girls from neighboring ones \u2014 turn their heads curiously to the source of the noise. You follow suit, only differing by the expression of sheer dread on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria has stood up next to you, a glass of water in one hand and salad fork in the other. You plead with your eyes for her to <i>please <b>sit down</b></i>, but she receives your venom with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inclines a finger at you, and the number of faces meeting yours make you want to shrink down into your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, this is my roommate, Emily!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir faces are smooth, impassive masks. You wish you could make your shaky awkward smile match theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She\u2019s new, so she\u2019s a bit nervous, of course, so be sure to be extra nice to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiles break out on some of the faces. They run the gamut from simpering to barely-contained-mirth, but none of them look particularly genial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, of course, help her out loads so she doesn\u2019t have to associate with\u2026 troublemakers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazes pointedly at Vivian, who looks back at her \u2014 oh god, and <i>you</i> \u2014 with an expression of pure disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn summation, I want you to treat her as you would any one of us. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down with the same smug smile as before and silence reigns through the cafeteria. You keep your gaze fixated on your near-white plate, waiting for\u2026 you dunno, laughter? General mockery? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, Emily? Uh, how\u2019d you get your hair like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in surprise. The voice came from across the table, from a girl with equally blonde hair. You run a hand through a lock absentmindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I just brushed it a bunch after I woke up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks in bemusement. \u201cOh. I have to use a <i>ton</i> of conditioner to get it like yours. Mine tangles easily, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a silent nod and put both hands on your tray, ready to leave. You\u2019ve had enough discomfort for the rest of the <i>year</i>, let alone a lunch s\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you dye it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to not let your consternation show as you answer her question \u2014 and then the twenty other ones shot at you by your fellow table members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the \u2018cafeteria incident\u2019, your reputation is - to your horror - solidified. Getting in sight range of Vivian means you\u2019re in withering-glare-range. Even the easygoing Fritz keeps her distance from you, eyeing you nervously in the halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, you learn, is thanks to the wonderful reputation of your (apparently, permanent, to your dismay) lunch table. They\u2019re the cattiest clique in the school: most snippets of conversation that you catch are either scathing remarks on another student or an exchange of insipid compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Gloria is your island away from these inane conversations. She certainly harps on about \u2018proper behavior\u2019 and \u2018behaving as Agatha Willard would\u2019, but the worst impression she can have of someone is \u2018rule-breaker\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s both confusing and relieving that she\u2019s managed to garner a decent amount of respect at the lunch table, but you don\u2019t question it much, especially since a good deal of that social shield covers you. She\u2019s your (relative) island in the sea that you\u2019ve found yourself in, and she\u2019s a decent tutor when you get down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays come and pass, and lunches go along with them, and you slowly fall into the routine of school life...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just when you thought you should leave, she waves a hand. \"Feel free. No one owns space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down quickly, eager to eat the surprisingly nice food offerings. The benefits of a rich school, you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ate, you started to feel Jennifer's eyes on you. You glance up, and sure enough her glasses were squarely focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Your aura is all off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... aura?\" You already felt dread on your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So angry and mixed up... it's not like any of the girls around here. You must be so troubled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how quite to respond. You looked for an escape and spied the books next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... whatcha reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh- Investigations of the Inner Mind. It's about the spiritual center of our brains- the part that connects to spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. A total space case with a side of hippie and wannabe paranormal investigation. Perhaps this wasn't the quiet, unassuming table you were hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.

This was most definitely a girl's school: one lunch with Fritz was enough to get you barred from the other tables and cliques in school. Gloria quickly lost interest in helping you out. Surprisingly enough, Fritz turned out to be smarter in the regular classes than you gave her credit.

It should be one color most of the time, but it's changing so frequently. I think it means your soul is both comfortable and uncomfortable in its container.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Jen.\" You tried to keep off the harshest of your sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably tied to some strange event in your childhood. Something that would make you not feel right in your own skin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to tense. Okay, this was getting a little real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably something very supernatural.

I don't suppose there's a way to balance my aura in any way? Or undo whatever this... spirit did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it'd be very hard to get the proper materials to undo it. Spells and curses are hard on your soul, and it's been so long that it could be tied too deep to your soul to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders slumped. \"What about this... soul balance thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, with the right ingredients, you could change your aura to fit a different hue. It's quite an exhilarating experience, I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really understand this mumbo jumbo, but it sounded like you could maybe find a way out of this stupid body. \"Hey, we got time, I say we try that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Still a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, you gave it a good ol' college try. And that's all you could really do sometimes. There was no use getting upset over failure- sometimes you could do everything right and still fail. And that's okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched back, fluffing your hair a little. It was getting a bit long. You usually cut it around now. Hairdressers always recoiled at cutting it too short, so you stuck with as short as they'd allow. But actually, you found you didn't quite mind long hair as much as usual. In fact, maybe it was time to finally do something with it. Nothing fancy, of course. Just long enough to work into a ponytail. You nodded, smiling. That would be a good compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorrowing some of Gloria's make-up, you freshened yourself up a bit.

You shoved your head under the pillow, trying to drown out the sound. Couldn't Summer last one more week? Or even just one more day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whined and grumbled and tossed and turned, but eventually you forced yourself into an upright position. You slapped the alarm through bleary eyes and shifted off of the bed. The soft feeling of carpet in between your toes was a welcome relief as you shifted your way towards the bathroom, picking up your clothes for the day as you did so. Hopping into the shower, you let the warm water wash all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerns about seeing each other's bodies had vanished a long time ago. You knew you were growing and the beginnings of what would clearly become breasts in a few years was forming on your chest. You weren't entirely sure what was going to happen next to your body. You were still a bright blonde, but you knew people who's hair darkened as they got older. But the future was quite literally a problem for another time. At the moment, your concern was washing, drying, and getting to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudged out onto the kitchen's hard wood floors as Ethan and Sophie scurried around you, playing around with each other. You retrieved the Cheerios from the pantry and made up a breakfast for the three of you. Idly, you consider if you should start waking up earlier. Cheerios might be good for a quick breakfast, but the twins (and you) might need some more protein and fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance in surprise at the plate of toast and eggs before you. Your eyes followed the hairy hand holding the dang thing up to the mustachioed face of Emily's dad. He hadn't ever made breakfast for you before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Morning, dad.\" You accept the plate reluctantly, shifting to your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to your first day?\" An oddly excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Kind of, I guess. I'm not really sure what to expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ruffles your hair eagerly. \"Oh, don't worry about it, honey. My little girl will do just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strangled a huff. Honestly, you were 12, almost 13! That was <i>practically</i> an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate in silence for a while as Ethan and Sophie flung cheerios at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you're planning on going out in?\" You glance up at Emily's dad, sipping a cup of coffee casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You looked down. You weren't wearing anything crazy. In fact, it was pretty conservative. A sweater for the fall chills, jeans, maybe a jacket if necessary. \"What's wrong with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just think you'd look cute in one of the skirts I bought you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgggggghhhhhhhhh. \"I'm sure I'll be fine, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced, but shrugged. \"Just a thought. But make sure to freshen up. You look kind of tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired? What the heck was that supposed to mean? It was morning, of course you were tired. Your mind wracked for something you were missing. You suppose Emily's mom always spent a lot of time on her appearance each day, putting on make-up and drying her hair and so on. But you weren't really interested in something like that. That was girl stuff, and you were still a boy in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure your bags were packed, you started your move out the door. Spotting movement out of the corner of your eye, you reflexively glance to see your reflection staring back at you through the mirror. You pause, taking a moment to soak it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould people really notice that kind of thing? No one would make fun of you for something as small as that, right? What kind of people at school would care about something as stupid as that? Right, of course not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you still paused. This was middle school, after all. Things would be different. You couldn't help wondering if you should change something before you go </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ugh, you didn't have time for this. With a quick goodbye to Ethan and Sophie (you hoped Emily's mom woke up before Emily's dad left, someone had to keep an eye on those two), you strolled out the door and into the new world of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began your first day at Riverbank Middle School, so named for the river that cut its way through the end of the district. On paper, it might sound peaceful or tranquil to pass by the river on your way to school each day. In practice, it was dirty and gross to look at, polluted by various trash or even just the natural remains of nature sullying the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill. Its nice to see the ducks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you notice how much bigger the school is. In sixth grade, your elementary school was starting to feel like you were a giant in a tiny doll house. Now? Two floors, over a larger distance, with hundreds more kids in one building. The smell of hormones replaced glue and paint. God, you thought high school was the one where teens went wild, but suddenly you got the impression that middle school might be a bit different than what you expected. Boys wore jerseys, girls wore shorter shorts, and there wasn't a single goofy child's doodle pasted onto a wall. Lockers to decorate, banners on walls, and much much more. Voices from every direction, students and teens talking amongst themselves excitedly. Everyone was really growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly located your locker and started fishing through your bag for the combination the office had given you. You know you put it in one of these pockets, but where was it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hand shuffled through the backpack, a notebook spilled out onto the floor and right next to what appeared to be pink high-heeled schools. Your eyes shot up to see another girl in short shorts, a hot pink shirt with the word's \"Daddy's Girl\" bedazzled on the front, under a white jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" you apologized quickly, reaching down to pick up the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heel stomped down on the paper, tearing on the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you<i>doing</i> near <i>my</i> locker?\" Her voice was haughty and arrogant from the word go. A voice that just encapsulated the sheer aura of someone who had never been told \"no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced between the girl and the lockers. \"Uh, well I was given locker 126.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth curled into a frown. \"So I have to be next to some frumpy little potato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up sharply, utterly baffled by the words that left her mouth. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled on your hair, startling you backward. \"I mean, look at this. Are you even using conditioner? And your  <i>face</i>. Someone clearly isn't using moisturizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling spawned from a few feet away and you turned to see other girls pointedly not looking your way as they covered their clearly grinning mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell kinda business is yours about my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shoved your shoulders and you stumbled back several feet. \"Well, you've forced everyone to see your droopy little hair and sad little face already, so you've clearly <i>made it</i> my business.\" She shoved a finger at your chest. \"What's the sweater for, sweetie? Covering up a whole lot of nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputtered angrily, too overwhelmed and confused by the insults to come up with anything substantial. And before you could, the girl shoved you aside and continued on her way. \"I'll call you if I need someone to make me look even better. Ta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stand still in complete befuddlement as other girls giggled around you. What the hell was that? Talking about make-up and her clothes and all that shit? What brought that on? No one had cared about your appearance before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or maybe they had. You hadn't hung out with a lot of girls (not including Emily) and their lives were always different to yours. They had started caring about fashion and looks and all that junk. You were busy worrying about your lives, thinking about Ethan and Sophie at home. On tv, ads for girls were all about the hottest clothes and the best lipstick. In movies, women were always stunning, with never a hair out of place. You never truly realized that the world thought all that stuff applied to you. Girls were creatures of beauty and you had skipped your way through elementary school without getting too involved in that world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up you notebook and started shuffling things into the locker, trying not to think about that weird new feeling in your stomach. You had classes to focus on.</span></div></div>",

They had a plethora of targets and you were just another dot on the horizon of insults and rudeness that were hashed out across the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ignore them. You knew you would get in trouble for fighting and you didn't even want to. You didn't even care about your appearance, it was Emily's body! But something about her words really startled to needle at you. You found yourself glancing into the mirror more often, trying to figure out what was wrong with you. Other than the obvious wrong body situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried making other friends, but nothing was working out. People kept looking at you in weird ways. Girls laughed when they thought you weren't listening. Teachers would stop to ask if you were getting enough sleep, since you didn't look like the other girls in their make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Emily herself wasn't any use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we talked about this,\" she tried to explain. \"This is middle school. People are gonna talk if a boy and a girl hang out all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your emotions buried under the surface. \"So, what, you're scared people will <i>gossip</i> if we hang out? You'd rather pal around with the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged helplessly. \"I mean, they're gross, but they're not that bad. You're the one who won't make friends with the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They won't talk to me!</i> your mind screams. <i>No one will talk to me! Can't you see I'm all alone?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever,\" you shrug, turning away. \"Like I care what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou here her mumble \"Douche\" under her breath and you feel the pit grow in your stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they all knew you were different? Could they all just sense you were a boy and wanted you gone? Or maybe you were just....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought much of the idea of girl drama. But you had to remind yourself constantly that's what it was. That it was just girls being catty. That it was entirely on them. They were just words, words that shouldn't even apply to you. But you felt gross. You felt weird, gross, and unwanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudge home, a month into the school year. You manuever around the twins, you shuffle into your room, and you feel the weight of the overwhelming loneliness all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you break, collapsing into the bed, tears falling down your cheeks. God, you were crying. <i>Crying.</i> You really were becoming a girl after all. But what was the use? What was the use caring about being manly anymore? You couldn't fight, you couldn't pound out your emotions into a punching bag or a pink-shaped target, or you'd just receive more abuse at school. Your parents didn't know who you were anymore and Emily's parents had little to no interest in any of their kids, much less you. Any outlet for these emotions you once had has been ripped away from you. The only thing that was yours was your tears, and god dammit you were gonna own those tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour, you just stare up at the ceiling, completely drained. There... had to be something you could do. Something to change things. If not at school, at least for you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't believe you were doing this. It was probably creepy or something, right? But after all the rudeness and snide comments, you had to try something. <i>Anything.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started with Emily's mom. She seemed like she had to know something about this, right? You approached the room cautiously, peering in on the mother watching tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, mom? Can you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Emily.\" She didn't even look at you. \"Mommy's busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take what you could out of this old broad and nabbed some supplies from her bathroom before retreating back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left your second source: the internet. You weren't exactly surprised by the sheer weight of the online resources available, but it was immediately overwhelming. You didn't even know where to start! Eventually, you managed to track-down some beauty site's \"Introduction to Make-Up.\" Items in bold and colorful fonts sprang at you through the phone browser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Moisturizer.</b> Melissa mentioned that, right? According to the guide, it had something to do with preventing wrinkles. That didn't really seem like a concern for you right now. Maybe some other time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Primer</b> There was a <i>primer</i> to make-up? You skimmed the text, reading something about sealing pores and preventing acne. Deciding not to take the risk, you squirt a bit of \"Ultra Face Base Primer\" into your hand and wipe it around your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Foundation</b> seemed important and it was the one you had the most confusion over. You pat the little powder foundation pads with a brush and touched up your face a little. You weren't sure there was much of a different at first, but gradually you began to notice that your face really was starting to seem... smoother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went step by step through each material and every instruction, skipping over things that looked superfluous and using whatever seemed useful. You washed your hair, careful not to mess with your work so far, and ldried it according the the instructions. Eyeshadow seemed like a pointless one, but you reluctantly picked a color that didn't seem over the top and applied it carefully. You applied a light blush and almost immediately noticed how much <i>brighter</i> your face looked. It seemed to pop with more life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the lipstick. You had assumed this would have been the only step at first, not expecting all these details. You tried to find a color that wasn't too noticeable, something that fit the rest of your face. A soft pink hue was pressed against your lips, slowly, with precision and carefully following the guides in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back from the mirror to view your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl looked back. She had curly blonde hair, no longer wild and unbrushed from showers. Her face glowed, with all the little blemishes invisible under the surface of paint that had been carefully applied. Her tired eyes now seem brighter and more awake than they had just minutes ago. What had seemed pale now seemed colorful and full of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You</i> looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou <i>felt</i> cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested a hand on your cheek, a smile softly growing. It was hard to believe that was you looking back. Sure, you were a boy and you still wanted to be, honestly, really, but... you couldn't help but feel good, for once, looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....What else could you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drifted back into your room and into the closet and dresser, picking out clothes you had long ignored. Careful not to destroy your work, you slipped on a skirt and a blouse that, as far as you could tell, seemed to match. You turned back to the mirror and had to take another moment to register it all. A girl in a skirt, looking like she's just found comfort after a long road of suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was <i>you</i> who looked that sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twirled around, admiring the swirl of the skirt, the smile in the reflection, the feeling of... happiness. God, you haven't been happy in years and yet some face-paint and a piece of cloth hanging from the waist was actually cheering you up. You had to laugh at the sheer absurdity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did. You laughed loud, for a second, before you tried something softer. A giggle instead of a chuckle. And then you had to giggle at the fact you were giggling and liking the sound and a whole cycle of girlish laughter and amusement sparkled into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was probably some commentary about gender roles to be had here, but at the moment you couldn't be bothered to care. Being a girl, if it meant feeling like this.... suddenly didn't seem so bad.</span></div></div>",

In fact it seemed like the two of you had stsrted giving up on ever switching back, instead accepting that they were stuck in eachother's bodies forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for yourself, things couldn't have gotten better these last two years.  As you started to embrace your feminine side, you eventually were able to befriend the other girls.  As you made friends, you engaged in more activities with the girls, such as slumber parties and even cheerleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily on the other hand, while he had gotten a few friends by now, had gotten a reputation as a shy, quiet loner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two haven't talked much the past 2 years, each caught up in y'all's own lives.  However for some reason on this very day, when you spotted him at his locker, you couldn't help but feel concerned - or at least some kind of yearning.  As much as you couldn't stand Emily back in elementary and high school you had to admit you kind of missed when the two of you tried to help eachother coordinate their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour now BBF, Leslie, notices you staring at Emily.  \"Something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to her, \"nah, I'm good\", brushing off your recent thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ought to be heading to Cheerleader practice\" Leslie says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we don't wanna be late\" you say.  Head walk off with your BFF, but you couldn't help but look back at your old body.  You couldn't help but feel sorry for him.  You couldn't help but feel... something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerleading practice went very well.  Now that you had become the cheerleading captain, you were popular with all the other cheerleaders.  Though much to your annoyance, the football players would not stop trying to hit on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are boys always this pushy\" you think to yourself.  Only to realize the irony in thinking this considering that you were once a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, as the other girls head to the locker rooms,  you spot a familiar face at the bleachers.  Your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Emily, he seemed to be reading a book of some kind.  Again, you had this urge to come talk to him after all this time.

You still kick yourself sometimes for that one. She was from a good rich family and she still has a figure to die for. Your wife however after two kids had a figure. Now all she has is an ever increasing waist line and an ever increasing bad attitude. You can't seem to do anything right by her. You feel she's always watching you waiting for you to make a mistake so she can pounce on it and tell you what a pathetic piece of shit you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You're so thankful the company you work for still sends you to seminars so you can get away from it. This one has been great. A group of swimsuit models are staying at the same hotel as you. You over heard they have a shoot in the area. You time your trips to the pool to when they're there. You then dream about them at night. \"What a fucking life. I bet those girls didn't have to bust their ass in school. They'll live off their looks as long as they can and right before they end their career modeling they'll hook some rich guy\", you mutter. You're jealous and you know it. Why wouldn't you be? It looks like a great life even though their chicks. You've been wondering about that as well. The media and society has always said that women have it so hard. These girls don't look like their suffering all that much. It's the men that get taken advantage of as far as you can tell. Your own life is a good example of that. Your wife has a job where she sits on her fat ass all day. She puts out a fraction of the workload you do in a day and bitches about why she doesn't get paid more. \"I'd get fired if I worked as little as she does\", you think to yourself. You look at the models again and mutter, \"Fucking bitches got it good\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly everything seems to freeze, even you. \"I've had enough of your complaining. You think those girls have it so good I'm going to give you the chance to find out\", a voice out of no where says. \"What the fuck\", you mutter right before you pass out. You wake up to someone shaking you and saying, \"Michelle, let's go before you burn\".

Your body seems different for some reason, as if there is a huge weight on top of your chest and stomach weighing you down, and you find it rather difficult to stand up. \"What the hell - -\" you squeaked, in a rather feminine voice that was definitely not your own. As you pushed yourself up, to see what's going on, you feel long hair tickling at your back and find yourself having great difficulty bending at the waist, almost as if your belly had swollen up or something. That's when finally, you gaze down over your odd feeling body and get the biggest shock of your life when you are confronted with two extraordinary large breasts pushing out of a red bikini top, and below, a gigantic pregnant bump leading down to a pair of long, slender female legs, with brightly painted red toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Holy crap!\" you shout, jumping up off the sunbed, as best as you can manage, the incredible weight of your front slowing you down somewhat, as you feel a twang of pain up your back. \"Ow, shit, that hurt!\" Steadying yourself, you looked down again, in absolute shock and amazement by what you were seeing; this was not your body! Bringing your hands up in front of your face, you studied the long slender fingers, nails painted red to match your toes, several rings decorating them, then began to poke and prod at your new face, noticing the smooth feminine skin and lack of stubble, your short hair was now long and sleek, currently held back in a ponytail. \"This is unreal,\" you thought, brushing your hands over the two large mounds on your chest, then over the tight stretched skin of your swollen belly.

It was rather a bizarre thing to be staring at, your own face, that you'd only ever seen in a mirror, now operating independently of you, like you were having an out of body experience (which you guessed you kind of were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I'm this pregnant lady,\" you thought, watching yourself closely, \"does that mean she's me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed there was only one way to find out, and headed across the pool towards yourself.</span></div></div>",

I know this sounds crazy but are you me your body Smiles Wylie and starts laughing. No it replies your me. You asked for an explanation and your body starts giggling apparently the body you're in now is known as Amy she is 25 years old and currently seven and a half months pregnant. She goes on to tell you that seven and a half months ago she went to a party and blacked out when she woke up several days later she found out she was pregnant she doesn't know who the father is and doesn't want to raise a child alone though she was looking for somebody to swap bodies with their she wouldn't have to deal having a child and to get a fresh start. You stare wide-eyed in shock. All you can stammer out is how how is that even possible. She holds up a small metal coin. This this is how I did it she remarks saying that to us with an very old coin she got on a vacation a long time ago and it hasn't power to swap two Souls to each other's bodies in addition allowing you to access certain memories of the host body you are currently in to fit in more easily you reach forward as as you can but your current condition and slower reflexes prevent you from reaching it in time as your body pulls it away quickly waving a finger at you saying no no no. She goes on to tell you that she plans on keeping your body seeing as how she doesn't want to go through childbirth or have to rate the child on her own. You shout that's not fair I shouldn't have to pay for your mistake she replied by saying too bad it's my call then gets up walks off and says maybe after the child is born I'll swap us back who knows it all depends on whether I like this body more than the one you're in. Then Amy in your body runs out of the building and to your car and starts leaving you try to catch up but with the added weight and unfamiliar body you are unable to catch her in time and before you know what she is gone you slowly sit back down and weigh your options on what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Even though it made no sense, somehow you were still you. You then considered for a moment that maybe the pregnant woman could just be pretending she was you, but that really made no sense either. Why the hell would anyone want to be you? And why was every move your body made, every facial expression, exactly the same as you'd seen in the mirror for the last 16 years? No, you were right the first time, you were definitely still in your own body, you just happened to be in some pregnant woman's body at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urm, Miss? Are you okay?\" you heard your own voice ask, snapping you out of your thoughts, seeing your face staring up at you, looking a little weirded out (much like the face you were currently wearing must look). This was too freaky, you had to have a seat, have a seat and figure out what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, eh, no. I think I need a lie down,\" you told him, and turned and quickly walked away, back towards the sunbed you'd just come from. You could tell that your former body was watching you as you went, no doubt wondering what the hell that was all about (and if you knew yourself, probably checking out your ass too), but you kept on walking, more than a little weirded out yourself.</span></div></div>",

You then noticed a blue flowery beach bag lying next to the bed, and figured it must have belonged to whoever you now are. \"Better find out who I am, I guess,\" you though, reaching down and picking it up. Inside you found a large fluffy blue towel, some sandals, a pair of immaculately folded jeans and a pink top as well as a few shower products, and right at the very bottom, hidden beneath the towel, a small black purse. Opening up the purse, you immediately came across a credit card and read the name that was on it out loud to yourself, \"\"Samantha Harris\", guess that's me.\" You continued your search of the purse and soon found a drivers license that contained most of the relevant pieces of information about your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, lets see now,\" you said, scanning over the drivers license, \"So my name is Samantha Harris, I'm 30 years old and I apparently live on the other side of town than I used to. Well, that's handy.\" You then looked at the photo on the card, staring at what you realized was now your new face, a little shocked to see a rather pretty woman, with long brown hair and brown eyes. \"Hello me,\" you smiled slightly, not quite believing you were now this very pretty woman that was currently staring out at you, wearing a rather dazzling smile. It was during this strange stare off with a plastic card that you suddenly felt something move inside your stomach, hitting at the walls of your belly. \"Holy crap!\" you exclaimed loudly, quickly covering your mouth, realizing what it was you were experiencing; the baby that was now growing inside you was moving around, kicking at your new womb. Your hands immediatly went to your belly, as if steadying it somehow would stop the little life within you from moving about, but it didn't work as the baby continued shifting inside. \"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!\" you screamed inside your head, the bizarre alien sensations coming from inside you being a little much to take, on top of everything else that had just occurred. Even though you knew that you had somehow become this pregnant woman, it wasn't until the baby started moving that it became totally real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the purse and it's contents back into the beach bag, your grabbed it in one hand, supporting your large belly with the other and moved as quickly as you could across the pool towards the changing rooms, no longer prepared to just sit there casually while all this weirdness was going on.</span></div></div>",

You shuffle back to the bench where to set your bag down and rummage around to produce some fade blue skinny jeans and a pink tank top from it. You seize the jeans and attempt to bend down to insert your legs in the pants but your protruding stomach protests even the slightest bend at your middle. You sigh and sit on the bench to try attempt numero duo. This time it's a relative success, you manage to get your feet though the pant legs and begin pulling them up. You encounter another problem when you try fastening the button and fly of the jeans over your swollen waist. \"Oh well,\" You think, \"I give up.\" You surrender to the will of the jeans and leave the zip undone. You try to see how the jeans look on you but you can't see past that dreaded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the easy part.\" You muse as you grab the shirt. The shirt has \"Loading Baby\" written on it in white with a graphic of a loading bar that is almost complete. You start to think about what will happen when that loading bar reaches the end - You, a sixteen year old boy, looking after a baby alone. You feel a shiver run down your spine at the thought of it. The group of hot teenage girls that you were checking out only an hour ago enter the room. The sound of their gossiping dialogue interrupts your tortured thoughts. You watch as they put their bags down to the left of yours. There are 3 of them; one is a tall thin blonde, the other a short curvy brunette and finally the third is an average height girl with dark almost black hair and perfect figure. You find yourself still attracted to the dark haired girl. \"Well I guess I'm a lesbian then.\" You ponder sarcastically. You look at her again. She has beautiful stone blue eyes, perfect fair skin and modest curves. When she notices you looking at her she smiles before asking, \"When's the baby due?\" <br>\r\nYou look down at your tummy and say, \"In another 4 weeks I guess.\"  <br>\r\n\"Oh okay. I thought you would be due earlier because you look ready to pop now but I guess you just have a big baby.\" Exclaims the dark haired girl.<br>\r\nYou nod it agreement. \"I can't wait till I get pregnant\" Says the girl. Her friends look at her surprised and mock her. <br>\r\n\"Haha guys.\" She says. \"It's just that I find pregnancy a beautiful thing. A gift that only women have.\" You blush. \"Not only women\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the girl and wonder whether you should put the top on and go to your car or continue conversing with this unusual hot girl.</span></div></div>",

Going further into the bag, you pulled out a pair of sandals and slipped your feet gently into each one. They didn't have heels, which was good as you probably wouldn't be able to balance on them. Then, you put away all the wet gear into the bag and got up, a little hard with the added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing\" you said to yourself as you began walking out.

Even though you knew that you had somehow become this pregnant woman, it wasn't until the baby started moving that it became totally real.You grab your belly in one hand, supporting your large belly with the other and moved as quickly as you could across the pool towards your old self, but you look up only to see that he/you are gone...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All O had to do was put them together and concentrate on creating another person of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A cloud of smoke appears for a brief moment and when it clears I don't see another of myself, I look at my hands and they look different for the 3rd time, I performed the transformation jutsu and I look like myself!!!

This is assumed to be the child link timeline and you are in love with him, how can you be in love with him this just should not happen.<br>\r\n You step out of the water and begin to pace back and forth in angst, the more you thought of your situation, the more you think of link, the more you feel jealous about his relationships and love him. You try to think of something else but it is an endless loop, it has only been half a minute and you can't handle what Ruto supposedly had to handle for seven years. Link was gone for seven years maturing and he is out in Kokiri village and you love Link and no, you have to resist the urges, you have to be strong, strong like link ahh, darn it.<br>\r\n You head out preparing things like rations, a backpack with supplies and then you head out on a journey to Kokiri Village first thing in the morning, but during the night. You couldn't sleep.<br>\r\n You toss and turn and adjust yourself but your body keeps squirming for link for him to do it with you. You reach down and feel your hand reach for what you didn't have in your previous life, no, you have to be strong, have to resist, Ruto you mustn't do this!!! You relieve your stress almost all night before the next day when you will see Link, but You don't want to let this body anywhere near him, to bad you don't have a choice.<br>\r\n You head out in the hyrule fields heading for Kokiri village to where Link lives, ready to face the challenges and see link, the map to the village is ingrained into your brain, you who has played Ocarina of Time, you are the map that Ruto needed to get to Link, you are both Ruto and an otherworlder.</span></div></div>",

But you were too tired to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groggily brought a hand to your head, eyes still shut. You felt as if you had fought an entire army in one day. Yet all you had done was take a short nap at the pool while thinking about your favorite game series, \"Metroid\" and it's star, Samus Aran. Your sore muscles raised a few questions. Had you gotten sunburnt in your sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your eyes, expecting the bright sun to be beating down on you. Only to find yourself staring up into the stars. Now your mind was turning. Did you really sleep that long? But if you did, why hadn't pool authorities woken you up at closing time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then other questions came into your head. if you were staring at the night sky, then where were the recognizable constellations? Big Dipper? Orion? The stars you were staring at seemed to be from a completely different solar system!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you took into account what you were laying on. It certainly didn't have the strong, texture of the lounging chairs at the pool. Here, it felt, soft and comfortable. Like a couch or bed. Had you gone home and fallen asleep in front of your tv with a movie on? If so, why didn't you remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were processing what the Hell was going on, a few strands of blonde hair fell into your vision. You didn't have blonde hair! At least not long enough to get into your face. What happened to you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediatly sit up, and are greeted by even more discoveries (and even more messy hair in your face). You were currently in what seemed to be a very spacious apartment, but with a very sci-fi feeling to it. With the walls very simple in shape and being mainly white with hints of blue. Mainly lining doorways, also having a very futurisic look. With a large window looking out into the depths of space. Under most  circumstances you would be amazed, but you were currently confused, and scared. These feelins only became worse when you took in the changes to your own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than looking down at your relatively fit, (but not athletic) body, you were instead staring at a very female, very clearly athletic body, with breasts that while not huge, seemed to reach just passed C-Cup level. Your hips being defined, with mouth watering well toned thighs. Your attire seeming to be an orange leotard with a triangle in the middle, showing a fair amount of clevage, your pants also being pretty tight, leaving little to the imagination. But why did you feel something that clearly wasn't normal hair underneath those mini-shorts?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What th-\" You immediately clap your slender, but fairly muscular hands over your mouth. You weren't expecting you to really have much from your normal form, but you certainly weren't prepaired for the very feminine voice that came out of your mouth! While it had a pretty tough tone, it was clearly a woman's voice. It kind of sounded familiar too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't concerned with that, looking over at the window in the large living space, you needed to see your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got to your feet, almost falling forward due to your shift in center of gravity, and slowly walked to the window. And what you saw, made your jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour, no, <i>her</i> face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a face that often chanded between graphical updates of consoles, but it was the face you knew from the plenty of hours you had put into the Metroid Prime Trilogy, and even Other M...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" You began, \"Samus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you had become the legendary Bounty Hunter...</span></div></div>",
