It was rank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What am I doing in a swamp?\" The sakura saber pondered. She didn't have the means of contacting Chaldea to find out what went wrong. Not with out her master anyways. However, if Okita had ended up in this swamp then maybe her master did do. She just had to find them. But where to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To Okita's left was path covered in vines and vegetation, but without her sword maneuvering would be difficult. The path on her right was clear, but it appeared to be a game trail and a quick cough was enough to remind Okita that she was frailer than other servants. The sakura saber could forward wading through the water, but who knew what was lurking in there. Another option Okita could climb up a tree and try to get the lay of the land; the only problem was that she was not an archer. Okita was deciding what to do when she...</span></div></div>",

Each of its eyes was easily twice the size of Okita's head. She had no doubt that it could swallow her if it wanted to, but thankfully it was looking in a different direction and hadn't noticed her yet. Okita knew she should probably leave while she had the chance but something about the shear size of this amphibian seemed to keep her glued to that spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How does a frog get that big?\" Okita wondered out loud.
