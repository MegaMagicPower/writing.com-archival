The last trainer she had faced lost here so as punishment, she decided to swallow her up along with her Pokemon. Well, not really punishment. Lately Sabrina had been ravenously hungry and needed food something fierce. In a fit one day, her appetite got the better of her and she swallowed up one of the trainers who came to this Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste had been so delectable that she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she decided recently to use her position as Gym Leader like a ploy of sorts; whenever trainers came to challenge her and lost, she would swallow them up for a nice, quick and easy meal. Sabrina purred as she rubbed her swollen belly, which grounded her thanks to how packed full it was. She couldn't wait to see what happened when she digested her meal. One thing she noticed was that heavy meals like this, of course, were chock full of calories. She could easily pack on a large amount of weight from even her \"Small\" meals. Not that she minded of course. As long as the meals were good, what was some extra fat anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina yawned as she laid back. She figured now was as good a time as any to sleep, let her meal digest and become plush, jiggly body fat for her to enjoy, licking her lips once more on reflex as she rubbed her large, bulging and packed full belly.</span></div></div>",

She sits down and orders a 10 stack of pancakes with chocalate and caramel sauce (this a lot for her). After an hour the waitres comes and said that they just started cooking her food and that it will be ready in half an hour. She waits and the waitres says the food will take another hour to prepare. Sabrina gets angry so she stands up and holdes the waiter and puts the waiters head in her mouth and swollows her. She goes straight to her belly which makes it stick out a lot. She then goes into the kitchen and swollows him whole. This is to much for her top and trousers. They rip and now she is standing in the kitchen in only her bra and underwear. She then decides to not let the food go to waste and eats all of the food in the kitchen which is a lot. Shortly after she eates the last burger her underwear and bra snap. Now she is standing in the kitchen naked. She hears a door open and quickly uses her physic powers to telaport home. She then goes into bed and sleeps.

I know being a Gym Leader can be slow, but this is ridiculous,\" Sabrina muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been three weeks since the last trainer had come to the gym. In those three weeks she had run out of things to occupy her time. Training her pokemon was pointless if no one came to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like they need it,' she thought with pride at the strength of her pokemon. Sadly the thought only lifted her spirits for a short time. Running her hand through her metallic blue hair one last time, she got up from couch and walked into her kitchen for something to eat. Walking to the her fridge, she begins to pull out a pre-made green salad. Something behind it catches her eye, reaching passed the salad, she pulls out a plate with a piece of chocolate cake on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm, I don't remember putting this in the fridge.' She thought. Suddenly the memory come to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey cuz,\" said a loud teen age girl as she twirled in a circle in front of Sabrina. Sabrina just glared at her cousin. <br>\r\n\"What do you want, Sonia?\" The young girl twisted her cyan colored hair. <br>\r\n\"You missed my birthday,\" Sabrina's eyes soften. <br>\r\n\"Sonia, I am so sorry. I have been so busy at the gym I forgot.\"\"I know so I brought you a piece of birthday cake.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sonia.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a fork from the silverware drawer, she sat down at the table. She stared at the cake for a few minutes. 'When was the last time I had sweets?' She looked down at her trim, fit body. She had worked so hard to keep herself fit. Shaking herself out of her thought, she shrugged. 'One piece of cake isn't going to kill me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a small bite of cake, she nearly dropped her fork. \" Oh my god!!!\" she whispered breathlessly. The sudden burst of flavor caught her off guard. She quickly devoured the cake. Leaning back in her chair and sighed in content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRing, Ring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she made her way to the phone.</span></div></div>",

Sapphire got a belly that stuck out 2 feet from another of the men. Yellow got a belly that stuck out 3 feet from the last man.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina the Psychic Pokemon Master of Saffron City entered the main battling arena from her meditation chambers to meet the opposing trainer in her gym. At first glance, he looked like your run of the mill curious trainer from some podunk town. But with her universally synced mind, Sabrina was mentally blown away from his immense aura. This kid was not your average trainer, no one could match that level of determination even with years of mastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly impressed, Sabrina smirked and placed her hand on her hips to strike a pose. She began her practised opening monologue that she had repeated to other kids hundreds of times. \u201cI knew you were coming...three years ago I had a vision of your arrival.\u201d She lied to the kid, who raised his eyebrows in slight shock. While Sabrina can predict when and who will enter her gym, she focuses her Psychic powers on more pressing work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're after my Badge. I don't enjoy battling, but it's my duty as a Leader to confer Badge on anyone who has proven himself worthy.\u201d Again, she lied. Sabrina does not let anybody know this, but she actually loves to battle her Pokemon. The shedding of their Psychic attacks is absorbed into her soul, making her even more powerful as a Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you wish it, I will show you my psychic powers!\" With that, Sabrina ended her speech and called out her first Pokemon. Tossing her Pokeball into the air, the metallic sphere opened to spew out liquid light. From that light came the Sun Pokemon, Espeon, already in an attack stance. The child on the other end of the battlefield and appraised the Psychic Eeveelution to determine the best course of action. After some time, the kid finally revealed his opposing Pokemon, a Beedrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina once again felt the energy of the cosmos flow through her blood. She could feel the impossible strength of the bond between the Beedrill and it\u2019s trainer. The look the two of them shared was not that of bond between master and slave; it was a special kinship forged in fire that could not be broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Sabrina, the resulting surge in energy from the great beyond had altered her physical figure. Instead of absorbing into her soul like her Pokemon attacks, the energy stuck to her body in the form of fat. It was hardly noticeable, a sliver of jiggle weight on her stomach and arms; but it was there. It was hungry from more of this kid\u2019s auru to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon, use Psychic!\u201d Sabrina ordered, starting the battle off. The Sun Pokemon\u2019s eyes glowed neon pink, and a beam of raw energy burst from it\u2019s forehead, aimed right at the Beedrill in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeedrill, dodge it!\u201d The kid instructed. The Beedrill effortlessly move out of the beam\u2019s way, forcing it to crash into the wall behind him. Sabrina, once again, felt the rush of power from the Universe as she absorbed both her Pokemon\u2019s attack and the Trainer\u2019s aura. Her frame bloated again, this time even more pronounced as more energy was flooded into her body. She had no idea what it was doing her waistline, but Sabrina was left wanting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-confusion!\u201d Sabrina ordered, a bit excited from her last surge. The Espeon worlessley obeyed and casted it\u2019s attack. The Beedrill couldn't dodge it this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut much to the Espeon\u2019s own confusion, the Beedrill did not even flinch as it\u2019s mind turned into mush. No crossed yes or frantic movements, absolutely nothing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeedrill, take advantage and use Poison Jab!\u201d The Kid ordered. To both the Espeon\u2019s and Sabrina\u2019s shock, the Beedrill simply gritted it\u2019s teeth and turned it\u2019s head to the side violently, casting off the confusion like swatting a fly. With incredible speed it zoomed across the field and delivered a poison laced blow to the Psychic Eeveelution, knocking it to ti\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Sabrina\u2019s body not only expanded, but also blew up. Her slim, washboard stomach now carried a potbelly, her breasts and ass ballooning out somewhat, stretching against the fabric of her clothes. Her hips and thighs grew, and her facial featured became less defined. And although she still has failed to recognize her new weight, the Kid and the Beedrill certainly have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sabrina asked impatiently as the two of them tilted their heads at Sabrina\u2019s fattened body. Was she like this when the battle started? \u201cStop staring at me and get on with the battle! Espeo, use Psybeam!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the battle continued, the overpowered Beedrill and the rest of the Kid's Pokemon easily crushing Sabrina's team of three. And all the while, she became fatter and fatter, much to the shock of the opposing trainer and his Pokemon. By the end of it all, the Kid and won, and Sabrina had expanded to...</span></div></div>",

On top of it, the other fellow Kanto female Gym Leaders agreed and got Sabrina hooked onto a \"blind date\" of sorts. What's more, she had to wear a fancy red dress the was strapless and had a slit exposing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a break from the monotony I suppose. Maybe the guy is nice...\" pondered the psychic.

Now one thing she knew that her blind date was loaded, but that made the psychic at unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe he is one of the rich cocky types...well...no time to ponder, better head on in' thought the obsidian haired beauty. She walked on in and meet the front desk. The Yellow Wing had a <i> front desk</i> for crying out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, I was wondering if the reservation for a Sabrina Hawthorne is on your list?\" asked Sabrina to the front desk man. He looked down to check on his PC screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. You're other guest as arrived about 5 minutes, please come in\" soothed the man as he escorted Sabrina to the dining room, which looked like something out of a palace. Chandeliers, fancy paintings and curtains, ice sculptures, everything. It made Sabrina feel a bit small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has reached the table, and to her surprise, sitting down waiting for her in a fancy suit was none other than Ethan Goldstein, the boy who became Johto's Regional Champion and the man who attempted to climb the Kanto Elite 4 ladder at Mt.

Upon further inspection, he has gained some weight when they last met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's face was still the same, but his belly was a bit wide, in addition to thicker legs and a plumper backside. Still, her psychic powers told her that Ethan is happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you are the blind date Misty set me up for, is that right?\" asked the boy. He was still a bit handsome, even with the extra pudge. Sabrina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she set me up as well.\" They sat down at the table and placed the napkins on their laps and looked at their menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna order first? I'm starving!\" said Sabrina. Ever since she was able to get in tune with the cosmos and become enlightened, an odd feeling radiated from her stomach, as if she was hungry. Ethan beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid you'd never ask! Don't worry about the bill it's on me\" winked the Johto champion. Sabrina was touched by the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you Ethan\" smiled the psychic. The waiter then arrived. Ethan ordered 3 tofu prime ribs meals, which included mash potatoes and biscuits for each meal. As for Sabrina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll order a...\" her first thought was to say 'garden salad' but something told her to order something more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have what my date is having, in addition to two Magikarp filets\" finished the psychic. The waiter nodded as he wrote it down and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry tonight\" chuckled the bigger boy. Sabrina read his emotions, he was attracted no doubt, but also there was a hint of amusement and playfulness as well. Sabrina blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's quite stressful being a Gym Leader and all that. And a girl needs to eat\" explained the girl. Ethan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, cool. So what have you been up to?\" asked Ethan as he started to munch on a breadstick, Sabrina took one too. She shrugged as she ate. Once she finished she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the usual, challengers here and there. Fanmail. Honing my psychic pokemon and what not. You seem to be rather well and healthy yourself\" said the psychic as she reached for another breakstick. Ethan smiled, which Sabrina found....attractive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Life as a champion is great! I live in a villa, I got a few maids, a pokemon practice field. This is the life right here! Although, since I'm not walking around as much as when I was in the hunt for the Pokemon League, I have put on a few\" chuckled the champion as he patted his gut. Sabrina sensed happiness and then...disappointment perhaps? She didn't want to make him feel down...he hasn't done any perverted stuff as of yet, not to mention he is genuinely nice. Perhaps he could...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, you look great. More healthy than that last time we fought! In fact, you can call me crazy, but the extra weight...looks rather good on you\" smiled the psychic. Ethan looked touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that? My friend Lyra has been egging at me to stop playing video games and exercise, but you think that um...\" he puased, blushing and shuffling in his seat. It made him look cute \"my fat looks good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I do. In fact, I have been meaning to ask you: how is the <i> chubby</i> life like anyway?\" asked the girl. She has been bored, communing with the cosmos being one of the only habits that she has been doing. Maybe a break from the monotony may be sufficient. She saw herself, with bigger breasts(she was jealous of Claire and Lorelai's bust size, she was a modest B-cup, while those two in the D's.), larger birth giving hips, plumper thighs, a soft round tummy. For whatever reason, Sabrina felt that...she wanted to try this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...as you can tell I am a bit 'bigger'. In addition I feel a bit more healthy(as my mom says). There is uh... certain plushness and all to me\" the boy paused blushing. The tray with the food arrived courtesy of a Chansey, who bowed and walked off. The couple salivated at the glistening food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna put our conversation on hold? The problem of being a chubby kid like me, eat first, ask questions later\" chuckled the younger boy. Sabrina smacked her lips, her stomach sending that same strange feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Shall we dig in?\" asked the psychic, sending a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the couple, much to the surprise of other patrons, finished the food which was enough to feed two families in under a half hour. Ethan's belly poked as his shirt rode up, his chair having a little creak due to the 200 pound plus boy. The 115 pound(but not for long...) Sabrina had finished too, the bulge in her belly evident of food and...</span></div></div>",

It hurt, but at the same time it was just so~ good~. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This feeling...it hurts but yet...it's so good...' thought Sabrina as she closed her eyes in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked on at his date with transfixed eyes, entranced as the psychic shuffled a bit in her chair as she caressed her rock hard belly. He was starting to feel a bit aroused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh...got room for desert?\" asked the 13 year old boy. Courtesy of his enlarged gut, he can contain more(despite the massive meal he has already consumed). Sabrina opened her eyes and let out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason...I am filled to the brim but yet...I feel that I should eat more! Yes Ethan, I would be happy to\" she gave another moan \"have the last course\". Ethan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" He raised his hand for the waiter, who gave him a menu. He checked the desert options which included a Towering Powdered Funnel Cake, a 9-layered chocolate yellow cake, a 12 scoop sundae, and a special hot chocolate chip cookie cake with vanilla ice cream on top! Ethan was salivating...He handed the menu to Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sabrina? Anything you like?\" Asked the champion. Sabrina began to read the menu. For whatever reason, she seemed to be transfixed on having one of each, but yet after eating that humongous dinner, how could her stomach, which is the size of her fist, could consume more? Then a vision came to the psychic as she saw the cosmos...space, planets, and galaxies all around her. Stars being born, galaxies spinning, nebulas forming. She sat down, and saw herself sitting next to the great creator of the stars, the Pillars of Creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: google it. It's an awesome nebula).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat between the pillars as if it was a throne and then suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina reopned her eyes, menu still in hand. Even with the pain and pleasure of being stuffed, she needed more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ethan\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I talk to you after our desert? Oh, and we will share one of each\". Ethan's eyes rose up. One of each desert, all big and huge with 1500+ calories! Ethan dumbly nodded. The waiter nodded and took the menu away. Ethan looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina what's up? You can tell me\" said the younger bigger boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ethan...you see...I want to try something new for a change.\" said the psychic, still caressing her belly with one hand and sipping water with her other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is...I wanted to see what it is like...you know..being fat. Being big, being plushy. I've never had such an experience before and I wish to try it out\" explained Sabrina. Ethan's eyes rose up. Here, this beautiful obsidian haired psychic wants to get huge, like he is! Besides, it wouldn't hurt having a partner in gaining right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great Sabrina. I support your decision as Johto champion!\" said Ethan with a gusto as he undid his belt. He knew he was not going to be needing it soon...Sabrina chuckled with a lady like grace due to his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see then I'm glad. This date has been quite fruitful\" She had to thank Misty when she gets the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here! And this is my first date too!\" Sabrina cocked her head to the side in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I've been too busy trying to win the Pokemon League for one, so I didn't have time to get a social life. Then came the responsiblities as champion, challenging other trainers and keeping my title. Then my lounging around at my villa over the past few months. I owe Misty one, that's for sure.\" Sabrina felt a bit of pride swell up in her, knowing that she is the champion's first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Desert is here!\" And the trays of the four meals were handed out by a Chansey onto their table. Despite being stuffed, the couple began to dig in like ravished Grumpigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~skip to after the meal~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIP* Sabrina heard her red dress give a rip around her abdomen section, but at this point she didn't care. She was in a hazy morass of pain and pleasure that she thought her brain would turn to into jelly. Her dress rose up a bit and the tear exposed her belly button. The psychic now looked 5 months pregnant, with a bit of chocolate and sugar smears on her face. She laid back in her chair and breathed in and out, her distended stomach sensitive to the touch, and that is why she continued to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...\" she panted. Ethan's shirt rose up, exposing his own navel and soft round belly. He too felt a bit pained due to the stuffing session as he too kneeded the hard flesh. He had just finished paying the bill, which for him was just a small amount due to his large wealth during battling sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you perhaps help me get to my house? I don't think I have the strength...\" moaned the psychic. She couldn't even try to access her psychic powers she was so pleasured and in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of-of course\" Ethan stood and walked over to the slightly taller girl and supported her by placing her shoulder over his and helped her walk out of the restaurant. Much to Sabrina's surprise, despite for also being in pain for being stuffed to the brim, Ethan had the determination and the strength to get his date back to her house, which took nearly an hour due to the slower pace. Sabrina staggered to the front door and leaned against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...this night was amazing, thank you so much\" smiled the psychic, her powers slowly returning to her as the pain began to recede due to digestion. Ethan rubbed the back of his head and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, any time. Now only if-\" he checked his watch and paled. \"Oh no!\" Sabrina looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed the last train to Goldenrod, which left 10 minutes ago! Darn!\" he cursed, and Sabrina couldn't help but feel guilty. If she hadn't ordered the desert, Ethan would have been on his way home to his grand villa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you wanna crash with me for the night? It's the least I can do since you payed for dinner and all\" offered Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked towards her and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Think nothing of it. I'm just repaying the favor\" replied Sabrina, happy to help. She walked inside, Ethan in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can crash on he couch if that feels okay\" said Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I have a guest room available. You can sleep there\" toned the psychic, hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. So you gonna shower first? Ladies first\" jestured Ethan as he took off his jack and undid some of the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. I also have some spare robes if you need one\" replied Sabrina as she walked towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll be sure to wear one\" replied the chubby boy as he kicked back on the couch and started watching some TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina walked into the bathroom, stripped down, and stepped into the shower. As she cleaned herself, she couldn't help but leave only one hand to do the rubbing of her belly and the other for mandatory shower tasks(shampoo, conditioner, etc). As she finished and dried herself off, he finally decided. Sabrina the Saffron Gym Leader will be getting much bigger from here on out. Although, there is the matter of her other friends, that being the other Kanto Gym Leaders. They may get concerned or, heaven forbid, be disgusted at Sabrina's new goal. Well they didn't meet a nice boy like Ethan, so she couldn't care less. The boy had genuine affection for her, not some lust for a one night stand, but pure affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another vision assaulted her mind. It was a continuation of the earlier vision, as she was sitting in between the Pillars of Creation, the other stars and nebulas began to move and converge, and with a great flash, another large nebula was created. This time it was another Pillars of Creation type of nebula and she saw another great light emerge from the nebula, blinding her and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision ended and Sabrina placed her hand to her head. 'What does this mean?' pondered the psychic. These visions have started to come ever since she started to communicate with the cosmos just yesterday. What is the point of another Pillars nebula? It puzzled the girl. Nevertheless, it was Ethan's time to shower so she stepped out of the bathroom, wearing her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, showers up!\" said Sabrina. She heard walking down the hall and low and behold, her chubby date was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot. You heading to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I tend to be an early bird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah okay. Then in that case...\" Ethan gave Sabrina a kiss on the cheek, making the psychic blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Sabrina. Thanks for the date and for the temporary accomidations\" smiled Ethan as he stepped in the shower, leaving Sabrina rooted like a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina then smiled as she muttered a \"good night\" and she walked on into her bedroom, stripped to her undies, and got into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~the next morning~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina awoke peacefully, seeing how early it is. 6:17 am. Most people would try to get some more sleep but Sabrina didn't, she was an early bird after all. She walked out of her room and into the bathroom and as she washed her face after grooming herself she looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that food from the night before went somewhere, as her flat stomach has began soften up, but additionally, her legs seem to be much thicker, her hips a centimeter wider, and her rear garnering a bit of flesh than yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder how much I weigh...' mused Sabrina as she brought out a scale and stepped on it. The last time she was 115 pounds and now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n125 pounds. Sabrina's eyes rose up. She gained 10 pounds in a single night! And as proof of her gain, she has slowly started to become something akin to either a pear or a \"bubble-butt\" as people would call them. She turned around and slapped her rear, seeing the additional flesh jiggle, which made the psychic happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gainers gotta start somewhere right?' thought the girl to herself. Now her belly groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. You'll be feed soon...\" smiled Sabrina as she stepped out and walked towards her room to get dressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~10 minutes later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was cooking some toast and eggs, wearing nothing but short-shorts, a pick-up bra, and an apron. It would be interesting to see Ethan's reaction. But, she realized that just the meager breakfast wouldn't help her gain, so she decided to garner other food out, such as brownie and cake mixes. She got out seperate glass pans and followed the instructions and placed the batter inside the oven. Two ovens with 3 levels each, which would equate to 3 cakes(gingerbread, spice, and yellow) and 3 brownies. Maybe she may convince Ethan to feed alongside her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~1 Hour later~ after taking the mixes out of the oven, she letted them cool off and she heard Ethan come down stairs in his robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ethan. Good morning\" smiled Sabrina. Ethan's eye went up and his face red as he looked upon her wardrobe, and then was her butt bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...morning?\" he turned on the TV and lounged. Sabrina walked over and sat by him. He could feel his briefs getting a little tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna gain weight and once I get full, I want you to be my feeder. Don't worry I am sure you can catch the afternoon train, but can feed me? Please?\" Sabrina asked. Ethan nodded dumbly as Sabrina walked to the brownie and cake batters and started to ice them over with fattening frosting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Going the extra mile for that extra pound' thought the psychic. She had to trays and sashayed over to her date on the couch and the two of them began to feed, Sabrina more than Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After she had finished he asked her to go upstairs and get comfortable while he made more food for her to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly carrying the repast upstairs as best he could, the plump boy went into Sabrina's room to find her on the bed, laying there almost uncomfortably. She hadn't had Breakfast in bed in the longest time and was a bit anxious regarding having her meal. Still she was determined to see her new decision through to the end, besides Ethan was excited about this as well from what the Psychic could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling my dear?\" Ethan cooed as he sat beside her and pulled out a forkful of the triple layer cake, Sabrina blushed at his playfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good, just a little hungry.\" Sabrina confessed, her cap wearing boyfriend chuckled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, I'll fix that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ethasn brought the forkful of triple layered cake to Sabrina's mouth, the older woman opened her mouth and ate it. She was impressed with how delicious her cooking was, and was surprised by how gracefully his hand sent the food into her mouth. She had consumed it and let the flavors dance on her tongue before she ate the food, as they progressed Sabrina ate more and more quickly and Ethan fed her more and more quickly. She had finished half the cake when she found that her beloved was going as fast as his cellulite laden arms would allow him, she needed more food though and didn\u2019t want to spoil his gesture so she psychically influenced him to feed her faster and more, taking handfuls of food instead of forkfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour she demolished all of the food and had consumed some of the homemade hamburgers that Ethan had whipped up. Her belly was full, but Sabrina had taken on a masochistic mindset regarding the pains in her belly. She wanted more food even if it pained her, but she decided it would be best not to rush things. As she moaned in pleasure and pain she felt a meaty hand make it\u2019s way over her belly. She enjoyed the sensations of gentle touch and a dull ache until her clock struck 1:30 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan my golden honey, you\u2019ll be late for the train if you don\u2019t hurry soon.

I have a match to prepare and what not\" he stepped up and kissed Sabrina on the cheek. Sabrina pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how couples do it Ethan\" teased Sabrina. Ethan cocked his head until Sabrina kissed him on the lips. It wasn't a deep passionate one, as the two are just starting out, but it was a good kiss nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better catch that train\" winked the psychic as she went back inside, Ethan leaving and with a hop in his step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sabrina sat down on the couch and turned on the TV to watch some shows. She's gotta let the food digest somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~present time~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina is now walking about in Saffron in her sweat pants and pink blouse. Right now, her current white slacks or her red and purple outfit can't fit, so she decided to attain new clothes from the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the woman's clothes section, she picked out several plus-size white slacks(and more much larger than her current size). In addition, she picked out more panties, bras, blouses, and a few dresses(all bigger sizes) and some slacks with buttons. With her masochistic mindset of stuffing herself and gaining, the psychic wanted to make the buttons pop when she feed herself. As she walked to the check out counter, she had a vision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same as before, her in the cosmos and several large Pillar of Creation nebulas all around her. She was sitting in one of them like a throne dressed in a golden bra and a satin toga and then, to the nebula that was higher than her, a figure appeared. It was Ethan! He was still chubby, with a bit of fat going into his breasts, his wide soft stomach breathing in and out, and his thighs and butt so tender and fleshy. He was wearing a golden toga, and wore a crown of flowers like a king of some sort. Then, she turned towards another nebula where a bright light as gathering and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision and ended and Sabrina rubbed her head. Now Ethan was in her visions, and now something else near one of the nebulas was coming as well. Just what did it mean? But she lost focus and bumped into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry!

Misty's eyes went up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sabrina...you're looking good...I think?\" asked the water type gym leader. Misty was wearing her jean overalls with a yellow long sleeve shirt. Misty Phelps had the misfortune of the smallest chest in comparison to her sisters. And by smallest, she means \"flattest\". Seeing her friend a bit plumped up surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was wearing her normal pink blouse she always wears, but her stomach looked softer and had a bulge, no longer as flat as it once was. In addition, her hips and thighs seemed to have absorb whatever pounds Sabrina has been packing. But Misty couldn't help but feel jealous as she could see her friends rear, which was nice and round, much akin to her older sisters. Not to mention her breasts, they were nice and big, bumped up from their B cup sizing to a nice and plump CC cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding! I have to thank you for the blind date you set me up with! I've met the man of dreams!\" said Sabrina. 'Literally and figuratively' she mentally added.

Wanna stop by my apartment for dinner maybe? You can crash at my place. No need for a hotel\" offered Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure! I'd be happy too\" said Misty. 'Maybe I can see what is causing her to let go...oh my god...her ass is GORGEOUS' thought Misty as her friend turned around and went through the check out aisle. Maybe the weight Sabrina had gained seemed to have gone well for the psychic, in which Misty couldn't help but feel even more jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm stuck being as flat as a board...'thought orange haired 17 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's psychic powers reached out and sensed Misty's emotions. From what she cpould read, Misty was feeling: curious, jealous, shock, and a...slight tinge of disgust? Was Misty ashamed of her friend gaining weight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll explain to her once we return to the apartment.' thought Sabrina. She waited for Misty to finish her and the girls walked out of the mall and back into town. It took them a half hour to reach Sabrina's place, and by the time she reached the door, the psychic's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quiet you\" said Sabrina to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina...I've been meaning to ask you a question\" asked Misty. Sabrina smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have to do with my recent weight gain I take it?\" Misty's eyes widened, but she knew her friend can use psychic powers, so she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I mean what's up? I mean you ranked 2nd in this years Kanto Beauty Contest? Is there something wrong?\" Misty was concerned. Was her friend going through depression? May she have an eating disorder? Sabrina chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you see I wanted to try something new and...I wanted to see what it's like living like Ethan\" mused Sabrina. Misty cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you know? Ethan Goldstein, Johto Regional Champion, gained nearly 80 pounds since becoming champion\" Misty's eyes became saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! Oh my gosh I'm so sorry...I thought that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to be sorry for? I like Ethan! I like him alot!\" chirped Sabrina. This caught the swimmer offguard, her friend wasn't this outspoken about someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Ethan is fat and you still like him?\" asked Misty. Sabrina turned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it? I was always stressed and freaking out over diets and what not, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because boys won't accept us if we're as fat as Grumpigs you know!\" Now Sabrina's face darkened, and if there was thing Misty knows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever piss of Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you that superficial Misty?\" she snarled in a calm tone, Misty gulping. \"Are you that afraid of trying something new? Or is that you're are jealous of other woman with curves?\" Misty's face contorted to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me there's no point! I've seen the glares you thrown at Lorelai Winters...the disdain you have for Flannery Lavaridge of Hoenn...the so-called \"dislike\" of Karen Dark and Clair DiDrago. You're as easy to read as a book. You're jealous of other girls that have curves because men ignore you for people like them. Curves much like YOUR SISTERS!\" Misty could only stand there rooted like a statue. As much as her brain raddled a way to find a comeback she couldn't. Sabrina was right. She detested other woman because they had what she couldn't have. Breasts and a rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how...\"Misty muttered, as quiet as a sleeping Whismur. \"How can I get curves. You know what happens in the long term to those who go under the knife. How?\" Was all she could ask. Sabrina's anger subsided, replaced by the calm girl she knew, who stepped forward to give her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an old saying, <i>When in Rome, do as the Romans do</i>. So do as I and Ethan do. Eat without restraint. Eat until you are full and near the limit to the point where you might explode. I'll guarantee you will gain curves Misty. You are my friend and I want what's best for you\" soothed Sabrina. Misty returned the hug, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. Let's get onto that mid-afternoon lunch shall we? I still have some leftovers and we can call in pizza. While we wait and eat, I'll tell you what me and Ethan did and talked about\" grinned Sabrina as she took Misty's hand, who smiled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she did needed that lashing, for after all, for some things to get better, some bad things need to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then...</span></div></div>",

Out of the two girls, Misty ate the most(as she was the most determined to gain curves the most) out of her late-lunch, and Sabrina let her. After all, that's whats friends are for right? Thinking only of sleep, Sabrina plopped on the bed and got into the covers. As she fell asleep immediately, she didn't notice a just as tired and in pain(due to eating the most) Misty come onto her bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sabrina dreamed, instead of a vision of the cosmos, she found herself sitting on clouds. The psychic layed down and snuggled into the clouds, her hands passing through the white fluff onto her growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her gain, her breasts have grown the least and her thighs and butt have grown the most. While her breasts are now a perky C-cup, her belly began changing from rock hard due to late-lunch to soft flesh. And she felt her rear and thighs expand a bit, while her bust remained the same. And best off all, her slim arms and cute face remained unaffected. Overall, her late-lunch(which she made to be fattening) made her gain about 5 pounds. Not as much as her dinner and stuffing session with Ethan, but every pound counts. For some reason the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty dreamed, she found herself on the clouds as well, much akin to her friends own dream. Her rock hard and distended stomach began to shrink and Misty felt a sensation. She was getting fat. She looked down and saw her muscled and toned legs begin to lose muscle and become softer. Her stomach, also slim and toned, softened and grew just by a quarter of an inch. And to her dismay, her breasts, in which she wad flat, didn't grow at all, until she felt that sensation tingling in her behind she looked and down and beamed. Her rear got some of the weight! Infact it may have gotten the majority of the 15 pounds of food Misty consumed! She started to hop up and down and gave her rear a slap, seeing it jiggle to her satisfaction. She fell onto the clouds laughing, gathering the clouds like fluff and hugging and cuddling them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, the two girls were dreaming and in their sleep, they touched each other. Misty was stroking Sabrina's left breast and it trailed down to her soft tummy while the psychic had her hand over Misty's growing rear(as the food was digested).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~a few hours later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was the first to awake, rolling away from Misty(unconsiously) and onto the floor. She looked down and saw her newly added gain and how it affected her body. She headed downstairs and ate an apple as she watched some TV, mainly the boring news. Still in her bra and panties, she reached for her phone and dialed a certain friend's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Ethan? How's it going? Oh you're busy? I'm sorry, when should I call you back?\" the psychic's face became understanding. \"Ah I see, you have an important exhibition match to worry about, so I'll leave you to your devices. Okay, see you friday down in Ever Grande. Bye\" She hung up and dialed another number. Thanks to her friend Lucian Potter, the Sinnoh Elite 4 member, she got quite a few numbers of some girls and guys in Sinnoh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Aaron? Hey, are you around in Kanto? You are? Awesome! I was wondering if you could head over to my place tomorrow night, I'm calling over some friends to go to a club. Which club? Well the best one in Saffron that's what! Great to know you're coming. See ya, bye\" She hung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to call over two more girl friends and 1 guy friend, but which to choose...Sabrina rubbed her belly as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll invite them them!\" She sent a text message via her PokeCell and texted to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note the 2 girls and guy selected below will eventually join in on the gaining adventures of Sabrina, Misty and Ethan)</span></div></div>",

Another trainer was scheduled to battle her that day, and, as it were, even her fantasies needed to take a back seat to her job. After a effortless victory against the poor bug catcher, Sabrina returned to Misty, only to find her nibbling on a brownie. \"Keeping up your training as before, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much,\" Misty replied, smiling as she said, slowly, \"Ya know, I wonder where Red is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red?

Why?\" Sabrina took all of five seconds to figure it out. She didn't need psychic powers to understand why the orange haired girl was turning red. \"So that's how it is, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, it's nothing like--well, maybe it is a bit, but--well, yes, it completely is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to find him so you can ask him out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty blushed again before saying, \"Well, maybe just to talk a little, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me, I know.\"</span></div></div>",

Misty turned towards the clock which read 8:30<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could they-\" A knock broke Sabrina's train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil\" she walked towards the door and low and behold, the trio was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sabrina! How's it going!\" asked the peppy pinkette in boon. The Goldenrod Gym Leader was the postergirl for MooMoo Milk, which has worked generously into packing the pounds onto her breasts and rear, giving Whitney a hourglass figure that the Bug type Gym Leader behind her, Brian Cyprus, better known as \"Bugsy\", couldn't help but drool a little. Her white shirt exposed generous amount of cleavage with her DD cup breasts and her denim shorts held a great round ass with thighs that nearly touched. If Sabrina guessed, Whitney weighed over 170 pounds, but it went to the right places for the girl. But then again, it would be irrelevant. She carried a box filled with MooMoo milk quarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going great Whitney, how's things down in Goldenrod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, the usual oggling trainer and the jealous Lass. A few loses here and there, you know the routine\" Sabrina nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, likewise. How are you doing Bugsy?\" The extremely feminine boy perked up and nodded as he smiled, but his eyes darted from the psychic to Whitney and back. Using her psychic powers, she sensed his emotions. They were blazing with lust and affection, with shyness and a bit of fear added in. The fear bit may have been the \"fear of rejection\" or \"fear of slap\" but she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going great Sabrina. That teacher girl, Roxanne Stone, stopped by my gym today for some research notes on Bug pokemon. Say did you lose weight? You look great\" flattered the purple haired boy. His emotions were once again riddled with lust as she gazed her as Whitney went inside to greet Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you Bugsy. I'll be happy to explain what we are doing later on so come on inside\" jestured the psychic and the bug afficionado walked inside with a bit of step. Which Sabrina turned towards her last visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Candice? Happy to be down in Kanto?\" Candice Winters, the Ice Gym leader in Snowpoint city shrugged. Candice had a slender figure, but her breasts were perky and her legs were toned. This helped her get to 4th place in Sinnoh's beauty contest(beaten out by, in order from 3 to 1: Dawn Berlitz, Fantina Robespierre, and Cynthia Celestia). Candice was peppy like Whitney, but more observant like Sabrina. Candice nodded, but she couldn't keep her eye off of Sabrina's muffin top of a belly and her slowly growing legs. Sabrina noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sorta miss the cold but I don'y mind the flight. So anyways Sabrina...I've been wondering...\" her emotions were laced with concern, curiosity, a pinch of disgust. Sabrina knew what was coming and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this?\" she grabbed her soft flesh of her stomach and fondled it, much to Candice's surprise. \"This is purely intentional. I wanted to try out something new ever since I met my new partner, so I've been determined to become as fat as he\" The Ice leader's mouth dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that guy must be one good date material. Who is it?\" Sabrina and Candice walked inside, the psychic giving her a sly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johto Regional Champion Ethan Goldstein. He's nearly 200 pounds right now\" Candice's eyes went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow. And...you're into that sort of thing? If so I respect ya completely, I was just worried for ya\" said Candice. Sabrina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I suppose I am into well...'plumpers' and weight gain. Ethan introduced me to that, and so I am doing that. See Misty?\" she pointed towards Misty as the swimmer was making conversation with Bugsy, who was incredibly red in the face, and Whitney in which Misty seemed to be getting along with more better now than she had before. She noticed the gain from earlier today has been distributed to Misty's legs and her rear. She's probably going end up as one of the \"thunder-thighs and Ass the size of Unova\" type of chubby girls. Sabrina was more of a pear, and Whitney a hourglass. Now she looked towards Candice then back to Bugsy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder how the weight will be distributed amongst them...' thought the psychic. She thought on the Orange Bowl, the best club in town, which even had several rooms for 'special services' or in other words, sex amongst dates. And since it is patroled by the occasional Bronzor(to check to see if any partner has been drugged) the rape rates have gone down dramatically. Then she thought of the special food she bought several days before her date with Ethan, which consisted of pure chocolate, bananas, vanilla ice cream, watermelon, and red wine. While Bugsy may be underaged, Sabrina didn't care. The foods were Aphrodisiacs, caused in enhance the sex drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, Sabrina wants all of her friends to stuff themselves on this and commence a massive sex fest. After all, she needs the practice for Ethan's victory night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you guys, here's what we have planned for tonight!\" All of the rooms occupants turned towards her....</span></div></div>",

Some of Sabrina's treatment should eliminate that apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like this idea,\" Whitney laughed, her eyes wide and sparkly in her sockets, a smile spreading across her slightly pudgy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" Candice said, grinning, \"It's been awhile since I've been able to really go loose and do whatever, so the club sounds cool.

Her breasts were the same but she knew once they digested all of the food they may grow soon enough. Her stomach and lower body seems to taking the gain the most, as her thighs will soon be close to rubbing each other. She drew upon her powers of foresight and saw her newly plump body, which satisfied the psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(She looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://munemune.deviantart.com/#/d2owxwh\" target=\"_blank\">http://munemune.deviantart.com/#/d2owxwh...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's breasts remained flat but her stomach was, like the rest of the gang: rock hard and almost pregnant looking.

Her belly was number two, and the rest of her last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice after tying her shoe sat down on the chair beside Bugsy and gave a pained sigh.

Sabrina wondered how the gain will act for the twin tailed girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney was still drinking wine and becoming drunk(all of them were a bit tipsy) and her breasts rose a bit due to her stuffed tummy. She decided to undo the shorts, wear her panties and plomped down next to Bugsy, he too had a stuffed a gut but was more transfixed on the girls, including Sabrina herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina turned towards Misty. \"So...shall we have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's bring them in on it too. Don't want them to feel lonely now do we?\" winked Misty as they both stood up and sauntered over the over three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..shall we let the festivities commence?\" asked Sabrina as she got rid of her shirt and trousers, leaving only her bra. Misty did so as well, and Bugsy turned as red as a Slugma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want in to!\" said Candice as she began to strip. Whitney was already naked. All 4 girls turned towards the girly boy. Thanks to the booze and the food, everyone was a bit wierd in the head and horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww look at his tummy. so stuffed, he looks like a prego\" purred Sabrina as she helped Bugsy up and layed him on a bed, leaving him naked. Bugsy's round tummy was breathing fast as his mind still tried to comprehend what was going on. Then Misty came over his face, Candice by the side with her head over his distended stomach, and Sabrina and Whitney down near his aching crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it began:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty began to face sit on him, her panties shuffling as they gave him a face full of vagina, Misty purring with pleasure. Candice began licking his belly button of all things, making Bugsy struggle, but the Sabrina and Whitney weighed down his legs and began giving him a double titty fuck with their large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry*hic* Brian! We'll make you happy!*hic*\" hiccuped Whitney as she and Sabrina took turns enveloping his head into their mouths. While one sucked on his member, the other licked it like an ice cream cone. Bugsy wanted to yell but his shouts muffled by Misty's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YA that's it you girly girly boy! Like my slit clean and you'll get a reward!\" yelled Misty as Bugsy began to do so. It made the swimmer shiver in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahn! He's sticking his tongue into my temple! Nya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Bugsy was struggling for freedom due to Candice licking his navel clean. She was into kinky stuff, that was for sure. And then, Bugsy's body quaked as he exploded all over Sabrina and Whitney's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! I'm cumming! That girlboy's tongue is making me cum!\" yelled Misty as she released all over Bugsy's face, and Misty moved, giving Bugsy needed oxygen. Whitney and Sabrina were licking each other clean of the sperm ejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exquisite\" purred the psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehe!

Her eyes were determined as she leaned in, ensuring not a single spot within her womanhood was left untouched. Before Buggy could fill the final hole, however, both Misty and Sabrina had come onto Whitney's breasts, suckling them gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four adults were in pure ecstasy. Sabrina noticed how Bugsy's hands kept extending outward, wrapping around her arms, as if wanting something more. Before Sabrina could deal with him, her mouth was filled with bountiful milk. She swallowed the fattening liquid, noticing how Misty's cheeks had puffed out sharply from the sudden intack, only to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney sagged in their arms, moaning in ecstasy, as she grew weak, her belly gurgling softly.</span></div></div>",

Candice played with her chest and navel, Bugsy rammed her from behind, Whitney wetted her armpits with milk, and Sabrina ate out of her. All of the gym leaders were succumbing to lust.

The two of them suckled Candice, her body shuddering in pleasure as her gasps for air came out in strained, orgasmic pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugsy emerged from behind, staying with the area he had found the most success in so far. Whitney, however, heaved her breasts against Candice's thirsty, salivating lips.  Not the ones on her mouth, but rather the ones between her luscious thighs. After stroking her nipples against her lower regions, milk began to spray out of her nipples, spraying alongside her womanhood, parching its thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice shuddered as her womanly juices splattered out along with the milk, coating Whitney's breasts in sexual fluids.  Bugsy discharged into his target, and, almost at once, both Misty and Sabrina felt the familiar thick fluids of milk fill themselves.  They were, by now, stuffed with milk, falling backward as they massaged their distended middles. They had eaten more than just their fair share of food. Even milk was starting to stretch their insides out to painful limits. Still, one last girl remained, and she longed for equal treatment.</span></div></div>",

Misty had the biggest conflict of them all, as her upper body was still relatively small for plus sizes, but her hips were well into the system. Whitney had less trouble, as, if she was to be believed, she had shopped in this section more often than Sabrina had guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I'm fat, but these boobs are kinda hard to fit in ordinary clothing, ya know?\" Whitney explained, blushing deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina eventually found some clothing to wear, albeit the outfits were far too baggy. She resolved to fit into her baggy clothing...by any means necessary.</span></div></div>",

No one had made it to challenge her lately, the Gym saw few visitors and hadn't had a worthwhile battle in months. She even started going to the Gym less and less, becoming a bit lazier and more of a slob as she did. She only wore her usual top lately and white pants, but those were starting to get more then snug that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lazier tendencies had caused excessive eating on her part and a lack of exercise only helped facilitate her rise in weight. She had already put on about forty pounds within the past few weeks, her belly swollen into a sizable muffin top as her folds flowed a tad over her wider hips and her butt made her pants fairly close to ripping in the back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina let out a dejected sigh as she looked down at her sizable bust, a large C lingering close to a small D-cup or it would in time at least. That was one benefit to her new, slovenly lifestyle, the fact her new body fat found its way to her bust and increased its size. Even if she was okay for now, eventually she needed to work. If not as a Gym Leader, she would need to lose weight fast seeing how she had gained some fame in Unova as an actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sabrina lacked any proper motivation. Remaining a couch potato for the moment, she flicked on the TV and started to shovel handfuls of popcorn in her mouth from a porcelain blue and white bowl in a bored fashion. She poked at her chubby belly while she continued to eat, opening a can of cola sitting on the table and taking a sip Sabrina looked down at herself, wondering what in the world she could do today in her continued regimen of...doing nothing.</span></div></div>",

A nameless fear still hung over her and her sheets were covered in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her legs in a pyramid, she hugged them slightly. She was trying to place her thoughts as to what she had just experienced. A dream? A vision? That entity that was speaking. Even though she had access to her physic powers most of her life, Sabrina never felt something that vivid before. She looked at her bedroom window. Stale drops of rain water still clung to the glass, but the sky was void of any signs of that pink light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a dream...\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in a mixture of confidence and relief, she laid back on the mattress. The stress of training was getting to her. Since the sudden increase in trainers recently, there was a demand to be better and stronger. More so then ever before. Trainers came from all over the world expecting the Saffron City Gym to provide a challenge to them. As the Gym Leader, Sabrina was forced to meet that demand whatever the cost. It was just unfortunate that the cost was usually many sleepless nights spent training both herself and her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still wearing her uniform, apparently she had passed out from last night's training. Her Pokemon must have carried her to bed, several of them were snuggled up against each other in the corner of her room. They must have fallen asleep after putting her to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she didn't physically smile, Sabrina was somewhat warmed by this sight and quietly stepped out of her room being careful not to disturb them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you lonely too?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze after halfway closing the door and took one last look out the window. Still, nothing was there. Satisfied, but still somewhat uneasy, she gently shut the door and continued on her way to start the new day...And begin more training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though, she needed to... </span></div></div>",

It was a stark room with a polished applewood floor and large walls, each one had a different mural on it, as did the ceiling. One was of a field, lush and vibrating with life, knolls as far as the eye could perceive. The next was of a deep ocean, clear blue and unfathomable...Presenting eternal mystery. The neighboring wall had the image of a mountain high in the heaveans, a light cerulean sky with fluffy nimbus clouds nearby. The fourth wall was of an embryo, life at it's very beginnings and at it's most complex, the fascinating structure that houses the soul before one can formulate thought. Lastly was the ceiling, that showed an artfully painted picture of the universe. One could just make out the Milky Way in a myriad of stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was infinite space, infinite potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese images helped Sabrina get into the meditating mood. She closed her eyes and sat down, she emptied her consciousness of every material thing and focused instead on the world around her and her own body. She could feel everything from her own Pokemon nearby and humans miles away. She felt them, their happiness, their worries, and their life. By no means did she invade their thoughts, but instead she gleaned them and analyzed them, which caused her to think of her own issues or successes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went about business as usual, when she felt something wrong...She felt a strong wave of lonliness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i> Where is it coming from?</i> Sabrina asked herself mentally. She did her best to hone in on it, but whatever it was was quick, elusive, and powerful. If she got close to it, it would put up a mental block.

It had suddenly turned the tables, instead of Sabrina pursuing the abnormality it was after her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat formed at the tip of her brow. She put up a quick mental block, attempting to stave off whatever it was. She felt that the thing's intentions weren't aggressive, but it desperately wanted to be with her for some reason. Putting all her strength into the mental block, Sabrina focused primarily on maintaining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had been busy forming the block, she had completely lost track of it. It had simply vanished as if it never was there. Cautiously lowering the mental block, Sabrina briefly scanned the area for any signs of the lonely emitter. There was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something nudged her in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping slightly, Sabrina's eyes shot wide open and she jumped five feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Mime?\" Asked a goofy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina landed hard on her bottom. Breathing heavily, she saw immediately what it was that had bumped into her. It was one of her Pokemon, Mr.Mime, who had been cleaning the room. He must have accidentally tapped her with his broom while sweeping around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...scared me...\" She whispered, in her usual monotone voice. Her heart was still going fifty beats a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mime!\" Bowed the Mr.Mime as if he were apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...Just be a little more careful when cleaning, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mime!\" He replied as he stumbled out of the room, clattering into a nearby vase directly outside in the hall. There was a crash followed by a smash and more shouts of \"Mr.Mime!\". Sabrina could only guess what had happened. If she had the capacity to, she'd probably have started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead she paused to recollect her thoughts, trying to piece together what had happened during meditation.

A few minutes later you hear her thundering footsteps and see her giant gorgeous bare feet land next to you. \"Where did you run off to my little slave\". She begins pacing impatiently her loud footsteps creating shock waves that rattled your tiny body. Suddenly she spot you by the corner-\"Is that you my slave-Wait no it's gross bug!\" She raises her giant foot to squash you when suddenly you see her foot pause in midair and she squints a little bit while staring at you. She then laughs and lowers her colossal foot and lays down on her stomach with her gigantic face staring straight at you. \"Sorry-little guy-didn't mean to scare you-haha!\" She then picks you up and places you on the palm of her hand and gives you a very large giantess kiss. You get drenched with her spit as the red pillows close around you, but you can't help but to enjoy her the experience. She then sets you back down on the table on walks away. Returning some minutes later-she is wearing only boxer shorts and a too small t-shirt revealing her sexy midriff and her long beautiful legs. She lays you on her bed and stretches herself out fully placing you next to her left foot. \"Okay-little slave hears the deal-if you can successfully traverse across me starting at my foot all the ways up to my face-I'll grow you back to normal size-or the closest to normal that you'll ever be-haha\" Realizing that this was the best deal you could get-you start the bear-hugging your way up her enormous foot. Once on top of it-you begin the cross country trip across her never-ending leg until you arrive at her stomach. Her smooth skin is too smooth to grab onto, but luckily your able to gain a hold on the ledge of her belly button and then use this cave as a pit stop to rest in. You then begin the journey up her shirt and finally up to her giant, beautiful face. \"Congratulations!!\" She exclaims. \"Alright you've earned this!\" You then feel dizzy and black out and wake up to see that she grown you to only 12 inches instead of 5. \"I told you that I'd make you normal-well this is your NEW normal\" she laughs. You're going to be my tiny pet boyfriend from now on-haha\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina's day had begun like any other.  She'd woken up, bathed, clothed herself in her pink top with white slacks, socks, and light pink shoes, enjoyed a nice breakfast, accepted and defeated a few trainers.  All in all it had been a pretty busy morning and now it was time to rest her weary mind and meditate.  She sat down and began to breathe like she had done many times before.  In and out, in and out, simple deep breathes.  Within moments, Sabrina was calm and her mind clearing as she began to prepare her mental powers and practiced inside her head.  However, Sabrina did not get too far into her exercises when suddenly she felt a presence.  It seemed unfamiliar to her, but why was it her.  However in that moment of pause, she felt the presence reach out to her thoughts.  Trying to bring her mental defenses to bear, Sabrina tried to protect herself, but the being was too fast.  It quickly reached into her head, touched something like a child playing with a light switch then disappeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking from her meditation, Sabrina glanced around angrily with her powers coming to bear against her assailant.  Yet, as Sabrina scanned her gym, there was no one, not a soul was in the room.  Quickly she checked around the gym to see if there was anyone hidden, but there was no one not even the usual grunts that hung around as it was a Saturday and they had the day off.  However, as Sabrina tried to focus on where her attacker may be, she sound her mind flowing elsewhere.  Eventually her attention turned to her feet of all things and how they were itching inside her shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina shook her head, she had to focus on finding... what was she looking for again.  This really troubled Sabrina.  The more she tried to focus on what or where her attacker had gone, the more and more her mind came up blank on whether or not there was even an attacker.  Focusing once more she tried again.  There was someone in the gym... wasn't there.  Well of course there was someone in the gym earlier, there were trainers trying to get there Pokemon League badges.  No, no, no, there was something... something... itchy, annoying.  Someone was here and they did something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all of this, Sabrina had been rubbing her feet together, the material becoming harder and harder to stand.  Suddenly it struck her, yes someone was in here earlier and she knew exactly what they had done.  Sitting done on the floor, Sabrina looked at the strange pink objects that were covering her feet.  They were tight, itchy, annoying, and nearly prevented her from seeing her socks.  With two righteous hands, Sabrina grasped the shoe and tore it off her left foot.  Tossing the shoe aside as hard as she could, Sabrina turned her attention back to her socked foot and how great it felt to be free of that darn contraption.  Grasping her socked foot in both hands, Sabrina practically began to pet her foot feeling how the material dressed her foot elegantly drinking in the smell as if it were wafting from a fragrant flower.  However, Sabrina's job was only half done and soon, Sabrina's other shoe was discarded alongside its other, her feet forever free from the tyranny of such cramped devices.  Rubbing and petting her socked feet, Sabrina fell into supreme bliss, unaware exactly what had changed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
