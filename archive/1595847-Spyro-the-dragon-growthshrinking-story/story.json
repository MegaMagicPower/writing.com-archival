His senses were very developed, he was able to feel everything without watching, so he could walk without looking down, making the thing more exciting.<br>\r\nGrass... grass... grass... pretty basic and normal, he was too used to stepping on grass. Grass... grass... then suddenly a dry leave made a crunchy noise under Spyro's hind paw. That was already more enjoyable. The dragon stopped for a while, and then... it was unbelievable! He actually grew!<br>\r\nHe grew just a little, but he grew indeed! Spyro was happy, that wasn't just a dream, it was magic!<br>\r\nThe dragon kept walking: grass... a plant (he grew a little more)... then Spyro saw the small house of some little gnome who had to be absent. The dragon slowly crushed it under a fore paw, then his hind paw destroyed it even more. That was heavenly... this time the growth was much bigger, in a few seconds Spyro became bigger than an adult dragon!<br>\r\nBut he couldn't stop right now. He saw a bush and slowly stomped it, enjoying the rustling noise and growing again. He stopped for a while to look for something else to crush and noticed a rock next to his left hind paw. He tried to destroy it with just one step... and it worked!<br>\r\nBy this time, Spyro was the biggest dragon ever seen! He was at least 50 feet high, but it wasn't enough for him! He stepped on some more bushes, rocks and trees until he was almost 100 feet!</span></div></div>",

My muscles expanding, my form towering...mmm, the thought of it is so exciting.\" He moans a bit as his dick starts to get hard and erect. \"Huff...huff...ooooh, man.\" He moans louder as he kneels down and starts humping the ground. \"F-fuck, gotta fuck.\" He huffs out as his dick grinds the ground, causing it to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels his body grow with each grinding against the ground. \"Y-Yeees. Yeeees. More, more!\" He pants out, growing to 150 feet now, the grinding shaking the ground more and more. Sparx is freaking out at how huge Spyro is getting. At this rate, he was worried what he would do. He needed to stop him! But he was so tiny already to Spyro, and now Spyro is like 200 feet tall and growing! He...he can't just watch though! He has to try and stop him! Suddenly, Sparx can feel a strange tingly inside of him, as his body began to grow larger! The small dragonfly wasn't so small anymore as he grew to 5 feet, then 10 feet, then 20 feet tall, surging in size all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good too, incredibly good. He was always made of fun of for being small, but now he too was growing! Spyro was so busy humping the ground that at 250 feet, he didn't notice until he felt himself lifted off the ground that Sparx was growing. \"Haa...haaa...y-you're not the only b-biiig one anymore Spyro.\" Sparx huffs out at 300 feet tall and growing still. \"H-Hey, Sparx?! How are you-?!\" Spyro asks, before yelping as Sparx surged again to 600 feet tall. \"C-Can't stop...g-growing...s-so big...\" Sparx huffs out. He surges once more to 900 feet, and Spyro was getting mad. He wouldn't be smaller than anyone! Not now, not ever!</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a loud and shaking thud that was felt by both Sparx and Spyro as towering over even the godly sized dragonfly, was an even bigger being. At 3 miles tall, was Red himself, enormous, and muscular beyond belief. \"Well, well, well. Looks like a little dragonfly is trying his hardest to feel big.\" Red taunts, which Sparx does not take well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Little?!\" He says angry. Red grins before surging himself larger to 4 miles tall. \"Yes. LITTLE.\" He reiterates. Sparx growls, before huffing and puffing and surging once again, to 2 miles tall. \"I am NOT little!\" He roars, before quadrupling his own size, making Red fall backwards in shock, as Sparx towered over even him at 8 miles tall. Red growls, and gets back up, before surging larger to 10 miles, and in response Sparx surged to 14 miles tall.

Half a mile, 1 mile, 2 miles, he grew and grew, huffing and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up between Sparx and Red, Sparx had grown to 25 miles tall, and Red was about the same size, the growling as they glared each other down, Sparx surging again, before Red surged as well, both growing to 30 miles tall, the planet beneath them just continuing to shrink to them. \"I'm bigger!\" Sparx roared out, surging to 35 miles. \"No, I'm bigger!\" Red retorted, growing to the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I'M BIGGER!\" A roar cried out from beneath the two as Spyro surged up above them both growing to 45 miles tall, then doubling that nearly instantly.

Spyro grins and huffs, before growing to 100 miles tall now. \"Guess I'm just that good of a grower.\" He huffs out, grunting as he grows another 5 miles bigger.

She stopped at the sight of it, her jaw hanging wide open. Marching towards her, eyes level with her body above the ground, was a huge Spyro, licking his lips in a lusty fashion. It seems as he marched to meet her, he had still been growing. From 100 feet before, he was 500 feet tall and growing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder could smell it, his lust was in the air, and visible in his horny erect dick. She couldn't help but get turned on by it. Malefeor quickly began telling her to calm herself in her head, but she wasn't listening at this point. Her own lust was growing too strong for his influence to matter anymore. And that wasn't the only thing about her that was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly as she hovered in the air, she moaned and panted as she too began to grow bigger and bigger. Not as much as Spyro, but still she was growing larger. On her dragon chest, she also grew large breasts on her as well, turned on by the musk his dick was letting out into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the now 1000 feet tall Spyro reached her, she was about 50 feet tall overall.  Oooooh, he could tell his lust for her was having an effect on her body. He loved seeing it grow, and he loved growing too. But she was too small still. Too small for his massive dragon cock and balls. Speaking of which, his balls were now towering over his body, but he could still easily pull them along with his new found strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls Cynder closer with a single paw. \"Mmmm...you're looking wonderful, my queen.\" He says in a deep booming voice, a giant grin across his face. She murred in his grasp, only 100 feet tall to his gargantuan 1500 feet tall. \"But you're not growing quite fast enough. You need to be big for your god.\" He says and begins to kiss her, which she happily returns. She moans as her growth accelerates and she grows, grows, grows! Going from 100 feet to 500 feet quickly. And the two enjoyed it very much.</span></div></div>",

And now she could stand on two legs, her fore paws had become hands, she was much more free to move! All this gave her a big excitement, and her mind was overcome by true evil and madness.<br>\r\nSpyro was totally paralyzed by fear and he could only look up with his mouth wide open. He couldn't even see his girlfriend's face!<br>\r\nThe huge Cynder looked down at the purple dragon, smirked and whispered: \"Hi there, little one\" And, just to scare Spyro even more, she slowly moved her titanic foot and made it land when the tiny dragon was between two toes. Despite the gentleness of its step, the foot made a quite loud thud and it made the ground tremble under Spyro's paws.<br>\r\nThe poor purple dragon covered his face with his wings and, overcome by total terror, he started to cry and weep. Cynder quite enjoyed this.<br>\r\nWith an obviously fake compassion, the giantess said: \"Aww, poor teeny cutie! You're afraid? Oh, how scary! I'm so big, so enormous, so titanic, so... goddess!\" She laughed evilly and then made a loud growl which could be heard miles away!<br>\r\n\"Come on, Spyro, what kind of hero are you?\" Cynder said mischievously \"You just can tremble and cry?\" She gently and slowly kicked Spyro, making him tremble and scream even more. \"I'll have some more fun with you later. Now this city must know who commands here by now\" <br>\r\nCynder raised the other foot and observed it, flexing and wiggling her toes. She had never realized she had such beautiful feet, they were made to crush everything they could find! And so the scary giant dragoness started to walk, causing earthquakes, devastation and panic.<br>\r\nCynder walked slowly, majestically and sinuously, her feet gently landed on the ground and destroyed a house or killed someone at every gigantic step. <br>\r\nThe dragoness kept looking down, and enjoyed every bit of her crushing. After a few steps some pieces of buildings and coaches were stuck between her toes. Sometimes she wiggled her toes some more, especially when one of her foot was about to stomp many people with a single step.<br>\r\nWhen she reached the square, she noticed that it was incredibly full of running people. She slowly put her hind paw in the center of the square and dragged it, turning the pavement into a red pool of blood. She growled and laughed.<br>\r\nThe army arrived, but it was useless. A catapult tried to harm her, but her comment was: \"Oh, that tickles\" And soon the catapult was stomped and destroyed by a huge and mighty dragon foot. Then all the rest of the army was easily defeated by Cynder's breath of fire.<br>\r\nThe dragon goddess sat on the castle in the center of the city and gently stroked her feet with her hands to clean them from blood, corpses and ruin. While she was doing that, on her still lovely muzzle there was a blissful smile and her eyes were closed.<br>\r\nEventually, Spyro managed to regain some bravery and flew towards her insane friend. When he reached her, Cynder noticed him immediately. She grinned and asked: \"What are you gonna do, little fly?\" Actually, Spyro had no idea... he tried to think the fastest he could, but soon an enormous fore paw grabbed him! The purple dragon tried to fight and spit fire, but it was useless.<br>\r\n\"Now listen, tiny dragon\" Cynder said \"Something in my head tells me that I have the power to turn you into what I am right now. Shall we make a try? Remember: if you refuse, I'll eat you or stomp you!\" </span></div></div>",

Sparx abruptly stopped and could not get this bloody shambles which took place before his eyes. Thousands of people tried to flee in panic before the inevitable crushing under the feet laughing Cynder. is made after the massacre site dragon woman calmly sat down on a bloody stain and with closed eyes began to clear the foot of the remains of buildings and people.<br>\r\n\"Well, you sit here a while I look for Spyro, he will appeal to common sense,\" she thought, dragonfly, but just then Cynder opened her eyes, looked over it and jumped toward him, reached his hand and covered his eyes Sparx goodbye to the world. until the moment he dared to open it, dragoness probably waited to do it to scare him to death. but to my surprise it was not, again, sat sorted in two fingers holding the neck a little purple shape.<br>\r\n\"No it can not be Spyro\" thought Sparx<br>\r\nCynder took air into the lungs and then released them in the direction of the shape and then put it on the pavement and watched it, that someone picked up and dropped over the transition in which there was a dragonfly, you could hear the laughter of Cynder. as far as how this man came near I could see more detail and after a while Spyro and Sparx missed over przepycha\u0107 started by the crowd. dragonfly flew to a friend and wanted to have him speak, but stopped short, purple dragon was much higher than normal, was higher than the rest of the crowd. Dragon had also noted as he looked horrified and then ramming people squeezed into the nearest building to look to avoid a gigantic Cynder.<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, wait for me,\" cried Sparx wlatuj\u0105c him inside.<br>\r\nthere is just as convinced it was a bad idea.<br>\r\nSpyro was already much larger than the outside, now a massive head bent down before getting a lower ceiling and more than half the surface of a four-room was occupied by himself, to make matters worse he has continued to grow. after a continuously growing population paw pressed against the wall and the ceiling under the pressure of big shoulders there were more cracks. Spyro occupied more and more and more space in the room, there was no floor space that could stand on the ground, the entire floor was occupied by the expanding constantly, body, tail and feet and the ceiling was not better, head for the Sparx Spyro was always tremendous but now is great and its giant wings covered what was not covered by the body and limbs. When people have long since died crushed by the dragon's paw - almost twice as much as them and Sparx was already thinking that it will be crushed under the onslaught of ever more large membrane wings, at the end of the ceiling covered with numerous cracks kinking his neck burst into Spyro now 4-5 times thicker than it was when I came Sprax. Spyro straightened his head freely through the ceiling, but its growth has accelerated even more.<br>\r\nSparx quickly escaped from between the membrane and the wall. and as soon as possible lawiruj\u0105c flew up between the rock fragments and, while fleeing from growing, purple body, quickly got up near the head goes through the next floor and hid in one of the cracks in the corners. this gap watched as successive floors are crossing at an alarming rate, and finally appeared in the blue sky, Sparx breathing heavily, as for him at this height for him was not enough oxygen.<br>\r\nflew from cracks and headed for the eyes of his friend, he was about to fly over the jaw and nose when you fly over the purple dragon bowed his head, nearly killing his friend, only to leave a man on the roof of a house. Sparx in the last minute he turned and went rapidly falling lower jaw, upper lip and flew panting over him, took a few deep breaths and looked down, with the wounds still so high it was not, seen below, a significant part of the city and the upcoming Spyro tagrze mouth with a huge speed<br>\r\nNooo! Sparx shouted and nose was pressed to Spyro, he could not raise pressed into the body like an astronaut to the chair and the oxygen is less and less. took on increased speed, more districts have been crushed under the feet of the dragon and his nose Sparx ne remnants of forces tried to crawl to the edge of the nose. to him from two steps when he lost consciousness. sudden gust of wind turned away brittle body with a smooth surface and unconscious Sparx began to fall to the ground.<br>\r\nawoke him incredible rush of air, quickly looked around and saw that it was flush with the top lying purple feet, the giant dragon, it was more or less at a height of 2 storeys. kick-started fast and slowed down the collapse of the wing. looked around quickly, the area around all buildings were completely razed to the ground and above them towered two gigantic dragons. Spyro stood on two legs for what was even higher, with bowed head, powerful voice could be heard Cynder<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you Grieve For All Those at the bottom?\"<br>\r\nAfter a while the voice of Spyro heard on wilele km<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little but it's not the point, somewhere down there for sure is Sparx, It Seems to me that I killed him\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, man I did not die,\" screamed and began to rush Sparx in his direction, after a moment he felt a lack of oxygen, the lung was too small and just flew to the waist of the two colossal dragons. Sparx yelling that they do not want to cheer a friend was killed, but he was too far away to hear, and was much too small to be seen.<br>\r\nCynder replied<br>\r\n\"Can we go from here? Should you better. But a little\"<br>\r\ngrabbed him by the hand and led him forward.<br>\r\nSparx looked like two giant dragons away with great speed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhot Sparx do now?</span></div></div>",

The two had brought peace to the world, and were enjoying staying with the guardians for now. Though, the pair were having some strange spikes in desire, and a weird feeling when falling asleep at night. They seek the wisdom of Ignitus, who managed to survive, to ask what is happening to them, if this is something Malfeor did to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus laughs when they ask him. \"I forget sometimes you two are younger dragons than us!\" He says first, making the pair look confused at him. \"You two are undergoing what is known as puberty. For dragons, this means your bodies will have more sexual desires and have growth spurts more often. I can't help but wonder which of you two will end up the bigger one.\" He explains with a small laugh at the comment towards the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, Spyro and Cynder learned to deal with their sexual desires and slight nightly growth spurts. None of the growth spurts were very strong, just a couple inches, barely noticeable really. But that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring a training session, both Spyro and Cynder got hit by that tingly feeling they've felt every night for the past few days. But it was stronger, much stronger than before. They began to pant and heave, the sensation was powerful, yet also quite pleasing to their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, slowly, the two began to grow larger, not just an inch or two, but starting to gain whole feet this time. Neither one understood why it was so strong, but they weren't complaining, the growth felt fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, both were half the size of a fully grown dragon. Ignitus was shocked, but not too much. He figured these two would have a unique puberty. \"Man, that was awesome, huh Cynder?\" Spyro asks her. \"It was. Mmm, I wouldn't mind another round sometime soon.\" She says with a slight giggle. She was actually a foot taller than Spyro, but he didn't mind. He liked looking up at her in the physical sense. Cynder enjoyed it also. Made her feel good, and protective towards Spyro, like he always was towards her before. Then suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Cynder backed away, starting to have look up at him, instead of down. Her mouth hung open wider and wider as Spyro grew bigger and bigger. Cynder had been 9 feet previously, while Spyro was 8 feet. Now, Spyro was growing past 12 feet and still growing too. He moaned, and panted, feeling his cock come out of it's sheathe because he couldn't contain the raw amount of pleasure he felt from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus laughs as he watches Spyro grow and grow. \"Well, you're a Purple Dragon after all! It's only natural you have a bit of a strong growth spurt! Or a very strong one!\" He says walking over, as Spyro now grew past Ignitus' 20 feet of height and just kept growing. Cynder couldn't help but blush as she kept looking up higher and higher at Spyro. Ignitus growled sexily as he stroked Spyro's dick. \"Mmm, you're getting to be a big fella ain't ya?\" He says smiling as Spyro grew to 25 feet and kept growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ignitus.\" Spyro pants out as he strokes the purple dragon's dick. \"Hehehe. Sorry, couldn't help myself. I just always wanted to see how big you would get, and I can tell...you're only gonna get bigger-\" 35 feet- \"-and bigger-\" 50 feet- \"-and bigger-\" 75 feet- \"-and bigger!\" Ignitus says to Spyro as he just grew and grew in that one long spurt. Eventually the spurt ended with Spyro towering over much of the area at a massive 100 feet in size. He was panting and heaving, but all with a smile on his face, after the mighty growth he had just undergone. Cynder now felt absolutely puny, blushing at how huge his cock was compared to even Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of whom, flies up to Spyro and hovers in front of him. \"Now that's a growth spurt! And to think, it was only your second one!\" He says sounding proud of Spyro, who manages to catch his breath finally and grins \"Hehehe. Yeah! I bet Cynders are gonna be way bigger than mine though!\" He says sounding happy. \"Who knows? You might end up way ahead of her, or she might end up ahead of you. Either way, I can tell, you both are gonna get quite big!\" He says grinning right back at Spyro. Now was the question: Who would experience their growth spurt next?</span></div></div>",

Some have l-late ones.\" He says, trying to get his words out, finding it rather difficult due to the intensity of the spurt. He had never one so intense before, but he wasn't complaining. Especially not when it actually started and he grew right in front of Spyro's face. Spyro took a few big steps away from Ignitus to give him room to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' spurts had never been strong, so he was more or less about average dragon size because of it, but this was a biiig one. It was biiiiiig because he was already Spyro's size and was only growing more! Spyro kept moving back as Ignitus grew and grew and grew, towering higher and higher over the purple dragon. Spyro was at 100 feet still, while Ignitus was already 200 feet and still growing! \"M-mmmmph, this is a biiiiiigguuuuuun.\" Ignitus moans out, panting and puffing as he just kept growing and growing. Cynder flew up on top of Spyro's head to look up at Ignitus' growing form better. It was incredible. She may not have liked being the smallest, but she certainly didn't mind the show of the big dicks both Spyro and Ignitus had to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Ignitus, he was still growing, getting past 300 feet now, but starting to slow finally. \"Man...we got a lot of catching up to do, huh Cynder?\" Spyro asks her grinning. She giggles lightly. \"I suppose so. I hope I'm next though, not exactly being the smallest for so long.\" She admits with a slight blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ignitus' growth stops, when he's 450 feet tall. He finishes, laying on his side, shaking the ground with his massive form. \"Sorry if I stole your thunder you two. Didn't think I'd have such a big late spurt.\" He says with a laugh. \"It's okay Ignitus. But man, I kind of wish we all could've gotten this big when Malfeor was around!\" Spyro says chuckling. \"Hahaha! Yeah. But at least we don't have to worry about him now, so we can just enjoy the growth!\" Ignitus replies laughing heartily.</span></div></div>",

She was still shivering and shaking a bit when she was a good bit above Spyro and Ignitus. They could tell this was gonna be a big one. She moaned as her body began to rapidly expand in size, overtaking Spyro's size rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooo, yeah Cynder! Get biiiig!\" Spyro cheers her on. She nods to him, smiling through the lustful panting and heaving. Her chest was also having a new development on it, showing off some lovely bouncey breasts. Cynder couldn't help but start to fondle them as she grew past even Ignitus' mighty size, up to 500 feet and only growing from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe! Looks like you're the smallest now Spyro!\" Ignitus says grinning down at Spyro, while Cynder grew and towered over both of them. \"Hahahaha! I don't mind, seeing us all get so big is awesome! Even being this big myself is already super great!\" He replies with a big grin of his own. Meanwhile, just one of Cynder's boobs easily outsizes Ignitus by the time she is about 1250 feet tall, and still growing. The two large male dragons smile and look up at the growing goddessly body of Cynder, as she huffed and puffed in pleasure, fondling her massive breasts. Surprisingly anything that her massive body grows over is unharmed. Whether it be other beings or even the area around her. It was all smothered harmlessly underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her growth ended, with her sitting at a massive mile in size, panting and moaning from the afterglow of the strong growth. \"And that...little men...is how you grow.\" She pants out proudly. Spyro and Ignitus fly up and land on one of her breasts smiling up at her. \"Hehehe. If someone like Malfeor ever shows up again, I doubt they'd last long against you!\" Ignitus says smiling proud of her, to which Cynder giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when do you think me and Spyro will stop growing? Or was it just a couple of big spurts for the both of us?\" Cynder asks. \"Well, I'm not sure. Heck, I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to get anymore growth spurts myself, yet look at me! I'm bigger than even Spyro!\" Ignitus replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not. I wanna see just how big all of us gets!\" Spyro says smiling. Then loud pants and heaving came from Spyro all of a sudden, as the tingly sensation of grow drew near. The panting grew harder and harder, as did the shaking and shivering, as the growth grew stronger and stronger. Cynder set him down on the ground, and had backed up, to give him lots of growth space for the obviously massive spurt he was about to go through. He wanted this to a biiiig spurt, but just how big was it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

A big guy like you shouldn't have to be so shy about sharing your goods.\" Spyro says grinning as he licks the growing dick, making the now 1000 feet tall fire guardian moan louder and start to leak pre from his cock. \"Hehehe...y-you're right. A g-groooowdian like me should be free to release when he needs to. Mind helping me out as well Cynder?\" He says smiling down at the ever tinier dragons on his cock. Cynder nods blushing deeply, and begins to rub the large dick of the growing dragon their on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther dragons that were training or just watching in awe, also fly on up onto the dick to help him get off. \"Haaa...haaaa. Mmm, you're all really goooood at this pleasuring.\" He pants out. 2000 feet and still growing, the growdian felt his growth go on and on, along with the amount of dragons pleasuring his dick. Even the other guardians have begun to try and pleasure the growing Ignitus. It looked like he would be the one calling the shots for them from now on, but he'd focus more on that when he actually stops growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, his dick starts throbbing harder, shooting off jets of pre, as he reaches 1 mile tall, and is still growing. \"Dang Ignitus. This is a serious growth spurt!\" Spyro says impressed. Ignitus simply grins down at him, letting his wide smile do all the talking. He knew it and he loved it. He loved being so huge, being so large and in charge. Eventually, after some final growth, he came with a roar shooting high into the sky and all around him. He panted and huffed in relief, at a massive 2 miles in size. He lays on his back, his seed soaking the land around him. \"Hehehe...sorry little guys. I've been pent up for a while.\" He says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you got huge. I feel like even more of a speck now.\" Cynder admits embarrassed. \"Don't worry Cynder. I think you'll grow bigger yourself soon enough! Either way though, I'm the biggest for now!\" Ignitus says proudly. Cynder smiles. Oh she'll grow alright. She's gonna make sure she does.

She turns to look to him at his little outburst, and sees how he seems to be getting smaller, only just noticing the tingling returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems I may be the one who'll be bigger in the end\" She leans down so they're eye-to-eye, eyes half lidded with a small grin on her face as she rises past eye level. \"I could get used to this, and I know you could too\" She stands back up, past 12' tall still and only growing more. She looks to Ignitus and smirks. \"I'm coming to take over as the biggest dragon, old man\" She teases. \"And this boy seems quite eager for that.\" She nods to Spyro, who's tail is wagging like a puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Cynder! Get huge!\" He cheers the 13' and rising dragoness on. She closes her eyes and grunts as a particularly potent surge hits her. 14'... 15'... 16'... 17'... 18' of dragoness, over twice the smaller dragon's size, and nearly as big as the elder dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your growth is very potent, and to think it's only your first true spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder smirks s she looks very slightly up at the elder dragon... eye to eye... down to him. \"What do you mean by that, shorty?\" she giggles a bit, outgrowing Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we've been growing nightly!\" Spyro pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, those are not true spurts, young ones. Only when one grows in a noticeable way while awake can a dragon say they have truly hit their first growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long will it last?\" The now 23' Cynder asks, lowering her gaze to meet her elder's so she can \"outgrow\" him all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, dragons never truly know when they're done growing until we die. Usually it's a spurt of only a few inches, not feet though!\" He admits, chuckling a bit as Cynder finally slows and stops growing at 25' tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! You've gotten so big, Cynder!\" Spyro practically fanboys over the dragoness nearly three times his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did the little purple guy miss this size on me?\" She teased, eliciting a blush from the purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... m-maybe I've dreamed of you being in that form but good... and teasing me...\" He gulps at her predatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And how often do you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...\" He gulps, deciding not to risk lying. \"It comes up nearly every night....\" He admits. \"Sometimes I grow too, but you end up towering... And... And... And I like it!\" He tenses, afraid she will reject him over such a weird fantasy for a hero. He wasn't expecting to feel her gently smother him with a huge paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like this?\" She leans in close. He just nods. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I love being big, and if it makes my little cutie happy, then that's even better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus just chuckles. \"You kids...\"</span></div></div>",

He has yet to have shown it as well, so he feels now is the perfect time he feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts taking a deep breath, his inners being heated by his natural dragon fire. He keeps taking in more and more, and his begins to expand larger, creaking and groaning as he does this. \"What the heck, Ignitius? What are you doing? How are you growing like that?\" Spyro asks shocked when he first sees it. \"Hehehe. It's a technique I learned in my training. I heat up the air inside me to make myself grow bigger. The more air I take in, the bigger I can get! And the bigger I get the more air I can take in!\" He boasts proudly as he now grows larger than the two dragon saviors. 40 feet, 50 feet, 60 feet, he just kept growing and sucking in more air. \"Now, there is an extra little step to this, if you wanna see me REALLY grow!\" He says grinning down at them, as he stops taking in air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then show us! If you got the growth, just do it big fella!\" Spyro calls up excited. \"Hehehe. I'd be interested in seeing it as well.\" Cynder adds. Ignitus grins wider, and begins taking a very, VERY deep breath, that actually makes his chest extend outwards with how much air he's taken in. He pats it as he holds his breath, before taking one of his claws, and blowing hard into it. He then expands largely and rapidly, towering over the very temple as he grows to 125 feet, then 175 feet, then 250 feet! He eventually stops growing at about 400 feet total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder look up, mouths agape at the hugeness of Ignitus. \"W...wow, you're huge! How big can you get?\" Spyro asks in awe. Ignitus grins happily. \"I'm pretty sure I don't have a limit! Though, huff...I could, huff...sh-show you some more growth n-noooowww.\" He moans as suddenly, he starts expading once more. \"H-Hey! Are you growing through a growth spurt now?!\" Cynder asks as she and Spyro take to the air and fly up towards Ignitus' face. \"Y-Yeah, I am! Mmm, c-come on body, bigger, bigger!\" He huffs out, growing to 500 feet, then 700 feet, then 1000 feet! His dick is out in full erection, showing how turned on this whole situation was making him. \"Bigger, bigger, bigger!\" He huffs out, still growing and growing and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder were really getting left behind now, but they wouldn't let themselves be counted out just yet!

He begins to focus and try to will his body to begin growing. Then he began to huff and pant in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to grow, and grow rapidly, Cynder landing on his back as he grew very quickly to 150 feet tall already. \"Geez, did you just get a growth spurt too Spyro!?\" Cynder asks shocked. \"Yeaaaah, B-But I w-willed mine to happen, oh fuck yeah this feels gooood.\" He moans. 300 feet, 450 feet, 600 feet, he was quickly catching up to Ignitus, who was too distracted by his own growth making him reach 2000 feet to notice Spyro catching up. \"M-Maaaan. I feel great!\" Ignitus cheers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well, I feel BIIIIG!\" Spyro roars, as he suddenly surpasses Ignitus in size at 2500 feet, before using his mighty size to playfully pin Ignitus on his back, grinning in the Fire Dragon's face as he was still growing. \"Huff, s-sorry Ignitus, but l-looooks like I'm the biiiiiig dragon now.\" He huffs out, already reaching 4000 feet tall, his dick fully out and erect also. As he grew and grew, his dick alone would be enough to pin Ignitus underneath it, despite Ignitus still growing himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, you are the Purple Dragon after all!\" Ignitus says blushing with the dragon dick on top of him. Spyro was already about 3 miles tall, with a dick that's a mile long, and half as wide. \"Yeah. Mmmmph, but man is all this growth making me hoooornnnyyyy.\" He moans out. He then steps off of Ignitus, and onto an open piece of land. He grins and huffs and shoves his dick into the ground, and begins to hump it. \"Huff, huff. Mmmmm, yeaaaaah. This is the stuff! Come on planet! C-Can you withstand this Purple Dragon dick?\" He asks the 'planet' rhetorically. He grew larger and larger with each hump, 4 miles, 5 miles, 6 miles, bigger and bigger he grew still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, more, more! Grow, grow, groooow! I'm big, I'm biiiig, I'm BIIIIIG!\" He roars and huffs as he keeps growing and humping away. The planet shook and rocked, as Spyro's growth kept going and going. \"Haaah, not enough. Still not nearly enough. I want more pleasure, more size, more power!\" He huffs out as he grows past 10 miles tall, then 20, then 30! He loved every bit of his growth, as the planet buckled beneath his draconic sex drive.</span></div></div>",

The two young dragons looks at eachother, as she notices a small flash of excitement to... disappointment as she doesn't look bigger. Then the two feel the tingling. \"Ah! And so are you, young Spyro!\" The two look around and note they're growing again. Looking back at Cynder, she seemed a bit bigger... Was it possible she was growing faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 12' Dragoness looked back at her 10'6 lover. \"I'm loving this, how about you?\" She kisses his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! It's great!

Is it possible these two's growth is tied into their subconsciousness? \"You two have fun together\" He moves to leave, but runs into a larger dragon. \"Oh, sorry, I didn't...\" He finds himself looking up at the grinning 21'... no, 22' Cynder. \"Where do you think you're going, shorty?\" she teases. \"Come over, Spyro dear!\" He does so, only 18' tall. \"Stand here next to Ignitus\" He does so. \"Oh, you're almost there, babe! You can do it!\" Ignitus turns to see spyro rise. The purple dragon turns to look just as he passes eye level with the older dragon. \"Good job, little guy!\" Cynder kisses his forehead, giggling as he blushes even as his growth halts at 21' tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still groing, Cynder!\" Spyro cheers as she passes 26' tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I do seem to be.

But now he wanted to release it and thus he did, unleashing a mighty roar as he cums hard into the cave he was fucking, his cock spewing out cum like a fire hose, filling the cave up with his seed.

Now, how to grow bigger this time? Part of him wanted to start fucking the ground and pleasure himself that way, but he wondered...could he just will himself to grow bigger? He loved growing and all, but he also did want to use this size and power to defend the world he cared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he begins to imagine himself and trying to will his body to grow bigger, and then...he feels it. He feels himself growing larger! Yes, it worked! Ooooh boy did it work. He pants and moans in pleasure as he just wills himself larger and larger and larger, his body responding to his powerful desire to be bigger, bigger, BIGGER! \"Yeaaah, body. Get bigger! WAY BIGGER!\" He pants out. 2 miles, 4 miles, 8 miles, the bigger he gets, the stronger the growth gets and the stronger the growth gets, the bigger he gets faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis huge ass, and balls are smothering everything, but because he also desires to protect them all, he doesn't need to worry about his massive form crushing everything underneath him. Meanwhile, Malfeor, sensing the incredible surge in power, comes forth to figure out what is causing it. He was massive himself, about 1000 feet tall, looming over the landscape. But it seems he didn't yet notice the huge shadow growing over him. When he does and looks up, his jaw drops in shock, at the sight of Ignitus growing and growing and growing, reaching a mighty 50 miles tall and still growing. Malfeor was furious though, to see this dragon guardian so much larger than him. He would not stand for that and began to will his own body larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IGNITUS! I HOPE YOU DON'T EXPECT YOURSELF TO BE THE LARGEST FOR LONG! I WILL SHOW YOU TRUE POWER!\" Malfeor roars up at him, from his already mile large body. Ignitus hears his roar and looks down. \"WELL, I DON'T EXPECT TO BE. I KNOW I'LL BE!\" Ignitus laughs as his growth accelerates and he grows past 100 miles tall. Malfeor growled in anger and sped up his own growth, not going to be outdone by this oaf.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGnngh, this day\u2019s just been going so slowly. All I wanted to do is tell Cyril about the remarkable status on Spyro\u2019s progression. The necessity to freeze my tongue to the roof of my mouth wasn\u2019t there; I couldn\u2019t even taste my favorite berries off the bushes in the forest my tongue was so numb\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large yellow and blue electric dragon sluggishly trudged through the temple halls with his head and long neck low. Boredom was his biggest enemy, at least in the non-physical aspect, and was really settling in on him during this particular afternoon. By nature he was a talker with a highly analytical mind, the most intelligent of the 4 elemental guardians, thus he disliked being alone and always wanted someone to engage with on virtually any subject matter possible. While Volteer was a venerable ally and friend due to this trait, his motor mouth was at times his biggest weakness, but it wasn\u2019t for not being able to keep a secret. On more than one occasion he would get passed back and forth between Ignitus, Cyril and Terrador to get some peace once their patience eroded. Ignitus and Terrador were usually more mellow on showing they were reaching their breaking points, Cyril not so much. With Terrador off somewhere training with Spyro and Ignitus taking a nap with his door locked, for the past couple hours Cyril had his hands full as Volteer\u2019s main target.  Drifting from place to place all over the temple, to him it was as if Volteer jabbered relentlessly without even a pause to breathe, even here in the library!<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid ignoramus! Don\u2019t you ever stop blabbering!? Shut up and leave me be you lowly dragon! Get out! Leave!! SHOO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snarling words that reverberated off the library walls made Volteer instantly trip up on his words in a bumbling, stammering attempt at an apology, however Cyril wanted no part of it and gave him truly the cold shoulder by blowing some bitterly cold air into the electric dragon\u2019s mouth, more than enough of an incentive to leave.  Fast forward another half an hour and it\u2019s back to the present moment of Volteer lumbering lazily to a place where he hoped would satiate the need to curb his boredom. Inside a somewhat small structure, he steps into completely circular room that also had another arched opening across from the very one the drake entered, a subtle beam creeps onto his face at the small body of green water positioned in the room\u2019s center. \u201cAhh, the looking pool room!  Why didn\u2019t I think of this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pool of Visions was a special place where dragons of the past and present could look into in search of any possible answers to what lay ahead in the coming future, or even at the current moment in a faraway land, someone in trouble for example. Of the 4 of them Ignitus by far possessed the most skill at accurately understanding foreseen details, but they were all competent enough to do it in one way or another. Volteer normally didn\u2019t exhibit the degree of fasciation that Ignitus did towards the mystical pool, the main reason why visions didn\u2019t always come out clearly for him, if at all, although today he was determined to sit still and focus\u2026 after all, there was nothing else better to do. Being a calculated thinker that he was, thoughts and ideas were nearly always rolling through his mind, which one of them he often practiced when staring into the Pool of Visions was just to pretend to BE Ignitus! \u201cJust be calm and don\u2019t think too much, Volteer\u2026\u201d the guardian, now lying on his belly gazing in the water, murmurs under his breath, \u201cRemember what Iggy says: just empty your mind. Let the visions come to you\u2026 and please don\u2019t drink any of it.\u201d        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce giving himself a quick reason to laugh by recalling to the time he nearly took a slurp of the pool\u2019s contents many, many trips around the sun ago, the guardian puts on a serious face for real this time, one enough even for Terrador to be proud of. A very long, deep inhale is taken as he lies in place, and stares directly at the water\u2019s perfectly mirror-esque surface. Not a sound in the chamber nor any movement of air to match, Volteer concentrated with unyielding dedication at staring at his reflection, just the very same spot, with the only time his eyes not looking at the water being the occasional blink. It was a little tricky for even Ignitus to explain to others on how the pool worked exactly, but to Volteer his way of associating it reminded him of an optical illusion puzzle, a game he was always intrigued by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it; I\u2026 I believe I\u2019m getting something here! Oh great pool of generations past, what is there in store for I, Volteer? Mmm, I can hardly contain my excitement!\u201d Volteer\u2019s tail bouncily swished to and fro. To his delight, right as his eyes began to tire from straining on one point he is allowed to relax them. Indeed, like an optical illusion he lets his eyes slowly draw apart in order to perceive the somewhat blurry image coming into shape, a moving one to be more precise.  A vast vantage of a snow-capped mountain range off in the distance was framed on the bottom by the tops of trees coming in one\u2019s direction way down below, looking like no more than clustered heads of broccoli. \u201cMy, such an enchanting scene straight out an old tale of lore. An excellent idea! A leisurely flight over the forest would be a splendid way to pass the time! Although\u2026 hmm, perhaps not so darned high\u2026 how would I enjoy the intricate beauty of the forest flying 150 feet in the air?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheerful, closed-eyes charismatic grin spreads across the yellow drake\u2019s face the moment he stood up, his tail thumping around in the dirt all the while and chest confidently pushed forward. He felt so triumphant, and understandably so! Normally he had a tricky time pulling answers out from the Pool of Visions from his jittery nature, but not this time! \u201cThis went so fluidly, so smoothly. I\u2019m getting better at this every time I try it. I can\u2019t wait to tell Ignitus later on, he\u2019ll be surely proud I grasp the concept. Who says an old dog can\u2019t learn new tricks, hm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolteer has a bounce in his step as he heads his way back to the way he entered, only to be halted by a flash of light in the corner of his eye, and reactively does a double take. As quick as his on-top-of-the-world expression formed seconds earlier it is just as instantaneously replaced by a look of mulling curiosity. Over on the opposite side of the room sitting right in the doorway that lead to the large dojo now sat a large, softly glowing crystal. About 2 meters tall, or roughly three-fourths as tall as he was when sitting in a shade of white accented by the occasional glimmer of colorful iridescence, this gem was instant captivation for the electric guardian, already transfixed on its sudden appearance and beauty. So much that he went into brief low-level flight across the relatively small room to get to it faster. \u201cA spirit gem... and one of upmost charm at that! It\u2019s a rare sight to witness one make its premier arrival here on Earth! A gift from our ancestors I've heard\u2026 and I believe it! Only a place from beyond this dimension could such a spectacle appear from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough tall, the crystal was no more than 18 inches across at its max width near its top and only a foot at its base, allowing ample space for Volteer to circle around it to admire it from all angles, including its subtle warmth it radiated.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a white one like this before.  Even the whitest snow and most extravagant pearls would be jealous.  I thought these only came in red, green, blue or purple.  Yes, a lucky find indeed.  Ancestors, I bid my thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of bitter was added to the sweet, because Volteer remembered that spirit gems needed to be shattered into many pieces to release their power, and this saddened him a little that at some point in the near time he would be destroying it. Or so he thought; when he places his clawed hand to stroke the crystal\u2019s flawlessly smooth surface in a way that spoke, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, friend.\u201d it began to quickly glow intensely\u2026 and much to Volteer\u2019s surprise so was his whole arm! He lets out a sharp gasp and slams his eyelids tight at the sudden transfer of heat and power that felt as if it was coursing through every living cell in his being, yet inexplicably he couldn\u2019t bring himself to take his hand away. Thankfully the dramatic intensity eases after the initial burst into an oddly soothing sensation, which tempted Volteer to open his eyes. He felt both apprehensive and intrigued towards the sight of the ethereal white energy swirling into his arm, and remained transfixed until any trace of the gem faded away. In a matter of seconds a spirit gem stood right in front of him, now it\u2019s as if nothing had ever been there at all! \u201cWell that wasn\u2019t according to plan; I WAS going to share...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking himself over, there were no adverse effects to his body from what he could tell, but just to be sure he stepped ahead into the dojo and flew a few laps around the enormous dragon statue that took up a great amount of the room. Corkscrews, barrel rolls, and loops he executed just for good measure, imagining he were performing in an act for all to enjoy, but apart from getting a little dizzy upon landing in front of the doorway he felt fine, great even. In fact, he caught himself again doing something completely out of the ordinary. \u201cI feel wonderful!  This day has turned around so astoundingly well that my chest keeps puffing out!  Oh, I\u2019m starting to act like Cyril! I\u2019d better be careful; if I were his ego's size I\u2019d match height with the ancestral statue. Haha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, a strange tingle overtakes Volteer\u2019s body, his eager smile wiped away by the sensation of lightheadedness, which causes him to rub his eyes and shake his head slowly left and right, realizing maybe he spoke too soon. Both he and the statue were dimly glowing with a whitish aura, a preceding herald to something game-breaking (possible pun intended) about to occur for Dragon Realms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was not a common occurrence for Volteer to be rendered speechless, but even one as engaging as him was at a loss for words to what was taking place right before his eyes.  The elegantly crafted ancestral statue of times old was shrinking, first pretty slowly and then increasing timely to a steadier speed, eventually diminishing until it matched his height, base and all.  The room\u2019s centerpiece now at Volteer\u2019s size made for an empty setting in stark contrast to what he had been used to seeing for many years, both adding strangeness of revealing architectural elements he never really paid attention to and by the echoing hollow sounds, such as the whispering winds, dull thudding of his footsteps, and most apparently his voice.  Even speaking to himself at a reasonable level saw his voice carried all around full and clear.  \u201cThe statue\u2026 err, umm, did <i><b>I</b></i> do that?  This day is becoming more and more uncanny, totally unprecedented in my lifetime experience for sure.  Either I need some much needed bedrest like Ignitus\u2014too much boredom CAN yield many side effects, mmhm\u2014 or that gem gave me a new power!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toothy- grinned glance to the sky with a hand stroking his indigo goatee, Volteer takes a small moment to admire the lichen covered walls adorned with jewels and shrubs growing out some of the cracked stone ledges halfway towards the ceiling, giving marveling testament to how etched in history the temple really was.  Moving beyond that, what could now be most appreciated was the wonderfully exquisite stained glass ceiling itself.  \u201cOhh, the time it must have taken to construct such flawless beauty... the way the rainbow-hued sunlight shines through and dances with the moving shadows from the rustling tree limbs along with the silhouettes of carved glass\u2026 ah, nature at its finest!\u201d Volteer openly spoke his musings, then shifting his eyes down to the eye level statue in the room\u2019s middle.  Immediately his endearing smile faded\u2026 \u201cB-But yet how sad that the ancestral statue genuinely robs us of it unless we guardians or the young ones are training\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electric guardian\u2019s resulting heaved sigh is retuned to him via ricocheting off the barren temple\u2019s walls.  As much as he wanted to keep things this way in part of the tranquility made by both sight and sound, he knew of the statue\u2019s cultural significance of their past.  And to their future too: the statue was synchronized specifically with the floor to sink below the surface, creating room for the dojo arena in the wide space left in its wake.  With the statue now shrunk to the size of an average adult dragon, however, who\u2019s to say this carefully timed mechanism still worked properly?  Volteer was a renowned guardian; he needed to do and protect what was in the best interest of everyone, not just himself.  An infamous yakker he was, yes\u2026 but selfish he was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully the statue shrinking down to my size wasn\u2019t a one time usage only ordeal.  Molecular structural alteration of an object to such a degree is in no way weak magic, and it could take great time to find another white crystal.  Ages\u2026 eras\u2026 eons\u2026 I-I wouldn\u2019t even know HOW to start explaining my severe mistake to the other guardi-\u201d Volteer pauses to take a deep breath.  \u201cNo, no, Volteer\u2026 collect yourself.  No reason to panic, think positive!  I very well may have acquired an ability that could last as long as I live.  And that\u2019d be something uniquely esoteric!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow drake knew there was only one way to find out.  He tries doing what he figured was most logical by focusing on the stone sculpture and imagining it looking the way it was supposed to.  Lo and behold the brightened demeanor Volteer took on when he and the statue took on the familiar ghostly glow; following suit the ground lightly shook as it gradually expanded outward and upward, all the way up to the towering, stately height it had formerly always been.  After the glowing ceased, not a scratch, dent, or any other suggested sign of tampering could Volteer find during a quick, rising corkscrew of a flying spot check.  \u201cHeeheehaha!  A perfect execution both ways!  I really CAN control such a power!  I always assumed only potions and machines could exploit this principle of matter!  The theories, the hypotheses I could think of for hours on end!  The fun I could have playing around with this!  Who could have thought this dismal day would turn into one of the best days of my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an overwhelming rush of barely contained bliss, the electric guardian leaps off the statue\u2019s snout and beelines through the passage back into the Pool of Visions room, and just as quickly sails over the aforementioned containment of liquid, his \u2018hi!/bye!\u2019 flyby making tiny ripples through its translucent jade surface.  Back outside, it was as if not even the nearly wall-to-wall sunshine could measure up to the brightness of his giddy smile.  Never mind the calm fly over the forest, he wanted to tell someone about his newfound feature!  But who?  Terrador wasn\u2019t here since he was with Spyro off somewhere, Volteer having no clue of his return time (even though it could be any time), which meant his best choices were Cyril in the library or Ignitus in his bed chamber.  \u201cWho to tell?  Who to choose?  Ignitus and Cyril both are occupied being by themselves, but I think this qualifies as an exception!  Maybe I\u2019ll even show them a personal\u2026 demonstration!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeeding off in direction back to the main corridors letting off sparks off his body all the while, Volteer made his decision.  The lucky dragon he would soon be visiting would turn out to be...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all when is he ever going to get a chance like this again. The yellow dragon stands up straight and makes himself certain of Cyril's position before entering the library. Then in somewhat loud voice calls out to the ice dragon. \"Cyril, are you present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril for his part is still trying to figure out what happens when a booming voice jolts him out of his thoughts. \"CYRIL, ARE YOU PRESENT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dragon whirls around and looks up in surprise as Volteer's enormous body fills his vision. Standing what seemed like hundreds of feet in the air was his colossal friend. A living monument of yellow and blue scales was all that the ice dragon saw. Before he could say anything however, Volteer began moving closer. Each foot fall from the giant sent shock waves through the earth that threatened to knock Cyril off his feet. The ice guardian could only maintain his balance as Volteer's shadow fell upon him. At last the giant stopped right in front of him, Volteer's front paw landed dangerously close to the tiny dragon. The force of it landing being more then enough to knock the dragon on his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril still in shock could only stare upwards at Volteer. His muscular form now put the ice dragon's diminutive body to shame. Cyril began to trail his eyes downward towards the dragon's other... assets. Volteer's package and balls made Cyril feel even smaller. But the giant's thundering voice brought him to his senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HM, HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE HERE. BUT PERHAPS MY LOVELY COMRADE WILL SHOW HIMSELF IF I CONTINUE TO IDLE HERE. THIS FACILITY WITHIN THE TEMPLE IS HIS FAVORITE SPOT. YES, WAITING IN THIS HALL OF KNOWLEDGE IS MOST IDEAL. FURTHERMORE, I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER WAY TO PASS THE TIME THEN DEVOURING THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THESE TOMES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyril watched as Volteer pulled a massive book (to him) out from one of the shelves and placed it down gently on the floor behind him. Excellent, maybe the ice guardian could get his friend's attention by jumping on too the pages. It was only when he felt the ground shake and look up again did he realize what was about happen. Volteer's yellow scaled romp was hurtling down towards him. The dragon had seconds to act. The tiny dragon dove out of the way as Volteer's butt made contact with the earth. The dust settled as the ice dragon tried to get his bearings. after moving around for a bit he realized where he was. Volteer realized it to a smirked to himself a bit.
