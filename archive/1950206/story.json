Fortunately, the neighborhood has calmed and there's nothing apart from occasional tremors and noises, although they seem to be coming from far away. On the other hand there's not much to see, since most of the view is blocked by several floors high piles of rubble made by the gigantic woman just walking. You tremble with the thought that had she stepped somewhere else, you would all be dead, just like so many people must have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, there's no time for panic right now. You need to stay calm and survive this. There must be a way.. if only you could find what is causing this chaos, perhaps you might take some precautions.. or at least know where to hide with your mother and sister. After calming them down - Melody is still the size of a doll and mother seems to be losing it - you tell them that you will try to find out what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't go! It's safer here!\" - your mother pleads at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point to the craters just outside the window and reply - \"If something like that comes again, then we'll be gone anyway. We need to know what's happening outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggles with the idea, but after a moment admits: \"Fine, but please.. do be careful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will be back shortly\" - you try to comfort them, if only you were so sure of it yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter literally jumping up the stairs, you try to figure out where to start. The TV doesn't work - you quickly discover that there's no power. \"Just great\" - you complain to yourself, but you should have expected it.. with so much damage to the infrastructure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to your room to find that the phone is useless as well - although the batteries are almost full, charged over the night, there is no signal. The only way to survey the situation is to go outside yourself. Looking through the window you don't see any immediate dangers - there is some commotion in the neighborhood, but it's mostly people driving away. You consider that option as well, but then.. go where, exactly? The last thing you notice through the window is a sight of a young boy - five or six years old perhaps - riding a kid bike... but miles tall, effortlessly bulldozing through downtown in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to make sure there isn't anything like that coming your way. Walking outside, you see chaos everywhere - it didn't seem that bad from the \"safety\" of your home. People screaming, running around - and nobody seems to know what is going on. The worst part is just how many things isn't right with the world. Half cars are the wrong size - some toy-sized, others rivaling nearby houses - which seem to be randomly affected as well. You decide to climb the nearest pile of rubble just across the road to see the wider area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing to the other side, you see what the kid must have been running away from - far in the distance, you spot a hazy outline of a dome of some kind. It seems alien at first, but then you spot another one behind it and realize it must be bra... impossibly huge, larger than any mountain range at least dozens of miles high. You definitely would not like to meet its owner - if she was enlarged to this size as well, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from the highest point of the debris, you cannot see any other threats - the enormous lady in red dress is nowhere to be seen, the kid is driving away and although there are some overgrown pets and cars large enough to take three lanes of traffic, there is nothing in the area to endanger your home directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext,</span></div></div>",
