She got onto a roof by herself and opened the bottle. She took a deep breath and splashed the water all over her. She waited for a moment, and soon noticed she had changed. She leapt to a nearby shop window and was stunned at her new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red hair was now a pale lavender that wasn't in a pigtail anymore, but instead fell down her backside. Her outfit also changed to that of a silver bikini that merely covered her nipples and lower region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This girl must have been an exhibitionist.' thought Ranma who felt this was much worse than his old female body. Luckily, it seemed the new body also came equipped with a black kimono. Ranma reached in and fished out a gold coin tied to a string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the tool needed, she decided to test it out.</span></div></div>",

Ranma had just had a fight with one of his fiances Akane. For a while after the failed wedding Akane seemed nice, but she soon became her old self. Ranma starts calming down, and notices a new store had opened. He walks into the store, and sees someone falling from a high shelf. He runs, and catchs the person before he could fall on a tray of glass bottles. He helps up the person who was a robed old man.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help young man,\" the man said.<br>\r\n\"It was no problem,\" Ranma said.<br>\r\n\"I must repay you for your help.

Finaly he spots a box with \"ONLY A MAN AMONGEST MEN MAY OPEN\" writen on it. Remembering the senpaku pact that was made with his mother Ranma decides to take it to see if he could open it, and prove himself to his mother. He shows it to Gary, and is given it.<br>\r\nRanma is siting alone in a park, and is about to open the box. He opens the box a find a potion in it. The potion says \"POTION OF THE LOVER. WARNING WILL INCREASE MANLINESS\" and in a very small print(needs magnifying glass to be read)\"Manliness is defined as being a pervert, and having many lovers while beliving it to be perfectly all right\". Ranma remembers his mother, and decides to drink the potion. He is then knocked out from its effects.<br>\r\nRanma wakes up with a head ache, and a boner. He trys to remember what happens when he sees Kodachi in the park. He realizes he never noticed how hot she was. He feels the urge to kiss her, and with his new thought trys to do it. He walks behind her, and grabs her, When she turns around he kisses her straght on the lips. She gains a shocked look, but it is soon replaced with love, and devotion. She falls to her knews, and bows her head.<br>\r\n\"I love you master,\" Kodachi says with out her sense of domince.<br>\r\nRanma is at first confused, but realizes that it was the power of the potion. He wonders if he sould not use it, but the thoughts are soon removed by the potion.Ranma orders Kodachi to take him to her house, and she happly does. When they reach her room Ranma locks the door behind him.<br>\r\n\"Strip off your clothes Slave,\" Ranma orders.<br>\r\nKodachi joyfuly does wanting to show her Master her body. Ranma quickly grabs her breast, and squizes.<br>\r\n\"These belong to me. It is my right as your Master. You have no right to anything. You will spend the rest of your life as a object not a person. You are to be used by my lovers, and myself as a means to releave stress, and not for your own plesure,\" Ranma says remembering all the problems she caused him as Ranko.<br>\r\nAs he forces his slave back on her knees, Ranma wonders what to do next.</span></div></div>",

The master gets into Ranma's head, and merges with his brain. Ranma remains himself for the most part, but with the desire to take control of his life, and use the drones to get a slave harem (along with being more open to doing sexual things).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drones will enter girls' heads, and merge with their brains, but as they are drones, the complete merge will take time. A personality of a devoted love-slave for Ranma with the memories of her original self will be in charge, but her original mind will remain in the back of her head at first, unable to control her body or speak, while slowly becoming assimilated into the new mind until only the drone remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master (Ranma) is able to take over and act through his drones' bodies. All drones can tell when someone else is a drone, or when Ranma's in control of (and thus treat the girl(s) as if they were Ranma, since any orders would come from him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing Sword- The sword used by Kuno in the manga, which grants three wishes to the owner. Ranma uses the first to remove his cursed form into a separate person unrelated to him, then uses the second to fix his life by changing the Tendo sisters, Shampoo, Ukyo, Kodachi, and Ranko into his openly loving, loyal, obedient harem. The sword only works for wishes from the owner's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImprinting Eggs- The eggs from the end of the manga. They make the ensnared see the first person they see as their master. They still have their minds and overall personalities, but are unable to even comprehend the thought of disobeying or betraying their master, let alone actually doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality Journal- a journal, that when written in, changes reality to reflect what's written. Unless otherwise written, only the writer will remember the change if history is changed. The journal is indestructible.</span></div></div>",
