Samus is sitting in a blue recliner in the dorm part of the ship. Day 47 still no sign of life out there in the big black void of space. Samus stands up and heads to the bridge when upon a sudden something hit the ship, which a loud crash something that resembles a escape old came smashing through the hallway. Samus Dan up to it looking to see if any thing was in it. She began looking in the cockpit for signs of life when, crash a Metriod burst out of the cockpit throwing samus against the wall. The metriod sped down the hall when another figure rose out of the cockpit. A xenomorph. It began to chase after the metriod screeching as it ran. Samus g's her pistol and begins to chase them. Moving down the hallway she needs them but doesn't see them. Samus walks into a room and closes the door. She sits down on the bed and waits. A couple hours pass and she can still here them screeching. She finally lays down on the bed, takes of her clothes and then bang. Out of nowhere the metriod comes bursting in samus goes for her gun but then the xenomorph joins in the metriod is now cornerd between the xenomorph and samus. The metriod turns to face samus. It the speeds towards her. Before she could do anything the metriod shot up into her vagina. Samus falls back in shock, and blacks out. When she wakes she is on the bed with the xenomorph which she realizes is a predomorph. She tries to sit up but the predomorph has her strapped down. She looks down at her new pregnant belly with confusion. Then the predomorph stands up tall walks over to her and sticks its claw up her vagina. With moans of hurt and pleasure the predomorph rips out the metriod and kills it. It looks back at her and lowers its head toward her vagina and then. Sticks some kind of tube into her and begins to pump. She looks at the predomorph in horror and sees eggs being pumped into her vagina.She passes out again and wakes to the predomorph gone and her mind month pregnant belly. I have to get these things out.</span></div></div>",

The robot asks Samus to lay down on the table. Alright Samus I'm going to numb your uterus and then I will remove the aliens. So the robot does so then she sticks her hand into samuses vagina and grabs the 4 baby alien xenomorphs. After taking them out the robots belly fills up with water that looks like a large plastic bag.The lady robot asks Samus what she should do with the baby xenomorphs? Incubate them.

After Samus asked one of the baby xenomorphs starts to act up and go wild inside the robots womb. Samus the babies are restless. I see that. All of a sudden a xenomorph baby shoots itself out of the fake womb and on to the floor. It looks around and then looks at samus. Samus points the gun at it. Then baby xenomorph screeches at her and bolts towards her. Samus begins shooting but keeps missing the baby jumps at her. Strait on target the baby xenomorph shoots back up into samuses vagina.

The space was pretty large, taking up an entire floor in the isolated building, but the location seemed to be a smart choice to hide from the Templars. The rainy night didn't hurt either. All of the other Assassins (what was left of them, anyways) were out on assignment, leaving Layla and the doctor to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Another sequence?\" Layla Hassan asked, crossing the room to see what Victoria was looking at on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. It's finally decrypted. I can't figure out what part of Kassandra's life it covers, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla put her hands on her hips. \"Well, I guess it's up to me to figure it out, right? Let's get the Animus started up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You've been using it enough lately as it is. You need to take a break every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria, this is important! You know what happens if we don't find the staff, right?\" Layla asked, knowing that the doctor was aware of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria closed her eyes and lowered her head. \"Then the Templars win. I get it. I'm just looking out for your health, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Bibeau put her hand on the Assassin's shoulder. Layla knew how much she looked out for her. Hell, sometimes she thought Victoria cared for her more than Layla cared for herself. But she was trying to save the world, and sometimes that meant that you had to take risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. And don't think that I don't appreciate it, because I really do. But what if this sequence is the one that leads us to what we've been looking for all these years?\" Layla's eyes went wide as she spoke, her sense of wonder and enthusiasm on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria frowned as she tried to fight back a smirk. She could never really say no to Layla. She'd try her best to change her mind whenever they got into arguments, but Layla always seemed to find a way to come out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Some day me giving in to your pitiful pleas is gonna get the both of us killed. But I suppose today won't be that day,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla raised an eyebrow. \"Does that mean what I think it means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have to ask? Just give me a minute to get the Animus up and running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Victoria was back at the computer while Layla was lying in the human-shaped indentation on the Animus. Layla grabbed the Abstergo virtual reality headset and placed it on her head. The doctor glanced at her as they prepared to dive in. \"First sign of trouble and I'm pulling you out. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear. Just relax, will you? It'll be fine. We haven't had any issues yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla's display suddenly changed from a menu screen to the surroundings of a familiar ship and the Aegean Sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loyal eagle Ikaros glided around the mast of the Adrestia while its crew worked below. Behind the wheel was Kassandra. She stood tall, her braided hair flapping against the front of her shoulder as the ship trudged through the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held a broken half of a spear in her hands. It had belonged to her grandfather Leonidas, and held powers that she still didn't truly understand. Kassandra hummed a tune as she felt the tip of the blade rest against her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kassandra! A great day to be out on the ocean, is it not?\" an elderly man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnabas, the captain of the Adrestia, stood beside her, his long gray hair and beard swaying in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you say that every day you're at sea, Barnabas,\" she replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain cackled, hands at his sides. \"I'll stop saying that when it stops being the truth. So where are we headed today, Commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra put a hand to her chin, pondering the possibilities. \"Hmm...it's been some time since I've been to Athens. Why not start there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA middle aged man in a blue hood sat behind her on the back of the ship. He didn't speak much, but the historian Herodotos always had something of value to add whenever he spoke up. Kassandra and Herodotos had crossed paths early on in her journey, and had been a valuable member of the crew ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Athens. The birthplace of democracy. We've been there many times. But there's much to do, and many unknowns on the horizon. Are you sure?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a good feeling about this, Herodotos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. ONWARD TO ATHENS!\" Barnabas shouted to the crew.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mere hours later, and the ship pulled in to the docks of the city. Athens was vast and housed many people that Kassandra considered to be friends. But they could wait. For now, she had drachmae to make. Kassandra went to the marketplace, searching for anyone that was in need of assistance. Much to her surprise, she had little luck. She checked a nearby bulletin board in hopes that something would be posted there. She'd been searching for an hour and had come up with nothing. At this point, Kassandra would even be willing to help a farmer lead their missing sheep back to them. Nothing close to even that was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Kassandra began to turn back to return to the Andrestia. That was, until a voice called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misthios?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was frail and high-pitched. It was a wonder that she could hear it over the noise of the bustling market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Kassandra replied without even knowing who was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned towards the voice, and saw a decrepit old woman sitting on a bench. The woman was tiny, nearly buried in her robes that covered her body and the top of her head. \"You are the one they call the Eagle Bearer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra smiled and made a triumphant pose, hands on her hips and puffing out her chest. \"There are some that call me that. But most people I know just call me Kassandra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kassandra,\" the old woman repeated. \"I wonder...would you be willing to help someone in need? I can pay, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do it if you couldn't,\" she joked. \"Tell me, what do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed. \"There is an island, just south of Athens. My family lived there for generations, but because of the war we were forced out. We got almost everything dear to us, except for a ring. It belonged to my great great grandmother. This was perhaps the most valuable possession we owned. Many tried to steal it, so we buried it in a cave on the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to get it and bring it back to you?\" Kassandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can find it. How does three thousand drachmae sound?\" she asked, pulling out a bag filled to the brim with coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds good to me. So I know you aren't lying, why not pay me half up front? As motivation?\" Kassandra proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman shook her head. \"I think not, my dear. We both know that you wouldn't venture to the island if that were to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're as wise as you look. Very well. I'll return to you as soon as possible!\" she said, turning to go back to the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting!\" the woman called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barnabas, do you know of an island to the south of the city?\" Kassandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain thought for a moment, scratching his beard. \"I believe I've seen it in passing a few times, but I can't say that I've ever stepped foot on it. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's were we need to go next. I'm helping a poor old woman in need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the goodness of your heart, I presume?\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra smiled back. \"Of course. The three thousand drachmae reward doesn't hurt either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're planning on sharing some of that with the rest of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Barnabas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, they had reached the island in question. It appeared to have once been the home of a small village, but that was some time ago. Now, it was nothing but a collection of burnt buildings. Indeed, war had ravaged this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra stepped foot on the sand and looked around. A large rocky hill rested in the middle. Where could a cave be here? She glanced up and saw Ikaros circling above her. Kassandra whistled, and the faithful eagle swooped down to a nearby roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are. Can you help me find the cave?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaros cawed and took off to the skies, flying over the island. Within moments, the bird made another noise, indicating that she should follow along. She was led to the back of a house that had fared better than most of the others there. Once she got behind it, Kassandra was able to make out a small hole on the side of the hill. It was just big enough for her to crawl through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasandra got on her knees and made it to the other side, where she was met with pitch blackness. She quickly lit a torch and got a look at her surroundings. It was a fairly small space, but now that she had some light she could see the deep water that was mere feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I lit this. Otherwise I'd be soaking wet right now,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Kassandra took a deep breath and dove into the water, tossing the torch aside. This wasn't her first time looking for something underwater in a cave. If this was like the other times, then the ring would be at the bottom. As it turned out, she had good intuition. There was something shiny that was half-buried in the rocky floor of the cave. Kassandra swum to the bottom, and eventually she got close enough to it to get a good look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object was the ring she was looking for, and appeared to be made of silver with a sapphire embedded in the center. She plucked it from the sand and made a fist around it. Kassandra swam back up and took a deep exhale as her head pierced the water, letting the refreshing air fill her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the ship, she stood by the wheel, wringing the water out of her hair. Barnabas stood beside her, a smile on his face as he looked her way. The Andrestia was already on the way back to Athens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find what you were looking for, Kassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" she replied, opening her hand to reveal the piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Pretty,\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For as much drachmae as she's paying me, I would hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was being honest with herself, Kassandra was a little disappointed at how easy the task seemed to be. This certainly wasn't the first time she had to retrieve an item for someone in need, but there always seemed to be a catch. Either some bandits would be waiting nearby, or perhaps the person requesting her help needed what she would bring back to them for nefarious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this really be so simple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out. The Adrestia pulled into the docks of Athens once more, and Kassandra returned to the market to meet with the old woman. She would have, if the woman was actually there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench was now empty, and after briefly looking around the market, Kassandra could find zero trace of her. She thought to ask the nearby traders by if they had seen her, and each claimed that they had never seen such a woman. It seemed that the woman was gone, and her reward, more importantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumped, Kassandra sighed and uttered a phrase that had become quite common to her. \"Malaka!\"</span></div></div>",

Did you get the drachmae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnabas looked at Kassandra with an expectant smile on his face as she stepped onto the ship again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I did not,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened? Did you try to haggle for more again?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra shot him a glare. \"No, Barnabas. I learned my lesson. The lady wasn't at the market. I tried asking around, and they all pretended like she was never there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strange. And what of the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra raised her right hand, revealing that the ring was currently on her ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about selling it. I even approached a merchant about it, but then I just stopped myself. I couldn't bring myself to give it away,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarnabas scratched his beard. \"I see. Well, if we're ever low on drachmae I might just pry that thing from your finger and sell it myself! So what shall we do next, Commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do what we always do. Travel from island to island, help out those in need, and if we're lucky, maybe we can earn some riches along the way,\" Kassandra smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot twenty-four hours later, Kassandra leaned over the side of the ship as she retched up the fruit she had eaten hours earlier for breakfast. She spat, cleaning out her mouth of the remnants of the bile and groaned as she stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she saw Barnabas and Herodotos standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you seasick, Kassandra? Try to look away from the water, I've heard that helps!\" Barnabas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, Barnabas! I have never been seasick in my life! I doubt that would start now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, you must be ill. Perhaps you should stay below deck until you are better so we don't catch it?\" Herodotos suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not happen. I must have eaten something that didn't settle with me. I'm fine. I'll be back to normal in no time,\" she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained in this state the next few days. Kassandra threw up often, and when she didn't she was incredibly nauseous. Barnabas constantly teased her while Herodotos kept his distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Kassandra awoke to find the ship approaching the small town of Opous in the Lokris region. Kassandra had an...interesting experience in Opous before, where she tried to help a man named Supideo. That did not go well, as she ended up killing his mother and sleeping with his father. It was an innocent mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra stepped off of the Adrestia and walked around town, her stomach still feeling a little queasy. She came across a man who looked like he had seen far better days. His hair was long, he had a wild beard, and his clothes were ripped and dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misthios?\" he asked weakly, wondering if she could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I need your help!\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra walked closer to him. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days ago, I was away visiting some family members in Mykonos. Before I left, I looked for people who were willing to watch over my house while I was gone. I paid, them of course! Anyways, a group of three people responded, and I hired them. At the time, I did think that they looked a little suspicious, but I was in too much of a hurry to think clearly. When I came back, my house was completely ransacked! They were taking everything! I tried to stop them, but they attacked me. I chased after them for a while, but I lost them. Last night, I saw smoke coming from the forest, in the direction that I chased them! That must be where they are! I'm a feeble old man, but you? You look strong! You have a sword and a bow! And a spear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" Kassandra smiled. \"What's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're bound to have some drachmae with them. You're free to keep all of that, and if you do bring back what was stolen from me, I'll give you a nice bonus!\" he said.</span></div></div>",

I'll be back,\" she promised, heading off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, she saw a camp that looked like it was made fairly recently. Three people, two men and a woman, were there. They didn't look like the people that you could trust to watch your house while you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man noticed Kassandra approaching. \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you can. There's a man in Opous claiming that three people stole from his house while he was away. Would you--oh look, there's three of you--know anything about that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in the group smirked at the other members, then looked at Kassandra. \"No. Can't say we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? That vase over there looks a little out of place, don't you think?\" the mercenary said, pointing to a vase resting on a box. There were other items that clearly belonged to the homeowner sprawled around the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three glanced at each other. Kassandra continued, her stomach lurching. Of course the nausea would return now. \"Let's not make this more difficult than it needs to be. Why don't you three come help me take all of this back to that poor man? I'm not in the mood to be fighting you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men stood up. \"Now, why would we do that? There's only one of you, and three of us. I think the odds are in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Who are you to come into our camp and make demands?\" the other man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't know who I am? My name is Kassandra. Some call me the Eagle Bearer. I stopped the Cult of Kosmos from taking over Greece. I've travelled to all over the Aegean Sea trying to do good. Does that sound familiar at all?\" Kassandra wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra nodded. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman charged at her, and Kassandra quickly fired an arrow, hitting her directly in the face. She collapsed to the ground quickly. Two down, one to go. They moved towards her and began to diverge. Kassandra pulled out her sword. She made quick work of them (she'd defeated a cyclops and minotaur before, after all), and stood triumphant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always...the dumb ones...that challenge me,\" she huffed, catching her breath as she collected everything that they had stolen from the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the village, Kassandra returned to the house, stolen items in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've returned! And with all of my things! What happened to the thieves?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't be a problem anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked Kassandra, and gave her some drachmae as a reward. She wanted to patrol the town further, but was stopped when she saw Barnabas approach her from the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kassandra! I think we should leave!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We received a message while you were away. From Hippokrates! It seems urgent. He's in Thebes and needs your help!\" Barnabas explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should leave immediately. If the doctor is sending a message, it's bound to be important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra returned to the Adrestia with Barnabas, and the ship set off for Thebes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Layla. I think that's enough for one session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla opened her eyes and found herself back in the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...how long was I in there for?\" Layla wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few hours, but still too long. We don't want you suffering from the Bleeding Effect any worse than you did back in Egypt,\" Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla sat up and rubbed her eyes. \"That's when I experienced Bayek and Aya's memories outside of the Animus, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Any more exposure and it won't end well for you. Your memories, your mind, they won't be your own anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, spooky. I'll be careful,\" Layla promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla's stomach groaned. She placed one hand on her flat middle and another over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Layla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a trash can!\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria quickly brought one up to Layla's mouth just in time. The doctor patted her on the back as she continued to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now. Probably will be in the long run,\" Layla said, trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you know what? We're gonna take a few days away from the Animus, alright? If you're feeling up to it then, we can continue exploring Kassandra's memories,\" the doctor offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla wiped her lips. \"If that'll make you happy. But I'm fine. I'll be back to normal in no time.\"</span></div></div>",

Observing my surroundings, I was on a bed, trapped in a large glass room, and I was able to see the outside of it.  \"Great, still in the test chamber,\"I said.  \"Yes, you are.  Did you really think that you'd be anywhere else?\"  That would be the operator of Aperture Science, GLaDOS.  Me?  I'm Chell, the only known living test rat still in Aperture.  Next thing I knew, I began to feel sick.  I ran to the lone toilet in my cell, as I liked to call it, and vomited.  \"Ugh...\"  \"Are you ready for some testing, I know I am!\",GLaDOS said excitedly.  \"Did you not just see me throw up?\"  \"Yes, but with all the recycled air down here, it's very common to get sick.\"  \"How would you know?\" I ask.  \"Trust me, you aren't the first person who's ever been sick here.  Don't worry, the tests are pretty light today, and there are only a few.\"  Obviously, that didn't bring me a good sense of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen GLaDOS said the tests were easy, she wasn't lying.  It seemed as easy as my first few tests at Aperture, which was a piece of cake compared to what I would do later on.  A few minutes later, I finished the tests, and began to make my way back to the chamber.  Walking past a mirror, I decided to check myself out. (What? A girl's gotta look at something, right?)  Pretty face? Check.  Nice boobs? Check.  Flat abs? Uh...  I seemed to have gained a slight belly, but it's nothing that I can't work off. GLaDOS spoke up,\"Why have you stopped walking?\"  Have I gained weight?\", I said.  \"Well, I didn't call you \"Fatty\" for no good reason.\"  \"Right...\"  The normally loose Aperture suit that I was wearing showed my puffed out belly proudly, only making me look and feel slightly bloated.  Maybe GLaDOS was right, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I decided that the best way to erase my belly would be to run, and I had a lot of room to do it.  I took off, attempting to sight-see, but when you're miles underground, that's kinda hard.  I discovered that my belly had made it harder to run, and after a few minutes, I was hunched over, panting for breath.  I put my hand on my belly, and noticed that it was oddly hard, like I had eaten a large meal, and it looked like it, too. I returned to my room, upset that my belly showed no initial improvements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that didn't go over well?\", GLaDOS asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\"I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got bigger since you left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, that's ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my belly, and was horrified to find out that GLaDOS was right.  It HAD grown, and I looked like a woman who was three months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me?!\", I desperately asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore GLaDOS could reply, my belly growled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wouldn't happen to have any food, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.  Need to fill that big belly of your's, Fatty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that big...\" I said sadly, my hands resting on the bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you say tomato, I say tomato.  You want food?  Here you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, a large shelf rose from under the floor, stocked with food, anything imaginable.  I'd rather not diverge into the details of what and how fast I ate, as I don't want to seem like a pig, but let's just say that it was a lot in a short amount of time.  After I had finished, my belly had grown again, and I seemed four months pregnant.  After my little feast, I decided that it would be best if I got some sleep.  Still in my uniform, I climbed into bed, and could see that my belly could be easily seen through my shirt, and it was getting tighter across it.  I fell asleep, feeling an odd squirming feeling in my belly as I did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a grocery store, we can get some food here, and we can rest in here for the night.\", said Nick.  \"I don't mind that at all.\", replied Coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the grocery store, but noticed that the door was locked.  \"Well, that's what we have guns for.\", Rochelle said.

A large crowd of zombies approached them quickly.  Their guns were little use, and they found themselves surrounded.  Coach pulled out a pipe bomb and threw it as far as he could, but Rochelle was bitten on the neck before he could actually throw it.  The zombies chased the beeping bomb, and were killed by it.  \"Ah, shit, I've been bitten!\" Rochelle yelled.  \"Great,\" Nick said,\"they'll have some disinfectant and bandages for that, let's hurry.\"  Nick rushed Rochelle into the grocery store, and Coach and Ellis were left by themselves.  \"You know, one time, my friend Keith got bitten by one of them zombies, and he told me that I should keep going, and not worry about him, because he was gonna catch up with me later.  I never did see him again...\", Ellis said.  Coach responded,\" I wonder why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nick put disinfectant on Rochelle's bite, and then put a bandage over it.  \"There we go, good as new...\", he said.  \"I guess, I feel kinda weird, though.\"  \"Well, just get some rest, and in the morning be ready to leave, alright?''

It seemed that Sly was gonna pull off another heist, and it was gonna be just as Carmelita was gonna take a long earned vacation, but all that went down the drain. This time the Sly's eye caught a amulet that was brought from Egypt, apparently it used by some princess as part of a special ritual or some junk. Bottom line was that it was priceless and Sly wanted it, which meant Carmelita had to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, here she was strolling trough the corridors, without a trace of Sly yet, giving a somewhat bored yawn the police vixen decided to visit the Egyptian display to see if the amulet was still in place.  Stepping into the room, Carmelita gasped seeing some of the guards knocked out, that meant that Sly was nearby and she maybe had a jump on him this time, so maybe she'll be able to head for her vacation early than expected. Preparing her shock pistol, Carmelita carefully made her way towards the center of the room, where the amulet was displayed on a statue of a female cat behind some glass. There, she spotted the thievish coon already carefully cutting the glass open, Carmelita decided to wait it out for when he had the amulet and then make her move, and for that retreated into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the treasure in his grasp, Sly flashed his usual playboy smile as he carefully used his cane to snatch it away and then with a fancy backflip landed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, not as challenging as I expected.\" He murmurred, tossing his treasure in his hand \"Then again, not the same when miss Fox isn't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask and thee shall receive~\" A sudden voice said, as Carmelita stepped out with her gun at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, miss fox! Such a un-invited entrance and here's me without flowers and candy for you~\" The coon gave a fake exclaim, followed by a theatrical bow. \"I do apologize for that~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph, don't worry Ringtail, taking you behind bars will do it for me~\" She murmurred, having him in her cross airs \"Now, be a good boy and don't do any tricks~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why miss fox, you offend me! I never do any tricks..buuut...Will THIS do?\" And with that Sly threw the amulet, as Carmelita managed to catch it in mid flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as that happened, the amulet suddenly began to glow, making the two stop and stare at it with confusion.</span></div></div>",

Twenty years ago, he and his brother Tommy experienced his daughter get killed, and had to live through the pain.  This occurred as a deadly fungus began to spread, transforming its victims into violent monsters.  There seemed to be no hope for a cure.  Except for one small glimmer of hope, with a rebellious group called the Fireflies.  They were determined that there was a cure, and they would find it.  Joel didn't believe any of that shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was working with Tess, a fellow smuggler, in order to survive as long as they could.  Tess was in her 30s, Joel in his 50s.  They were now stationed in Boston, doing whatever they could.  The two were forced to help smuggle a young teenage girl, Ellie, in turn receiving a weapons cache.  Ellie had to be taken to downtown Boston, where a Firefly group would be waiting.  This task was given by Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, Ellie was infected.  Normally, infection would take two days to run course, but she had been bitten weeks ago, and seemed no worse for wear.  For now, Joel and Tess were forced to believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the Capital building is just ahead.  The Fireflies should be waiting,\" said Joel, as they approached the gold-topped building.  \"They better be.\" replied Tess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, they approached the Capital building's entrance.  \"So this is it?  Once we open this door, you guys are gone?\" Ellie asked, grabbing her forearm, or the bitemark to be more specific.  \"Yep.  Sure was good doin' business with you, kid.  But it's time to move on.\" Joel replied, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fireflies were there, alright, but they lay in a puddle of blood.  \"Shit!  Military must have gotten to them first...\" said Joel.  \"Well, is there another Firefly camp anywhere nearby?\" asked Ellie.  \"I don't know...Tess?\"Joel replied, wondering if Tess had the answer.  \"Uh...Pittsburgh, I think...\"she said.  \"Shit, Pittsburgh?  That's too far.  We'll never--\" Joel trailed, before being cut off by Tess.  \"Wait!  What about Bill?  In Lincoln, I bet he has a car!\" she said.  \"You know, that's not a bad idea...\" said Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there were multiple voices coming from outside.  \"Someone's in there!  Come out now!\"  \"Who the fuck is that?\" asked Joel.  \"Soldiers, I think.  They're not going to let us out alive.  Joel, take Ellie to Lincoln, and go find Tommy.  He's in Wyoming.  I'll stick behind so you guys can escape.\" Tess said, her eyes watering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel couldn't believe what he was hearing.  \"Wait, what?  I'm not letting you get killed, Tess!  We've been through too much shit--\"  \"We don't have time to argue!  Take the girl and get out...\" she said.  \"Fine...I'll go.  Ellie, come on.\" Joel said.  \"We're just going to leave Tess to die?\"  Ellie asked.  \"Come on!\" he shouted.  Ellie obeyed, and walked to the back exit.  \"Goodbye, Tess.\" Joel said.  \"So long, Joel.  Good luck.\" Tess replied.  Joel went to the exit, but not before looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the room, they heard a loud crash, and a flurry of gunshots.  With difficulty, they moved on, heading to Lincoln.</span></div></div>",

Her belly grew up to where she looked 6 months in. When Daiyousei woke up she said, \"That was a weird dream I had. Hmm?\" Daiyousei saw her belly look much larger. She said, \"Did this really just happen overnight? I wake up and I look like this? Oh!\" Daiyousei felt a kick. She said, \"It's real alright. I'm pregnant. Hopefully Cirno realizes now she can't be as much of a tomboy.\" Daiyousei then heads to Cirno and Cirno is shocked to see her friend's new body.

Cirno then says, \"Alright I'll try to act more cautious but as you know old habits die hard. Eh?\" Cirno notices her stomach starting to swell to Daiyouseis size. Cirno realized she is now pregnant as well. Somehow hormones made Cirno realize she has to act more properly. Daiyousei chuckles a bit and says, \"It's alright, we are at a point in our lives where we learn how to mature properly. Say why don't we blow those we know away with our new bodies eh?\" Cirno agrees. They get to a humans shrine known as Hakurei. Reimu says, \"What do you wa-... Holy smokes!\" She is awestruck by the sight of two pregnant fairies in front of her. Reimu quickly comes to her senses. She asks the both of them Why this occurred. They explain this to her in detail. Reimu then says, \"Normally I wouldn't do this but seeing how the two of you are of that size I am unable to harm you since I can't hurt an innocent baby. Look it's a part of the rules of the shrine.\" Both of the fairies say, \"Normally we would take advantage of that but somehow our unborn child is feeding off of our magic meaning we are weakened until the baby is born.\" Reimu is surprised and says to them, \"Does that apply to everyone in Gensokyo? I mean that's a surprise to even me where if a child is growing in someone the mother can't attack as well since the child is feeding off their magic supply is true.\" Yukari then shows up saying, \"That is sadly the truth. The child will inherit a mother's magic as well as their fathers and the child will feed off the mother's magic until the child is born meaning the mother is weaker. I know of this because I went through this myself a few times. Each time I was at half strength due to the child.\" Reimu was shocked and passed out.</span></div></div>",

You think everything will be ok if he just let everyone happy after they leave the underground together but now... you feel empty like something was missing, at first you think it was because of asriel and flowey story, but after touch this subject with him he find out that he was ok with him now,  just then he noticed the look on your face and then he says.<br>\r\n\"You know you can always reset the world.\" flowey says.<br>\r\nYou suddenly flinched in your place but you said that everyone is happy now so he has no reason to reset again.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You don't have to lie Frisk! Since everyone started living in the surface some of them are empty just like you.\" flowey said in a strange concern.<br>\r\nYou couldn't deny it some of them maybe are ok but the others...well not ok.<br>\r\nFirst Toriel was now taking a career like a teacher, but she is single since she doesn't trust herself again to have another relationship with someone else, she started to act more depressed and she didn't leave the house if wasn't for go to work.<br>\r\nThen his friends Alphys and Undyne's relationship was having problems not because of the others, but because of Alphys lack of confidence, Undyne was the active in the relationship but Alphys has been acting too pasive for undyne dislike. They have to give themselves a time because Alphys couldn't give a kiss without feel embarassed with herself.<br>\r\nThe last ones were Catty, Bratty and Muffet, their stories are similar, the first two are giving up in their lifes since Mettaton rejects her confessions, so they decided to find someone else to be her boyfriend, but they had no succes and Muffet had problems since many humans have a fear for the spiders in the city they live so she had problems with relationships with others since they seem to avoid her. <br>\r\nSince this happened you couldn't help you could do something about that but no matter what did you do this seem something that cannot be changed in the present.<br>\r\n\"Well if thats the problem why don't you help them in the beginning when you met them.\"you suddenly look flowey with a surprised look, since he accepted who he was his attitudde changed to someone who can rely on in this last days.<br>\r\n\"Look I know he have our differences but we started to get along and you know I can't judge you if you decide to reset everything again, I did that many times a long time ago so why don't you give it a shot?\" Frisk was really considering do that, but first he has to do something before he return to Mt. Ebott.<br>\r\nSome hours later Frisk took a few moments before return to the beggining of his journey he had to inform to sans about his descicion so he will be aware about the reset without problem.<br>\r\nSo after a concentration he returns to the beginning where you wake up from the flower bed like and started his journey into the ruins, he remembered his agreement with flowey this time flowey will not interfere to attack him this time or spy him all the time, and he will not be seen until he destroy once again the barrier.<br>\r\nSo Frisk walked once again when suddenly.<br>\r\n\"Oh my what is this child doing here?\" a female voice said.<br>\r\nFrisk knew that it was Toriel who was going to guide him over the ruins.<br>\r\n\"Do not fear young one I am Toriel. I live in this ruins and I will guide you in you journey.\" Toriel says with a sincere smile<br>\r\nAfter a few rooms you started to talk with Toriel about topics, you started with her likes to the food, teaching, and her life, then you talked  about yourself about your likes, and personal stuff, she asked you how many years you had and you tell her you are 18 years wich wasn't false at all since it's the age you had before your reset, you are glad about the fact that the reset didn't make you look younger at least you look like if you had 16 years old.<br>\r\n\"Oh my you are a young man now?\" Toriel said a little surprised. \"Well at least I know you can take care about yourself\" she said a little relieved about this situation like if she knew you could make it without her.<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached the longest room, Toriel suddenly take your arm and squeezed hardly.\"Well the only thing you had to do is here is go through the room without my help forgive me..\" before she started to run you griped your hand over her arm and keep her with you.<br>\r\nYou said that it is ok as long as she stay with him, so you started to walk together until you reach the end.<br>\r\n\"Well I was expecting that of you but I kind of fell flustered by that.\" Toriel said while she cover her face with her tunic.<br>\r\n\"But we need to be apart for a while I need to do some things in my place for your arrival.\"Toriel says finally with some composture.<br>\r\nYou think this will be a great opportunity to spend some time with Toriel, so you say if was ok if you follow her because it was dangerous even for an adult to go alone in this place.\"Well if you don't mind I guess we can go together, follow me human.\" Toriel says.<br>\r\nYou said if she call him Frisk since she seems so nice and sweet.<br>\r\n\"Well..if you like that Frisk\" Toriel says feeling a little nervous but at the same time odd because she seems to remember to heard that name before.<br>\r\nYou started to walk, encounter monsters even tough Toriel scared most of them, collecting gold when suddenly you see the spider shop from before, so you decided to buy some things from this shop Toriel was afraid that they would hurt you but you remarking to them that you loved the spiders and they seem very nice.<br>\r\nToriel and you started to talk about your lifes before this, Toriel was trying to aboid that subject, but you assured her that you won't judge her. You knew about her life for other monsters but she never told this to you directly so you think it was best to talk about this.<br>\r\nAfter she finished to explain, you seemed to agree with her descicion about left the castle to protect the human who falls to this place, Toriel was relieved that you don't hate monsters espcially her after all of this.<br>\r\nYou finally reached the house, so Toriel gave you a tour for all the house after finally take you to your room she said, \"Well as you can see this room needs to be remodelated, so it's ok if you wait for me to finish the last things..\" you interrupt her and said that you would be glad to help her.<br>\r\nToriel appreciate your consideration but tells you that in the meantime you would sleep with her.<br>\r\nYou asked if she was ok with that. You don't want to be a problem.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I am ok to share with someone nice as you.\"Toriel says while smiling<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Toriel yawned and said \"I guess we should go to sleep is has been a long day\" you only nod and started to rest with Toriel, but you notice that she was nervous so you asked hwr whats wrong.<br>\r\n\"Well you see I use to sleep..without clothes. So I hope you don't feel uncomfortable.\"Toriel say while blushed in shame.<br>\r\nYou tell her that it was ok and she shouldn't feel shame because what he will think of her because is her house and is her way to live.<br>\r\nToriel felt better and started to undress herself until she was naked with her biggest breast and ass exposed and her slightly chubby figure.<br>\r\nYou tell her that she looked beautiful and you didn't understand why she was nervous about her figure.<br>\r\n\"Please don't say things like that I feel weird if you say things like that, we should sleep by now.\" Toriel says while trying to push herself in the bed with you and sleep.<br>\r\nYou decide to let the subject and tell her good night what she respond with a goodnight kiss.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes while you were sleeping Toriel was trying her best to understand what has been happening to her lately since she met yoy she started to feel nervous around you when you are kind, when you complemint her or even you just smile at her. It was like you knew from a long time but she think it was ridiculous because, she just met you today, so why she was feeling so happy around him so a thought cross over her mind thar make her shocked and happy at the same time, she thinks she is in love with him, after debating if was real or not this feeling, she decided to let the time take thar choice for her.<br>\r\nFinally she started to sleep but not without reaching with her arms the human she has living with to hug her close like if her life depend of that, if she was honest she started to like have someone to hug, so she sleep after seconds of hugging him.<br>\r\nIn her dreams Toriel was dreaming about her in a living a happy life with Frisk when she noticed thar she was wearing a ring in her hand while Frisk wear a same ring too.<br>\r\nSurprised by this she asked if something was wrong to Frisk.<br>\r\nHer question was responded with a kiss in her lips while Toriel moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\nShe suddenly broke the kiss when she felt Frisk rubbing her belly, to her surprise when Toriel looked she found her belly more bigger that was bigger and rounded than before, her questions were responded when she felt a kick from inside meaning that she was expecting a child. She couldn't help but smile while crying of happyness. She launche herself at him before wake up and realize it was all a dream, she was shocked about the fantasy he just had but she didn't complain she felt happy and decided to continue dreaming hoping to ecperience that again.<br>\r\nThe next morning you waked up finding yoursle wrapped around Toriel body with your head between your breast, you were surprised that she seemed to start to have a thing for you so soon, you know is the time to leave the ruins and when you asked her for leaving she will try to destroy the exit, so you decided to..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took to you a lot to decide what to do, but you concluded that it was best if you started to win Toriel's heart first before anyone else, if you were honest it was a wise desicion since Toriel was an old school person in the romance. You knew if you want to succeed first you need to make sure that Toriel sees you like a man instead of a child since she seems to have doubts of push herself to you because of your age difference, and make her feel more comfortable or at least willing to let you to make your moves on her. <br>\r\nSo you decided to begin with small things like helping her making the food, washing dishes, or even clean the house, when Toriel ask you why do you help her you always responded it was because it's what man do for a woman in need even if don't ask for it, Toriel took it as a compliment and for the first time in her life she felt loved enough for make all the work just for make her happy and relaxed.<br>\r\nFrom time to time you give her a massage when she was having problems relaxing since this was something she never expected, so you began to rub her feet, then her legs, she seemed to enjoyed to much when she didn't complain when you started to massage her neck and shoulders.<br>\r\nYou avoided the chest area and her lower parts on purpose just to tease her but it was just enough to make her want more.<br>\r\nYou continued with this for a few days, in that time Toriel behavior changed with the past of the days. <br>\r\nShe always asked for help when she was cooking, when you offer her a massage you manage to convice her to undress herself until she was on her underwear,  the only thing she never let you finish it was the room she was preparing for you because she always say she will handle thar, it didn't take you too much to deduce she didn't want you to finish the room because that mean that she will sleep alone again so you knew she was getting attached to you more faster than you expected.<br>\r\nFrom time to time when you spend time you talked about the life out there, you tell her about the inventions like the vehicles or communication media, since you knew that she didn't know anything about this because she only discovered this when Alphys teach her this when she finally leave the ruins.<br>\r\nShe seemed fascinated about the inventions of the humanity and wanted to try use one of that transports or use a cell phone. You only say that you were willing to teach her all the way if she wanted when the time comes which she agreed immediately.<br>\r\nWhen it passed a week since you met Toriel let her uncomfortable behaviour and became more assertive in her interactions, she always take your hand when you are with her helping in the kitchen or laying in the couch together, when you are in bed she started to hug you back crossing her legs with yours she even started to wake up much late just because she didn't want to stop cuddling with you.<br>\r\nAfter this you decided to take the initiative and confront Toriel about leaving the ruins instead of getting nervous she seemed horrified and scream.<br>\r\n\"No!\"Toriel says in worry.\"You can't leave here! If you go further in the underground my exhusband Asgore will kill you.\" Toriel started to hug you with the intention to stop you to go downstairs.<br>\r\n\" I lost every human who go further please don't go.\" Toriel said while you break free from her arms.<br>\r\nToriel sad look changed to a more determined look and started to run without more explanations until both of you reached the door.<br>\r\n\"I can't let you...No I will never let you go! You become important to me more than you imagined so..\"Toriel turn herself to you and with tears in her eyes says\"I will fight with you\".<br>\r\nYour heart started to glow and your sight has focused on Toriel, you know by this point that Toriel will never had the malice of kill you so instead of dodging her attacks you only walk to her slowly enduring the attacks of her while while she screamed at you to return to the house.<br>\r\nYou instead reached her and hug her with all your stenght until she stopped herself and kneel herself to let her fruststion go away.<br>\r\n\"Why you have to be a good soul?\" Toriel says between sobs, before you kissed her in the lips, it took you at least 4 minutes to Toriel to snapped herself and said \"Wha-but Why do you do that?\".<br>\r\nYou only tell her that was for not telling her feelings to you because you felt the sane for her.<br>\r\nToriel didn't need to say anything else to realize that you feel the same so she continued with the kiss for a few moments.<br>\r\nSuddenly Toriel take your hand a take you to the bedroom, she started to undress you and hersel until both of you were naked.<br>\r\n\"You know I wanted to do something with you since a few days but I always feared that you didn't feel the same because we are different species.\" Toriel say with a blush of shame, you only tell her that she shouldn't care for that as long as she love someone it didn't matter if they were different.<br>\r\nToriel only put her fingers over your lips and started to place herself over your member and without hestitation she bumped herself up and down for around an hour.<br>\r\n\"Frisk I think I'm reaching my limit.\" you tell her that you started to feel the same.\" Then let's do it together I want to do it inside, I want to have your babies.\" Toriel said with a pleasured face.<br>\r\nYou came inside of her while she just moaned in response before she came for the pleasure.<br>\r\nToriel couldn't resist longer and she let herself fell asleep over you with a happy expresion. You thanked that you were now taller enough to carry her and make her sleep properly in the bed.<br>\r\nYou see somethings seems odd on Toriel when a glow was emerging from her reveling her soul. You could see her soul shaking like trying to break but instead her soul turned in 180\u00b0 degree matching your soul and not just only that her soul turned from white pure to pink like trying to match yours. Finally Toriel started to mumble in her sleep before her soul glow one last time and returned inside of her.<br>\r\nThis leave you with many questions without an answer since you didn't know that the souls do that. You know who may got the answer to that or at least will be interested in this but that will have to wait for another time.<br>\r\n\"Frisk..\"Toriel mumbled trying to call for you. \"Come to bed dear, I need to sleep and you know I will refuse until you I am in your arms\" she says stretching her arms waiting for you to come.<br>\r\nYou shake your head to forget about the subject for now and started to cuddle with Toriel for the next day. Meanwhile inside of her a bunch of little creatures were trying to reach an egg it take hours of work but they reached the egg but to their surprise only one was enough determined to suceed not only that her soul started to make a few changes by its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you were the first one to awake and you were surprised to see Toriel try to get rid of his \"morning wood\" it didn't take her too much to finally swallow a hot liquid from it and started to tasted with pleasure.<br>\r\nWhen she drink the last drop she says\"Good moorning love, how are you feeling?\" Toriel says without a shame for whar she did a moments ago. <br>\r\nYou only responded  that you were fine but they have to have a talk about their relationship.<br>\r\n\"Why dear is something wrong?\" Toriel asked worried that she may have done something. You assured her that she is not the problem but you needed to talk anout his feelings since she already let clear her own.<br>\r\nAs you said you tell her about how you feel about her and you would be glad to be his lover but she have to follow some rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel was not sure about this but for a reason her heart tell him to say yes to anything he will ask for so she only nod inmeadiatly in reaponse.<br>\r\nYou tell her she have to let him go to meet the king to convice him to destroy the barrier without killing him or iniciate a war once again in the surface.<br>\r\nToriel was scared about this but accepted in exchange that you promise that you will return safetly with her.<br>\r\nThen your other condition was to let you make this relationship open.<br>\r\nToriel was expecting this if she was honest in the mean time when you were with her you told her histories about people that shared their relationships when these people fell in love with the same person or when they felt the same equally for each other.<br>\r\n Toriel was surprised about that, she never knew that kind of relationships was allowed, at first she wasn't sure that kind of relationships but when you told her that it have to be their descicion and don't force anyone to do it was ok as long everyone is happy. As more she listened this the more Toriel wanted to know. She even started to have dreams about her and you with other girls even if just was recently but she didn't regret that thoughts.<br>\r\nToriel just sigh in defeat since she could deny she was curious about the idea.<br>\r\nHer condition in this matter was that she needed to agree with person will be in this relationship Toriel didn't want anyone enter in this if she didn't like and she want any other male except him in this. In her definition she was the only man she wanted.<br>\r\nYou agreed but Toriel changed the subject to tell you something important at this point you knew she was going to tell.<br>\r\n\"So when do we go?\" Toriel asked almost entusiastic,  since Toriel wanted to be by your side it was out the question that she will follow you to the end of this place.<br>\r\nSo the first thing you do was prepare yourselves for the journey, Toriel decided she will take the only backpack and take the kit of Medicine, clothes and other things just to let you hand the other things.<br>\r\nYou recommend her to use a disguise in case someone remember her as the old queen of the ruins, so she decided to use a towel of the bathroom as an turbant to not let people see her face.<br>\r\nAlso Toriel confessed to you that she also thinks she is pregnant, she may have no clues but she had the feeling that she is. You only assured her that you will be with her until the end no matter what.<br>\r\nAfter a lot of you opened the ruins entrance and...</span></div></div>",

Toriel was worried if he was going to capture you when she heard him say he was searching for humans with her brother, she was glad when he said he didn't want to do it because he was tired. Then suddenly she recognizes as the voice she heard always behind her door, it didn't take to long before they became friends in less than a minute but their chat was interrupted when suddenly Sans told him that his brother was coming in their direction, he told them to hide behind in the convenient lamp from there in his case and Toriel behind the station.<br>\r\nToriel was worried at first because of what he will do to frisk but her worried was vanished with a smile when Toriel saw their interaction with Sans making bad puns about the situation and Papyrus getting angry at him then composed himself to tell him about his dream to be a royal guard. It was all she needed to know that they were at least innofensive.<br>\r\nAfter Papyrus left Sans told you if you can play along with him to make his little brother happy to see finally a human.<br>\r\nYou inmeadiatly agree, which Toriel wanted to deny but Sans was already leaving with no further explanation. In your way with Toriel you confronted other monsters she was glad that you were a pacifist who resolved the problems without violences she even had more time to understand how were the things changed after she ran away.<br>\r\nThe first thing is many of the royal guards are at least dogs in snowdin for what Sans told him. Second Papyrus is like a innofensive kid who just want to have a friend it didn't take much in a few encounters she already had the idea of what kind of monster was him. To be hones it was funny to you to let Papyrus do his thing because it always let him make a good impression on Toriel who was willing to see him trying to be cool even if that make him look silly. Even when he was trying to capture you Toriel and you couldn't help but let a laugh when he do something wrong or his innocence and luck make him fail in the process.<br>\r\nFinally apparently anyone recognize her since any in the royal guard seemed to recognize his vestment and Sans told them that the only thing strange in her was the towel on her head, so both of you decided it was safe to reveal your face since any of them recognize her.<br>\r\n You also discovered something else when a monster attack you not only you have more hp without raisimg your exp. or Love but Toriel recieved also part of the damage even when she was far away from the attack. You guessed it was for the transformation of her soul with yours in someway or another this make them connected to each other more than you could imagine, when they encountered a monster Toriel go in a deep trance where she seems focused in following orders of you only.<br>\r\nWhen you are defending yourself she kept a closer distance to you to make sure you won't get so much damage or when you have only 1 hp Toriel grab you to run away from there and treat properly your injuries even if you always told her to that you needed some monster food to recover.<br>\r\nWhen is your turn she make the monsters keep her distance over you she even glare at them when they are attacking you.<br>\r\nFinally you notice Toriel always make sure she is by your side when yoy are walking for the path. She always took your hand just for squeeze it or put it in her belly to let you feel the life inside of her.<br>\r\nWhen you reached snowdin you explored the town Toriel know about there was a Festivity similar to the Christmas you reffered before.<br>\r\nIn the mean time Toriel suggested to buy matching clothes for the ocassion, she take you to the shop and bought many different clothes for what she remembered there were other zones with different weather.<br>\r\nSo she buy a winter clothes for here in snowdin she brought herself a blue sweater and a pair of yellow winter gloves and for you another blu sweater with a yellow scarf to match with her when you asked her abouth the other clothes she tell you it was a surprise so you shrugged and let it be.<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the end of snowdin you finally encountered Papyrus at the end you tell Toriel to stay back in case this end bad she did not complain since she knew Papyrus would never kill you and you neither will give up so she kept her distance and waited.<br>\r\nWhen you finished their \"fight\" it ended with a date with him, Toriel seemed proud of you for making friends so easily with anyone who gets in your way.<br>\r\nSo without hestitation you proceed to attend the date with him meanwhile Toriel spent time with Sans since she wanted to know more about him. During her time she let Sans know about their relationship and that she was expecting. Sans seemed fine but he assured her that if she needed help or if she felt ill don't hestitate in call for a hand of his. Toriel couldn't help but laugh until she was lack of oxygen.<br>\r\nShe even laughed more when you enter to the house and Papyrus showed to you his things until he started to chase a dog who stole a bone from Papyrus and when he failed Sans make accidental music with a trombone that he took out of nowhere.<br>\r\nIt was so funny than everyone but Papyrus laughed because of it.<br>\r\nAfter the date ended with you and Papyrus have a platonic relationship and Sans and Toriel keep themselves in contact with the phone that Toriel take with her from the ruins to be in touch even Papyrus told her his number to call you every he wants.<br>\r\nPapyrus say that he needed to see some friend of his but he tell you to not worry about mentioning you to his friend because he will only tell good things to you.<br>\r\nToriel wanted to stop him to tell anyone about you but it was too late, he just run away.<br>\r\nSans only assured to Toriel and you to not worry because Papyrus would never want his friends be hurt because of him.<br>\r\nAfter giving your goodbyes to him you started to run to the next area.<br>\r\nAfter this you now find yourselve and Toriel encountering Sans once again in a station relaxing, but at his side one monster kid was looking excited, you remembered as the kid from snowdin who was always talking about Undyne all the time until he changed his fascination to Papyrus.<br>\r\nWhen you and Toriel approached him the kid tell you that he was excited to see his hero Undyne hunting a human here in waterfall. Toriel knew it was matter of time before someone notices the presence of her lover in the underground but she at least expected that this Undyne was as the same as Papyrus when they confront him or her since she didn't knew the gender of this monster.<br>\r\nYou only wish him good luck knowing that you will see him again. You advanced until you were on a zone with tall grass but Toriel and you are taller enough to be more taller than the grass.<br>\r\nSuddenly Toriel put you on the ground and silence you and signal to the top of you a silouette of a Knight and Papyrus chatting over the top.<br>\r\nFor the tone of Papyrus he looked worried about the reaction of the other who was speaking.<br>\r\nFor what both of you could hear he seems to talk about you and how friendly he was but the other one seemed indiferent to his speech and just only turn to his sight to see him. Apperently he failed in convice this person to stop the search for you and your soul.<br>\r\nWith his defeat Papyrus returned to snowdin apparently. Toriel just hug you in reaction and stopped yoy from moving until it was safe to move again. It took literally minutes to wait for the royal guard to leave until it left. When both of you leave the security of the tall grass just to find out that the same kid was with you observing Undyne all this time, even if you know the answer you ask him if he was with them all this time.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It was awesome it my first time seen her in action so..man I don't know you and your girlfriend but I will run to catch her before I lost her, so se ya later!\" That was all he said before started to run away..after he slipped and fall over his head to the ground and get up again.<br>\r\nYou and Toriel blushed for the comment then you see at each other while smiling.<br>\r\nThe Toriel stopped her tracks to talk to you \"Frisk I think this Undyne is very dangerous, I know you would never give up until you reach the end but don't you think we could avoid her for the moment.\" If Toriel heard the kid well he refered Undyne as a she so it's sure that it was a female creature who was chasing her dear.<br>\r\nYou were thinking how you would confront this because if you know Undyne by now is she is very stubborn in her goals so maybe go through the same routine will end with same result from the beginning, so what now?.....You can't even have time before you looked a fainted Toriel laying on the ground.<br>\r\nIt didn't take you too much to know that she was overworking herself all this time.<br>\r\nWhen Toriel in this condition you can go further until she gets better but then you remembered that you still had the phone on Toriel possesion you could call san for help but you can't waste time so you will have to go alone in this or you could take care of her until she was better to continue but you could waste a lot of time without a progress with Undyne.<br>\r\nAfter thinking too much you....</span></div></div>",
