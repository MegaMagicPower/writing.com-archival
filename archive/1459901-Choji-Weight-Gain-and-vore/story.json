He heard a ripping noise and looked down to his pajama bottoms to see that they had ripped at the sides.  Chouji grinned and poked his belly, \"Guess i've put on some weight?\" and weight was indeed what he had put on.  Over the last few weeks Chouji had been eating more and training less, the results being that he had gained quite some pudge to his already doughy body.  Chouji pulled himself from bed his bed and walked to his bathroom, which was only a short distance from his bed.  As the teenage ninja walked, his new weight caused him to waddle left and right, but only slightly.  Once in the bathroom, Chouji stepped onto the wornout scale and watched as the needle landed at two-nintey-eight.  The overweight ninja blinked before an extremly happy smile spread across his face, \"Two-nintey-eight?  I've almost hit three hundred pounds!!\" he yelled in joy as he shook his belly, which showed off why he was so big.  His stomach was huge, as was the rest of his body.  Chouji hurried out of his room as quickly as possible and got dressed in his usual clothes before hurring down stairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis morning meal was already on the table, courtesy of his dad, who had already left for a mission.  Breakfast didn't last long.  Chouji leaned back in his chair and rubbed his belly which was skin tight against his huge shirt, \"Aaaaaah... that was amazing.  I can't belive I ate that much?  I can't belive dad cooked that much?!  I should go and see if i'm any heavier.  That, or I could lounge around all day and just pig out and check before I go to bed?\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, what's the point in burning all those calories?\"  He reached over to the fridge and started pullling out food by the handfuls, stuffng his face as quickly as he could grab the food, his large belly filling slowly as he ate.  A few hours passed before he was finally out of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I can't believe I finished off the whole fridge,\" he exclaimed, rubbing at his now bare belly, as his shirt was too tight to fit right now.  \"Should I risk getting up and weighing in, or should I see if I can't finish off some more food... hmm...,\" he pondered...</span></div></div>",

He would have used his father's scale, but his bedroom was locked with a sealing jutsu, which always made Chouji want to know what was behind the door.  The chubby ninja finally reached his bathroom and sigh, tired from using so much energy, \"I knew I should have just sat in the kitchen and ate.  Now...\"  Chouji stepped onto the scale and stroked his stomach, \"Let's see how much weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja sucked in his stomach slightly so that he could see the numbers and looked down.  The arrow had stopped at three-fifteen.  Chouji could feel his smile spreading across his face, \"No way!!  I gained seventeen pounds in two hours!!\"  Chouji jumped off of the scale, his fat jiggling around as he danced a happy dance.  He then stopped and thought aloud, \"If I gained that much in two hours... I wonder how much I could gain in four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji hurried out of his bathroom and into the kitchen to eat what he could.</span></div></div>",

He had recently gained alot of weight and weighed in at four-hundred-and-eighty-nine pounds.  The ninja burped and licked his fingers clean of food before he noticed something on the table, it was a single chocolate chip cookie he had missed.  Shocked and dissapointed at himself for missing the sweet, gooey treat, Chouji snatched it up and shoved it in his mouth, chewing it slowly, enjoying the taste.  Sadly, it seemed to dissapoint him, and he didn't know why?  Food had never dissapointed him before in his life!  The ninja sighed and slapped his fat, bloated stomach, \"Damn it, why is food boring me?!  I'm an Akamichi for goodness sake!!  Food is the most important thing in my life!!\"  It wasn't until then that he noticed the woman working there.  He scanned over her body, long black hair pulled back into a ponytail, a perfect figure eight body with averege sized breasts and and amazing ass.  Chouji's mouth began to water as he looked at how smooth and creamy her skin looked, \"Damn... she looks good enough to eat.  Eat... that's it!!  That's why i'm bored with food!!  I'm not hungry for food, i'm hungry for people!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji then remembered as old family jutsu that was only to be used in emergencies.  It focused chakra into your jaw bones, allowing you to unhindge your jaw and devour people and animals whole.  It was used during the time of the second hokage when Konoha had undergone a serious famine, causing his family to resort to eating pets, livestock, and enemy ninja for food.  Chouji quickly performed the handsigns and felt his chakra surge to his jaws.  He grinned, but then he thought of something, \"I could eat her first as practice, or I could go after a funner prey, one of my fellow ninjas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji decided on...</span></div></div>",

He rapped on Kiba's door to be greeted by his mom, who informed him that Kiba was out training in the forrest.  Choji looked irritated, but none the less, he headed off into the forrest, taking a while before he spotted Kiba- not training, but stuffing his face as Choji himself would have liked to have been doing.  He eyed him carefully, guessing his weigh to be about 400 pounds,a  plenty large meal for the hungry ninja. He licked his lips as he approached...</span></div></div>",

Chouji could feel his ancestrial predatory skills begin to awaken as he crept up on Kiba, licking his lips eagerly.  His mouth began to water as he was finally within grabbing distance of his prey.<br>\r\nKiba leaned back into the log as he rubbed his full stomach happily.  He burped before slapping his enlarged midsection, \"Holy shit, I don't think i've ever been this full.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?  Because i'm starving.\"<br>\r\nKiba jumped as he heared Chouji's voice, followed by a pair of hands on his shoulders.  The dog heard his friends jaw pop out of place, thanks to his jutsu, and felt a warm heat rush over his head.  Chouji snickered in his head and he closed his jaw around Kiba's head and shouleders, enjoying the way he saw Kiba squrim to get out way to much.  The predatory ninja opened his jaw slightly and lowered it around Kiba's chest, feeling the also overweight ninja's soft boy breasts in his mouth.  Chouji moaned happily as he continued to devour his prey.  He began to have some trouble once he reached Kiba's large stomach, but he made quick work of getting it into his mouth.  Chouji stopped once he had the dog's butt fully in his mouth and began to move his tounge back and forth across Kiba's ass, enjoying how it tasted before continuing with his meal.<br>\r\nKiba kicked his legs frantically in a futile effort to escape.  Chouji placed his hands on Kiba's thighs and kept his legs steady as he pushed the dog farther into him.  With one final gulp, Chouji had completly eaten his prey.  Chouji stroked his stomach, which was twice the size it was before, as he dropped himself onto the ground where Kiba had once been sitting.  The fat ninja watched as his meal squirmed inside of him, \"Thanks for the meal Kiba.  Your the first of many.\"<br>\r\nChouji placed his arms behind him and rested his head against the log, wanting to take a nap before going after his next meal when he heard something come out of the bushes.  It was a very fat Akamaru.  The small white dog looked like he weight at about two hundred pounds.  Chouji grinned as his mouth began to water again, \"Well I always wanted to eat Akamaru.\"  Chouji placed his hand on the ground and whistled, \"Here boy.  Come on Akamaru, it's me.  Chouji.  Don't you wanna join your master?\"<br>\r\nAkamaru waddled over to Chouji and sniffed at his hand, making sure it was Chouji.  The predator grabbed the puppy by the fur on the back of his neck, and without a second thought, scarffed down the little morsel in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\nChouji grinned as he rubbed his stomach again, enjoying the feeling of the two dogs in him before passing out in pure bloated ecstasy.</span></div></div>",

The two boys had gained quite some weight(two-hundred pounds each) while the female of the group hadn't put on a single pound.  She was scolding them for their weight gain.

I have to get chakra from him... in other words, I need to use him like a battery first, touching him should be good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then asked, \"how do we know you won't get enough chakra to eat us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"because I can only get so much, not only is this body small, but I can't pull anymore essence through, and it can't hold much chakra at the moment... maybe when I get it fatter, the larger body would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how do we know you aren't lying!\" Kiba accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know how to lie yet...

I may not have any chakra, but the part of my ninjutsu I cast can be controlled if I alter it slightly.\" kyuubi nodded. touching the large ninja's belly with his tiny little paw, he asked, \"now tell me what you want to be, the effect will happen soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm...\" choji thought \"I'll be...\"</span></div></div>",

As the front gates to the village opened, Akimichi Chouza, the father of the gluttonous hero of this story, waddled in.  He stood tall and proud, one hand on his full stomach, which expanded far in front if him.  His clothes seemed to fit him perfectly, despite weighing almost eight-hundred pounds, thanks to an Akimichi family jutsu.  As Chouza walked in, the first thing that he noticed were Kotetsu Hagane and Izumo Kamizuki, the two Chunin who watched over the gates.  The two were leaning back and had their vests off, shirts pulled up to reveal their bellies.  Chouza wasn't sure what they were saying, but he guess that the two were debating over who was bigger, which was Kotetsu.  He smiled and continued on his way into the village as the rest of his team went to the Hokage to report on their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chouza waddled through the gaining village, he noticed two other Jonin through an open window of a buffet that had just recently been built; Asuma and Kakashi.  Asuma had one hand hanging out the window, a lit cigarette between his index and middle finger, smoke floating into the air from it's tip.  His other hand was busy forcing food into his mouth.  Kakashi sat opposite of him, re-reading the first volume of Icha Icha Paradise.  He wasn't eating.  Asuma dropped the bone of an extremely large chicken leg onto a pile and placed the cigarette to his lips.  He took a deep breath and exhaled, smoke flying everywhere, \"I don't get it Kakashi.  Your the one who invited me to lunch, and your not even gonna eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that hungry.\" Kakashi said, turning the page in his book before placing his hand on his fat stomach, which had grown very round in the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma rolled his eyes and finished the rest of his cigarette before butting it out in the ash tray on the window sill and using both hands to eat.  Kakashi looked up at Asuma and the savage way he ate.  He chuckled and went back to his book.  Kakashi decided that he'd wait until he got home to stuff himself, a habit he'd gotten into as of recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza waddled over to the open window and smiled, \"It's seems the two of you are getting quite big.\" he said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma looked up and grinned.  He sat back in the large seat and slapped his even larger gut, \"Oh yeah.  This babies gonna get huge!\"  Asuma was wearing the standard Jonin uniform, with his sash hanging from his large waist, the only difference was the size.  It was extremely small.  The vest didn't fit at all and his shirt was raised high up, revealing his tan, hairy stomach.  The part of the shirt that covered his massive breasts was exteremly tight and looked like it was going to rip, \"This is the last outfit I own that halfway fits me.  The rest of I ended up tearing cause I they were to small.\"  Asuma stroked his stomach and laughed, \"Pretty soon, the same'll happen to these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could always use the clothing expansion jutsu for you.\" Chouza offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. Asuma said, \"I've already bought two more outfits that fit, and I plan on ripping those two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza nodded and looked at Kakashi, \"So how much do the two of you weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"342 pounds.\" Kakashi said, not turning from his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"793 pounds!\" Asuma said, proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza was impressed by Asuma's weight, he was only five pounds behind him, but was dissapointed by Kakashi, \"Tell you what, guys.  Stop by my house in an hour and the three of us will stuff ourselves silly.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!!  I'd never turn down an offer for food!\" Asuma said excited, while Kakashi merely shrugged.  Chouza smiled and bid the two farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short walk, or rather waddle, from the buffet to his house.  Chouza walked inside and went straight to his room to change from his armor to more comfortable clothing.  When he opened the door, he saw his son, along with Naruto, Kiba, and a small orange fox.  Naruto\u2019s ears had been replaced with fox ears, and there was a fox tail sticking out of his lower back.  Kiba had the same, but they were black and resembled pointy dog ears, with a matching tail and his son had pig ears, tiny tusks pointing up from his lower jaw, and a pig tail that he couldn\u2019t see at the moment.  The small, fat fox was laying on top of Chouji\u2019s stomach, sleeping.  All three of them were incredibly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza noticed that his locker doors were open and a tiny amount of food was missing.  He wasn\u2019t angry, just... shocked!!  Before he could do anything, one of the boys woke up.  It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Choji suddenly noticed his father standing in the doorway with a shocked look on his face. Choji was surprised as well, his father was not due back for a few more days, even weeks! the young ninja's face blushed with embarrassment as he knew he had been caught in his father's room, eating his private stock. he didn't think his dad would be too angry, but he still wasn't supposed to be in here. his piggy ears lowered lightly and he chuckled nervously. he was at a loss of words at the moment.</span></div></div>",

Naruto had woken up, but after greeting kakashi and admiring his other teacher on the wolf-man's new size, he decided to rest some more to allow the lard to accumulate a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi eventually got up and helped Akamaru gorge again by sitting in between the food pile and the puppy and rolling extra food to the rounding puppy. the fat fox found he rather liked helping the others add to their waist lines and felt the urge to snuggle up to a belly but put it off until he and the young dog behind him were fully fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon enough...</span></div></div>",

Choji, still drowsy from his bull-filled power nap, opened his eyes and watched with everyone else as the smoke cleared and Naruto has been revived, but something was different.  Naruto had lost ALL of the weight he had gained since he agreed to help Choji!!  He now weighed a puny 340 pounds!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAPPENED?!\"  Choji shouted, upset to see that his best clone machine had become so skinny.  Chouza turned to his son and smiled, \"Son, no need to worry.  This is how the jutsu works!  The one who is being revived returns to a 'default weight', but would quickly gain it all back in a matter of seconds.  Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody watched in amazement as Naruto's tiny frame began to expand like crazy!!  In mere seconds, Naruto returned to his weight before he had been eaten by Asuma, 512 pounds.  Choji licked his lips hungrily, the sight of Naruto's body growing as quickly as it did made Choji extremely hungry now.  As Naruto stepped out of the circle and continued to examine his now re-fattened form, the circle began to glow again, \"Whats happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuma is being revived, the same way that Naruto was.  He'll also be going through the rapid gaining process like Naruto did.\" Chouza explained to his son.  Choji licked his lips once again, excited to see his sensei gain all that fat back.  Choji then began to daydream about eating Asuma again when felt a small bit of pressure on his stomach.  He looked down to see the tiny, fat Kyuubi on his stomach, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if you would be interested in finding out your current weight?  One of my abilities is to be able to see everyone's weight!\"  This idea excited Choji, and he immediately said yes. The Kyuubi hopped off of Choji's gigantic stomach and pressed it's two paws into his bellybutton and closed his eyes.  The paws glowed with Chakra, \"You weight 1,985 pounds, Master!!\"  Choji grinned widely and jiggled his stomach happily.  The Kyuubi waddled over to everybody else and did the same, calling out their weights as it went.  Akamaru weighed the least, being a puppy, and was only 178 pounds.  Naruto weighed 512 pounds, Kiba weighed 898 pounds, Kakashi was fairly small, weighing only 610 pounds, but Chouza was easily the second biggest next to his son, weighing a huge 1,858 pounds!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the weigh-in, everybody went right back to eating from he massive, never-ending pile of food in the room.

Inoichi informed me of your coming. It comes to my attention you need men from our village for assistance, as men from yours are rapidly expanding fro \"The Change\".

I can't wait to see how Choji looks if he's bigger than you!\" pausing to relish in the feeling of fullness, he added, \"I always did think that his body frame looked best out of all of our peers. now we all are getting blubbery together!\"</span></div></div>",
