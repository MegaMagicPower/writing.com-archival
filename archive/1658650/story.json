            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 3 days since Zuko returned to the fire nation, greeted by his family and subjects as a hero, not only for the assistance in the taking of the Earth Kingdom capital but he was credited, by his sister, with the death of the Avatar. Over the years searching Zuko had made no friends, exiled at 14 years old for refusing to fight his father, a firebending master; The thought still made him cringe, he may have what he wanted, or what he thought he wanted, but it had come at a cost of everything. He had doomed the world of the only chance of peace by assisting the in the defeat in the Earth Kingdom, the only power that could challenge the Fire Nation head on, and the Avatar was dead, Katarra had offered to heal him, heal his scar but worse that all that, he had betrayed his uncle, the only one who loved him, the one who cared for him, who looked after him when no one else would, now he was in jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling on a ship had denied him the decent food supplies he enjoyed as a child, there was always little to eat but in pursuit of the avatar he couldn't afford to be out of shape. Although Zuko was only 16 had well defined abs despite his very thin frame, he sat cross legged in his private chambers in a mediative stance, cross legged with only his red silk underwear on. Before the battle that changed everything Zuko hadn't been trailing the Avatar, well for at least 2 months; His uncle had done very well and was given the opportunity to open a Tea Shop in the high class end of Ba Sing Se, and the money earn't had been good. Zuko spend his time with the ability to, after so many years going hungry, to eat when he pleased, and the fire nation myths on what some of the culture on the other side of the wall hadn't been far wrong. High Class food was delicious, but fattening, with out the regular fighting and moving Zuko had began to fill out, going from being below 9 stone at about 123lbs to above, his stomach though didn't look any worse for it though, he still had his defined abs and was still very thin but this had aloud him to fill out a bit with out any of the flab visible on his hard flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko had his own private wing that during the night lay empty, devoid of life. No one was about 'I am starving' Zuko thought to him self clutching his hard stomach, he would be able to go down a level to the pantry and collect the some of the food that was stored there for meals during the day, and of course in case the good prince had the munchies in the middle of the night. This had been the first night, he had met with his father yesterday lunch time and due to nerves he wasn't eating properly. But that was done now, he crept out of his room and swiftly broke into a fast jog almost falling into a cartwheel as he went down a level, as he got there he looked left and right 'I don't know who I was expecting to see' he thought to himself, remembering he could be as loud as he wanted and no body would hear, so he just flung the door open he saw a large 20 square meter room filled with cakes, bread, butter, stakes, crisps, cheeses, chocolate and more, in the corner he spied a trolley, he quickly loaded up a couple of cakes, some bread and cheese, and took one of the boxes of stakes and just pushed it toward the stair case he came up, the trolly wasn't heavy so he lifted it and pushed it the rest of the way and uploaded the contents of the trolley onto his bed and sat down with them. \"Ah\" he said outloud suddenly, he continued to scoff him self, the prince had forgotten what being a prince was like, he looked toward a full cake, creamed filed with chocolate flavored and iced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always wanted to do this\" he said to him self quietly before just shuving the cake in his face and chomping it up. After about half an hour of eating he was feeling very full, his belly was extremely bloated but he was determined to finish what he had got out before sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week later Zuko was still struggling to settle back into what he thought or hoped was normality. The first couple of days back he barely because of nerves before meeting with his father, and since then he hasn't spoken to him or seen him. Deep down he had always known that going back home would entail loneliness, at least early on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the third night back Zuko had started enjoying the high-life again of Fire Nation royalty, he was waited on hand and foot, he could have anything he wanted and he had inadvertently been eating too much; Before going to sleep he would take plenty of snacks with him, during the day the cook would cook him plenty of fattening food, and it was all just so good Zuko found it hard to resist. It was starting to take a toll on his body how ever, not that it couldn't easily be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the suddenness was his body just wasn't use to the food he was eating or the quantity,had spent the years prior doing various workout sessions daily on top of that he was always on the move with food rationed between him, his uncle and several crew members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get you, highness\" a young servant boy, Lee, knelt before Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a slice of the chocolate cake please Lee, and you dont have to call me 'highness'!\", friendliness was something Zuko had troubles with, he looked at the young servant boy walk away, he stood a couple of inches shorter than Zuko and was only a couple of months younger, Zuko had come to treat Lee as a freind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes high.. I mean Zuko\" the thin boy left and returned five minuets later with an entire cake, putting it down on a table besides Zuko. The balcony Zuko sat at overlooked much of the capital city, although doubtful people could see Zuko from bellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko rose from his seat and grabbed a knife from beside him, \"Sit down Lee\" Zuko patted the seat beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Zuko\" He sat down next to Zuko and just looked nervously, it was rare for royalty would fraternise with the servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever eat, lee, your looking so thin\" it was true, Lee had hardly any muscle mass and was very thin, much like the avatar, although this was not due to being a servant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... I know, and I do... sometimes, no regally, I mean the average amount a human being eats\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down\" Zuko chuckled back \"Here.\" Zuko sliced the large cake in two and handed half to jet before taring a part of and started eating him self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Zuko\" the two sat there and just looked up at the warm blue sky, Zuko quickly finished his half but Lee was still eating, \"All this extra food your eating seems changing your stomach\" lee chuckled, looking at Zuko who was shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oye\" Zuko chuckled back, \"Nah, I don't look any different, do I?, no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine Zuko\" Lee giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late, Lee had gone hours ago and Zuko was preparing to go to bed. He had been thinking about what Lee said, in jest, earlyer. He walked into the bathroom and stripped down to his underwear and looked in the mirror. Lee was right, Zuko's well defined abs were still there, although slightly faded, but he had also accumulated a small layer of flab over the lower and mid section of his stomach, he stood on the scales '131' they revealed. 'I'm up 5 pounds' he thought to him self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steeped closer to the mirror and bent over slightly and a small layer of flab overhanged his boxers, slightly, and was clearly visible. Zuko was surprised but not totally shocked, he was also in a way pleased, he hated being thin and he liked having this small layer of flab on his belly. He returned to his bed chamber to give it some thought, he perched on the end of his bed making the flab visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On, sorry highness\" lee took a step back as he entered the room seeing Zuko almost naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry Lee, come here a second\" Lee did as he was asked and stood next to Zuko, \"how much do you weigh?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err. about 8 and a half stone, I think\" Lee answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down a second\" Lee sat down a couple of inches from Zuko. \"Do you mind\" Zuko asked lifting Lee's shirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not at all\" Lee answered truthfully, Zuko patted lee's stomach, it, although little defined abs, had remined him of what he use to be like, very slender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see\" Zuko let go of Lee's shirt, \"I have, put on weight\" zuko said slowly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Zuko, your fine, you look good\" Zuko took Lees hand and pulled it to his lower stomach and rubbed it up and down for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Im sorry highness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"err. ZUKO, and dont be sorry, i'm not bothered. What do you think. What did it feel like to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you still have your abs, but as you said your mid section has gotten a little flabby\" Zuko lent forward slightly and Lee felt confdent enough to jiggle Zuko's small flab layer for a couple of seconds. \"I think you look good, highness. Parden me for saying but I think the flab makes you look more Sexy! What are you planning to do?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm glad you like it, I'll need all the encouragement I can get, if I'm going to keep gaining. How would you like to share my room with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Really Zuko? You would share your quarters with me?\" Lee could hardly hide his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lee had been crushing on Zuko ever since he returned to the fire nation. He already thought Zuko was hot before, but now that he's put on weight, \"Wow\" Lee thought, \"Zuko is so incredibly sexy.\" Lee was thrilled at the idea of sharing a room with Zuko, and more importantly that he wants to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee? Are you okay?\" Zuko asked Lee as he stared at Zuko.<br>\r\n\"What? Oh yea, I'm fine. Sure! I'd love to share your quarters with you...but ummm, Zuko? Where would I sleep?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, hmmm. I hadn't really thought of that. I guess, if you don't mind..\" Zuko starts to blush. \"...You could share...the..bed...with...me?\"<br>\r\nAt this Lee almost died. \"I don't mind, not at all!! I'd love to share the bed with you!\" Lee then thought about what he had just said.<br>\r\nThis confirmed Zuko's suspicions. He thought Lee was gay, now he knew. He didn't mind that Lee was gay, he knew he was too, and this just added to his excitement. He knew now that he could have Lee, and that Lee already thought he was sexy, everything was just going to be perfect. Zuko then looked at Lee, \"He's blushing, Oh god, he must think that I'm straight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee? Are alright? Look don't be embarrassed about wanting to share a bed with me, I want to share it with you too. I just didn't know how to say it. Lee, look at me.\"<br>\r\nLee looked up at Zuko's face crying.<br>\r\n\"Lee, don't you understand? I'm gay too, and more importantly I think...I think I love you\"<br>\r\nThey stared into each others eyes, and ever subtly leaned in and kissed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zuko, Thank you. For everything.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Lee?\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you for being so nice, and for the cake, you're right.
