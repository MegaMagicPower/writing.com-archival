Are you here?\" the Hedgehog had been asked to meet his friend here in private, Gold had been acting strangley since the council had been defeated, he hoped she was alright. <br>\r\nThankfully his worry was lost when the cloaked tenrec came in smiling, \"You didn't need to call out, I could sense you worrying.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah... Could you... maybe not read my mind without asking? I don't want you thinking I'm weird.\" Silver asked, blushing.<br>\r\n\"I can try, but I already know about you seeing me naked that one time in the hot springs\" Gold remaked teasingly. <br>\r\n\"Hey I didn't see any-\" Silvers protests were cut off as Gold placed a mask with six dots on it \"Whats this?\"<br>\r\n\"My old mask, they used it to try to brainwash me, but I was able to block it's effects with my powers.\" Gold explained before continuing.<br>\r\n\"Silver, if we use this in combination with my powers. We could change how a person thinks. Wouldn't that be an easier way to make a better future than talking to people who never listen?\"</span></div></div>",

This is an adult story, do not participate in or read if you aren't old enough. If I suspect a chapter is written by a child, I will delete it.<br>\r\n2. A central charcter in this is Gold the Tenrec, a Bisexual telepath from the Sonic Universe Comics, please atleast read over her wiki page if a chapter your about to write involves her. <br>\r\n3. This story is primarily to appeal to mind control and brainwashing fetishes, that being said, not every chapter path needs to be sex sex and evil mind control. You can have legitamate drama or romance if the situation calls for it.<br>\r\n4. Do not force other fetishes into this unless you have some way to work them in naturally to the plot. Inflation, Scat, Vore, Gore and Diaper fetishes are out right not allowed because of the excess of those on other stories. (gender bending, mild expansion and bimbofication are examples of more acceptable fetishes, but do try to focus on the mind control)<br>\r\n5. Since one of the Characters is a Bi lady, Lesbian scenes are more encouraged than gay, but feel free to experiment. <br>\r\n6. No fan characters, theres plenty of blank slate characters from the comics and games that can be used inplace of a self insert and it's not fair to others to include a character that they wouldn't be able to know anything about. If I spot a fan character I will either delete your chapter or replace the character with a similar official character.<br>\r\n7. No sex scenes with Eggman, we don't need the nightmares. I won't say no humans but realize some people find Sonics 3 human girlfriends creepy.</td>",
