When you walked in the girls went off ahead and you and Gareth followed them. they went over to the girls section so you waited on them as they said they would help pick out another uniform for you. then they dared you to try on a piece of girls clothes.

You then finished eating and went up to the common room. In the common room there was a sign saying for those interested in self  transformation lessons should sign up but there was no name of what teacher was doing them but you and your friends all signed up for them as you had never heard of self transformation and thought it could be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lesson for self transformation was after regular lessons that day so you had defence against the dark arts with professor titanium (not real in movies i made it up) where you learnt the stunning spell and it was only the first day. Then you had potions with professor Snape who hated all gryfindors even the great harry Potter who you had met a few times before. But through all the lessons none of the teachers mentioned the self transformation and none of the other houses had heard of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you finished your lessons and went to the library where the self transformation was meant to be.

No coming across main movie characters and transforming them but they can use your transformed self and transform you (if applicable) <br>\r\n2. only your character can be transformed<br>\r\n3. try make it all female objects<br>\r\n4. try make it so they can be either another object at some point or be the same object and be used by someone else<br>\r\n5. no swearing<br>\r\n6. avoid one liners try keep at least a few lines ( I may include a few but even then I will try to avoid short ones I'll probably just use them to get the story going then I will follow this rule as well)<br>\r\n7. others including teachers can transform you as well as you being able to transform yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\njust so you know girls uniform at hogwarts consists of a black skirt, black shoes, tights, a shirt , a Grey jumper, a Grey pinafore ( instead of skirt and jumper). After lessons the students are allowed to wear their own clothes instead of uniform and you can make the ule ball happen again if you want ( like a prom at hogwarts from the 4th harry potter movie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK that's it then make additions and if you keep to the rules I will send you GP if you make an addition <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
