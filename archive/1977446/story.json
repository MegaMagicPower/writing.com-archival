            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was more than a little down on his luck. He thought it was bad enough when he lost his job, but everything just seemed to get worse from there. Already living pay check to pay check, there was no way he was going to be able to pay rent for his apartment this month, and his landlord was as unforgiving as they come. No doubt he would be out on the street within the week. Having just moved into town to \"start a new adventure\", he had no real friends yet, and no family to fall back on. Needless to say, he was SOL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand through the short brown curls of his hair, he searched the internet, hoping to find some solution to his problem before the internet company cut him off from lack of payment. He sighed as he felt like tugging his hair out at the roots. \"I don't need a job 3 months from now, I need something now...\" He needed something to hold him over, and that was assuming he could get any of these positions in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's something in the classifieds... Hopefully people still use the newspaper for odd jobs...\" Dejectedly, the 22-year-old forced his lanky body into action, making his way to the apartment door, happy to find as he opened it that at least the newspaper company hadn't yet stopped their services. Taking the paper back in with him, he tore through the classifieds, crossing off ad after ad, until before long there was only one ad left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I've never really tried anything like this,'\" he read aloud, \"'but I'm totally looking for a new roommate! Sorry Ladies, but I'm looking for a guy who needs a place to stay! Hehehe! If you're interested, and you agree to one tiny, little something, you can stay for free! Here's my number...' I'm surprised they even printed this... if even actually says, 'Hehehe,' I mean, come on... This has gotta be some kind of joke. There's no way anyone could take this seriousl--\" Just then Kyle was interrupted as he was suddenly standing in darkness; the electric company had apparently waited long enough to get payed. \"*Sigh.* That's it then... I guess it's this or nothing... I wonder if I have enough money for a payphone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed as he made his way to what was hopefully (or more correctly, 'going to have to be') his new home. He was glad at least that the woman (Jessi was her name) seemed nice enough, and they had gotten along fine, but he was more than a little uneasy about the fact that she wouldn't tell him what the agreement for free rent was until he came over. He shrugged his backpack up higher on his shoulders, the relatively small bag filled with all that was left of his possessions. \"At least I made enough money selling stuff off to pay the bill collectors, but this is sort of depressing...\" He tried to shrug it off as he made his way into the apartment complex, an old, somewhat aged building in the suburbs of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching to press the elevator call button, he grimaced as he noticed an out of order sign claiming the elevator would be back in service as of May 25th. \"That was over a month ago...\" \"Glad\" to see that his luck hadn't changed, Kyle made his way up the six flights of stairs to his new apartment, building up his courage before finally knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door flew open, Kyle didn't even get a chance to say \"hello\" before he was being smothered by a huge pair of breasts. As he panicked and tried to pull away, the woman assaulting him only seemed to squeeze him tighter in a horribly strong bear-hug. \"Like, oh my gosh, you really came! This is gonna be soooo awesome! I've done like, a bunch of adds and no one has ever called, and now here you are! And you're not too bad to look at either! Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle in the meantime could barely comprehend her continuous stream of jabbering as he was left with nothing to look at but Jessi's massive cleavage. Past the panic, he couldn't help but enjoy this a little bit, though a fine film of sweat that was being transferred from her boobs to his face kind of killed the moment. When she finally loosened her hold, Kyle came up gasping for air as he finally got a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was of course, her breasts. At his eye-level, pale white flesh surged and swelled out of the top of a slightly dingy looking spaghetti string top, the white fabric fighting for dear life to hold back her massive mammaries and barely succeeding. At 5'10\", Kyle wasn't used to having to look up at people, but Jessi definitely required this. Somehow she was slightly more than a head taller than him, her smiling face framed with blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail beaming at him with 'smiling' green eyes as he realized she was waiting for him to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... uh... Hi, I'm Kyle... You must be Jessi, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yepyep, I know silly! It's sooo awesome you came, KyKy! Come in, come in!\" Kyle was about to make a comment about not especially liking the nickname, when he was decidedly distracted as Jessi turned and walked back into the apartment. Though her waist was slightly pudgy, and her Breast Gods had given Jessi way more than a fair share, apparently her lower half had been slightly even more blessed. Clad in a pair of tiny pink boy shorts, her booty exploded from her back like a shelf. Kyle watched, hypnotized, as the massive behind jiggled and jostled like twin jello molds as her cheeks attempted to escape her boy shorts out of the top (and with half of her crack showing, they seemed to be succeeding).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatdayou think of your new home?\" Kyle was forced out of his stupor as she turned back to face him, the door closing behind him as his eyes washed over the apartment. One wall was taken over by a small kitchenette and an even smaller bathroom. The rest of the one room apartment was apparently being used as a living room/bedroom/and dining room all in one. A small bed sat opposite a large TV, and Kyle couldn't help but notice that the place was a complete pigsty. Almost every inch of the floor was covered in, by the smell, dirty clothes, and over half the bed seemed to be strewn with discarded taco rappers/bags from Taco Bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppalled, but knowing he needed to keep on Jessi's good side, Kyle took the easy way out. \"It's umm... well... it's cozy, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaww, I knew you'd like it!\" Kyle was beginning to be amazed by both the tomboyishness and the air-headedness of this girl. \"Come on, sit!\" Feeling more than a little awkward, Kyle took a seat at the corner of the bed, noticing how big the TV was in this tiny space just before Jessi plopped herself down right next to him. He couldn't help but fidget as he noticed her thighs and butt rubbing up against his, as his eyes once again lingered on the pile of Taco Bell refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have someone over a little while ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that Taco Bell? No silly, I bought us dinner, but then you took a little longer than I thought you would and I got a little nervous... And I get hungry when I'm nervous, Hehehe. Umm, I think I made sure I left you one...\" Kyle's eyes grew wide; she had eaten enough tacos for a whole family!!! \"Ah, here it is!\" Jessi triumphantly pulled a squished softshell taco from under the pile, thrusting it into Kyle's face as it tripped with grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... No thanks, I ate before I came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should have told you I got Taco Bell! Oh well, if you don't want it, more for me! I don't know why my doctor says I shouldn't eat these, they just taste sooooo good!\" Kyle watched in mute fascination/horror as Jessi barely got the wrapper off before she scarfed the taco down practically whole, smearing cream cheese and taco grease around her lips and even dropping a dollop onto her cleavage with no attempt to wipe it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jessi... What is it I have to agree to to live here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hehehe, I was so excited you're here I forgot to tell you! If you decide to live here, I'll totally let you stay for free, and even pay for anything you need or want! All yooou have to do, is be my live-in boyfriend!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle nearly choked on his tongue. Living in this big tomboy's apartment was an awkward enough position, but being her boyfriend?!?! His mind scrambled once again for other options, but of course came up with none. Even with how slobby and tomboyish she seemed to be, her personality and outgoingness were cute, not to mention her amazing body... He looked up to answer and nearly laughed at the pair of puppy dog eyes Jessi was giving him. \"I guess if that's all I need to do to live here, I'd be honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaaay!!!\" Jessi literally jumped for joy, her breasts nearly surging all the way out of her top as the fabric creaked, groaned, and nearly tore in two. This resulted in Kyle getting even more of a facefull of sweaty cleavage as she hugged him again, causing small squelching noises as she squeezed him tighter and tighter. \"Oh my gosh, you don't even know how long I've waited to have a boyfriend! I don't get it, I try so hard but they never seem to stick around very long, but you'll be living with me!!! Don't worry, this is going to be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of talking (between smother sessions when Jessi got a 'little' too excited), Kyle found that he and Jessi actually had a lot in common and really got along. In different circumstances (and maybe if she was a little tidier), Kyle found himself thinking that he would have actually asked her out if they had met somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to talk, he couldn't help but notice that Jessi seemed to be shifting around uncomfortably. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, hehehe... Umm... *Shiftshift.* Yeah, I'm fine. I think I just need to umm... use the little girls' room-- I mean, our bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm... well don't let me hold you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, don't be silly.\" Finally giving into the urge, Jessi went to stand. As she did, her butt pooched out right in Kyle's face, her shorts sliding lower as her ass surges towards him, nearly looking like her crack is going to engulf him from his perspective. Kyle has just enough time to hear a rumble and then... PPPPHHHRRRRRRRRAAASSSTTTTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly threw up as the most disgusting smell ever blasts him square in the face, getting into his eyes, nose, even his mouth. Jessi looked over her shoulder at him, blushing from head to toe (even her pale white butt cheeks going a shade of pink). \"Oh my god, I'm soooo sorry KyKy!!! Sometimes it happens when I eat tacos... Or pretty much any time I eat anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to run out and never come back, but he had nowhere to go, and not to mention he had just agreed to be her boyfriend and he'd be living with her. Deciding it'd be better to avoid conflict, he tried to brush it off, even as the smell was still lingering. \"Don't *cough* worry about it... It didn't even really smell, and it's not like it's a big deal even if it did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god, I knew you were going to be a great boyfriend KyKy!\" Before Kyle could respond, there was another, much bigger rumble, followed by a very wet SSSPPPPRRRRRAAAPPPSSSSTTTTT!!! He felt like his face was melting off as Jessi ripped an even worse fart again right in his face before she walked towards the bathroom, apparently taking what he said as meaning what she did was just fine between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried as best he could to wave the stink away, but it seemed permanently fused to his nose no matter what he did. He was only distracted when Jessi got into the bathroom and turned around to start pulling down her boy shorts. \"Umm... Jessi, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hehe, I forgot to tell you, there's no door for the bathroom. That's kinda why I've been holding this in, I didn't know how to bring it up... But if I already farted in your face twice and it's no big deal, then just watch TV and imagine it's me doing that!\" Kyle had to fight back the urge to puke again at the thought, but as her big butt sealed itself to the toilet, he tried as best he could to watch the news that was on and not look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In our latest story tonight, a local man jumps from a 7 seven-story window to escape his --\" SSSSLLLLLLLOOOOOOORRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPSSSSSSHHHHHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he thought the sound of her explosive crap blasting into the toilet was bad, it was nothing compared to when she shifted and the smell leaked out. It was like when she farted in his face the second time, if he had been burying his face in her butt cheeks instead of just being near them. Forcing himself not to say anything and not to look, Kyle turned up the volume on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other news, a woman in the nearby county of-- PPPRRFFFTT --is attempting to boycott string cheese in an effort to--\" SSSSPPPPRRRRROOOOOMMMMMFFFFFSLLLLLLSSSHHHH!!! Barely keeping himself from looking, Kyle is reeling from the smell that is filling the room, and only getting worse by the minute. Jessi courtesy flushes, sending sickening bubbling noises throughout the apartment as the toilet struggles to process her slimy, soupy mixture and barely succeeds. The smell doesn't diminish, however, and it actually seems to get worse as the stink circulates throughout the small area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving one last valiant effort to \"ignore\" Jessi's emissions, Kyle turns the volume all the way up on the TV. \"--MAN DIED TODAY FROM EATING TOO MUCH BROCCOLI, A SHOCKING REPORT LATER TONI--\" SSSPPPPRRRRROOOOSSSSHHHH!!! SSSPPPREEEEEEENNNNN!!! SSSSHLLLOOOORRRFFFTTTTPPLOOOMTTTTSHHHHHHsppreeeeenplopplop... FFFRT!!! *Splash.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessi sighs in relief of pushing out the last of her nasty delivery, Kyle can no longer take it and glances over, and immediately can't look away. Like a car crash, his eyes lock on against his will. The toilet seems to be giving up the fight under Jessi's bulk, barely containing the bulk of her sludge even after the courtesy flush, and as it starts to leak slightly from overflow, Kyle can't imagine what the seat must look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi giggles nervously as he stares in morbid awe. \"Sorry... I know that must have been really disgusting... Oh god, I even forgot to get toilet paper AGAIN!!! *Sigh.* Umm... I understand if you want to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle siged inwardly. Despite how disgusting this situation (and maybe even Jessi and general) was, he couldn't walk out on her like this and crush her... Convincing himself that he has nowhere else to go anyway, Kyle forces a smile and forces himself to cover up his disgust as he turns down the TV. \"Don't... *coughcough* worry about it... I mean, *snifflecough* shit happens, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi gave Kyle a confused look for a moment, before she suddenly burst into a fit of smiles, giggles, and a barrage of nonstop jibberish. \"OhmygoshyourlikethebesteverKyKythisisgoingtobesogreatIthinkI'mgoingtoex plodeIdon'tknowwhattosay!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle can't help but smile genuinely as he still chokes on the smell, until to his horror Jessi gets up and, forgetting or ignoring the lack of toilet paper, pulls her boy shorts back up with a horrid *Squeeelch.* \"Hehehe, you're like, the best boyfriend ever, KyKy!\" All Kyle can do is stare as she walks out of the bathroom (not even attempting to flush this time), sickening squelching and rubbing sounds coming from her still-dirty butt as she walks to him. \"Hey, I've always wanted to do something with a boyfriend, you don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all Kyle can do to shake his head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I've always wondered what it's like to sit on your boyfriend's lap!\" Kyle tries to stop her in horror, but Jessi talks over any protests and spins around, showing off her once white, now brown/green smeared crack and just as dirty once pink boy shorts, right before she plops down on his lap. He can feel and hear the left over sludge squishing and smearing, even moreso when she shifts her weight from side to side to get comfy, her ass engulfing his entire lap. \"Hehehe, this is great! It's so comfy! You don't mind if I stay like this while we watch TV do you? PPPRRRPPPTTT Hehe, excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed as Jessi watched TV, while all he could watch was her back/the back of her head and listen to her shimmy back and forth on his lap. If this is what was happening the first day he's here, this was going to be a very... \"interesting\" relationship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleeping Arrangements<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed with relief as Jessi finally got up off of him, giving him a \u201cgreat\u201d view once again of her still ridiculously dirty bum. They had spent the last few more hours of Kyle \u201cwatching TV together\u201d (which in reality was her watching TV and constantly chattering while he put up with her shifting and grinding her soiled butt into him with his vision filled by her back and hair). He was at least happy to see that Jessi\u2019s ass seemed, at least relatively, cleaner, until he looked down and realized why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the uncovered section of Jessi\u2019s crack had been up against the front of Kyle\u2019s shirt, and Jessi\u2019s constant wiggling and grinding had caused it to be makeshift toilet paper. Most of his shirt now had a giant smearing of the brown/green stuff. Apparently Jessi had noticed as well. \u201cLike, oh my gosh!!! I\u2019m so, so, soooo sorry, KyKy! I knew I should have bought some toilet paper, but I always end up getting distracted and forgetting! I\u2019ll toootally by you a new shirt when we go shopping sometime soon!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was of course more than a little disgusted, and he wanted to be mad at her, but one look into her angelic face that screamed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d immediately made him think better of it. He was starting to get good at forcing smiles. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a shirt, and I never liked this one anyway. Heck, if I had the money, I would have thrown it away a lot sooner.\u201d This was a lie of course, it was actually Kyle\u2019s favorite shirt, but a shirt WAS just a shirt\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi was nearly in tears of joy as her face broke into one of the biggest smiles Kyle had ever seen. \u201cHehehe, well don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll buy you a new shirt every time that happens, KK?\u201d Kyle couldn\u2019t help but smile in spite of himself, the fact of her statement suggesting that this may be a regular occurrence not being lost on him. He wasn\u2019t sure yet if this agreement was a godsend or a deal with the devil, but he had to admit that he was starting to have a weakness for making Jessi smile even as she was making him almost lose his lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Kyle gingerly started undoing his shirt, not wanting to get any more of the refuse on his hands than he absolutely had too. With his shirt half unbuttoned, Kyle looked up to see Jessi staring at him in complete rapture; at least until she noticed he was looking back. Startled, her breasts and buns were sent a-jiggling like mad as she quickly turned around and covered her face, showing off her trademark full-body blush as she burst into another barrage of nearly incoherent words. \u201cOhmygoshI\u2019msorryIshouldn\u2019thavebeenlookingIshouldhaveclosedmyeyesorsomethi ngbutI\u2019venever\u2026 I\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle arched an eyebrow, still not exactly sure what he had done to get this reaction. \u201cNever\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he couldn\u2019t see her face, Kyle could just imagine the pouting/semi-ashamed face Jessi made as she answered. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 seen a guy undress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Kyle could do not to bust out laughing, but he couldn\u2019t stop a small snicker from escaping. He was immediately assaulted by the most perfectly poochy pouty face ever. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me\u2026 Meany Head.\u201d But as she noticed he had opened the rest of his shirt and was in the process of taking it off, her body was quickly washed an even deeper shade of red as she quickly turned away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t hold back the laugh any more. As he laughed and Jessi continued to pout and fidget, he couldn\u2019t help but notice how innocently cute she was (and inversely, how at the same time she could be completely oblivious to how she carried her OWN body). \u201cHahaha. Come on, Jessi, it\u2019s not like I was taking my pants off. Then again\u2026 it is about time for bed.\u201d Kyle didn\u2019t think it was possible, but Jessi\u2019s body immediately went an even deeper red, her butt cheeks practically glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a break from his teasing, Kyle decided it was time to bid his shirt a fond farewell. \u201cAnyway, do you have a garbage can somewhere?\u201d Jessi seemed more than a little relieved for the change of conversation, though Kyle was pleased to see her taking quick glances over her shoulder at him as she replied, still refusing to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I mean, I had one\u2026 I\u2019m not sure where it is\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure I had one last week\u2026\u201d Kyle was wondering how she could lose a garbage can in such a small space, until he saw the especially large pile of dirty clothes that had accumulated in one of the corners and hadn\u2019t yet spilled onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have known better than to disturb the pile\u2019s slumber, but before he could think better of it, Kyle reach out and shoved the top half of the pile to the floor. He was happy to find he was right as he saw part of the garbage can sticking up, but two seconds later he was regretting it. Not only was his hand greasy and sweaty from the god-knows-how-old dirty clothes pile, Kyle had inadvertently released the stink that had been trapped inside. His head was spinning as the smell of decaying BO attacked him full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! You found it! Goody!\u201d Jessi had apparently worked up the courage to turn around and be able to talk fairly normal, though now her eyes were roaming more than ever and she hadn\u2019t gotten any less red. \u201cI\u2019ve been using it for a dirty clothes basket, but go ahead and toss your shirt in there, I have plenty of clean clothes to wear! Hehehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes quickly swept the room again, and sure enough he didn\u2019t see anything the resembled a dresser or closet. Which meant\u2026 she actually thought all the clothes strewn all over the apartment were clean?! He sighed in exasperation as Jessi proved once again just how oblivious she really was. As he reached towards the lid of the garbage can, a chill ran down his body. If she thought these obviously dirty clothes were clean\u2026 how bad did something have to be for her to think it was dirty? Glancing back to see Jessi preoccupied with openly checking him out again, Kyle forced down his growing dread and, braving the smell of the \u201cclean\u201d clothes pile, opened the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had thought that the smell of the clothes pile was bad, he had had no idea. The smell assaulting every part of his being at the moment was something like mixing a bag full of used gym clothes with an abandoned gas station bathroom, then having someone eat that mixture and throw it back up again. He tossed his shirt into the bin blindly, his eyes watering too much too see (which thankfully meant he didn\u2019t have to look at anything inside). Even though it had only taken him a few seconds to dispose of his soiled shirt, the stench was proving too much for him. Kyle took a few steps back, tripping over an errant T-shirt, and before he knew it he was out cold on the floor, the expanse of dirty clothes at least breaking his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi seemed unconcerned with Kyle\u2019s fall, flashing another smile as she looked down at his passed out form. \u201cAaww, he must be like, totally exhausted after all of the excitement today! Hehehe, he\u2019s definitely a keeper. Too bad he didn\u2019t fall onto the bed though\u2026 I mean, no, that\u2019s bad, bad, bad!\u201d Her body had finally gotten back to its pale shade, but was once again washed in pink. \u201cAt least I get to sleep in the same room with him, hehehe. I can\u2019t wait until tomorrow!\u201d Feeling a bit tired herself, Jessi soon turned off the TV and the overhead light, taking one last long guilty look at Kyle before pushing the Taco Bell wrappers off the end of the bed and plopping herself onto the sweat-stained sheets. Today was the best day she had ever had, and she was optimistic that every day from here out was just going to get better. A content smile washed over her face as she drifted off to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle startled awake, having just woken up from a nightmare about Jessi wanting him to clean her toes with his tongue. He could almost still taste the toe jam\u2026 Wait\u2026 He spit violently as he realized he had somehow rolled in his sleep and filled his mouth with an inside-out sock, the toe section rubbing all over his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to work on cleaning all of this up sometime\u2026 or at least not pass out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a valid attempt to scrape the taste of Jessi\u2019s foot off his tongue ended in failure, Kyle finally noticed that it was dark; well, mostly dark. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as even with the room entirely in disarray, no clothes were blocking a nightlight plugged in low on the wall. In the soft glow, he could see Jessi\u2019s sleeping form. On her side facing away from him, her hips jutted up from the bed like no other, her dirty butt shifting slightly with her breathing, and Kyle couldn\u2019t help but take a moment to admire her form (minus the dirtiness) while he took off his shoes and sock to make himself more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s own ogle session was interrupted by the urge to make water. Getting up and setting his shoes near his backpack by the door, he made his way to the bathroom, and \u2013*Squish*\u2026 immediately regretted taking his shoes off. How could he have forgotten about her recent bowel movement already? Maybe Jessi was rubbing off on him\u2026 Or maybe he had blocked it out. He was glad at least that the smell wasn\u2019t as strong, though the disgusting sludge on his foot told him that the toilet had continued to leak after she had walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes adjusted to the darkness, the extent of the mess slowly came into focus. The toilet had completely overflowed, chunky diarrhea water having spread to most of the bathroom floor. At first he thought there was no toilet seat, but he soon realized that is was slick with crap, the once white porcelain now a sickly shade of brown/green, and a lot of the tank wasn\u2019t much better. Choking back his dinner from the feel Jessi\u2019s crap between his toes alone, Kyle sighed as he realized that if he wanted to pee, he was going to have to clean this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst\u2026 Ick\u2026 I\u2019ll have to unclog this thing\u2026\u201d Luckily, behind the toilet there was a plunger (albeit a VERY used one), unfortunately, it too had crap leaked all over it. Picking it up as gingerly as he could, Kyle reached into the small nearby walk-in shower and turned on the water, washing at least the handle off as best he could. \u201cI swear, if you weren\u2019t so cute, and I didn\u2019t need a place to stay\u2026\u201d Kyle couldn\u2019t finish his thought as he imagined Jessi\u2019s facial expression, and was immediately defeated. \u201cLet\u2019s just get it over with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet was so backed up, that even just introducing the plunger caused more overflow, splashing onto his already disgusting feet. The smell was horrible, but there was nothing he could do about it as he was forced to use both hands to pump the plunger, which splattered backsplash all over his pants, yet another piece of clothing Jessi had claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied that the toilet would flush, Kyle tossed the plunger under the running showerhead. \u201cMoment of truth\u2026\u201d Pressing the handle, Kyle half imagined the toilet exploding and spraying everywhere, but after a few disgusting bubbling sounds, the toilet finally started to process the mass, although very slowly. Kyle couldn\u2019t help but do a fist-pump in victory, but this proved to be his undoing as the excessive amount of waste still under his feet caused them to slip right out from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed down around him as Kyle fell, his destination pre-determined by some angry god as he first fell to his knees. He tried to catch himself, but the filth-slick surfaces of the bathroom offered him no help, and he was forced to watch in horror as he faceplanted into the still nearly full toilet bowl. Coming up sputtering for air and spitting out cold diarrhea/water, Kyle immediately wanted to dive into the shower and turn the water up to scalding, but he realized he would immediately be dirty again as soon as he stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter desperately fighting his dinner down multiple times, he looked around and was glad to notice a pile of only slightly used towels in the bathroom corner that had escaped the shitstorm unscathed. He did his best to use one to get the shit off of his face and out of his hair as the toilet continued making its disgusting slurping sounds behind him. Working up whatever gusto he still had, he forced himself to finish the job as he used the rest of the towels to wipe up the entire bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the toilet finally cleared out, Kyle was amazed at how Jessi had slept through the entire thing. Taking off his pants and using one of the towels to wipe off his feet too not drag shit into the apartment, he and bundled up both with all of the other towels and placed them in the \u201cdirty clothes basket\u201d, making sure this time to plug his nose and be even quicker about closing the lid. As Kyle admired his handiwork, he couldn\u2019t help but have an inkling suspicion that it would all be undone before he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and finally taking the piss that had started all this hardship, Kyle soon jumped in the shower, nearly burning himself trying to make sure not a speck of crap was left on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wiped himself dry with one of the last remaining towels, not too happy with the smell of BO that was coming off of it, but just glad it wasn\u2019t shit, and didn\u2019t smell anywhere near as strong. Grabbing his backpack, Kyle turned on the light as he searched for a new pair of boxers and slipped them on, the light apparently stirring Jessi out of her deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had every intention of telling her off, or at least telling her what he had to put up with. But as she rolled over to squint over at him standing in the bathroom doorway, her hair in a tussle and rubbing one eye sleepily, he once again couldn\u2019t bring himself to crush this girl. \u201cKyky\u2026 *Yawn.* What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kyle was trying to think of what to say when his thoughts were stopped dead in their tracks. Apparently her cami had finally given up the fight, at least partially. As she turned, one of her breasts flopped free of the cami\u2019s cup, bouncing and swaying with the slightest shift. Even out of the cami, it seemed to defy gravity, the giant orb much to perky for something its size. He was snapped out of his stupor as he noticed Jessi had the same expression he must have had. \u201cYo\u2014y-y-y-you\u2019re\u2026 *Gulp.* You\u2019re in your\u2026 your boxers!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was stunned. Now fully awake, she still seemed oblivious to her own body, even as she was freaking out about something much less\u2026 risqu\u00e9. Trying to keep Jessi from going into another blushing fit, Kyle quickly made something up to answer her question. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I umm\u2026 I was having trouble sleeping on the floor, so I decided to take a shower. Oh, and umm\u2026 your boob kind of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi looked at him confused for a moment, before looking down and giggling. \u201cOh, yeah, that happens a lot, I know this is my size, but it\u2019s like all my clothes shrink before I even try \u2018em on!\u201d She shifts her cami around a bit and with some effort, shoves the orb of flesh back in, only to have the other flop out without her notice. Kyle sweatdropped, just glad that at least she had gotten over him being in his boxers. \u201cUmm\u2026 I mean\u2026 if it\u2019s like\u2026 Uncomfortable for you down there\u2026 I mean, if you want to\u2026 umm\u2026 youcouldsharethebedwithme!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said the last part so fast Kyle barely caught it, but he couldn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t pleased with her sudden burst of forwardness. \u201cUmm\u2026 yeah, that\u2019d be nice\u2026 I mean, we ARE boyfriend and girlfriend, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still wasn\u2019t absolutely sure it was worth all of the trouble, but with how happy it seemed he had just made Jessi, you\u2019d think she just won the lottery after buying a ticket with her last dollar. Too happy for words, she just scooted to the end of the bed, her naked boob bobbing hypnotically, before nudging her head toward wall side of the bed. Kyle had misgivings, but couldn\u2019t say no at this point. Turning off the light, he made his way over to the bed and laid down with his back against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he hadn\u2019t noticed how small the bed was before, he definitely noticed as Jessi laid back down beside him. \u201cBeside\u201d meaning she smacked him in the face with her naked (apparently very sweaty) breast, and then engulfing him once again deep in a face full of cleavage. \u201cHehehe, this is soooo cozy! You\u2019re like a big teddy bear, except like\u2026 warm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery warm,\u201d Kyle tried to reply, but all that came out were muffled \u201cmmphs\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, that tickles KyKy! Now, time to get back to beddy-bye, and then we can do stuff all day tomorrow!\u201d Jessi couldn\u2019t help but huggle Kyle even tighter, and he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if his head had completely disappeared into the sweat waterfall that was her cleavage. It was all he could do to not drown as he tried to breathe, a steady trickle making its way past his lips even with his best efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he could hear the rhythmic breathing of Jessi sleeping, her cleavage surging past his ears with each inhale, squelching in retreat with each exhale. Even though he would have enjoyed a less damp environment, Kyle couldn\u2019t help but find it really\u2026 relaxing. Before long he was drifting off to sleep as well\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kyle looked up groggily as she fidgeted; only noticing that he had been moved a bit when her breasts were no longer in his face. She had rolled onto her back, which gave him just enough room to do the same, moving up a little higher on the bed. Oddly enough, the sudden absence of her body made him wish he had a blanket, but that thought was thrust from his mind as he looked over to see Jessi roll back, her breasts slapping onto his chest as she half steam-rolled him, her angelic sleeping face sideways above his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe enjoyed the moment, watching her still-smiling face until it was suddenly blocked out by her arm, then her armpit. Kyle opened his mouth to get her attention, but all he got for his troubles was a mouthful of even more foul-tasting sweat. He tried to move her, but found his one arm was pinned under her breasts/stomach, and the other was pinned against the wall. Jessi giggled in her sleep, shifting around on top of him and rubbing her armpit skin all over his face. Though her hair wouldn\u2019t be visible to the naked eye, the stubble was definitely there as it rubbed his face raw before she finally moved back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still pinned, but this time her arm was propping her up on the bed, her face back over his. \u201cJessi\u2026 Jessi, could you scoot over a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Tacos\u2026 sooo\u2026 tastey\u2026\u201d Apparently Jessi was dreaming, and she was back to not waking up for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessi, wake up!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Should wait\u2026. but\u2026 so nummy\u2026\u201d Kyle watched in horror as Jessi began to drool, a large glob forming. Totally unresponsive to anything Kyle yelled at her, he was forced to watch as the large glob grew and stretched, before slowly sagging down towards his face. There was nothing he could do as the smelly fluid contacted his face and kept coming. Soon a large stream was flowing, getting all over his face. Before long it was getting into his nose and mouth, and at the very least he could tell that Jessi hadn\u2019t brushed her teeth in a while, with both his sense of smell and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2026 *Coughcough.* Why does she have to be dreaming about tacos?\u201d By the time Jessi moved again, it was like he had taken another shower in her drool. \u201cEck\u2026 I should go back to the floor\u2026\u201d Fortunately, at that moment, Jessi started to get up. Unfortunately as Kyle moved with her to try to get past, he was immediately knocked over by her enormous ass swinging around as she moved her head from the top of the bed to the bottom. In the middle of the bed now, Kyle was about to attempt again at getting up, but it was too late. His eyes went wide as one of Jessi\u2019s chubby thighs swung over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, all of Jessi\u2019s weight plopped onto him, her breasts engulfing his crotch, while her lower half was decidedly more\u2026 noticeable. With her knees on just above each of his shoulders, and her thighs on either side of his head, Kyle was mortified to realize that she was laying with her crotch essentially on his neck. Which meant her ass crack\u2026 was trying to devour his chin through her dirty boy shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been the worst thing to have her cleavage grinding his crotch, or that bad of a view, if he didn\u2019t know the horrors that came from that behind at least second-hand. Nonetheless, he couldn\u2019t help enjoying himself a little as Jessi, still oblivious to everything, started shifting her butt back and forth right in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026 yeah\u2026 \u2018m fine\u2026 need to go\u2026 little girls\u2019 room\u2026\u201d Kyle forced himself to focus as he thought what he was catching her say sounded kind of familiar\u2026 \u201cHehe\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 be silly.\u201d Wait\u2026 wasn\u2019t that part of the conversation they had had right before\u2026 PPPLLLOOOORRSSSHHHHHTTT!!! \u201cOh god\u2026 sorry KyKy\u2026 happens when\u2026 I eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god! *Coughcough.* She\u2019s dreaming about today! The taco bit must have been before she ate them\u2026 and now she\u2019s dreaming about\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 knew you were\u2026 best boyfriend\u2026\u201d SSPPPRRRROOOOOONNNNSSSHHHHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thought smelling it the first time was bad enough, but these farts seemed even wetter, and they were blasting at him through a crap-smeared screen. But what was next? As Jessi started shifting, Kyle was hoping this meant she would be going into the bathroom now, but unfortunately that wasn\u2019t the case. Instead she pushed herself up and leaned back, essentially sitting her gigantic ass on his face. \u201cHehe\u2026 forgot to tell you\u2026 no door\u2026 just imagine\u2026 me farting in you face\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s only saving grace was that at least some of her ass was covered by her boy shorts, but that didn\u2019t last long. He felt an intense pressure on his face as Jessi used it as leverage to move her legs in front of his arms and lift into a low squat above him. He tried to quickly get out of the way, but was stopped as Jessi yanked down her boy shorts and hit him square in the face with them. He fought with the soiled garment, until Jessi kicked them away and slammed her ass back down, engulfing his head in her still horribly dirty bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was practically crying as Jessi shifted back and forth, grinding his face deeper and deeper (and consequently dirtier and dirtier). He started to hear deep gurgles from Jessi, as he could do nothing but wait for the inevitable before\u2026 SSSLLLLLLOOOOOOOOORRRSSSSHHHHHHH SSPPPPRRRROMMMMFFFFTTTTT SSSSRRRRRAAAAAMMMPPPPHHHHHHTTTTT FRRRRSSSSSSHHHHHHPPPPPTTTT BLRRRTT SPLOORRSSH PPPhHHrrrtttsprooonshom\u2026 FRAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was assaulted by the most vile, disgusting, horrendous combination of semi-liquid to semi-solid spurts of diarrhea and logs. He tried to scream and flail, but it only got him a few mouthfuls of the filth, forcing him to swallow just to be able to breathe the rancid air. Before long his head was all but entombed in her shit, along with overflow staining the already sweat-stained sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026 really disgusting\u2026 forgot toilet paper\u2026 Understand\u2026 want to leave\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle would have liked nothing better, but of course he didn\u2019t have that option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026 best boyfriend\u2026 KyKy\u2026 do you mind\u2026 always wondered\u2026 sit on\u2026 lap\u2026\u201d Wait, wasn\u2019t she supposed to put her boy shorts back on? \u201cHehe\u2026 so comfy\u2026 don\u2019t mind\u2026 if I stay like this...?\u201d SPPPPRRAAASSSHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was in hell as Jessi apparently was going to go the rest of the night sitting up on his face, and even though her dream was seemingly over-- FFFRRRSSSHHHTTT!!! Her wet farts didn\u2019t seem like they were going to stop any time soon\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A \u201cRomantic\u201d Dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had never been more disgusted in his entire life. His face, hair, and probably most of his chest were covered in shit. Not only that, but every time he actually got a little bit of sleep, he would be assaulted by another giant fart from Jessi\u2019s foul butt, which was still planted squarely on his head. It only made it worse to know that she was completely oblivious to it all, and with how she would periodically grind his face between farts, he was starting to think that she was subconsciously enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, exhaustion finally allowed the sweet release of sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kyle awoke, he had convinced himself it was all just a nightmare, but he was quickly brought back to the sick reality with a hearty PPRRAAAPPTT!!! Kyle could barely hear Jessi through her gigantic buns as she seemed to be waking up. \u201cHmm\u2026 *Yawn.* FFLLAAAPPTT!!! Oopsie, hehehe, sorry KyKy, morning gas is the worst. FRRRTT!\u201d Jessi let out another giggle in embarrassment, shifting her ass from side to side and grinding the stink into Kyle\u2019s nose as he tried to move his stiff body to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get a good night\u2019s sleep, KyKy? \u2026KyKy? Where are you? Oh no, like, don\u2019t tell me he left!!!\u201d As Jessi panicked, Kyle felt a final increase of immense pressure before her ass finally rose and released its hold on him, though not without a sickening squelch as it seemed reluctant to let him go from its massive crack. Kyle gulped the first fresh air he had in hours, but only for a moment before a final PPPRRRROOOOSSHTT as Jessi stood up the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi stood over him, looking this way and that, somehow still oblivious to her shit-stained crack. With her back still turned, Kyle toyed with the notion of sprinting out the door, but the only thing worse than running through an apartment building with shit all over your face would be having a girl with a naked crap-smeared ass running after you. With a sigh, he coughed and said her name. She quickly turned around, and Kyle was amazed in spite of himself to watch as she had to pull her breasts apart to look down at him through her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you are, KyKy! I was afraid you\u2026 you left\u2026 Oh\u2026 My\u2026 GOD!!!\u201d A look of confusion washed over her face as her eyes traveled first from Kyle\u2019s face to her butt (or at least as much of it as she could see), then as it clicked her expression quickly changed to horror. \u201cOh my god, like\u2026 I didn\u2019t, did I?! OhmygodohmygodI\u2019msosorryIdon\u2019tknowwhathappenedyou\u2019renevergoingtoforgivemeI justwanttodie!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her legs gave out from under her and she plopped down hard next to him, Kyle realized too late that he had missed his chance to berate her. Her face was the very definition of sadness, and that was before she burst into bubbly sobs, spouting gibberish about ruining everything and him leaving between each bout of waterworks. Huge tears welled up and streamed down her face, and it was all Kyle could do, even crap-covered as he was, to not reach out and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have rather lived in a cardboard box if he was told what was going to happen here, but now that he had spent even the short amount of time with her, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave her destroyed like this. It wasn\u2019t like she was actively trying to do this stuff to him\u2026 Then again, she definitely wasn\u2019t trying NOT to either\u2026 But he was trapped nonetheless. \u201cJessi\u2026 It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not leaving\u2026 I told you, shit happens, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi slowly blubbered to a stop from her crying fit, not sure whether he actually meant what he said or not. \u201cI\u2019m still here, aren\u2019t I? \u2013WAIT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi stopped in mid-glomp, her still exposed breast bobbing along with its covered twin inches from his face. \u201cShowering and cleaning up first, THEN you can hug me all you want.\u201d Kyle immediately regretted phrasing his statement that way, but couldn\u2019t help but be glad he at least could get clean again. Though how long that would last was anyone\u2019s guess. Getting up to shower first, Kyle fought back a smile as he watched Jessi bounce happily around the bed, giggling like a school girl even as she bundled up the refuse-covered sheets and nonchalantly threw them into the \u201cdirty clothes bin\u201d, as usual completely oblivious to the smell, not to mention the most likely permanent stain on her mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time both Kyle and Jessi were done showering, it was early afternoon. It had taken Kyle over an hour to get every bit of her waste off of him and out of his hair, and at least most of the smell. Jessi took just as long, though in her case it seemed to be because she was doing more singing than washing (though calling the high off-pitched screeches of Jessi \u201csinging\u201d was like calling a lopsided stick figure \u201cart\u201d). It wasn\u2019t any better to listen to when you added in the constant \u201cbass-line\u201d of Jessi\u2019s morning gas; the tacos (even after two more than massive bowel movements) apparently still ripping through her system with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle finished getting dressed while he waited, putting on a pair of black jeans and a red turtleneck, trying as best he could to not think of what most likely would happen to one of the only good outfits he had left after the move. \u201cHey, KyKy! SSPPPRFF! Do you like, FRRAASSHTT! Hehehe, excuse me. Do you like, wanna go out to eat? I\u2019m totally mmphPPRRRAAPPPT!!! Starving. Hehe.\u201d Kyle replied with an affirmative, though he wasn\u2019t sure his stomach was ever going to recover from the \u201cbreakfast\u201d Jessi had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessi finally got out of the shower, Kyle turned his attention from the TV and was stunned. Jessi stood in the doorway in all of her dripping wet glory, a small towel held across her chest by one arm and barely hanging long enough to cover her crotch, no doubt leaving her backside completely exposed. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was most impressed by this sight, or the fact that he could practically see the stink from her farts, heavily saturated by the shower water, flow in from behind her and attack his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to put up with the smell to enjoy the view, Kyle didn\u2019t see the smirk on Jessi\u2019s face until it was too late. \u201cHere I come!!!\u201d With a sudden burst of giggles, Jessi dove at him, seeming to forget all about covering up her wet body with the towel as she tackled Kyle to the ground. Having survived being nearly crushed upon landing on the clothes-strewn floor with Jessi on top of him, Kyle received no respite as she proceeded to smother him with a pair of orbs he was getting very acquainted with. \u201cHehehe! PPLAAPPTT!!! Remember? You like, said I could hug you as much as I want! Hehehe! SPLORT!!! \u2018Scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\nHis clothes now soaked, Kyle definitely remembered. He also couldn\u2019t help but recognize a bit more than a hint of the BO that he had been forced to smell every time Jessi gave him a hug. But how could she still have a scent after just getting out of an hour-long shower? When she finally disentangled herself from him, he couldn\u2019t help but ask about it as slyly as he could muster. \u201cUmm\u2026 Jessi\u2026 what kind of soap do you use?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi pulled her towel (which had miraculously never uncovered her crotch) back up to \u201ccover\u201d her bulging breasts. \u201cOh, I dunno, I just like, buy whatever looks good. I used soap last week though, so I just rinsed off this time. Hehehe. FFRRAAAPPPSSTTT!!!\u201d Kyle sighed, once again shown why he was probably her longest-lasting boyfriend to this day. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get ready! I\u2019m like, totally gonna FRRPPTT! Die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessi started rooting through the room for an outfit, Kyle tried his best not to stare, but failed. Her bum completely exposed in all its jiggling magnificence, it was like it had magnetic force on his eyes, even as he could practically see smell lines streaming off of it as she continued to nonchalantly rip ass. \u201cThis\u2019ll work! I haven\u2019t worn this outfit in\u2026 BLART!! \u2013ever, I hope it hasn\u2019t shrunk too much.\u201d Kyle highly doubted the material had shrunk at all, but as she turned around and showed him the outfit, he was even more doubtful she would even get into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one hand, she held a baby-tee, the white garment adorned with a large yellow duckling with the caption, \u201cI Like Duckies!\u201d underneath. In the other, Jessi held a yellow mini-skirt, a small pocket affixed on the back end of the cotton-stretchy material. Both looked to be made for someone sizes upon sizes smaller (not to mention a foot or so shorter) than Jessi, but of course Kyle saw no signs of her noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing the biggest act of \u2018modesty\u2019 Kyle had ever seen her display, Jessi tied the towel as well as she could around her waist (which ended up with it like an apron, still leaving her butt fully exposed, not to mention her bouncing breasts). He could do nothing but stare as Jessi tossed the skirt on the corner of the shit-stained mattress and started putting the t-shirt on, no bra in sight. Kyle wouldn\u2019t have been able to look away if his life depended on it as she got caught in the shirt as she got her arms through and tried to slip it over her head, her breasts flopping and bouncing hypnotically with every shimmy and shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got unstuck, giggling as she went, the big obstacle, her chest, loomed large. Undaunted, Jessi yanked and pulled on the tiny shirt, stretching and yanking and pulling, forcing the shirt down until she decided to rest. \u201cSorry, KyKy \u2013FFFRAAPPTT!!! I guess this shirt did shrink a bit. Hehe.\u201d Kyle once again doubted that, but was distracted as the shirt was only staying because she had it caught on her nipples, under-cleavage running rampant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After more than a few more tugs and jostles, Jessi had her breasts completely packed into the tiny shirt, the duckling and caption so distorted and stretched they were almost unrecognizable. \u201cSooo\u2014SSPPRRRAAPPT! \u2013tiiiiight\u2026 frrrrrrppttt\u2026 \u2018Scuse me.\u201d Jessi pouted, grabbing a tie to put her hair up in her signature ponytail when suddenly\u2026 RRRRIPPP!!! Kyle\u2019s eyes went wide as a tear formed from the collar of Jessi\u2019s shirt and her cleavage fought to explode out, while she just sighed in relief. \u201cOh goody! I guess it just needed a chance to stretch!\u201d Jessi pulled her shirt down forcibly to cover her stomach (only half succeeding), the tear growing and growing until by the time she was done and the tear seemed to stop, cleavage was all but flowing out of the top, the poor duckling nearly torn in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go!!! Hehehe! Now for the skirt\u2026 Hmm\u2026 PPPROOPPT!!! KyKy, since the shirt shrank so much, I\u2019m sure the skirt did too\u2026 Do you\u2026 umm\u2026 I mean, like\u2026 doyouthinkyoucouldhelpme?\u201d After watching her walk around essentially naked and putting her shirt on right in front of him, Kyle wasn\u2019t sure how Jessi was still embarrassed, but he had to admit it was cute. After nodding an affirmative, Kyle was rewarded with another breast smothering hug, his face being engulfed in the tightly packed flab until he was finally able to extricate himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty, here we go!!!\u201d Kyle let Jessi lean on him as she stepped into the small skirt, bending over in front of him and wiggling her smelly butt in front of him, quickly getting stuck at the base of her thighs. Taking this as his cue, Kyle bent down and started shimmying the skirt up. It was slow going and a lot of work, so much so Kyle almost forgot that Jessi\u2019s ass was right in his face\u2026 Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just glad that apparently her digestive system had won out over the tacos, but immediately knew he jinxed it as he yanked the skirt up to the base of her bum cheeks, jiggling them slightly as\u2026 mmmrrpPRROOOOOFFFTTTT!!! Kyle nearly hurled as Jessi blasted his face at point-blank. \u201cHehehehehe, that like\u2014FRRAAAPPPTTT!!! \u2013tickles, KyKy! PPROOPTT!!!\u201d It didn\u2019t get any better as Jessi\u2019s constant giggling set off a chain of popping farts. Kyle tried as best he could to hold his breath as Jessi continued to rip ass right in his face, the fact that she was wiggling and fidgeting from his \u201ctickling\u201d wasn\u2019t making it any easier, especially when she occasionally slammed her ass against his nose and rubbed in the smell. FFFRRROOOOPPPTTTSSSHHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enduring countless barrages of farts, Kyle was getting light-headed, and the skirt was still only a quarter of the way over her bum cheeks. With a grunt of exertion and frustration, Kyle yanked hard as he stood; startling himself slightly as the skirt suddenly gave. Falling against Jessi, Kyle was at least happy to hear her celebrate his apparent success with a giant FFFFRRRRRAAAAPPPTTSSSHHHOOOOMMFFF!!! That is until Kyle felt very warm air on his hand and forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Kyle at first noticed that though he had apparently succeeded in pulling up Jessi\u2019s skirt, there was definitely not enough material for her ass. The yellow material, already meant to be short on a person the size it was made for, had become less than a micro-skirt, Jessi\u2019s humongous behind and deep stank-producing crack bulged and overflowed out of both the top AND the bottom. To his horror, Kyle then noticed that in his surprise and stumble, he had somehow ended up with his left hand and most of his forearm shoved deep into her crack, the turtleneck\u2019s arm having lifted above his elbow and left him with skin to skin contact. Trying to yank it out, Kyle\u2019s horror grew as no matter how he tugged, it wouldn\u2019t budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSPPPLLOOOOORRRPPPTTT!!! \u201cHehehe, what are you doing back there, KyKy? It like, hehehehe, totally tickles!\u201d FRRAAASSSHHHHTTT!!! Kyle\u2019s skin crawled as the thick hot air from her farts blasted all over his trapped hand and forearm, only getting worse as the stink traveled up his arm and attacked his nose. Lifting her arm and turning suddenly to look behind her, Kyle received a face-full of armpit and side-boob, the thin material of her baby-tee thinly veiling her still present BO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyKy\u2026 Umm\u2026 FRRPPT! Do you like\u2026 Do you have your hand down my skirt?\u201d Kyle pulled his face away as best he could and looked up to see Jessi starting one of her full body blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I mean\u2026 well, I do, but\u2026 It was an accident!\u201d Kyle tried once again to extricate his arm, but only succeeded in jiggling loose another massive PPPRRAAAPPPTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyKy\u2026 I mean\u2026 You don\u2019t have to fib\u2026 Hehehe\u2026 I mean, we\u2019re boyfriend and girlfriend, right? You said so yourself! So umm\u2026 I mean\u2026 FRPT! If umm\u2026 If you want\u2026 Ifyouwantyoucankeepyourhandthereuntilyoudecidetotakeitout!!! SSPPPRRROOOPPTT!!!\u201d Kyle tried to tell her he couldn\u2019t take it out, but she heard none of it over her blushing giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Kyle tried a different approach. \u201cUmm\u2026 Jessi, don\u2019t you need panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOopsie, did I forget undies again? Hehehe. I do that a lot; there\u2019s always next time though! But we should like, get going, I\u2019m completely starved!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging Kyle along \u201cby the hand\u201d, Jessi grabbed her credit card, slipping it into her small butt pocket before bouncing out the door, Kyle still being assaulted by both the smell and now the feel of her horrid gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jessi and Kyle arrived at the restaurant, Kyle\u2019s face was half-soaked with sweat. It was a very hot day as they had started out on their walk to the place, and Kyle had started off at least trying to enjoy the close up view of Jessi\u2019s right breast bouncing near his face with each step, trying his best to annoy the noxious air saturating his hand and arm. Unfortunately this \u201cenjoyable\u201d time didn\u2019t last long, as with a giggle of happiness from walking with her boyfriend, Jessi wrapped her arm around him in a half-hug, slamming his face into both her side-boob and her armpit once again and trapping him there as she continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued, Kyle sighed in exasperation as Jessi started to sweat profusely, soon soaking through the shirt and smearing the salty liquid all over the side of his face and in his hair. By the time they reached their destination, Jessi\u2019s BO was as strong as ever, practically giving Kyle a second shower as the sweat waterfalled onto him. Jessi only released her hold when they stumbled into the restaurant, nearly dragging him along as she rushed up to the hostess/waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, welcome to Gertrude\u2019s Seafood Shanty, where the only thing better than our seafood is our service. My name is Lisa and I\u2019ll be your hostess and waitress today.\u201d Kyle looked up as the waitress gave her welcoming speech flawlessly but unconvincingly, her face showing both boredom and annoyance. Kyle didn\u2019t blame her as her uniform was tacky at best, a bright aqua polo shirt with a large trio of shrimp on the front with black pants, her head adorned with a newspaper hat over her bobbed black hair which by the date was made just this morning. \u201cWe apologize for the heat; our air conditioning broke this morning. Two seats for the\u2026 lovebirds? Right this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi giggled merrily as Kyle sighed, feeling like his arm was nearly breaking as Jessi practically jogged after the waitress. Kyle was mortified as she ushered them to a tiny booth, Jessi not giving him a chance to protest as she hip checked him in first, quickly following him and nearly smashing him against the wall. Kyle moaned as she half sat on his lap, half sat \u201cin\u201d the booth, her butt so big and the booth so small that her hips and butt still stuck out of it.</span></div></div>",

Lisa stared in open mouth disgust as Jessi went red in embarrassment, before remembering that she now had a boyfriend who \u201cdidn\u2019t mind\u201d\u2026 FRRAAAPPPPTTT!!! Kyle cringed as he was forced to feel the noxious air flow over his hand and arm once again, this time the hot air also assaulted his leg and lap out the bottom of the skirt. \u201cI\u2019ll like, just have one of everything on the menu! What about you, KyKy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress, doing her best to ignore the smell wafting from Jessi, looked at Kyle with an \u201cis she serious?\u201d expression. All Kyle could do was smile apologetically. \u201cJessi, how are you going to pay for all of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hehe, no worries! GramGram gave me billions when she passed away, and having such a cozy apartment means I can use it all on food and clothes and just like, stuff! PRRAPTT! Hehe, \u2018scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have a pound of king crab then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had been about 2 seconds from telling this disgusting behemoth and her boy-toy to piss off just to get away from the smell, but upon hearing about her inheritance, she seemed willing to put up with it in hopes of a sizeable tip. \u201cWell Ma\u2019am, our policy is to pre-charge for such\u2026 \u201cexpansive\u201d orders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okeydokey! PRRAPT!\u201d She ground her ass all over Kyle\u2019s lap as she reached for her credit card, which consequentially released all of the stink that had stayed trapped in her cheeks, subjecting both Kyle and Lisa to an especially raunchy plume of gas as she handed over her card. Lisa quickly ran away, leaving Kyle to wish he had such a luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned, holding her breath as best she could as she handed over the bill, she promised the food would be out right away as it was prepared, apparently just as Jessi had hoped. Jessi barely even looked at the bill that was hundreds upon hundreds of dollars, quickly writing in a tip and signing before putting the bill at the far end of the table until the end of the meal. \u201cIs 3 dollars too much for a tip? I never know what to give them. FRRRAAAPPPTTT!!!\u201d Kyle felt bad for the waitress but stayed silent, not up to trying to explain to Jessi why 3 dollars was not only not too much, but nowhere near enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi happily bounced, shifted, and grinded Kyle\u2019s lap and arm as she waited, Kyle doing his best to enjoy this \u201cdate\u201d. It wasn\u2019t as if some part of him didn\u2019t enjoy the grinding, but that part of him was mostly overpowered by his nose hairs burning and getting his hand a lap air blasted with butt gas. \u201cHehehe, I like, totally loooove seafood! The doctor says I\u2019m like intolerant to it, but that\u2019s what he says about dairy too, and all that does is make me need to go to the bathroom a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to cry at this point, trying once again to pull out his arm and only getting a SSPPPRRRAAASSSHHHTT!!! in response as the waitress brought out Kyle\u2019s king crab and Jessi\u2019s first few orders. It was slow going for Kyle trying to eat the crab with only one free hand, but Jessi dove into the garlic butter-dripping shrimp, crab, and lobster face and chest first. Chewing blatantly with her mouth open and smearing her face with the dripping butter, she also managed to dribble bits of half chewed food particles and even more butter all over her cleavage, even staining her already tortured shirt. As she tore into plate after plate, Kyle could only stare in sick awe as Jessi talked continuously, spraying him with almost as much food particles as her breasts and face. Eating so fast, Jessi soon started having gas out of both ends now, and of course she always seemed to be turned to talk to Kyle just as she ripped a massive\u2014BBRRROOOPPPPTT!!! \u2013belch, followed quickly by chain after chain of farts. SSPPPRRROOOOPPPTTT!!! SPPPRRRAAAAASSHHHHTTTT!!! BBBUUURRRRRPPPP!!! FFFFRRRRRPPPTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of Jessi\u2019s hours-long binge, Kyle was mortified to find that though her farts were getting less loud (even as her belches got louder), they were becoming much hotter, and even\u2026 wetter. BRRROMMPP!!! FFssssstttttpoppopflrt... \"Oooh, KyKy, my tummy like\u2026 really hurts\u2026\u201d Kyle yanked and tugged again in panic, but was still unsuccessful at pulling out his arm. \u201cOooh\u2026 KyKy, sorry, tickling isn\u2019t a good thing right now\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d SsppppprrrssshhhhsssSPLARSH!!! \u201cOopsie\u2026 Need to go potty.\u201d Kyle could definitely confirm this as to his disgust, he could feel shit from her shart splattered in between his fingers, causing him to fight both hurling and crying as she scooted out of the seat and dragged him jostling and jiggling with her to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowing him into the girls\u2019 bathroom, Jessi paused at the first of three stalls, just noticing that Kyle was still with her, surprise knocking loose another juicier shart. SSPPLOORRT!!! \u201cKyKy, what are you\u2026? I mean, like, after this morning\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re still like, okay with coming in here with me?\u201d Kyle opened his mouth to finally explain the real reason why he\u2019d been \u201cfeeling up\u201d her ass all day, but wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u201cOhmygoshyou\u2019rethebesteverIcan\u2019tbelieveI\u2019msoliketotallylucky!!! Hehehe! I absolutely hate using public bathrooms normally, it\u2019s so weird, but with you here for me I won\u2019t hold back!!!\u201d SSPPPPRRRAAAASSSHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly remembering her urgent business, Jessi turned and shimmied her ass into the small cubicle, pushing Kyle with her ass until he was standing next to the toilet, trapped by her bulk. With surprising ease, Jessi yanked down her skirt, her ass exploding out of its shoddy prison. Happily this released Kyle\u2019s arm, but he could have done without the shart spray that coated a good portion of it. Luckily he could just barely reach the toilet paper around Jessi, and spent his time trapped getting as much off of it as he could as Jessi wiggled her ass onto the seat with a sweaty squish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFRRRAAAAPPPPTTT!!! SSPPPRRRROOMMMFFFTTT!!! FFFFRRRRSSSHHHHHHTTTT!!! Jessi sighed in relief and bent forward slightly, both releasing the stench and showing off her jiggly, stinky ass in all its glory and giving Kyle no escape. Like a car accident, Kyle couldn\u2019t look away even as he nearly hurled in disgust as Jessi pushed. A sick crackling noise could be heard as Kyle watched the biggest log he had ever seen snake its way out from Jessi\u2019s bulbous cheeks, showing no signs of stopping as it hit the water and started coiling around the bowl. Like some sick anaconda, the log continued to coil round and round, filling the bowl more and more until it was running out of room. Luckily, with one last giant push and a SSSSPPPPRRRAAAAAPPPPPPTTTTT!!! Jessi squeezed off the log and scooted forward to start wiping, the end of the log actually sticking up out of the overfull toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was forced to endure the smell as well as the sight of the log and her ass, not being able to tear his eyes away from her \u201cmagnetic\u201d butt as she prepared to wipe. Taking up the rest of the toilet paper in the cubicle in a giant wad, Kyle was at least happy that it was all over as he added the toilet paper he had used on his arm onto the massive log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahhh, that\u2019s like, soooo much better. I\u2019m glad that was all though, usually I\u2014Oooh\u2026 \u2018Spoke to soon.\u201d Kyle at first was mortified that she could minimize her massive log with a \u201cthat was all\u201d, and even more-so as she suddenly got up, tossed the unused toilet paper on the floor, and grabbed his hand, pushing him into the next stall as she shimmied her way in and trapped him once again. \u201cI\u2019m like, soooo glad you\u2019re here, KyKy! Usually I\u2019d be like so totally embarrassed about this. Hehehe. SSSPPPLLLOOOORRRPPPPTTTT!!! \u2018Scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle plugged his nose the best he could as Jessi bent to show off her ass once again. He almost regretted plugging his nose as Jessi pushed again, this time pushing out slimy logs and turds that spurted out and splashed into the toilet bowl like a slow machine gun, the smell so strong and pungent that with his nose plugged he could practically taste it. Sickly water back-splashed out of the toilet and sprinkled the back of it, more than a few splashes getting onto Kyle\u2019s shoes he had so recently avoided getting dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the splashes turned to sickening plops as the water was overpowered by the mucky waste, and with no signs of stopping, Jessi continued to inhumanly expel the slimy shit, more of it than any human should be able to produce at one time. Kyle watched in horror as the toilet started to fill up once again, Jessi only stopping as the toilet was filled to overflowing. Kyle sighed in relief too early, as Jessi pushed one last time with a mighty mmmphhhPPRRRAAAASSSHHHHHTTTT!!! A giant wad of the sickly shit blasted into the bowl like a comet, splattering slimy spatter all over the back of the toilet and right onto the bottom of Kyle\u2019s pants and all over his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I dunno what the docs are talking about; it only gave me a little bit of upset stomach!\u201d Yanking the entire roll off the spool once again, Jessi was reaching back to wipe her brown/green stained cheeks when both her and Kyle heard an ominous rumble. \u201cUmm\u2026 Hehehe\u2026 I guess we might want to move to that last stall, KyKy.\u201d Kyle tried to protest as yet again Jessi through the entire unused roll in a tangled wad on the floor, to desperate to listen to his please as she shoved him into the last stall, her now very dirty ass chasing him in. Kyle tried to get her to let him pass, but she heard none of it. \u201cSorry, KyKy, I like, totally need to concentrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle despaired at yet another horrible situation he had gotten in with this girl, and it only got worse. After tensing and pushing a few times to no avail, Jessi started doubling over more and more with each push, each time pushing harder and harder with no results. Kyle had finally forced himself to look somewhere, anywhere else, but after a few moments he looked ahead, hopeful that it was all a false alarm, only to see Jessi bent so fart over that her ass was now off the toilet and pointing straight at him!!! \u201cNo, Jessi, don\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSPPPPPLLLOOOOORTTTTSSSSHHHHHHHPPLAAAFFFTTTPPRRROMMFFFF!!! Kyle was subjected to one of the worst sights and experiences imaginable as Jessi blasted diarrhea in every direction behind her, covering the entire toilet and Kyle\u2019s front from his chest down, turning the red and black of his clothes a sickly brown and making the floor and wall slick with her filth. SSSPPPPRRRAAAAPPPPSSSSSHHHHHTTTTTSPPRROMMMFFFPRrrroommptsshhhhhhSPLORTSPRAFT!!!&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final massive trumpeting, Jessi put one last coating of diarrhea green onto everything, sighing in more than obvious relief as she started to wipe, once again pulling out the entire roll to Kyle\u2019s diarrhea covered dismay. Using every bit of the massive wad to wipe up her even more massive dirty ass, Jessi soon let the mess fall into the toilet, her butt mostly clean as she flushed and the toilet clogged and started overflowing from the toilet paper alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around with a contented giggle, Jessi startled at seeing the state of Kyle\u2019s clothes, but only for a moment. \u201cOopsie, hehehe, I guess that\u2019s the danger of escorting me into a bathroom. But that\u2019s what makes you so awesome KyKy! Don\u2019t worry, like I said, we can go shopping sometime soon and I can replace any other clothes that happens too!\u201d Kyle once again nearly threw up thinking about all the ways his clothes would most likely be ruined with this girl, but convinced himself that at least her shit wasn\u2019t on his face and hair this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was left more than a little stunned as Jessi proceeded to pull up her skirt with a few mighty yanks all on her own, which essentially meant Kyle had been put through this for no reason in the first place. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go home! After a big meal like that I think a nap\u2019ll be perfect! And of course\u2026 you\u2019re umm\u2026 you\u2019refreetojoinme!\u201d Blushing profusely, Jessi grabbed Kyle\u2019s hand and led him out of the restaurant, with Kyle dragging dejectedly behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t so damn cute\u2026\u201d Kyle mumbled to himself, though he knew that if he had taken all of this already and not left, there was little chance of him escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 maybe I should have like, given our waitress 4 dollars for a tip\u2026 Oh well, I\u2019ll give her more next time! PPPRRAAAPPPTTT!!! \u2018Scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, their waiter, Lisa, dejectedly cleaned up the disaster area that was their table. \u201cThat disgusting behemoth gets billions and spends hundreds here and I get 3 dollars\u2026 3 dollars!!! God, I am so spitting in her boyfriend\u2019s food if they ever come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking her train of revenge, her manager called from the back room, saying there was a costumer complaint about the ladies\u2019 room. With an angry sigh, Lisa grabbed the plunger from the supply closet. \u201cNo doubt that huge pig plugged up one of the toilets like she was in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Lisa found when she entered was a complete war zone. Shit was everywhere, toilet water was flowing all over the floor, and toilet paper was unrolled and tossed everywhere as well. The smell hit her so hard she nearly passed out, her anger and disgust growing to a brand new height. \u201cScratch spitting in his food, I\u2019m shitting all over it and calling it special sauce\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A New Arrival: Part 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessi and Kyle arrived home, he immediately changed out of yet another bunch of ruined clothes into a simple blue button-up shirt and a pair of faded jeans, washing his shoes to the best of his abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking if he could use Jessi\u2019s internet, Kyle used her bright pink laptop while she took her nap (only barely able to resist her puppy-dog face as she fell asleep with him on the corner of the mattress), Kyle attempted to find a job, ANY job. Sure, he couldn\u2019t go so far as to run out on Jessi completely, but maybe if he could get a job and get another apartment, he could see more of Jessi\u2019s cute side and less of her disgusting parts\u2026 Ignoring the large Jessi + Kyle with a heart around it that was Jessi\u2019s desktop picture (which she must have put in before they had even actually met), Kyle frustratingly searched and sent off a few resumes. With most summer jobs already filled and any others scouting for openings that wouldn\u2019t happen for months out, he didn\u2019t expect much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of resignation, Kyle thought about getting a nap himself, but wasn\u2019t given much of a choice as Jessi suddenly yanked him from behind and snuggled him like a teddy bear once again; a contented smile painted on her sleeping face. Jessi continued to sleep, but Kyle received none, getting another smothering from Jessi\u2019s sweat and leftover food-smeared body. When she finally woke up, he was just glad that her sleep had been apparently dreamless and it hadn\u2019t been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yawn.* \u201cHey, KyKy, decided to join me after all, huh? Hehehe, well thank you, that was like, the best nap ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulled himself away from her with a forced smile, a squelch of suction from Jessi\u2019s sweaty body almost sticking him to her. \u201cSo hey, I was like, wondering if you might want to go to the gym with me? They just opened nearby, and I absolutely looove it there! Hehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle almost agreed, but bit his tongue hard. Jessi had already proven her \u201ctalent\u201d at making an otherwise normal time completely shitty (in both senses of the word), what would happen if he went with her to a place where people were already supposed to be sweaty and disgusting? \u201cUmm\u2026 well, you know I\u2019d love to, but\u2026 I\u2019m actually still pretty tired; exciting day and everything, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAawww, so you really liked our date, even with the pit-stop? Hehehe, you\u2019re the best KyKy!!! Alrighty, I\u2019ll let you relax, and I\u2019ll go work up a sweat!\u201d Kyle couldn\u2019t help but sigh as she both took what he said the wrong way AND gave him a disgusting image of an even sweatier version of her working out. He was just glad she hadn\u2019t begged him to go, which he didn\u2019t know if he could resist twice in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by an audible squishing and squelching sound as Jessi grabbed seemingly well used (and still dirty) gym clothes and stuff them into a backpack. \u201cLast time I was there, someone asked me if I wash my clothes like, once a month! Hehehe, can you imagine? Of course not! I mean, if you take in clean stuff every couple of months, you don\u2019t have to worry about your clothes being too dirty!\u201d Kyle was floored, but quickly realized he shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Happy he had dodged the bullet at least this time, Kyle waved goodbye to Jessi as she jiggled out the door, the backpack full to bursting with \u201cclean\u201d clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping back onto the internet once Jessi was gone, Kyle was excited to see that he had received a reply for a job opening! Immediately calling the number in the e-mail, he was quickly set up with an interview; they had even agreed to see him in just an hour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there was no way he could go in his now wrinkled and sweat/food stained clothes, Kyle went to grab his backpack\u2026 only to find it wasn\u2019t there. Assuming it had been buried in one of the many piles of dirty clothes, Kyle systematically worked his way through the mess, holding his nose and cleaning as best he could as he went. Not having any clothes bins (besides the dreaded garbage can that no doubt was even more disgusting by now), Kyle did his best to make semi-neat organized piles by color and if they were delicates or not (he fought both the urge to blush and hurl as he grabbed each of the overly used panties and bras). By the end of it, Kyle was proud of how much cleaner the room looked, but crestfallen at a realization\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi had taken his backpack, and he only had about a half an hour until his interview!!! He could only hope that her \u201cclean\u201d gym clothes hadn\u2019t completely soaked all of his, and that he could find Jessi quick enough to still make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he knew of the gym she had been talking about, and with an uneventful sprint, Kyle arrived making good time. Running into the large gym, he tried his best to look for Jessi. After looking into multiple weight rooms, tracks, and basketball courts, Kyle still had had no luck; but he was starting to think that was a good thing. More than a few women were working hard in the rooms he peaked his head into, from skinny to chubby to downright fat, and all of them were drenched in sweat and filling the rooms with a strong smell of BO. If more normal girls were working up this much of a sweat/stink, what would it be like to see Jessi actually working out?! Not to mention if she spotted him, there was no chance she would let him leave without joining her\u2026<br>\r\nWith a sigh and only 20 minutes to go until his interview, Kyle made a bold decision. She had talked about bringing clothes in every couple of months, which meant she must have a locker so\u2026 He would have to sneak in and find it. Normally he would never do something so brazen, but after getting smothered, gassed, and above all shit on multiple times, there wasn\u2019t much a guy wouldn\u2019t be willing to do to get out of that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing every ounce of stealth (and courage) he could muster, Kyle watched for an opening and when the coast was clear he quickly made his way inside. With a sigh of relief, Kyle found that the stars had aligned and the locker room of this apparently very busy gym was completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, Kyle began to look into row upon row of lockers, hoping that the same luck that had left the locker room deserted would lead him to Jessi\u2019s. But after looking into a dozen rows of lockers, and seeing (and smelling) more than his fair share of used gym clothes and attire, Kyle was still no closer to getting his backpack back. With only 10 minutes left until his interview, he needed to cut down his search area. Suddenly spying a member\u2019s only reserve section, Kyle made his way over to the slightly large lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a few of them were unlocked (and you hoped with Jessi\u2019s obliviousness she wouldn\u2019t think to get a lock). Though most were fairly clean, many had discarded gym clothes that must have been sitting for a while now, the smell nearly bowling him over each time he opened one of these lucky \u201ccontainers\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the last locker in this row, Kyle nearly hurled. The clothes inside were so disgusting they were practically decaying, all of them completely worn out and raunchy with BO and sweat. Kyle was about to slam it shut, when he suddenly heard someone enter the locker room. \u201cI know working out is good for ze body, but why must it be so tiring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking upon hearing the European accent he can\u2019t quite place at the thought of being caught in a women\u2019s locker room like this, Kyle did the only thing he can think of. Turning, he bends and shimmies himself into the waist high locker, pressing himself to the back of the locker and pulling his knees to his chest, slamming the door behind him. Kyle can hardly move an inch in his dank hiding spot, the smell almost as bad as Jessi\u2019s \u201cdirty clothes bin\u201d. As what must be days old sweat starts seeping through his clothes, Kyle is thankful for the small air vent slits at his eye level, letting him see out and giving him fresh air in the otherwise solid locker, no matter how little. Wishing he had been cooler under pressure and moved to a less disgusting locker, Kyle looked out as best he could through the slits, and saw the woman who had interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beautiful, to say the least. Red hair in long red curls cascaded down her shoulders, framing an almost regal face with silver eyes. She carried herself almost like royalty, and she definitely had a body to carry. Her breasts were large to say the least, bouncing hypnotically in a sweat-drenched green sports bra, cleavage showing out of the top wiggling with every shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest sloped into a relatively tiny waist, her abs chiseled and her skin tan. A pair of black stretchy workout shorts adorned her explosive backside, finishing out the extreme hourglass shape of her otherwise toned body. It was obvious that she tanned and worked out quite often, though her breasts and bum seemed to be immune to any calorie burning she did. Though her assets were smaller than Jessi\u2019s (and whose weren\u2019t?), since she appeared to be Kyle\u2019s height, the extreme transition from the wide points of her hourglass to the toned parts of her body made them look enormous.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle fought the urge to drool as this European beauty walked closer, giving him a wonderful profile from his covert position. His eyes grew wider as she stopped right in front of the locker he was in, and nearly exploded out of his head as she bent down to untie her shoes, her cleavage bobbing and weaving in front of his face. Mouth wide open, Kyle only stopped staring when she suddenly opened the locker he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle froze, unsure of what to do. He was sure she had seen him, but apparently was wrong as she tossed her shoes and socks in without looking and slammed the door again. Kyle sighed in utter relief, but soon was assaulted by one of the rankest foot odors he had ever bared witness to. The shoes had plopped next to his feet, foot stink wafting up out of them like some sick overpowering air freshener. He had been so shocked at her opening the locker, that he hadn\u2019t noticed one of her crew-cut workout socks had plastered itself on his shoulder, and the other was soaking his hair. In disgust he tried to move to get them off, but found he couldn\u2019t move his arms enough. Wiggling, he only succeeded in causing the sock on his head to slowly slide down his face, before thankfully falling on top of the shoes, its pair still sitting on his shoulder and drenching his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kyle was soon distracted as the red-headed bombshell wiggled her butt at the locker, yanking down (with some amount of effort) the small workout shorts. Kyle stared in disbelief as her butt seemed to jump out at him and get even bigger, her perfectly tanned cheeks doing their best to devour a tiny pair of white lace panties. Before he could think how odd this was to wear to work out, Kyle was given another heart attack as the woman opened the locker once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle closed his eyes and braced himself for being found, but instead he only got slapped in the face with a sopping wet article of clothing before she shut him in again. At first the suffocating feeling of having a sweat-soaked pair of shorts plastered to his face was the worst; that is until the smell of both horribly fresh BO and rank ass nearly burned his nose off. Flailing like mad, he still managed to get some of the butt sweat in his mouth before the shorts finally peeled off and fell away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes cleared from the burning salt of this woman\u2019s ass sweat, Kyle\u2019s vision cleared just in time for a perfect view of said ass leaning towards the locker vents. Kyle\u2019s eyes grew wider the more her bum cheeks spread, until with a squeak of sweaty flesh on metal, her ass sealed off the vents, giving Kyle not much else to look at except her lace covered crack. \u201cAnd of course, all zese men, zey drool over moi from afar, only to get cold feet once zey realize how sweaty and bad smelling I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could understand why as the smell of ass crack and sweat only grew in his hiding place. \u201cI mean, I did not even pass gas very much out zere today!\u201d Kyle felt dread wash over him before suddenly\u2026 PPPHHHHRRRRAAAASSSHHHHHTTTTT!!! \u201cAahh\u2026 Oui, zat is what zey should have to put up with to be with someone as beautiful as moi.\u201d FFFRRRRRPPPPTTTTTSssssssssssssprrrrooop\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was sent reeling as the gas sprayed him continuously at point blank, her ass sealing off any fresh air and forcing him to breathe the rank stuff and listen to her talk to herself. BLLOOOORRRSSSHHHTTT!!! \u201cMy father always said zat I would never get a man if I did not learn to control my \u2018bad habits\u2019, but he does not know what he speaks of! Someday soon, I shall find a man who will know how much my beauty is worth. He will put up with any level of nastiness because my beauty and allure shall overpower all else!\u201d PPPPRRRAAAAPPPTTTTTPPPRRRRROOOMMMMFFFFpppreeeeeeeen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly hurled as he thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter if she was the most beautiful and alluring being on earth, if she smelled this bad everyone would run away. He wasn\u2019t even sure how he was still conscious as her horrible gas continued to fill his hiding-spot-turned-prison. When she leans forward, Kyle can practically taste the clean air just on the other side of the vent. Nearly plastering his lips and nose to the slits, he took deep breaths, only to suck in hard as she pushed her but out one last time with perfect aim before\u2026 PPPLLOOOORRSSSSHHHHPPRRROROOOMMMMTTTTBBBRRRRRRAAAAAPPPPPTTTTFFLLLLLrrrrrrrrrtprr ttpromp\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle recoiled as he coughed and choked, his nose melting off and his tongue dying in his mouth as the woman seemed to finally notice his presence. \u201cWhat in ze hell? Who are you? What\u2026 what are you doing in zere?\u201d Even in this horrendous situation, Kyle had to fight distraction as the woman was required to bend over slightly to see him over her breasts, swaying like fleshy pendulums. It even almost made him forget the smell that thankfully was slowly dissipating with the locker door now open\u2026 Almost. \u201cNo doubt you are here to admire my magnificent beauty\u2026 But, as is always the case with you shallow men, you will not be able to put up with even a single one of my\u2026 \u2018habits\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtracting himself with some amount of effort from the locker, Kyle stood up in front of the woman, nearly hitting his head on her jiggling pair in the process. Though he was definitely in a compromising position, Kyle couldn\u2019t help but feel indignant at being looked down upon by this royal wannabe, and his mouth opened of its own accord. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had to put up with quite enough, actually. I was just trying to find something so I could get to a job interview, and now I\u2019ve not only had to put up with you tossing your completely sweat-soaked gym clothes all over me, including your shorts to my face, but also a horrible barrage of your completely disgusting farts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him in confusion, Kyle himself shocked into silence at his own outburst. After a more than awkward pause, the woman spoke up. \u201cSo\u2026 You hid in my locker, with all of my old gym clothes\u2026 then let moi throw my dirty gym clothes on you, and my shorts right on your face\u2026 and you sat in silence as I passed wind all over you, all with you only getting just a glimpse of my beauty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Well, I guess you could put it that way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was thinking now might be a good time to run, when the silver-eyed woman suddenly burst into a genuine, yet still somehow regal, smile. \u201cFinally, I have found someone who appreciates what one needs to go through to be around someone as beautiful as moi!\u201d Kyle could only stand and blink in bewilderment. Had he somehow complimented this girl with his outburst? \u201cYou have earned an introduction. I am Alexia, heir to the multi-billion dollar Rothswei family business. Zough I require most men to address me as Miss Rothswei, I believe I shall make an exception for you; you may address me as Alexia. And what might your name be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was still slightly dumbfounded as Alexia gave her introduction, seeming to not only not mind being in front of him in just her sports bra and panties, but enjoying his internal struggle to keep from staring. \u201cUmm\u2026 *Cough.* Nice to meet you\u2026 I suppose\u2026 I\u2019m Kyle\u2026 not really the heir to anything I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Alexia had apparently barely allowed him to call her by her first name, she held no such regard for his. \u201cHaha, well Ky, zat is fine. Ze higher class men will never understand what my beauty is worth as you do.\u201d Attempting to ignore yet another woman over-simplifying his already simple name, Kyle still didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on at this point. From what he could tell, this woman, though absolutely disgusting, somehow thought that because she was beautiful (this fact could not be denied) that men should have to put up with any disgusting thing she could dish out in order to be with her. \u201cSo, now zat you have earned even a glimpse of my true beauty, you will no doubt wish to court me, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eye twitched. What was it with him lately and disgusting chicks thinking he wanted to date them? Still, Alexia had taken finding him in the women\u2019s locker room surprisingly well, and he didn\u2019t want to tick her off\u2026 \u2018Best to let her down easy. \u201cWell, Alexia, I would love to\u2026 I mean you are absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately I don\u2019t think my girlfriend would appreciate that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, you are already spoken for? \u2026\u201d Alexia\u2019s face became crestfallen, but only for a moment as happy realization washed over it. \u201cBut you still could not resist me, oui? So zis just means zat I must convince you to leave zis woman for moi! I shall not stop until you realize how much you are wasting yourself on her! Hahaha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grimaced, the feeling of dread he was getting a lot lately creeping up his spine with a vengeance. \u201cAlexia, that\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was unable to finish his sentence as the locker room doors opened, more than a few women\u2019s voices being heard as they entered and made their way towards Alexia and his location. Kyle nearly panicked again, but Alexia just smiled. \u201cHaha, you need to get out of here unseen, no? I can help you hide while you wait for ze \u2018all clear\u2019, if you are willing to help me, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle definitely didn\u2019t like the direction this was going, but had no choice other than jumping back into Alexia\u2019s locker. A nod of dejected acceptance set Alexia smiling and laughing, grabbing what looked like a sort of business outfit from her nearby gym bag before tossing the bag into her locker and grabbing his hand. \u201cZis will also give me some time to\u2026 entice you, no? Haha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle startled as Alexia squeezed his arm to her side, making sure to turn his palm a press it to her completely drenched side boob before dragging him off into the shower area, pulling Kyle along with her into a reserved member\u2019s only shower stall\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle was more than slightly apprehensive as Alexia dragged him into the private shower stall. As she pulled him inside behind her, he couldn\u2019t help but think the semi-small space was most likely not made for two people. Slightly smaller than a handicap bathroom stall, Alexia\u2019s BO stench quickly chased out any fresh air. Trying not to gag, Kyle was suddenly struck by how attractive this girl was in spite of himself. If he wasn\u2019t already \u201cdating\u201d Jessi, and of course if Alexia wasn\u2019t giving her a run for her money on the grossness scale, Kyle would have at least made a pass at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his eyes wandered back up to Alexia\u2019s, he was faced with a very large smirk. \u201cDo you like what you see? Zere is much more where zis comes from, you know. Hahaha. You will wait for moi to take a shower, oui?\u201d Kyle is about to object but is left speechless and in awe as Alexia hands him her change of clothes and proceeds to yank her sports bra off with a lot of jostling, wiggling and jiggling, before her breasts explode with sudden freedom like two gigantic bowling balls, so perky they might as well be filled with helium. Of course, this isn\u2019t lost on Alexia, who, after tossing her bra onto Kyle\u2019s head with her continuously growing smirk, proceeds to turn around and start wiggling her ass out of her tiny lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle once again received a good taste of Alexia\u2019s sweat before the bra shifted off of his face and ended up as a necklace. A very sweaty, smelly necklace. With her ass halfway out of the tiny panties, Kyle finally snapped out of his stupor, not wanting this to get any more out of hand. Of course he didn\u2019t mind what he was seeing\u2026 But that thought was overruled by his \u201cloyalty\u201d to Jessi, and, more accurately, the horror of having yet another disgusting girl making advances on him. In a panic, he blurted out the first thing that came to mind to stop her, though as usual he wished he hadn\u2019t a moment later. \u201cNO! I mean, umm\u2026 You don\u2019t need a show\u2014er\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia blinked at him for a moment in surprise and confusion as Kyle fought the urge to try and grab the words out of the air, but the moment was much too short as a huge smile erupted on her face. \u201cI can not believe I ever doubted you! To zink at first I zought you were just like all ozer men! Of course I don\u2019t need to shower; I am beautiful even after a workout, even zough I am drenched from head to toe with ze sweat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spent a bit too much time with Jessi, Kyle braced for a very sweaty glomp, but it never came. Instead, Alexia\u2019s trademark smirk re-emerged, her arms crossed under her ample bosom and purposefully squishing the orbs together and pushing them up right in front of him. \u201cStill enjoying ze show, I see. But I am afraid zat if you want to get out of here, I must put on my suit, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t be happier. The her stink was definitely becoming overpowering at this point, and she really DID in fact badly need a shower, he had somehow avoided what had seemed inevitable moments ago. \u201cOf course, you did promise to help me, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling of dread that was becoming a constant part of his life started creeping up his back again, though it was more than slightly muffled by the sight of Alexia giggling, sending her twosome jiggling and wiggling. \u201cUmm\u2026 Yeah, what did you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shall assist me in dressing! It is a high honor, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sweatdropped. There were so many ways this could go wrong. But it wasn\u2019t like he had another way to get out of, by the sounds of it, the increasingly populated locker room, and it wasn\u2019t like he wouldn\u2019t enjoy it at all\u2026 \u201cAlright\u2026 How do you want me to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will put everything on me, of course.\u201d This seemed like completely dressing her instead of assisting, but again he wasn\u2019t in a position to complain too much as Alexia tapped her foot and shifted her hips impatiently, causing her breasts to jump, slap, and collide. Kyle barely caught himself before he was drooling once again as he set the pile of clothes on a nearby bench, so nervous he could barely acknowledge the sports bra still soaking his shirt around his neck or the sock festering on his shoulder, let alone take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he needed to cover up Alexia\u2019s biggest distractions, so he grabbed a lacy bra that seemed to be the pair to her panties, sweat stains on the otherwise white fabric from previous use not being missed by him. As he turned with the relatively tiny undergarment, Alexia seemed somewhat disappointed in his choice, and to his dismay waved him off. \u201cI am willing to allow you to continue gazing upon my exposed beauty, as a gift for you pointing out how I obviously do not need a shower.\u201d Kyle was left regretting this once again, but at the same time the view WAS amazing. \u201cGrab my leggings first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle cringed slightly at the thought of being around her sweaty feet, but this needed to be done so he could get out of here and try to get another interview. He grabbed the thin veils of fabric, just as Alexia butt bombed onto the bench next to him, splashing more than a bit of butt sweat on him and her \u201cclean\u201d clothes. He forced himself to ignore this, moving to kneel in front of her to reach her feet. The smell was just as horrible as he had expected, if not worse, and he could barely even look at her feet without gagging due to the globs of toejam in between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up for a moment, he could barely see Alexia\u2019s face past her bulging pair, and she was\u2026 blushing? Suddenly noticing his stare, Alexia immediately turned her nose up at him (a nose he couldn\u2019t help notice was packed with more than a few boogers). \u201cI\u2014I have never had someone actually kneel before my beauty. I am very glad to have you know zat it is deserved.\u201d Kyle could only stare in disbelief at her sketchy logic, which Alexia read as admiration as her blush grew ever so slightly. \u201cConcentrate on what you are doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kyle could think of how cute someone who was otherwise so regal could be as he started pulling on one of the leggings, his face was suddenly assaulted by her free foot. He reeled as she rubbed the horrible smelling, toejam-ridden object all over his face. \u201cZere, now you will have somezing to admire, no? Even after a full day in ze gym, my toes are still beautiful enough for zis, oui? Hahaha.\u201d Kyle wanted to yell at her, but as he opened his mouth, Alexia took this moment to shove her toes in, rubbing toejam and sweat all over his tongue as she wiggled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle fought both the urge to hurl and the urge to bite of her toes to get away, knowing he needed her to get out. Trying to ignore the gross spectacle (and failing miserably), he pulled up the first legging, his long arms barely able to reach and attach the garters to her underwear. He nearly weeped with joy when Alexia reluctantly pulled her toes out with an audible POP, but the moment was fleeting as he started on the next legging only to have her rub her now covered foot all over his face, the thin veil of fabric doing nothing to cover up the stench and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was finished, Kyle wanted to take every person who had a foot fetish and admit them to an insane asylum. The taste of her toejam still wouldn\u2019t get out of his mouth, but at least Alexia seemed to be pleased. Making an extra effort to mash and jiggle her breasts as she got up and leaned to look down at his handiwork, Alexia\u2019s cleavage squiggling and clapping in front of Kyle as he tried to reach for the next article of clothing; a bra. Succeeding in blindly grabbing for it, Kyle quickly stood up and stepped away, happy to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia seemed reluctant to be done with her \u201centicing\u201d, and stalled a bit more, putting on a pair of heels that Kyle wondered how she could even walk in. The view again made his mind and heart race, the nastiness a moment ago almost forgotten at the sight of her standing in gartered leggings and underwear, heels, and\u2026 nothing else. He was so enthralled, he almost missed Alexia putting out her arms so he could slip the bra over them. He stopped as he got to her breasts, expecting her to take over from there, but no dice. \u201cWhat are you doing? You must hitch it in ze back!\u201d Kyle sighed and made to move around behind her to do so, but she quickly stepped back in front of him. \u201cOf course, I would not want you to forget ze beautiful view you are no doubt falling for, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at her questioningly, but before he knew it, she had pushed him down and against the wall. He had just enough time to see a huge pair of breasts only partially covered by a bra surging towards his face before he was engulfed in completely sweat-soaked flesh. Kyle panicked and tried to get away, which only dug his face deeper into the grimey cleavage. Switching tactics, he grabbed Alexia\u2019s hips and tried to push her away, but she apparently hadn\u2019t been working out for nothing and easily continued smothering him, laughing all the while as he was nearly drowning in a sweat waterfall. \u201c*Squelch\u2014squelch\u2014smack---squish* Haha, I am sorry about ze sweat, but it is worth it, no? Do not worry, I shall allow you to enjoy until you get ze bra attached.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly cried as Alexia was having the time of her life smothering his face against the wall of the shower-stall, jiggling and wiggling back and forth, up and down all over his face. Knowing what he had to do to get out, he quickly groped her back for her bra straps, causing a few appreciative moans from Alexia as she understood this as a back massage. Nearly running out of air and choking on both sweat and boob flesh, Kyle struggled valiantly to get the much too small bra to clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alexia\u2019s bra creaked and moaned with every shift of her body, her twin orbs overflowing the tiny garment every which-way. He couldn\u2019t help but be glad as Alexia grabbed her cream-colored suit top and put it on, no dress shirt apparently required. Kyle was starting to admire how easily Alexia could make him forget something disgusting she had just put him through, as his eyes were glued to vision in front of him, her still bottomless form nearly bursting out of her top, her bra clearly showing through the puckering between her screaming buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I shall make sure ze coast is clear, zen we shall go, oui?\u201d Kyle stared in disbelief as she turned to walk out, her mammoth butt jiggling and shaking, the garters of her leggings having pulled down her panties slightly a showing off more than a small amount of butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Alexia\u2026 I think you\u2019re forgetting\u2026 your pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia quickly turned around with a massive smirk, clearly catching him as he tried to look back up from her ass without her noticing. \u201cHaha, I was starting to zink zat you were no longer looking down zere! I am glad I was mistaken.\u201d A wink showed that he had fallen into some sort of trap, though Kyle had to admit that at least part of him thought it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you will help me with my skirt, no?\u201d Turning to emphasize the request, she teasingly wiggled her hips back and forth, her cheeks jiggling like mad as almost half her crack seemed to be showing now, leaving Kyle only able to nod absentmindedly in response. Alexia smiled broadly, pleased enough in her success to actually grab the skirt and hand it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the skirt knocked Kyle out of his stupor (though her shimmying ass still in his field of vision, it was definitely distracting). The thing might have been meant to go down to near the knee-line, but that would have been on a much smaller girl. Looking at the cream-colored fabric and then to her ass and back again and again, Kyle wasn\u2019t even sure this would cover her ass all the way, and that was if he could even get it on. He at least needed to try though, if he ever wanted to get out of here and get yet another much needed shower. Bending down, he let Alexia step back into the skirt, and was starting to pull it up when he looked forward just in time for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPRRRAAAAAAASSSSSSSSHHHHHTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reeled, his face having been right next to Alexia\u2019s mammoth butt when she let \u2018er rip. \u201cHaha, oops! It is a good thing you have already experienced zat \u2018bad habit\u2019. Of course, you have shown zat any of my habits are worth it, oui?\u201d Kyle could only stare in disbelief as he recovered; how could something so sexy be so foil at the same time? \u201cNormally I would not zink a man would be worthy, but\u2026 Ky, you are welcome to a closer look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was about to assure her he was fine, but before he could Alexia bent and shoved out her ass, her panties moving down just enough to engulf his face in her crack as she pinned him against the wall once again. Kyle immediately dropped the skirt as his face was eaten by Alexia\u2019s dirty, smelly crack, which she just read as him wanting to make the moment last. \u201cSee? I am sure I am much better zan your current girlfriend. Ze choice is obvious, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle responded by trying to push her off, anything to escape this literally crappy hell, with similar results as before. This time, however, Alexia actually seemed to see it for what it was: him trying to get away. \u201cOh, playing, how you say, \u2018hard to get\u2019, no? Zat is fine, I never back down from a challenge!\u201d Kyle is left crying as Alexia ground her butt even harder against the wall, driving his nose and mouth rub against her deepest reaches, including her dirty hole, which sent her moaning and shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSPPPPPPPPRRRRRROOOOOOPPPPPTTTTT!!! SSSSSSPPPLLLOOOOOOORRRRSSSSHHHH!!! PPPPRRRRAAAAAASSSSHPPPPTTTTPRRRRROOOOOSSSSSHTTTSSSSPPRRREEEEEENNNPPPOOOMP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had nothing to breathe but the sickest farts since Jessi, Alexia seeming to think he was somehow still enjoying this, her ass\u2019 desirability \u201cobviously\u201d overpowering any grossness it was producing. \u201cMmm, Ky, is it heaven for you? What am I saying, of course it is! No man has ever been so close to moi, you should feel greatly honored!\u201d SSSPPPPRRRRRRAAAAAAAAFFFTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Kyle was feeling at the moment was sick as Alexia \u201chugged\u201d his face with her blubbery buns, squeezing them again and again in between wigges and grinds, making it almost impossible for him to concentrate on grabbing her skirt and pulling it up again. He was getting a little lightheaded from breathing farts, and he was gagging on butt sweat that was forcing its way into his mouth with every squeeze of Alexia\u2019s cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPRRRRROOOOOMMMPPPTTT!!! *Squish, squelch.* FFFFRRRRRAAAAAPPPPTTTT!!! *Squlech, splat.* PPPRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMFFFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexia was starting to really get into the face grinding, moaning a bit louder now and visibly shivering, Kyle was tugging on her skirt for his life. Having, with a lot of difficulty, gotten it up over her thighs, he switched his grip and tried to get it up onto the bottom of her cheeks. Feeling my success and not wanting this to end, Alexia seemed to double her efforts, doubling over and actually booty clapping now, nearly knocking poor Kyle out with the beating he was receiving from her most dirty asset. \u201cYou do not have to hurry, Ky. I do not have to be anywhere anytime soon. SSSPPPRRTT!!! Oooh\u2026 I feel my second wind coming on, but I am sure you will hardly notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly lost all hope at this. \u201cSecond\u201d wind? This was more like her fifth or sixth, and she didn\u2019t seem even close to stopping! SSPPPRRSSSSHHHHTTT!!! Kyle screamed as he was hit with an excessively wet fart, which just sounded like a moan to Alexia as he tugged and tugged, only getting an inch or two up her butt cheeks before he snagged on his chin, not able to get up any farther even if her buns cooperated. His being stuck wasn\u2019t lost on Alexia, who continued to pummel him, now sure he would be there for a while as her farts kept getting wetter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSSPSPPPPLLLLLOOOORRRSSSSHHHH!!! SSSSSLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMPPPTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was about ready to give up. What could he do? Suddenly, a flashback of being under Jessi\u2019s ass during her \u201csleep shitting\u201d came to mind. He DID NOT want that to happen again! With renewed vigor, Kyle again began tugging and twisting, lifting harder and harder. There had to be a way! Soon, his efforts seemed to be working as he could feel the fabric more against his chin and less of her mobility of her jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSPPPRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFTTTEEEEEEEEEEMMMMFFFFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo close! So\u2026 Close\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSSSPPPPRRRROMMMFFTT!!! FFFRRRAAASSSSSSHHHTTT! SSSSLOOOOOOORRRPPPPTTTSSHSSSSHHHpprrreeeeeeennn\u2026 SPLAT SPROSHT SPLIRT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed down Kyle\u2019s face as he literally lifted Alexia away from him with a mighty shove that pulled her skirt up to cover at least most of her crack, or at least the tears would have if they weren\u2019t blocked by the diarrhea that had just been plastered all over his face from the series of Alexia\u2019s sharts. He tried his best to wipe it off, but what wasn\u2019t just rubbed in oozed down and stained into his shirt and Alexia\u2019s sock and bra still on his shoulder and around his neck as Alexia turned around, somewhat disappointed but still apparently pleased with his success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, I did not mean to show you zat habit quite yet, but as you are still here\u2026 You are just as much ze man as I was zinking! I must have you as my own, girlfriend or not. I will not rest until you are mine!\u201d Kyle just wanted to crawl into a hole and die as Alexia picked up a previously used towel that was sitting sopping wet on the floor and tossed it at him. Normally Kyle would puke at the thought of using a gym towel someone else had used, but with shit all over his face once again, it couldn\u2019t get much worse. He wiped off as much as he could, only keeping from yelling at her because he still needed her to get out, when she suddenly grabbed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I wish we could keep going, it is good you finished when you did. I believe ze other women left when you started to get your close-up view of my derriere, they may come back at any time.\u201d Kyle screamed internally, so he had just gotten shit on, AGAIN, for no reason?! He took a deep breath the yell at her, but before he got it out, she was dragging him through the locker room towards the exit. \u201cI am\u2026 glad you came in here today. Your girlfriend is not worthy of your admiration, you will see!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The \u201cDate\u201d: Ferris Wheel Go!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle still felt disgusting as Alexia dragged him along, but once again she seemed to have a knack for being able to make him \u201cforget\u201d nasty things she had put him through with her body. Currently, the distraction she was causing was simply from him being behind her as she walked. As regal as ever, Alexia strutted in her high heels more forcefully than any soldier yet more gracefully than any supermodel, her epic hips slamming and shifting from side to side with each step. He was so distracted, it took him a while to realize that he still had her sock and bra on him, immediately causing his skin to crawl as he tossed them away as discreetly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle knew better than to think her behind was without flaws of course (no doubt it was still disgusting as ever), but he couldn\u2019t help drooling again at the sight of it, more than a fair share of her lacey panties and butt cleavage jiggling and wiggling in full view out of the top of the tiny cream business skirt. He soaked in the view, hoping against hope to put all the disgusting memories behind him, only half listening and mumbling responses as Alexia asked him about how he had ended up in the locker room. Of course, the sexy moment could only last for so long before all the shifting and slamming of her hips seemed to \u201cwake the beast inside her\u201d, and before Kyle knew it, every clack of her heels was accentuated by a fart, all of which of course wafted right into his face as she dragged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLACK.* Prrrfft\u2026 *CLACK.* Plaartp\u2026 *CLACK.* PLAAAPPTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Jessi, who seemed to realize passing gas at least warranted an \u201cexcuse me\u201d now and again, Alexia didn\u2019t even seem to pay attention to the gas, which was essentially flowing out of her ass, in the slightest. As Kyle was subjected to her horrible farts once again, he couldn\u2019t help but think that Alexia would just say it was worth the view. \u201cI am, how you say\u2026 parched. We can continue on our date in a moment.\u201d Kyle could only sigh, dreading the fact that he was apparently going on a date with Alexia whether he liked it or not. As they made their way to an outdoor food stand, Kyle extricated himself from her and sat a nearby table, glad to at least get a little fresh air while she got her drink. He contemplated running away, but with how much Alexia worked out, and how sure she was even in her heels, he didn\u2019t doubt she could catch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked up to him, Kyle was surprised to see a bucket sized cola in her hands. When Alexia arrived at the table, she quickly took off the lid and tossed the straw. \u201cI hate straws, they are zo\u2026 low class.\u201d Kyle could only watch in amazement as Alexia lifted the bucket to her lips and chugged the cola until over a quarter of the bucket had been emptied, not spilling even a drop. Kyle could almost see the cola churning in her stomach as it pushed against her business top, which would no doubt cause him trouble later. Trying to distract himself, Kyle started up some small-talk, which Alexia quickly steered to Jessi and his relationship, how they had met, and why he was staying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZo, you are currently unemployed, and cannot support yourself until you have obtained a job? It is little wonder you have been trapped so by\u2026 \u2018Zat Woman\u2019.\u201d Kyle couldn\u2019t help but sweatdrop at this. Though Jessi had indeed been his last resort, Alexia seemed to think that Jessi had somehow tricked him and was holding him against his will (which was only partially true in a twisted sense), and as such refused to even speak her name. \u201cWell, if zis is ze case, you must move in with moi. You shall never have to worry about employment ever again, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thank you Alexia, but I already live with Jessi, and I really just want to support myself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! I will not take no for an answer! I have told you, I will have you as mine no matter what it takes\u2026 In point of fact, give your identification to moi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed, not having a clue where this was going, but giving her his ID in order to avoid an argument. In an instant, she took a picture of the ID with her phone, handed it back to him, and moved to sit down. Kyle was happy for this, having felt weird talking up to her this whole time\u2026 That was until she sat directly on his lap, making herself at home and happily grinding his crotch. The feeling definitely wasn\u2019t unpleasant besides the amount of weight she was squishing him with, at least until she started passing gas again, her having stopped while they were talking and her chugging of the cola only causing the farts to ring out louder and smellier. SSSPPPLLLLALAAAAARRRRPPPPTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t help but blush as nearby people began looking around for the source of the noise, before reeling from the horrible smell. Alexia seemed to pay them no mind however, just letting out another PPPPRRRAAAAAFFFFFSSSSHHHH!!! That pretty much guaranteed everyone knew it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia seemed to be preoccupied with dialing someone, continuing to grind her butt into him as she blasted fart after fart nonstop as she talked\u2026 \u201cOf course zis is Miss Rothswei, are you a new secretary, or just incompetent?\u201d FFRRRAAASSSHHHTTT!!! *Grindgrind.* \u201c \u2026 Yes, yes, I have no time for your apologies. Use ze ID I have just sent you and our connections to ensure zat zis man is not hired by any paying business.\u201d PPPLLOOOORRRTTT!!! *Squishswivel.* \u201c\u2026 No! Zis man is of ze highest caliber, and I will not have anyone zay otherwise! Do not slander his name, only pay off any company that receives an application.\u201d GRRRAAAAFFFFTTT!!! *Griiiiiind.* \u201c\u2026 Yes, yes, goodbye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Alexia was so into the grinding that Kyle was almost as embarrassed by it as he was by the farts that everyone was staring at them for. He was so distracted that he almost missed what had happened in the phone conversation. But\u2026 had he just heard correctly? \u201cAlexia\u2026 Wh-what did you just do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I force you to stay with zis woman, you will no doubt realize very quickly zat it would be much better to be with me, oui? And zis way, when you do become mine, you will be able to give me ze undivided attention you know above all others zat I deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t even respond as Alexia actually started to bounce a little, apparently being less regal the more turned on she was, even as she picked up the bucket again and proceeded to chug more and more of it, with no signs of stopping, and still not spilling one drop. SSSPPPPRRRAAASSSSHHHHTTT!!! It seemed that no matter what he did, fate had conspired to stick him with the worst situations (not to mention the most gross), and now it seemed that there was absolutely no way out for him except being a homeless bum on the street. SSSSSPPPRRRAAAAPPPTTTT!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought stuck in his mind for a few moments, punctuated by Alexia\u2019s epic rips that seemed to come in time to every bounce, but quickly faded. Even if he COULD tear Jessi\u2019s feelings apart enough to just leave to go live on the streets, no doubt Alexia would pick him up (see also: kidnap him), and he\u2019d be stuck in a just as bad, if not even worse situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was it then. At the very least, for now, there was no way out\u2026 Kyle could only look on and blush some more as Alexia\u2019s stomach pushed her business suit up as it filled to the brim with cola, a horrible gurgling sound greeting him from the ever more exposed tummy as she finished with a SSSPPPPRRRRROOOOMMMPPPPTTTT!!! Kyle\u2019s eyes were watering and his head was spinning as the worst gas so far enveloped them both, anybody who hadn\u2019t already left quickly running away as Alexia slowly ground the stench into his crotch. Most people belched after chugging a soda, but apparently the fuller Alexia\u2019s usually toned tummy was, the more farts were pushed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorribly embarrassed, Kyle decided to take it one step at a time, deciding that for now, he at least needed to get away from Alexia before she did something even more drastic, and the only way to do that was to go on some sort of date with her. Looking around franticly, he spotted a nearby attraction he thought might be perfect, and before he knew it, HE had lifted Alexia off of him and now HE was dragging Alexia around by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, he was amazed to see Alexia blushing. \u201cKy\u2026 Does zis mean\u2026 Have you chosen me?\u201d SSPPPRRROOOMMPPPFFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing his best not to roll his eyes at the leap of logic he was getting used to both girls having, and glad that he wasn\u2019t down-wind of THAT particular outburst, Kyle did his best to force a smile. He had to be careful with this, otherwise who knew what kind of measures Alexia would take with her \u201cconnections\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be leaving Jessi\u2026\u201d As Alexia frowned at the mention of her name, he quickly continued. \u201cAt\u2014At least for right now. But in the meantime, we might as well have that date, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia seemed to be on the verge of borating Kyle, but upon him actually saying he\u2019d go on a date with her, she immediately perked up. \u201cWell of course! I was just\u2026 deciding where to go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t help but suddenly realize how cute Alexia could actually be when she was being defensive\u2014PPRAAAFFTT!!! Shaking the thought off, Kyle continued dragging her to his goal: the nearby Ferris wheel. Sure, being stuck in a small booth with Alexia might not be his best idea, but one trip to the top and back could count as a date and he could make a quick escape afterwards\u2026 At least that\u2019s what he was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he marched her up the ramp to the Ferris wheel that fortunately didn\u2019t seem to have a line, Alexia seemed suddenly unsure about this date. \u201cKy\u2026 where are we going? Surely not on\u2026 zat contraption?!\u201d SSsssppprrrsssht\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle looked back at her, only to see Alexia staring towards the top of the wheel, noting the fact that she was sweating completely through her business suit, even more-so than before, if that was possible, and her farts even seemed to be less boisterous (though no less smelly). \u201cAlexia? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 Are you afraid of heights?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia almost instantly snapped out of whatever funk she had just been in, a scowl (and a hint of a blush) crossing her face. \u201cA member of the Rothswei family line, afraid?! N-never!\u201d With that, Alexia practically marched into the next booth that came around, all but throwing the attendant out of the way as she made her way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle apologized to the attendant before he joined her, helping him right himself. \u201cSorry about that, she\u2019s well\u2026 she\u2019s a handful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant just smiled, not insulted in the slightest, a \u201cknowing\u201d smile crossing his face, the fact that he was stoned more than bit obvious. \u201cNo worries, Man! You know those red-heads, they\u2019re like, total firecrackers, Man! Don\u2019t get too freaky in there, alright? I gotta clean the booths up afterwards!\u201d After enduring 4 or 5 over-exaggerated winks, Kyle made his way into the booth before helping the attendant close the doors behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ferris wheel seemed fairly normal, the booths big enough to fit four people with a bench on two sides, doors on one, and windows in every direction. Kyle had expected Alexia to be sitting in on one of the benches, but instead, he found her standing almost perfectly in the center booth, and by the looks of things, if when Kyle pulled her up the ramp she was releasing a river of sweat, she was now releasing a tsunami. Kyle didn\u2019t even know business attire could soak up that much sweat, but it had become a different shade of cream all together, especially under the armpits, with large splotchy lines around her cleavage and especially down the seam of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexia, what are you\u2014\u201c Kyle was interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream and a horrendously wet fart as the ferris wheel suddenly jerked to life. SSSPPPLLOOOORRSSSTTT!!! Before he knew it, Alexia had lunged at him, and in the next instant, he was barely able to keep on his feet as he found himself holding Alexia princess style, her arms clinging around his neck for dear life. \u201cOof, Alexia\u2026 what\u2026? If you\u2019re that afraid of heights, you could have just told me\u2026\u201d PPPLLLAAAARRRFFFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia glared at Kyle, though a rosy blush told him that he was right. \u201cI told you before, a Rothswei is not afraid of anything! I just\u2026 I just thought zat you should hold me like the princess zat I am! Zat is all! Zis is what you do on a date, oui? Do not act like you do not like it.\u201d A \u201cknowing\u201d smirk crossed Alexia\u2019s face as she wiggled herself against him, rubbing her horribly sweaty body into him, her sweat-soaked skirt only acting as a screen for her farts and making them smell even worse. It was all Kyle could do not to just let his arms give out and drop her. SSSPPPRRRAAASSSHHT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wheel stopped to let passengers into the next booth (the jolt leading to another ear-shattering scream, choking squeeze, and spluttering fart), Alexia seemed to calm down slightly, though still refused to look out the windows. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s just sit down, okay?\u201d Reluctantly, Alexia allowed Kyle to put her down, before taking a seat himself and patting the seat next to him. Unfortunately, before Alexia could sit down, the ride started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle flinched and closed his eyes when Alexia screeched even louder than before, opening his eyes just in time to get the biggest face-full of boobs since Jessi. With a horrible SLAP-SQUUEELCCH!!! Her fully exposed cleavage slapped into his face, before her chiseled arms wrapped around his head and buried his face into the deepest point of her canyon, nearly suffocating him and only wrapping her arms tighter with every second. Though this should have been at least slightly enjoyable, Kyle was nearly hurling as what little air he had to breathe was completely saturated with Alexia\u2019s sweat and BO, a potent mixture so strong that it actually rivaled (if not somehow actually surpassed) Jessi\u2019s ever-constant funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, Alexia\u2019s equally strong legs wrapped around his waist, her excessively expansive behind burying his lap as a wave of farts blasted all over it. SSPPPLOOOORRSSSHHH\u2026 PPPRRRAAAFFFTTT!!! PFFFLOOOORRTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried to calm Alexia down, tried to talk to her, but she didn\u2019t seem like she was going to be letting go anytime soon. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not scared! I just\u2026 I just thought zat you might be longing to touch my assets once again. Zat you might be getting how you say\u2026 \u201clove sick\u201d! Yes, zat is it! You ARE such a naughty boy, after all, Ky! But do not worry, your princess knows how much you enjoy it, it is worth an ocean of sweat, oui? Hahaha.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if that had been the case (which it definitely wasn\u2019t, as Kyle\u2019s near suffocation on BO and sweat attested to), the horrifically warm air that was no doubt eating through his pants as it wafted out from under her buns was definitely enough to make it \u201cnot worth it\u201d, especially as the smell mixed with her BO and sweat until the whole car began to smell like a \u201cfresh\u201d version of her gym locker. Kyle thrashed and tried to escape, but Alexia easily overpowered him as the ride started to move again, no doubt half scared and half thinking Kyle was having the time of his life. Who wouldn\u2019t put up with a bit of BO, sweat, and a fart or two to be this close to such a beauty as her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \u201ccouple\u201d continued their snuggle-fest, the Ferris Wheel seemed to be fully loaded and was now slowly ascending, swaying back and forth as it went. Alexia\u2019s grip seemed to loosen ever so slightly as the booth continued to sway back and forth\u2026 back and forth\u2026 back and forth\u2026 Her stomach let out another borrible gurgle, the cola and whatever else was inside it no doubt churning up a storm. \u201cKy\u2026 I\u2026 I do not feel so\u2014\u201c BBRRROOOOOOOOOPPPPP!!! Alexia finally ripped a humongous, guttural belch. Of course, Kyle had picked the point just before the belch to take advantage of Alexia\u2019s loosening grip and poked his head out of her cleavage right into the full blast. Alexia just smiled, no doubt thinking of how wonderous of a time it must have been for Kyle between her breasts, even as he was forced to \u201ccatch his breath\u201d from being smothered with burp air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Kyle continued to be forced to smell her BO, sweat, farts, and now her horrible burps, Alexia\u2019s grip seemed to loosen more and more as the ride swayed up higher and higher, until she practically jumped off his lap as they got towards the top, moving once again towards the center of the booth. \u201cOoooh\u2026 Ky\u2026 why is ze world spinning? I do not\u2026 BBRRRRAAAAAPPPP!!! SSSPLLOOOORRRSSSH!!! \u2013feel so well at all\u2026\u201d Kyle of course was blasted with both another huge belch before she got up, and an equally large fart as she turned and got off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only shake his head in disbelief at his luck (and in an attempt clear his head of the dual odors). She was horrified of heights AND she got motion sickness this easily? He was beginning to think this was his worst choice since going to the gym in the first place. Still\u2026 he had dragged Alexia on here\u2026 With a sigh, Kyle got up and stood beside Alexia, reaching out a hand and touching her shoulder to steady her. In the next instant, Alexia had swooned and he had caught her in an awkward hug, her arms wrapped around his waist as well. \u201cKy\u2026 I zink I\u2026 I zink\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was about to ask her if she was okay, but he never got the chance to say it. One second, her almost completely exposed stomach was letting out another horribly strained gurgle, the next second, the next second, her face became VERY green, and finally, her mouth was open and she was tossing her cookies everywhere\u2026 or more to the point, all down the front of Kyle. As Kyle reeled, he ended up slipping on some of the puke, twisting and falling onto the floor, the impact probably being the only thing keeping him from losing his lunch as well. When the pain passed and he opened his eyes, Alexia at least seemed to be done.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it was how he had fallen, or if she was still stumbling from the motion sickness, Kyle didn\u2019t know, but somehow she was no standing with her feet on either side of his head, giving Kyle a glorious view up her skirt at her lacy panties (or at least whatever of it wasn\u2019t currently being eaten by her sweat-drooling ass crack). The \u201cwonderful\u201d moment was quickly ruined by another interruption by Alexia\u2019s butt. SSSPPPLLLLAAAARRRSSSSHHHH!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, you know, trying to hug me when I am getting sick is not something a normal man would do\u2026 But you are not a normal man, and zat is why I must have you. Do you not understand yet? Do you still need more convincing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle just sighed, just wanting to keep the rest of the ride uneventful as possible, not even really having the motivation to get up at this point. \u201cJust\u2026 Why don\u2019t you sit down, Alexia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia bent and did her best to look down at him past her mammoth tits (which she had to push down with her arms to get the right angle. Her face seemed almost insulted for an instant, but then quickly changed to a sultry glee that horrified Kyle. \u201cOooh, I see, I see. So zat is ze kind of convincing you need, oui?\u201d Kyle didn\u2019t understand what she meant, but a sense of dread washed over him. But, as often seemed to be the case when this dreadful feeling visited him, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was practically paralyzed as he watch Alexia hike up her skirt and completely expose her ass except for her lacey panties. Even this \u201ccoverage\u201d was negated as she wrenched her panties out of her ass crack with a *STRETCHSQQUUUUEEELLLCCCHcchhh\u2026* the panties falling with a sweat-soaked SLAP onto his chest before she kicked them away. Kyle finally snapped out of his stupor and tried to sit up, only to have Alexia squat, her butt cheeks separating with perfect timing for him to bury his face in her ass. \u201cOoo\u2026 mmm\u2026 You are eager, oui? I have what my father zays is my \u201cworst habit\u201d, especially when I am not feeling well\u2026 But I am sure zat you will zink the \u201cview\u201d is worth it, oui?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSPPPPRRRAASSSSSHHHHHTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly hurled as he pulled his head of her cheeks with a sickening popping sound, but this didn\u2019t last long as Alexia sat the rest of the way down on his face, her ass engulfing him again and burying him even deeper. SSSPPPLLLLOOOORRRRSSSHHHH!!! SSSSLLLLLLLRRRRSSSSHHHHH SSSSPPPPPPPRRRRAAASSSSHHHHTTTT PPPRRRROOOOOLLLLSSSHHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was in yet another living hell as Alexia swiveled her hips all over his face, the sweat and ass grime smearing all over him the least of his problems as she released fart after fart, each wetter and more disgusting than the last, setting the bar again and again. \u201cMmm\u2026 PPOOOOOORRRTTPPPpreeeeeeeennnn\u2026 You are enjoying being zis close to my derriere, oui? I would not do zis for any other man, no one else understands how much my beauty is worth. Oooh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia seemed to really be enjoying this as she practically ground Kyle\u2019s face to a pulp, her farts still getting worse and worse every moment until the ride seemed to be slowing to a halt. PPPRRRAAAPPPTT!!! \u201cOooh\u2026 It seems ze ride is over Ky\u2026 We will have to continue zis some other time. I am sure you will not need much time to choose moi over that woman.\u201d Kyle was finally given the chance for some \u201cfresh\u201d air as Alexia VERY slowly got up, seeming to take her time and enjoy the experience, clenching her cheeks to make sure his head came with her as far as it could before gravity finally won out and he flopped back onto the floor. SSSLLLLLRRRRSSSHHHHTTTTPRAPT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia leaned down again, moving her jugs to look at Kyle. \u201cZis was\u2026 very fun. And remember, a Rothswei is not afraid of anything. Hahaha. Do not worry about giving me your contact information, I already had my people send zem to me.\u201d Kyle just tried to catch his breath as she walked forward enough so that he could sit up, her standing legs still on either side of his. Kyle just wanted to get out, get away, but in his dazed state, his chivalrous nature kicked in as the doors opened, Alexia seeming about to walk out with her panties still off and her skirt still hiked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexia, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia smirked as she looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cOh? Did you not have enough? Hahaha. Of course not. You know my true beauty\u2019s value, after all.\u201d Sticking her butt into Kyle\u2019s face once again, she wiggled it in front of him mesmerizingly until\u2026 PPLLOOOOOOOOROOOOORRRRRTTTSSSSHHHHHHSPLAAAATTT!!! PPPREEEEEEESSSSHHHHHHHAAARRRRPPPPTTTT!!!! BLLLLOOOOOOOORRRSSSSSHHHHHPPRRAAAAMMMPTTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was blasted once again by horrendous gas, but this time it was accompanied by blasts upon blasts of shit. Alexia continued to jiggle her ass, brownish green sludge being flung all over Kyle\u2019s face, chest, and the rest of her body. By the time she was done, he was coated in the stuff, along with a good portion of the booth around/behind him. Alexia looked back at him as Kyle coughed and gagged, only a small hint of surprise even glinting in her eyes. \u201cDo not say anything; I know what you want to say. It was definitely worth it, oui? Hahaha. You may\u2026 keep my underwear\u2026 As a reminder. I will zee you soon.\u201d And with a wink as she pulled down her skirt, Alexia marched out, handing $1,000 dollars in hundred dollar bills to the ride attendant as she strode by. \u201cFor ze mess,\u201d was all she said, smiling cheerily as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026 like, thanks, Man!!! One more trip around for, like, everybody! I guess that guy really got lucky, huh?\u201d The attendant was so happy with his \u201cgood fortune\u201d, he didn\u2019t even check on the mess (or Kyle for that matter), and to Kyle\u2019s horror, the doors shut with him inside for another trip, trapped covered in sweat, puke, and shit, the booth filled with farts and BO besides, his only solace a sweat drenched, fart stained pair of panties\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle almost lost his own stomach contents multiple times on his \u201cfree\u201d trip back up and down the ferris wheel. It didn\u2019t help at all that the only relatively \u201cclean\u201d thing he had to wipe off at least a little of the filth that was on him was Alexia\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d, her sopping wet panties, still dripping with sweat and reeking of farts. But when compared to the sweat, puke, and shitty sludge all over him, well\u2026 It was still dry heave inducing, but at least he could get some of the shit off his face and out of his hair, though all attempts to get the stuff off his shirt and pants just smeared it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ride finally let him off, Kyle stormed out into the fresh air, throwing the now shit-stained panties at the attendant\u2019s feet as he flew by. \u201cWhooaa dude\u2026 I told you man, you gotta watch out for those red-heads, they can be into some freaky stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ignored the man (and the dozens of other disgusted stares and jeers) and made the long walk back to the apartment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he made it up the six flights of stairs (the elevator STILL out of order), Kyle\u2019s own sweat mixing with the god awful mess on his shirt was waking up the horrendous smells all over again. Sighing, he walked to the apartment, glad at least that it would be clean, for now, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Kyle opened the door, he was in for a VERY rude awakening. Time stood still as the door swung open, atrociously disgusting air practically pushing him back. The room was completely trashed. Clothes were everywhere, the \u201cdirty clothes bin\u201d even having been emptied and the contents strewn about, and last, but certainly not least, Jessi\u2019s VERY dirty, completely exposed ass was sticking up in the air right at him and jiggling from side to side, Jessi\u2019s upper body sticking under the end of the bed, from what little Kyle could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you are KyKy! I\u2019ve been waiting for, like, ever! Do you think you could help me? I\u2019m kinda\u2026 well\u2026 I think I might be stuck. Hehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t even think at this point. He was so disgusted, so frustrated, so\u2026 trapped, that there was nothing he could do but help her. Unfortunately, in his stupor, when Kyle stepped forward, he missed the thick layer of liquid shit on the floor. In the blink of an eye, he was slipping and falling forward, until he had buried his face deep into Jessi\u2019s shit-smeared ass crack, his face now filthy once again. \u201cAaawww, hehehe, I missed you too! And we can definitely snuggle, but I think we should, like, get me out of here first. Hehehe. And you\u2019re making my butt tickle.\u201d SSSPPPLLLLLOOOOORRRRRRSSSHHHHSSSPPPLLLAAAATTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s mind nearly shut down completely as his face was blasted with a splash of Jessi\u2019s sludge that even managed to get onto his shirt, mixing into a revitalizing Alexia\u2019s shit and puke. It\u2019s funny how the mind works in situations like this, how it tries to escape, cling to anything except what was happening right then. Instead of thinking how he was trapped with Jessi, how even if he escaped he would be stuck with Alexia, or how he was covered in shit from both girls, all Kyle could think was; \u201cHow and why the hell is she stuck under the bed?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She hummed a tune as she walked (or at least attempted to, her pitch so off that most people could hardly recognize notes), a huge smile plastered over her entire face.  \u201cHow could life get like, any better?!  I\u2019ve got my first ever &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; boyfriend, and he\u2019s the most perfectest thing evers!!!  Hehehe!\u201d  She received a few looks for talking so loud and to herself, but got more than that just from her appearance, not that she would ever notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly cute ducky-shirt hadn\u2019t gotten any better since she left the apartment, in fact it was decidedly worse.  The tear had only grown with every couple of steps, and now that she was out in the blazing sun again, she had completely sweated through the material once more.  Now completely smeared and stained with both food &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; sweat, the shirt had also shrank quite a bit due to the wetness, and not only showed off her nipples through the thin fabric but slid up to show off the pudge of her tummy and hold her breasts like an over-used sports bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was nothing compared to her skirt (also completely soaked in sweat).  The tiny thing allowed her humongous bum to spill both out the top and the bottom, and did even less to keep in the smell of the complete swamp that was her ass, let alone the almost constant barrage of\u2014PPPHHRRRAAAAPPPPPTTTT!!!  \u201cHehe, \u2018scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it didn\u2019t take long for people to start crossing the street to avoid this very smelly (albeit beautiful) behemoth of a girl, and those who were too taken up in the over-exposure of her assets were quickly shown the errors of their ways.  But as usual, Jessi was completely unaware of everyone else.  Why should she care anyway?  She had a more than loving boyfriend, who accepted her for &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; she was, why would she need anything else?  \u201cHehehe, I mean, he\u2019s sooooo- SSPPPRRRLLLTTT! \u2013cute!  And handsome\u2026  And hot-\u201d  Jessi\u2019s skin quickly turned pink remembering Kyle in his boxers, not to mention when he was only in his towel\u2026  She suddenly startled out of her revere, wiping off a stream of drool from her chin that had dribbled into her cleavage before she continued on her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!  Naughty!  Anyways\u2026 SSpppplllrrrfffftttt\u2014PRAPT!!! I mean, he\u2019s just so like, totally awesome!  He let me sit with him\u2026  He cuddled with me all night\u2026  He took me out to eat\u2026  And he was even with me when I went potty a few times!!!\u201d  If Kyle had been there, he may have had a few choice corrections, but he was currently \u201ccontinuing a nap\u201d he no doubt deserved.  Jessi had been a little disappointed that he hadn\u2019t been up for coming with her, but it was alright, she\u2019d just have to make up for the lost time later! PPPPHHHRRRAAASSSTTT!!!<br>\r\nBy the time Jessi had made it to the gym, she was making multiple squelching sounds from multiple places on her body, be it from her shoes now sopping wet with sweat, her breasts as they jiggled and slapped together, or her ass cheeks as they clapped and jostled with every step; all only adding to the \u201cmusic\u201d of her body that included her horrendously out-of-tune humming and of course her farts.  Jessi walked in with her smile re-plastered on her face, and practically a skip (or at the very least a violent jiggle) in her step. <br>\r\nAlthough not everyone in the gym smelled like roses, Jessi was in a league of her own, stench billowing out from her as she made her way to the locker rooms.  She walked into a room almost completely packed with mostly smiling women in many stages of mid-dress, some even just gossiping happily.  But mere seconds after entering many of the locker room lurkers were no longer smiling--  SSSSSPPPPRRRAAASSSSHHHHTTTT!!!  SSSPPPLLLOOOORORRRRSSSSHHHHH!!! \u201c\u2019Scuse me. Hehe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the smell of her BO wasn\u2019t enough to fill the air with stink that overpowered all else, Jessi\u2019s farts definitely did the trick.  Many of the room\u2019s occupants visibly turned green as the smell washed over everything, quickly filling the room with her nauxious cloud.  The more opinionated of the women immediately wanted to know who was the cause for this stench and to deal with the problem one way or another\u2026  Of course, when they saw how much of a behemoth Jessi was (an intimidating fact for those who didn\u2019t know her), people generally decided it was best to avoid her than confront her, especially when an especially raunchy and wet-sounding fart ripped from her buns\u2026 SSSPPPREEEEESSSHPPPRRRAAAAPPPTTTTTPpllluuuuurrrrfffftttBLURP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, even the hardiest of gym-goers were sent running for the hills, half-naked or not, leaving Jessi completely alone with her stink.  \u201cHmmm, I wonder why everyone was in such a hurry all of a sudden?  SPPRRPPPTT!  I always seem to get here just, like, when everyone else is leaving!\u201d  Jessi continued beaming her trademark smile as she made her way past the \u201cReserved Only\u201d section and to the very back corner of the locker room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough almost the entire locker room was claimed, the occupied lockers thinned out more and more as Jessi got closer to her destination, until a noticeable (by all but Jessi herself) barrier of un-occupied lockers could be seen on all sides of one locker in particular\u2026 Jessi\u2019s.  A practically visible stench was seeping from every vent of the abhorrent \u201cholding cell\u201d, the smell so overpowering that it was seeping out of most of the lockers around it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jessi paid this no mind, continuing to hum to herself as she reached the locker and bent down (her ass now even more exposed in the process) and opened the latch.  \u201cI keep meaning to get like, one of those cool spinny locky thingies, but I forgot again\u2026 Oh well, no one has stolen anything yet, so it must be okay! Hehe!\u201d  With a flick of her finger, the locker door flew open as if she had just loosed some horrible demon, clothes that had been trapped unwashed for who-knows-how-long pouring out onto the floor like some sick lumpy sludge.<br>\r\nJessi looked on with her mouth agape in horror.  \u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 gosh\u2026  My locker\u2019s like\u2026 almost totally full already!  I might have to start another one\u2026  I mean, I\u2019m sure there are only like\u2026 10 or 15 outfits in here, and I\u2019ve only worn each of them like, a couple dozen times!\u201d  It was a sad fact that anyone who actually knew Jessi would be more surprised that she actually knew what a dozen was than that she was horrified of her locker for the completely wrong reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much jostling, jiggling, squelching, sweating, and farting, Jessi eventually managed to shove all of her clothes back into the locker, even being able to add all the clothes from her bag, at least until she got to Kyle\u2019s stuff.  \u201cOh my gosh, it\u2019s like, sooo totally nice that he let me use his bag like that!  Hehehe, he\u2019s soooo awesome!\u201d  Slinging the backpack with Kyle\u2019s remaining wearable clothes (by some miracle not too horribly worse for the wear) onto her shoulders, she started to walk back out of the gym to return Kyle\u2019s backpack before she suddenly realized she hadn\u2019t actually done what she\u2019d come here to do\u2026  \u201cHmmmm-- SSPPPLLLRRRRPPPPTTT!!!  --mmm\u2026  I guess me pushing those clothes back into the locker can count as my workout\u2026  Anyway, I want to get back to KyKy!  But\u2026 PPPHHLLLRRTTT! I suppose I should like, still grab my after workout victory snacky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo no small relief of everyone in the gym, Jessi quickly made her way out of the front doors, though most knew better than to enter the locker room for at least 15 minutes (if not an hour or two).  Quickly turning towards the strip of food-shops that had conveniently popped up right next to the gym, Jessi wiggled and wobbled her way to the nearest  (and her favorite) ice cream shop, \u201cGut-Bustin\u2019 Debbie\u2019s\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie, the owner of the establishment, was an all around normal woman now in her 30\u2019s (more on the upper side than she\u2019d like to admit).  Her stick-straight dishwater-blonde hair went down to an only modest pair of breasts, and though her waist and hips had become decidedly less modest over the years, she still considered herself quite a looker.  Her noteworthy southern drawl and all around fantastic hospitality had ensured her little niche of an ice cream parlor had become quite popular and self-sufficient, but that wasn\u2019t her only secret\u2026<br>\r\nAlthough the shop had originally been known simply as \u201cDebbie\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor\u201d, it had quickly earned the \u201cGut-Bustin\u2019\u201d moniker due to its seemingly impossible food challenge.  It consisted of a scoop of every flavor in the store (all 27 of them), even an extra-large scoop of the dreaded pride and joy of the shop, Debbie\u2019s own Triple-Choco-Caramel-Cookie Dough-Swirl, with one hour to eat every last scoop.  The challenge required a bet of $100, with a promise of doubling said bet if completed, and even allowed for up to 3 contestants to team up, if you made the bet triple or nothing.  Of course, most people immediately scoffed at the deposit, but Debbie had been able to swindle countless boys by getting them to try to show off, even groups of girls just coming off of a failed workout routine at the nearby gym.  And to this day, even if all 26 other flavors were polished off, no one was ever able to finish even the one scoop of  \u201cT-Triple C-D Swirl\u201d.  Well, &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; no one.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay everyone; store\u2019s closed!  Everyone else out!\u201d  There were a few grumbles from patrons that had just sat down, but Debbie knew it was only a matter of time until they had their own reasons to leave\u2014SSPLLLAAARRRPPPTT!!!  \u201cSpeak of the devil.  Hahaha.\u201d  It was only a few moments before everyone had cleared out, Debbie quickly locking the door behind them and flipping the open sign to \u201cclosed\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Darlin\u2019, how\u2019s my little girl been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi giggled uproarishly as she sat with a horribly audible squelch, her butt all but devouring the poor chair.  \u201cI\u2019m great Debbie!  Actually, I\u2019m like, more than great!\u201d  SPPPRRAASSSHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people would be hacking and gagging by now from Jessi\u2019s BO alone, but Debbie had spent almost her entire childhood around cows and pigs, and although she definitely didn\u2019t &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; Jessi\u2019s stench, she could handle it a lot better than most.  \u201cI could tell, Darlin\u2019!  Seems like my little girl\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s been since the first time she marched herself in this here shop!\u201d  Debbie couldn\u2019t help but smile thinking back on that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it had been more than a rude awakening to have a huge girl who was as much of a slob as Jessi walk into your eating establishment out of the blue, and even more so when she had taken the Gut-Bustin\u2019 Challenge and beat it without even breaking a sweat. But although Jessi had misunderstood the rules and paid her the Triple-or-Nothing rate of $300, she not only let her keep the $600 Debbie would have owed,  but paid &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; $300 for &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; \u201cGut-Bustin\u2019 Sundae\u201d (as Jessi called them).  Needless to say, Debbie had decided to all but adopt her.  Making more in an hour than she usually did all day (let alone all week if no one else tried the challenge) was definitely worth shutting everyone else out and putting up with a little\u2014BBBRRRROOOMMMPPTTT!!! Okay, a LOT of stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Darlin\u2019, what\u2019s left ya so happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe\u2026 Well\u2026  I kind of\u2026 sort of\u2026  IHAVEABOYFRIEND!!!\u201d  Debbie could only laugh at the sudden outburst, even as a string of flatulence was produced along with it.  \u201cAnd he moved in with me!!!  He\u2019s soooo perfect, I like, totally can\u2019t believe it! Hehehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie could hardly believe any normal guy would put up with walking cloud of stink that was Jessi, but she was happy for her nonetheless.  \u201cSo it\u2019sa\u2019 special occasion then, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely! Hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019ll ya be havin\u2019 today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2014SSSPPPRRRHHHTTT!!! \u2013mm\u2026  I think I\u2019ll have, like, 2 Gut Bustin\u2019 Sundaes, but\u2026 Can I like, make a special request?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Hun, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can I have all the scoops be T-Triple C-D Swirl?\u201d  Debbie could only shake her head in disbelief\u2026  Only Jessi would ask for 54 scoops of a flavor most people were hard pressed to finish more than 1 of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Darlin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYaaaaay!!!\u201d SSPPLLOOORRTTT  SSPPRRASSSH  SSPPPRREEEENNN!!!  Jessi put her chair to the absolute test as she bounced happily on it between bouts of stink, the poor thing all but ready to buckle even when she was sitting still.  Not wanting to have to sacrifice more than one chair to Jessi\u2019s butt (the stench left over even after she left was too much for even Debbie to use again comfortably), Debbie quickly made up the two \u201csundaes\u201d, soon plopping two spoons and a veritable mountain of ice cream onto a table that was left creaking almost as much as Jessi\u2019s chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi was left speechless for a few moments, even her gas dying down to splutter\u2026 But after those few moments, the table might as well have been a chocolate battlefield.  Like a pro, Jessi grabbed both spoons with practiced precision, digging in and shoveling one spoonful after another, again and again.  Debbie could only watch in awe as Jessi plowed through the mountains at a completely steady pace.  She was in complete euphoria, even as huge globs of half-melted ice cream dribbled down her chin, or sloshed off the spoon straight into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done with the first \u201csundae\u201d, Jessi\u2019s face was completely smeared with streams of chocolate and caramel that flowed into rivers that in turn flowed into her cleavage.  Not even pausing for a breather, Jessi immediately jumped to the next sundae as Debbie carefully pulled the empty dish away from the hurricane that was Jessi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Jessi was always somewhat chubby, her stomach had swelled from tummy, to paunch, to full-blown belly, and didn\u2019t show any signs of stopping.  The thing had been slowly swelling with every other bite, and to Debbie\u2019s usual astonishment, it didn\u2019t show any sign of a limit.  She could swear she heard the ice cream sloshing around in there with the frantic movement of Jessi\u2019s eating, but it was hard to distinguish between the sloshing and the increasingly wet farts.  SSSPPPLLLRRRSSSHHHHTTTT  SSSPPPRRRrrrrrrrssshhhPPLAAARRRSSSHHHAAAMMMFFFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less than half of the sundae left, Jessi finally showed signs of slowing down, but only slightly.  Like a machine, Jessi continued to chow on the ice cream; chocolate swirl here, caramel swirl there, a huge chunk of cookie dough next, more and more of it spilling down the front of her and now making its way past her bulging breasts and onto the ever-swelling belly that was now taking over more and more of her thighs.<br>\r\nDebbie shook her head in disbelief once again as with a massive shudder, Jessi shoved the last spoonful into her awaiting mouth, the room now completely quiet except the sloshing of more ice cream than most people could eat in a month\u2026  Well, that and an especially mighty\u2014PPPPLLLLRRRAAAAAFSSSSSHHHHHTTTTPPPPLllloooorrrmmmffff\u2026 SSPLLLARRTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessi sat in a glutton-induced haze of frozen dairy goodness, Debbie went about cleaning up and paying Jessi\u2019s bill, even taking time to wipe off as much of Jessi\u2019s front as she could, though there was nothing she could do for Jessi\u2019s\u2026 \u201cshirt\u201d.  \u201cSo\u2026 How was it, Darlin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi took a few moments before she could respond, stuffed to the gills and then some.  \u201cShooooo\u2026 SSPPRAASSHHH!  Gooood\u2026\u201d  Jessi was so happily stuffed, she was about to nod off, at least until she suddenly snapped back awake.  \u201cOh my gosh, I gotta like\u2026 Oooh\u2026 PPLLRRAAAPPPTTT!  Get back to KyKy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi never ceased to amaze Debbie, a fact that was once again hit home as she suddenly lurched to her feet and waddled right out of the door, her stomach holding so much that she should be in a coma, let alone walking.  \u201cThanks again, Darlin\u2019! Oh, and tell your man he\u2019s one lucky stud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to either of them, in the walk to the gym and the ice cream eating binge that was the last half-hour, Jessi and Kyle barely missed each other multiple times.  But by the time Jessi waddled out of the shop, Kyle could have walked right in front of her (or been dragged by an overly confident red-head) and she probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed, so glazed was her vision from the euphoria that was a tummy filled to bursting with ice cream.<br>\r\nWith what little was left of her top completely smeared and stained with all different swirls of browns and caramels, not to mention a stomach that had not only grown gigantic but sloshed with every movement, Jessi made the slow, drunken march back to the apartment.  \u201cHehe\u2026  Lactose\u2026 Intolerant\u2026  Nuh-uh!!!  There\u2019s like\u2026 no way\u2026 it would taste\u2026 that gooooood!\u201d SSSSPPPLLLLLRRRRRRSSSSHHHHHHTTTTT\u2026 BLOOORPT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the time Jessi had made it up the 6 flights of stairs to the apartment, her stomach had somehow already shrank significantly, her drunken shuffle giving way to her usual jiggly gait as she walked to her door and made her way inside.  The sight that greeted her was practically a miracle.  \u201cOh my gosh, I can like, totally see the floor!  KyKy, you\u2019re so totally, awesomely, amazingly, amazing!!! Hehehe!\u201d  Jessi bounced for joy, until she noticed that Kyle wasn\u2019t there.  \u201cKyKy?  Where did you go\u2026?  You didn\u2019t\u2026  He didn\u2019t\u2026 &lt;i&gt;Leave,&lt;/i&gt; did he?\u201d  Jessi was on the verge of blubbering, until she suddenly remembered what he had said.  \u201cWait, he said he wasn\u2019t leaving, we\u2019re boyfriend and girlfriend now!  He probably just went to get something to eat\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s it!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hmm\u2026 but what to do?\u201d  PPPRRAAAPPPTTT SSSsppllluurrfss\u2026  \u201cOh, I know!  I\u2019ll put on a special something, just for him!\u201d  Giddy with her sudden inspiration, Jessi literally ripped her shirt off (or what was left of it), and stripped off Kyle\u2019s backpack and out of the rest of her clothes, tossing everything in a corner with an unceremonious set of squelches (with Kyle\u2019s backpack on the bottom, of course) and leaving her completely naked in every inch of jiggling glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the piles so neatly sorted, it was easy for her to find one of her favorite spaghetti-strap tops, a tiny little formerly white number that had been soaking in a sweat-filled corner for so long, it had completely stained yellow, once again leaving her in nothing much more than a sports bra.  She was about to look for the shorts she had in mind, when she suddenly spotted an item she hadn\u2019t seen, let alone worn, in quite some time.  \u201cLike, ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!!!  I haven\u2019t worn those in fooooreeeeeveeeeer! They\u2019re perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi quickly reached down to grab a lone toe sock, the previously black material of the sock literally rotting in some areas from repeated never-washed uses, not to mention left over toe jam and grime that had turned the individual toes almost green.  \u201cBut where is your partner, little socky?  I can\u2019t wear you all by your lonesome!  Soooooocky!  Sooooooooooockyyyyyyy!!!\u201d  Jessi continued calling out to the missing inanimate object as she started digging into the pile, tossing the items he didn\u2019t need behind her as she went. Soon, the pile was completely spewed out behind her, with no success.  Thus the utter destruction of Kyle\u2019s cleaning continued as Jessi mowed through the piles with almost as much precision as the ice cream earlier, throwing articles of clothing in every direction while she looked.  Soon the room was completely destroyed yet again, if not even worse than before with even the bed covered in dirty clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm- SSPPPRRRPPPTTT!!! -mm\u2026.  Why can\u2019t I find Socky?  Maybe I put him in the dirty clothes bin?\u201d  Without Kyle to protest, Jessi didn\u2019t think anything of it as she opened up the \u201cbin\u201d and began her search anew.  By the time she was done, shit-smeared towels were literally sticking to the walls, clothes that no longer could be called clothes becoming horrendous accent pieces for the entire room.  The room itself was filled with a stench that almost covered up Jessi\u2019s gassy emissions\u2026 Almost.  SSSSPPPLLLOOORRRSSSHHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving exhausted all areas to search (and completely destroying any chance of the room EVER becoming anywhere close to clean), Jessi could only pout and stamp her foot in frustration, her completely exposed bottom half and stomach jiggling and sloshing like so much jello.  Letting her shoulders slump in defeat, Jessi almost didn\u2019t think to look in one last place\u2026 Under the bed!  Thrilled at the sudden stroke of genius, Jessi flopped down on the now re-covered floor of disgusting clothes, her head sticking under the bed and leaving her humongous ass pointing up and exposed to the world (or at least to the world of her room).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLo and behold, in the very middle under the bed, among a few other horrible articles of \u201cclothes\u201d Kyle had missed, was Socky.  \u201cThere you are!!!  Now just let me\u2026 SPPPRRRTTTT  get\u2026 SSPPRRRAAAFFFTTT  you\u2026  SSPPPLLLOOOORRRSSSHHH!!!\u201d  Got ya!\u201d  After wiggling like mad to fit under her bed, Jessi finally reached Socky and snagged him.  Unfortunately, when she tried to back out, she encountered a problem\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her efforts to get under the bed, her breasts had squished under with her, but now that she was all the way in\u2026 they wouldn\u2019t slip back out.  Jostling and struggling, Jessi only succeeded in giving her door an amazing show of ass shaking, her chunky butt gyrating, circling, and clapping with every other motion, not to mention the ever-increasing- SSSPPPRRRAAASSSHHHHHTTTT  SSPPLLOOOORRRTTTT  SSSPPPRRRRMMMMMFFFFF  SSPPPRRREEEEENNNNFFFFF!!!  \u201cOoooooh\u2026  My tummy doesn\u2019t feel so good\u2026  I think I need to\u2026\u201d SSPPLLRTT\u2026  SSPPRRROOMMF\u2026 BRAPT\u2026 SSSLLLLOOOORRRRRMMMMMMMPPPPHHHHSSSTTTTTTTPPPLLOOOOMMMMFFFFRREEEEEEEEnnnnsssshhhh httttpppplupplrupploomf\u2026 BROMP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi could only wiggle her butt in dismay as she released wave upon wave of liquid shit all over her doorway and whatever else happened to be behind her.  \u201cAaaww\u2026  Now I won\u2019t be able to wear that like, toootally cute outfit for KyKy! Oh well, hopefully he gets back soon\u2026\u201d  Again totally misreading what she should be dismayed about, Jessi continued to wiggle her butt, periodically splurging another horrendous shart or two while she waited until she heard the door finally open some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you are KyKy!  I\u2019ve been waiting for, like, ever!  Do you think you could help me?  I\u2019m kinda\u2026 well\u2026  I think I might be stuck.  Hehehe.\u201d  Jessi wiggled her ass one more time to emphasize her situation, when she suddenly felt Kyle slam face first \u201cagainst\u201d her butt (his face actually wedged deep into her crack).  \u201cAaawww, hehehe, I missed you too!  And we can definitely snuggle, but I think we should, like, get me out of here first.  Hehehe.  And you\u2019re making my butt tickle.\u201d   SSSPPPLLLLLOOOOORRRRRRSSSHHHHSSSPPPLLLAAAATTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kyle got himself unstuck, he had practically made out with every inch of Jessi\u2019s dirty ass crack, a fact his taste buds would probably never forget.  It actually took much less time to get Jessi out, a simple matter of lifting the bed up and letting her out, though by that time Kyle\u2019s clothes were now a complete mix of both Jessi\u2019s and Alexia\u2019s refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes watered even more than they already were as they were exposed to the full extent of the dump (literal and figurative) that was Jessi\u2019s (and his) room, and his impulse to run for it came back\u2026 But only for an instant.  Alexia would kidnap him before she\u2019d let him live homeless, and although Jessi was disgusting beyond belief, she was beautiful besides, and never did this stuff on &lt;i&gt;purpose,&lt;/i&gt; unlike Alexia.  With a sigh, Kyle started stripping, flinching as he once again stepped in a puddle of poo.  Side-stepping, he heard another squelch as he stepped onto an article of clothing he couldn\u2019t even identify, sending chills up his spine.  Grabbing the least disgusting towel he saw (making sure not to grab one he had used to clean up earlier), a crinkled, crusty purple number, Kyle wrapped it around his waist and turned back to see Jessi\u2019s back (and most importantly, her ass) to him, red in blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessi\u2026  You know if we\u2019re gonna be living in one room like this\u2026  we\u2019re gonna see each other naked eventually, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cButIdidn\u2019twanttomakeyouuncomfortableandI\u2019MuncomfortableIthinkandIthin kyou\u2019re... like\u2026 reeeaally\u2026 umm\u2026  Ithinkyou\u2019resexyandstuff!\u201d  Kyle couldn\u2019t help but smile despite it all.  Sure, he was essentially in a cesspool, but\u2026 what could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessi\u2026 Do you want to take a shower?\u201d  It was worth a shot at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessi immediately turned around, a look of pure astonishment and a pink blush over her entire body, her modesty barely covered by her top and the decrepit sheet she had just grabbed.  \u201cYou mean, like\u2026 together?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2026 I mean you\u2026 and I\u2026 and\u2026 Ireallythinkthatwouldbeliketotallyamazing!!!\u201d  SSSPPPPPPPPRRRARAAAAAFFFFFTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled again, even as his nose felt (as usual as of late) like falling off.  &lt;i&gt;Well, if I have to be stuck with a girl who would put any ogre to shame, at least I\u2019m stuck with one as cute as her\u2026&lt;i&gt;</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And Now... A Shower Scene<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike newly-weds on their wedding night who had never even kissed, Kyle and Jessi stood awkwardly in the bathroom as they waited for the water to heat up. Even with the stench of absolute filth wafting through the bathroom doorway, it was all Kyle could do not to become rock solid underneath his towel as Jessi succeeded in wrenching the tiny top she had been wearing up over her shoulders. Tossing the top aside with a cute smile and giggle, Jessi was left standing in all of her absolute glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fidgeted nervously, her enormous breasts swayed ponderously in front of her, somehow defying gravity and leaving her stomach fully exposed. Down lower, the pudge of her stomach formed small love handles, the chubbiness of her thighs and tummy barely giving any modesty to an only slightly trimmed crotch of nearly invisible curly blonde hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding in kind, Kyle slowly removed the towel he had wrapped around his waist and turned to place it on a nearby hook. When he turned around, he wasn\u2019t quite ready for what he saw. Jessi was literally drooling as she stared at him. Her hands clasped under and lifting her enormous breasts with nipples fully erect, she had a look of combined embarrassment, curiosity, and pure lust in eyes grown huge, leaving Kyle to form a blush of his own as the river of drool dribbling out of the corner of her mouth trickled down one breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI umm\u2026 I think the shower should be hot enough soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d SSSPPPPRRRAAAFFFTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shower, Jessi\u2026 We were going to take a--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, yeah! SPPPPRRRSSSSHHHTTT!!! Yeah, I like\u2026 totally knew that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf\u2026 If you think this is going to fast, Jessi, we can always just take separate sho--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly had a heart attack as Jessi suddenly surged on him in all of her naked glory, clinging to him with all of her might. After getting over the shock of her naked breasts suddenly smothering his face yet again (this time with Jessi naked as the day she was born no less), Kyle couldn\u2019t help but realize that despite the horrible BO she was still giving off that it was getting much, MUCH harder not to get aroused, especially with her crotch so close to his\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyKy, I\u2026 I\u2026 IlikereallyreallyreeeeeallylikeyouandIreeeallywanttodothiswithyou!!! YouputupwithmefortwodaysnowandsleptwithmeandtookmeonadateandIthinkwe\u2019rethebest coupleever!!! So\u2026 Like\u2026 Please?\u201d PPPLLLLOOOOORRRRRFFFFTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs gently as he could, Kyle extricated himself from Jessi, her breasts swinging so close to his face that her very hard nipples were likely to poke an eye out. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay with it, so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAAAAAA\u2014sssspppprrrraaaaaAAAAAFFFFTTTTLLLOOOOPMMMMTTTT!!!\u2014AAAaaaaay!! !\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle caught himself staring as Jessi hopped up and down, sending her body into a fit of jiggles and ripples that left Kyle hard in spite of himself, leaving Jessi to go back to her drooling when she finally noticed. \u201cU-umm\u2026 yeah, so lets do this.\u201d Trying to ignore her lingering stares, Kyle slid open the shower door, only to realize with Jessi actually standing here next to him how small the shower really was. He wasn\u2019t even really sure how she had fit in on her own, let alone how she would fit in with him. The thought of her body squished up against him, slick and clean with soap suds\u2026 Kyle suddenly snapped out of the daydream, wiping a bit of his own drool away from his lip as he tried to occupy his mind with something else with limited success\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that without soap he\u2019d have no hopes of any suds, let alone getting Jessi anywhere near clean, Kyle looked around until he noticed a small, seemingly forgot bar of soap in the corner of the small shower. \u201cAh, there\u2019s the soap, just let me get in and grab it\u2026\u201d Stepping into the pleasantly warm spray of water, Kyle squatted down to grab the bar of soap only to have Jessi move in from behind before he could notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady or not, like, here I come KyKy!!!\u201d Kyle nearly screamed as he turned to see Jessi barging her way in, forcing his back against the corner/wall as she went, slamming the door shut behind her. In shock from the abrupt moves of Jessi, Kyle didn\u2019t say anything right away, not exactly sure what had happened. Trying to stand up, he suddenly bumped into something soft, sticking gunk coming off of it in his hair. In front of him were\u2026 He suddenly recognized the backs of Jessi\u2019s thighs, which meant\u2026 He nearly vomited as he realized where he was. Somehow Jessi had forced her way in after him, and now he was stuck in a squatted position behind her legs, with nothing except a ceiling of horrendously dirty ass that was apparently so big that he had no room to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPPPPPRRRAASSSSHHHHTTTT!!! \u201cKyKy? I thought you were like, grabbing the soap?\u201d SSPPPLRRRRPPPTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened his mouth to answer up at her, already gagging from the butt bombs she was dropping all over him, only to have some kind of semi-liquid sludge plop into his mouth and smear all over his face. To his horror, he realized that although it had taken a few moments, the water of the shower was slowly working its way through Jessi\u2019s dirty ass crack, and every bit of muck the water was washing away\u2026 was pouring right onto him. PPPLLLOPOOOORRRFFFFTTTT!!! SSPPPLLRREEEEEENNNSSSSHHHH PPLLLOOOOOOMMMMPPPTTTRRRFFFFFTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, I get it!!! You like, toootally remembered that I used the soap already last week, so you were just gettin\u2019 it for yourself! Hehehe! You\u2019re like, soooo totally amazing awesome, KyKy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only accept the \u201ccompliment\u201d in silence or risk getting another mouthful of shit water or sludge, the slop positively raining down on him at this point as Jessi started \u201csinging\u201d, drowning out any mild attempts he did make at alerting her. With a last ditch effort, Kyle reached up and pressed up on the sludge-covered watermelons of flesh above him, causing Jessi to jump in surprise, knocking not only whatever left-over poo was still lodged in her crack, but a barrage of farts as well. SSPPPRRRAAASSSHHHTTT SSPPORRRRMMMMMMTTTTTTT PPPRREEEEEEOOOORRRRSSSHHHHTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, KyKy\u2026 that kinda tickles and like\u2026 Kinda\u2026 Itkindafeelsgood! So like\u2026 if you want to\u2026 youcantotallykeepdoingit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sighed as yet again he was being put through hell at the \u201chands\u201d of Jessi\u2019s ass. Nonetheless, it did kind of feel nice to touch her bum like this\u2026 And he was already covered in her butt juice\u2026 moving her bum cheeks around would only leave them cleaner for inevitable later meetings with it\u2026 Right? Convinced well enough with this line of thinking, Kyle started kneeding Jessi\u2019s bum cheeks, letting the warm water at least rinse out the rest of her butt. Of course this meant all of the rancid water fell right on him, but the feeling of massaging the jiggly fat of her bum was a nice one, if not a little\u2014mmmmmpppphhhLLLPSPPPPPRRRAAAAAAAASSSSHHHHTTTTT!!! \u2013Okay, a lot smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessi moaned above him in a much less than discreet way, pressing her ass cheeks down into his hands as he went, Kyle suddenly realized something\u2026 He was enjoying it, and quite a bit at that (at least if the stirring in his lower regions was any indication). But how could he be? After being shat on by Jessi on multiple occasions (among countless other nasty things), how could he be\u2026 attracted to her, let alone her butt? Sure, he could blame having to stay here on Alexia, but could he blame how much of a pushover he was towards Jessi (without her even realizing)? Could he blame her for how cute he thought Jessi was, despite everything? He couldn\u2019t blame the threat of homelessness on his thoughts of Jessi either\u2026 Could he actually\u2026 Have some sort of feelings for this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmppphhh\u2014SSPPLLLOOOORRRRFFFFTTTT!!! KyKy\u2026 This\u2026 I think I like\u2026 I like this a looooot. Hehe\u2014SSPPPRRAAAPPPTTT!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was cut from his thoughts for the umpteenth time by Jessi\u2019s ass as he realized that while he was thinking, Jessi had continued pushing her butt against his hands, his arms letting it get closer and closer to his face with every grind. Too late to stop it, with one mighty shove, Jessi\u2019s butt was upon him, his whole upper chest and face completely pinned and smothered against the wall of the shower. Jessi continued to moan louder, gyrating and grinding her butt every which way against him as she continued to let out her butt burps. SSSPLLLOOOOORRRRRSSSHHHH SSSPPPRRREEEEEEFFFTTTTTT SSSLLLAAAARRRRshsshshshshsSPLORT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried frantically to at least get her to let him breathe, but Jessi was too far gone to notice anything except how good his face felt. As more fetid air accosted him with every second, Kyle started to feel his consciousness slip away, one fart at a time\u2026 PPPRRRAAAFFFFTTTT PPRRROOOMMMPFFF SSLLLOOOOMMMMFFFPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he escaped into dreamland, Kyle suddenly felt cold water on his body as Jessi startled off of him with one last might BLLOOMMMFTTT! \u201cOh jeez, like, did I use up all the hot water agaaain? And that was feeling reeeally good too\u2026 Right, KyKy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could barely nod in response as Jessi swung open the shower door. Trying to get up too fast as Jessi stepped out, a dizzy spell suddenly hit him and before he knew it he was falling. It all happened so fast that he could barely register it, but a girly scream one instant, and with the wind knocked out of him the next, Kyle found himself on his back on the bathroom floor with a very heavy something on top of him. \u201cOuchie, ouchie ouchie\u2026 KyKy, are you like, okay? Hehehe.\u201d Make that a very heavy someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened his eyes to find Jessi\u2019s face mere inches from his, her wet hair framing it beautifully as she trickled decidedly less tainted water onto him. \u201cUmm\u2026 yeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine I think\u2026 I, umm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whether he had started it or Jessi, Kyle didn\u2019t know, but he didn\u2019t much care. Sure, she put him through a very personal kind of hell, and he wasn\u2019t exactly sure of what these feelings really were towards her, but\u2026 Whatever they were, they were strong enough and them some to stick around through it all and find out for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the passionate kissing died down enough for them to catch a breath, staring at each other for a few moments in happy silence. A long enough silence, in fact, for Kyle to realize that Jessi was not only on top of him, but was naked on top of a naked him (as if Kyle\u2019s lower extremities needed any additional stimulation). Having the same thought, both Kyle and Jessi matched full body blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 KyKy, do you\u2026 I mean\u2026 would you want to\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 with, like\u2026 me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blushing smile, Kyle gave her another kiss in response, and he couldn\u2019t help thinking that despite it all, this moment was perfect\u2014SSSPLLLLOOOOORRRRSSSSHHHH!!! \u201c\u2019Scuse me.\u201d \u2013Even with Jessi\u2019s gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle startled awake hours later, his body sore from having fallen asleep with Jessi on the bathroom floor (among other sore-body producing activities). He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as he saw Jessi practically wrapped around him in usual Jessi-cute style, all the way down to the near lake of drool she was dribbling onto his chest. Hearing a rampant knocking at the door and realizing this is what must have woke him, Kyle did his best to extricate himself from his now-decidedly more serious girlfriend and made his way to the door, wiping off the drool as best he could and pulling on a pair of boxers as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incessant banging continued even stronger now, causing him to hurry and open the door to keep whoever it was from waking Jessi if he could manage it. \u201cHell--- Oh\u2026\u201d Kyle could only let his jaw hit the floor as he found himself glad that he was using the door to shield his body from view, because standing in front of him in all of her crazy redheaded glory was none other than the last person he wanted to see there\u2026 Alexia.</span></div></div>",

I tried to open my mouth to reply, but all that came out was a cough. This only brought a warm smile from Jackie, followed by an equally warm giggle as I occupied myself with looking at my shoelaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you thirsty? I can grab us some drinks. Be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced back up as Jackie got off the couch, her long, curly chestnut hair bouncing with the motion, along with a large pair of breasts packed into a sky-blue button up T. As she bent forward to get off the couch, I couldn't help noticing more than a few buttons left undone on her \"neckline\", causing an overabundant amount of cleavage to swell into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her breasts were impressive by just about anyone's standards, it was absolutely nothing compared to the giant mass that was her booty. Her twin moons of flesh were jammed into such an ill-fitting pair of khaki short shorts that along with a massive wedgie, she was also showing flashes of the bottom of her bum cheeks with every step along with more than anyone's fair share of butt cleavage out of the top. As her greatest asset jiggled its way around the corner, I was finally able to somewhat think straight again, not to mention realize what a stupid idea this all was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had met Jackie while in high school four years earlier, all because of a science project. I had ended up partnered with her stepdaughter, Jennifer, which at the time I considered to be the worst luck in my life. While Jackie seemed completely devoted to Jennifer even after her biological mother had left at her birth and her father had passed soon after them getting married, it was more than obvious that there was no genetics between them. While Jackie was a chestnut-haired, emerald-eyed bombshell; Jennifer was a dishwater-blonde, brown-eyed whale of a girl. If it was only for her weight, Jennifer wouldn't have been so horrible, but on top of this, she was a complete slob, not to mention an enormous klutz as well (both literally and metaphorically).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite this overwhelming difference in conventional beauty, I had slowly learned to not just put up with Jennifer's disgusting habits, but actually enjoy her company despite them, and eventually I had even fallen for her. Now with both myself and Jennifer at 20 years old, I had finally convinced myself that I was going to take the leap and try to make this a relationship beyond just best friends. It had taken 4 long years to get to this point in my feelings for Jennifer, but now that I had decided, there wasn't anything I wouldn't do to make my dream a reality\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why I was here today before Jennifer would be home. It was an old fashioned idea, yes; but with how strong a relationship Jennifer and Jackie had, I couldn't make my move on Jennifer until I had her blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was startled out of my thoughts as Jackie jiggled and shimmied her way back into the living room, plopping down on the couch with a noticeable jostle of her breasts. With another warm smile, she offered me a glass of juice which I guzzled down in seconds; hoping to loosen up my mouth enough to form speech. \"So, as I was saying; it's kind of early in the afternoon for you to be here, you know Jennifer's still at college for the next couple of hours\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026 I'm not h-here to see Jen-Jennifer\u2026 Yet, anyway\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're here to see little ol' me?\" I blushed horribly in silence as she giggled cutely. After a few moments of no reply, she probed again. \"Hey, Cutie Pie, you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth opened and closed a few times before I was able to speak again. \"Y-yeah\u2026 I'm fine, I\u2026 I have something I need to\u2026 I need to tell you\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knowing smirk was cast on Jackie's beautiful face. \"Oh, really? Hehe, I think I know what you're going to say, but go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. This was the moment I had been building up to for the last 4 years, whether or not I realized it. 4 years before I realized that despite how much of a disgusting slob Jennifer could be, I loved her\u2026 I needed to do this before I lost my nerve. \"Jackie, I\u2026 well I\u2026 You see, what I'm trying to say is\u2026 I l--- I love\u2026 I love\u2026\" Panic was rising in my throat. I couldn't do it\u2026 I couldn't\u2026 \"Jackie, I lo\u2026 I\u2026 I love---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, don't hurt yourself trying to force it out Cutie-Pie, I know you've had a huge crush on me for the last 4 years, I'm glad you were finally able to fess up to it! Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis misunderstanding was enough to snap me back into control, in fact it was all I could do to keep myself from laughing. \"What? No, no, no! I don't have a crush on\u2014I mean, I like you a lot as Jennifer's Mom but\u2026 What I was trying to say is that I love\u2026 I love Jennifer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie startled, but only for a moment before her glorious smile washed back over her face. \"Hehe, oh you! You're such a jokester! I mean, I'm glad that you're able to put up with Jennifer to be around me, I mean, that's half of why I like you back, but you don't have to go as far as to say you love her just to convince me! I mean, I love her to pieces, but she's definitely\u2026 well\u2026 I guess a handful would be an understatement, no matter which way you take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned at this turn of events. How could she think I'd like her like that? I mean, there was a good 14 year difference between us! \"Jackie\u2026 I\u2026 I really do love Jennifer, handful or not\u2026 I was just wanting to ask your permission before I ask her to date me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's beautiful smile slowly faded away, quickly being replaced with something more akin to\u2026 disappointment? \"That\u2026 that can't be true\u2026 I mean, Jennifer's like a real blood daughter to me, but\u2026 She's gross enough to put a pig, a skunk, and road-kill that's been sitting on the road for a week combined to shame\u2026 Are\u2026 Are you sure this isn't a joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. Though part of me felt bad for the misunderstanding, I had to make sure Jackie understood. \"It's not a joke, Jackie. I love Jennifer. It doesn't matter how gross she is to me, I just want to be with her....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointed look only grew as Jackie's arms crossed underneath her heaving bosoms. My eyes once again drifted down to my shoelaces in the silence, distracting me enough to not notice as her facial expression changed once again from disappointment to pure determination. \"I'm sorry too\u2026 No matter how gross she is, you still want to be with her? That doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 No one in their right mind would pick her over me\u2026 Unless\u2026 Are you actually INTO how gross she is? How she weighs more than nearly two of you combined?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared dumbfounded for a few moments, wondering how this could have gone so wrong. \"Well, you know what? I'm not a pretty face all of the time, and I can be just as disgusting as Jennifer, maybe even moreso! And there's even ways to make it so my body looks huge compared to even a girl Jennifer's size!!!\" Unfortunately, the dumbfounded reply of silence from me gave Jackie enough time to make a few sudden hand gestures as well as mumble a bunch of words I didn't understand. Both embarrassed and confused, I got up to run out the door, but a sudden queasiness overtook me, and before I knew it I was falling face-first towards the coffee table\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments after I woke up, I was convinced that it had all been a dream. The jitters of having to ask Jackie if it was okay to date Jennifer had just got to me was all\u2026 That was until I slowly pushed myself up from my prone position and looked around. This wasn\u2019t the floor of my bedroom. I hadn\u2019t just fallen out of bed and woken up from some slightly humorous dream. In fact, part of me wasn\u2019t even sure if I was awake right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind scrambled to find some kind of alternate explanation as I pinched myself a few times, but soon I could only come to one conclusion. I had just woken up on Jackie\u2019s coffee table, and I could only be a few inches tall!!! How could this have happened?! Was this even possible?! Was Jackie a witch?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts and quite a few more were buzzing around in my head like a million angry hornets, but all of them went completely silent when I finally noticed Jackie standing over me. My jaw hit the floor (or in this case, the coffee table) as I took all of her in, and there was a lot of her. I was level with her knees, my eyes slowly traveling up her perfectly sun-kissed skin to her tiny shorts cutting into the meat of her thighs just below a very mature set of hips. Following higher, I couldn\u2019t help notice how much her dress-T\u2019s buttons were actually puckering, especially when I took in her breasts that were overflowing out of the top. Her breasts alone took up so much of the view that I almost couldn\u2019t see Jackie smiling down at me from high above, her giggling rumbling down to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, so you finally woke up, huh Cutie? I\u2019m glad you came by so early, otherwise Jennifer would already be home! Lucky for you and me, we still have at least an hour!\u201d Part of my brain told me to run as fast as I could in any direction away from Jackie, but whatever part of the brain that was wasn\u2019t connected to my legs, and I stayed rooted in place when she reached out her hand and picked me up like some sort of doll. I nearly lost my lunch as she quickly brought me up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackie, what happened? What did you do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, well, it was the only way to make me look bigger than Jennifer, Silly! By the time she gets home, I\u2019m gonna have you so hooked on how gross I am that you\u2019re gonna totally forget about her! Hehe.\u201d I nearly cried at the thought. How did she think that I actually LIKED how gross Jennifer was?! Sure, I had gotten used to it to some extent, and I tolerated it, but\u2026 I liked her IN SPITE of how gross she was, not BECAUSE of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackie, you have to listen to me, I love Jennif\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Addition/Chapter Limit Reached.)</span></div></div>",

I mean, who DOESN\u2019T want a guy who doesn\u2019t need his girl to keep up her appearance all the time? Hehe. Like, normally I would NEVER eat anything with garlic because even a bit of it makes my breath smell horrible! But\u2026 because you want a gross girl, and I\u2019m happy to be that gross girl for you, I got to eat a whole bag of garlic chips by myself while I was waiting for you to wake up! Here, smell!\u201d<br>\r\n I tried to tell Jackie once again that that wasn\u2019t how it was, but before I could she suddenly brought me in front of her mouth. I could only stare half in awe and half in terror as her lips parted, showing off pearly white teeth (or at least pearly white except for leftover chip chunks stuck in between them). Unfortunately, Jackie moved me even closer, then proceeded to blow her breath all over me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t lying about how bad they made her breath smell. In fact if anything she understated it. The garlic smell alone was enough to knock out someone at normal size, but mixed with the smell of her saliva, and whatever other smells were lingering from her last meal, I didn\u2019t know how I was still conscious. Even as I wanted more and more to hurl, Jackie just blissfully continued to blow her breath onto me until\u2026 BBBRRRROOOOOOOOOPPPPPT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hair was blasted back as Jackie released a horrendous belch into my face at point blank, now adding its stench on top of her breath and somehow making the smell at least 10 times worse. My head was spinning, but I stayed awake somehow, unable to pass out no matter how much at this point I wanted to. \u201cHehehe, see? It reeks, right? You even got a dose of that soda I chugged! And you don\u2019t even have to worry about passing out or getting sick or anything! My spell makes you waaay more resilient; wouldn\u2019t want my little lover to not be able to enjoy his little fetish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie winked at me as I coughed and gagged, horrified as I realized I would have to put up with whatever Jackie wanted me to unless I could talk some sense into her. \u201cJackie, please, you have to\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019m not gonna stop there! If I did that, I wouldn\u2019t even be 1/10th as gross as Jennifer!\u201d Jackie giggled over any of my objections, clearly enjoying my supposed \u201cenjoyment\u201d of her prowess in the ways of the gross. \u201cNow, Jennifer picks her nose all the time, right? Well, I was thinking, since you must like watching her, I could do you one better! I\u2019ve been havin\u2019 allergies lately, so my nose gets stuffed all the time. It happens to be a little stuffed right now and, well\u2026 I\u2019m gonna pick my nose with you! Hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently pleased with this terrible idea, Jackie didn\u2019t give me any time to object. Before I knew it, I looked up to see a nostril that was in fact filled with globs of green snot. In the next instant I was shoved up into some form of hell. Green slime engulfed my face, the rest of my head, and whatever of my upper body Jackie could fit into her green gold mine. She continued to giggle and titter as I screamed and flailed, making sure to twist and spin me to get every last bit of the disgusting slime, a lot of which was getting into my own nose, my eyes, and even my mouth. I gasped for air as she finally pulled me out, but the relief was short lived as she spun me and shoved my lower body into her other nostril, her fingers holding my head and shoulders and rubbing the slime that was there in even more as she coated my legs with an equal amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally pulling me out, she dropped me onto the table gently, my body hitting the table giving of a sickening SPLAT as I was stuck to the surface spread eagle without being able to move a finger as the snot and boogers started to dry. \u201cHehehe, that was perfect, right? I mean, it was even good for me, my nose hasn\u2019t been this clean in forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was forced to eat her snot and boogers in reply just to breathe until I could finally speak. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t perfect! I don\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you want it even more gross, huh? Well, I guess it\u2019s a good thing that I turned up the thermostat then! I can already feel myself sweating through my clothes\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that just turn you on? My clothes slowly getting soaked with sweat, my BO steadily getting worse and worse\u2026\u201d Jackie smirked down at my stuck form, thinking I must be having the time of my life having this MILF literally talk dirty to me. I could only stare back in disgust and disbelief, but Jackie only took this as me being too turned on to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll skip the boring stuff and go straight to what I know you want!\u201d With another wink, She started undoing her button-up T. My jaw fell yet again as her humongous pair was exposed more and more until they finally flopped out for the entire world to see, apparently Jackie not having bothered with a bra today. The twin orbs shimmied and shook as she pulled the shirt off of her arms, the massive, perky orbs of flesh not showing any age whatsoever. I was so enthralled, I hardly noticed as Jackie giggled and grabbed me, bringing me closer and closer to this pair\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden smell of BO snapped me out of my stupor, but it was too late. One second I had a wonderful close-up view on the biggest pair of breasts I\u2019d ever seen (at least with the size comparison); the next I was suddenly being engulfed by cleavage, which seemed to have a river of sweat flowing through it as Jackie nonchalantly squished me in and out of her canyon. \u201cHehe, you tickle down there Cutie Pie. Isn\u2019t this just everything you\u2019ve ever wanted? Hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to reply as she dunked me in and out of her sweat canyon, but it was easier said than done. \u201cNo Jackie-- *Squeelch.* --It isn\u2019t-- *Squirt.* -- I want-- *Squish.*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not quite gross enough for you, huh? And here I thought you were a big boobs kind of guy. You must not care where it is as long as it\u2019s gross, huh? Hmm\u2026 Oh, of course! It\u2019s gotta be my armpit you want! What place is grosser than that for sweat and BO? Hehehe. You\u2019re even extra lucky today, I forgot to put on deodorant this morning!\u201d I screamed and flailed, but Jackie silenced me with one last squeezing of me between her breasts, squeezing the breath out of me and giving me a horrendous drink of boob sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, by the time I caught my breath and I was in front of her armpit, which left me praying to be put back in between her breasts. Even a few inches away from it as she lifted her arm, it was like a wall of BO smacked me in the face, causing me to cough and hack. It only got worse as Jackie brought me slowly closer, building up \u201canticipation\u201d (and the stench), until she quickly slammed my face against the horribly fragrant and slimy skin. \u201cOh, I just remembered I haven\u2019t shaved for a day or two under there either, it might be a little stubbly. Hope that\u2019s a turn on too!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was essentially crying tears of Jackie\u2019s sweat as she rubbed me all around her pit face first. My face felt like it was being rubbed against sandpaper, and the sweat immediately poured into every little scratch (not to mention into my eyes, nose, and mouth). I prayed for it to end, but Jackie only put her arm down, sealing me in the sweat and BO for more than a few minutes as I nearly choked for air before finally letting me out. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your fun isn\u2019t done yet, I still have another armpit!\u201d I tried to make my mind go blank as she brought me to her other armpit, but the smell was too strong, and I once again had to endure everything from the first armpit. This one even seemed to take longer, Jackie apparently not wanting the \u201cfun\u201d to end and taking an especially long time before she brought me back up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was literally coughing up sweat by this point, my face red from being rubbed raw by her stubble. \u201cSooo, Cutie Pie, how was that? Was that enough to convince you how gross I can be, how perfect a couple we can be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just wanted this to end, even if I stayed shrunk like this with her, as long as she stopped now, maybe I could convince her that I just wanted to be a \u201cnormal\u201d couple at least\u2026 \u201cNo\u2026 *Coughhackcough* More\u2026 *Coughcough.*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie\u2019s smile changed to a look of confusion, then to one of slight frustration. \u201cSo that wasn\u2019t enough\u2026 and you want more?\u201d I screamed internally as apparently my coughing between words had left my meaning open for interpretation. I tried to explain myself once again, but Jackie just talked over me. \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026 I\u2019ve given you everything that you could want with Jennifer\u2026 I mean, if you like big girls, I\u2019m the biggest you\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 I picked my nose even better than she does\u2026 My breath smells just as bad as hers\u2026 I\u2019m even almost as sweaty as her! What could you possibly want that I haven\u2019t--- Oooooh\u2026\u201d A smirk crossed her face that I knew wasn\u2019t going to lead to anything good, but by this point I knew trying to yell at her wasn\u2019t going to get me anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, and here I thought you didn\u2019t care where the gross stuff was happening. Of course you want more, you\u2019re OBVIOUSLY an ass man! Hehehe. Sorry, I should have been able to figure it out sooner! Don\u2019t worry, if I push you deep enough you won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between me and Jennifer\u2019s booties, and since it\u2019s for you\u2026 It\u2019ll definitely be nice to let out all of the farts I\u2019m always holding in!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dry heaving just at the thought of her ripping ass all over me, but there was nothing I could do as she giggled once again pulling me around to her ass. Of course I had noticed it before, but nothing could prepare me for the sight before my eyes. Though Jamie\u2019s butt had always been big before, her ass cheeks were now like two perfectly shaped asteroids compared to me, except I was hurtling towards them instead of the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Chapter/Addition Limit Reached)</span></div></div>",

Hehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cried out for her to stop, for this nightmare to end, but Jackie paid me no mind as she quickly brought me to her crack and started sliding me and her hand deeper and deeper. I tried my best to get away, but this just made Jackie think I was really excited, cementing my fate. As I sunk deeper with her hand, the smell slowly got worse and worse. At first it had just been the smell of her BO and sweat, but soon that was mixed with what could only be the smell of her ass. By the time she finally stopped, swamp ass and shit was all I could smell, my eyes adjusting to the darkness just in time to see a completely dirty ass hole right in front of me before Jackie shoved me right up against it and started sliding me around all over it. \u201cMmm\u2026 If I had known this would feel THIS good I would have shrank you down a long time ago!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to scream, but this just left me with a mouthful of anus skin and whatever shit residue had been left on it. I didn\u2019t know how this could get worse, until a rumble reminded me, followed by\u2026 PPPHHHHRRRRRRAAAAAASSSSSSSHHHHHTTTTT!!! \u201cAaaahhhh\u2026 That feels SO much better to just let it out like that\u2026 Especially when I know you like every bit of it! I mean, if it feels this good, I might just have to keep you back there all the time! I bet you\u2019d just looove that, wouldn\u2019t you, Cutie Pie?\u201d SSSPPPPLLLLAAAAAARRRRPPPPTTTT!!! SLLLUUUUURRRRRTTTTT!!! PPPLLLLOOOORRRSSSHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wishing for death as Jackie continued to rub me along her horrible, grimy, smelly ass crack, taking an extra amount of time whenever I would be forced to \u201cmake out\u201d with her asshole, usually pausing to give an especially big PPPPPRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTSSSSSSSSSsssss\u2026 It didn\u2019t get any better when Jackie took her hand out (making sure my face was plastered squarely against her ever-puckering hole). Though I could still see a small amount of light from my position deep in her crack from where her ass overflowed her shorts, without her hand to enlarge the opening, her horrible gas lingered that much longer\u2026 And to my horror, and Jackie\u2019s giggling delight, her farts were getting wetter and wetter\u2026 SSSPPPPPLLLLOOOORRRRHHHHHHH!!! SSSPPPPUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPTTTT!!! PPPPREEEEENNNNFLARTPLRRRRSHHH\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the very definition of hell, the whole time with Jackie thinking I was in my own personal heaven. \u201cOh my goddess, this just feels so GOOD!!! I\u2019m really glad you like this, Cutie Pie, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to stop now even if you didn\u2019t! Thank the goddess I don\u2019t have to worry about THAT! Hehehe.\u201d SSSSSPPPPPPPPPRRRRRRRRAAAAAAASSSSHHHHHHHHTTTTSppplllrrrpptt\u2026 \u201cOopsie, that one was a little wet, huh Little One?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could definitely attest to this, though a \u201clittle\u201d wet wasn\u2019t exactly an accurate description. I had been blasted by the shart at point blank range all over my face and front, even in my hair. \u201cMaybe I should take you out, wouldn\u2019t want you to\u2026 Wait\u2026 Oh my goddess\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a FANTASTIC idea!!!\u201d I had a horrible feeling about this, but there was absolutely nothing I could do but cough and hack, try not to make out with her asshole anymore, and lament about how she had sounded like she was going to take me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I was forced to smear my face all over her hole once again as Jackie suddenly got up and bounded off somewhere, her butt cheeks around me smashing and smothering me with every step, a chain of farts leaking out as she went. SSPPPLLLRRTT SSPPRRROMMMFFF SSPPRRAAAAPTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen light began pouring into my little hell and the pressure suddenly began to lessen, I gasped for fresh air. I was elated that apparently Jackie HAD decided to let me out\u2026 that was until my eyes focused to the light and I saw what was below me. I could only scream once again as Jackie wiggled out of her shorts, jostling me and sending me flying into open air\u2026 straight into her toilet with an audible SPLASH. Jackie looked down at me through her legs as she finally wrestled her way out of her tiny shorts (apparently not having bothered with panties any more than she had with a bra), a broad smile on her face. \u201cOh, figured it out already, huh? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re just as eager as I am! I\u2019m sure Jennifer farts around you all the time, but I doubt even SHE would take a big ol\u2019 dump around you, let alone ON you!!! Hehehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI literally was crying at this point as I tried to tread water, but Jackie was much too involved in making my \u201cdreams come true\u201d to notice. Before I knew it, her once heavenly ass plopped down on the toilet seat, leaving only a shaft of light through her legs that showed her smiling face enjoying every minute of this. Dejectedly, I swam further back to get away from that smile, only to realize that I was directly under her ass. SSSPPPPRRRROOOOOPPPPTTT!!! The rumbling fart took whatever fresh air the toilet had offered and immediately made everything smell like shit, but that smell only grew as I heard a very unladylike grunt from Jackie, followed by a crackling type of noise. I couldn\u2019t place it for a moment, until I looked up and saw a giant log slowly forcing its way out of Jackie\u2019s horrible brown hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately tried swimming to the side to try and climb above the waterline, and to my surprise, I actually able to climb up a little at a time. With a smile, I clung to the side just above the water, glad that I had escaped my horrid fate. But that smile was quickly wiped from my face, or more accurately smacked from it. While I had been climbing, Jackie\u2019s log had become an anaconda, and it just kept growing with horrible farts sneaking out every few seconds. SSSPPPRRRAAASSSSHHHTTT SSSPPPPLAAARRRTTT!!! Even as it hit the back of the bowl, it just bent and coiled around it, like some horrible form of soft serve. I looked just in time to get a huge taste of the nasty substance as it knocked me back under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came up, Jackie was still going, the soft log that had just smacked me coiling around like some enormous brown snake. I stared in disbelief, no normal person would ever be able to shit this much! Then again, Jackie WAS apparently a witch\u2026 SSSPPPPPRRRRROOOOSSSSHHHHTTTT!!! Either way, I was forced to watch (and occasionally be smacked around) by the never-ending log as it closed in more and more, until to my utter despair, the log finally did break off, only to completely bury me. As if to add insult to injury, she Jackie grunted a few more times, burying me with even more (relatively) smaller logs before she finally finished with a SSSPPPPPPRRRRRAAAAPPPPTTTT and a giggle, my only reply being to gargle on her \u201csoft serve\u201d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I scratched and clawed my way to the surface of the log coil/pile (more than anyone\u2019s fair share of shit having forced it\u2019s wait into my eyes and nose, not to mention down my throat), Jackie had put her shorts and shirt back on (or at least as well as they would allow) and was smiling over me. \u201cHehehe, took you long enough! I guess you were really enjoying yourself, huh? Normally taking a dump is so annoying, but I think it might be one of the most enjoyable parts of my day now!\u201d I couldn\u2019t even reply, my tongue too filled with the taste of shit. \u201cBut I suppose I should take you out of there since Jennifer will be home soon\u2026 But don\u2019t worry, I made sure not to wipe so you can continue to\u2026 \u201cindulge\u201d. Hehehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cried tears that left brown streaks running down my face as she reached for me, realizing that my life wasn\u2019t going to be anything but this for the foreseeable future, when suddenly Jackie was interrupted. \u201cMooom! Are you in the bathroom? Someone dared me to drink a carton of milk that was waaay past its expiration date, and\u2026 It\u2019s definitely NOT sitting well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked at me, the door, then back again, before that oh-so-horrible smirk crossed her face as she began whispering to me. \u201cYou know, you\u2019ve made me so happy\u2026 I think I\u2019ll let you \u201csay goodbye\u201d to Jennifer.

Immediately he was following her, his eyes glued to her booty the whole time as her chain belt jiggled against her love handles, her tight top clinging to these same handles with all its might. Soon it seemed like she was going to join a line for what appeared to be some kind of show tickets. Tom didn't know what it was for, but he knew he wanted to be in that line. Quickly he overtook her without her seeing him, quickly sitting down in line as she slowly came over and sat behind him. He kept glancing over his shoulder, trying to get up the nerve to talk to her, but suddenly he felt funny. Before he knew it he was no more than a few inches tall!!! He quickly looked to the big beauty behind him, hoping she had seen him, but apparently her and everyone else was looking somewhere else when he shrank. The woman slowly looked ahead and noticed Tom had disappeared, but unfortunately for him assumed he had just left, and proceeded to take his spot. Before he knew it the massive bulk of the woman had moved over him and her ass plopped down right in front of his face. He tried not to be turned on as her butt scooched around in front of him, her thong more than slightly visible. Sighing, he decided he had to get this girl's attention somehow, and the quickest way seemed to be to climb her back, Running to her pants, he planned to climb her thong to her chain belt to her purse strap to her shoulder. It seemed to be working until he got to the first string of her thong and he heard a massive rumble. PPPHHHHHRRRRTTTTT!!! Tom's eyes and nose burned as he was assaulted by a horrible stench as the woman looked back and forth, happy that seemingly no one noticed her raunchy fart. This gave her the bravery to blast another, this one much wetter. SSPPPPPRRRRSSSSHHH!!! Tom couldn't hold on anymore at this, and of course the woman decided to shift her hips back and forth just in time to shift the thong enough for him to fall in, sliding deep into her asscrack. SSSSPPPLLLLLUUUUURRRPPP!!! \"Uh oh... I really need to shit... but I'm not gonna lose my spot... Guess it's a good thing I wore my crappy jeans, 'cause they're about to live up to that name...\" Tom screams as his eyes adjust just in time to see a giant ass hole in front of him, right before a huge slimey log of shit pushed it's way out, smearing all over his body and forcing him to eat some just to breathe. \"Geez, I wouldn't want to be my pants today if it's already this bad, I still have to wait 4 hours until the line even starts moving...\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, he always was on the lookout for the awesome sights that only a big beautiful woman could provide, but this girl was perfect. He couldn't take his eyes off of her thong sticking out of her tight white pants as it jiggled along with her ass cheeks as the woman shifted back and forth talking with her friends. Only after he dropped his tray of food did he remember he was here to eat as well as ogle. But without any more money to buy food, apparently all he had left was ogling. Looking around to make sure no one saw him drop his tray, he wiped the drool of his lip and built up his courage to talk to this massive beauty. Unfortunately as he got closer to her, he began to feel queezy, a feeling that only got worse and worse the closer he got. Suddenly with a loud (at least to him) SNAP!!! he was falling through the air, only a few inches tall!!! His arms flailing wildly, he righted himself in the air just in time to see his destination as he slammed the BBW's huge thong clad ass. Unfortunately the mass under him reacted with massive jiggling, and soon he would fall to his death. Luckily the tag of her thong was hanging out, and at the last moment he grabbed hold of it. He sighed in relief as the girl's butt continued to jiggle softly until it suddenly heaved up, as the girl apparently got up to leave. \"Sorry guys, but I should be getting back home.\" Tom hangs on for dear life as her ass nearly jumps up and down of it's own accord, until you hear a \"Hiisssssssssssss\". He nearly hurls as an SBD seeps out of this girl's butt and nearly smothers him. Tom thanks god that at least he's outside her thong, but apparently he spoke too soon as the woman nonchalantly reaches back to tuck in her tag, unknowingly tucking in Tom as well. He screams as he slides down the thong into her raunchy crack, and almost cries as she notices her pants have slipped down and pulls them up, pushing Tom even deeper and smashing him against her asshole. PPPRRRAAAAPPPTTTT!!! \"Ooo, that was a good one. Better get home and get on the pot before Sis gets there.\" Tom is dry heaving at this point when suddenly he is blinded by light and tossed into cold water. The light only stays long enough for him to make the horrific realization that he's in a toilet before the girl's giant ass blocks it out. Tom screams to try and get this heffer's attention at just the right moment to get blasted with runny chunks of shit, some getting into his mouth. The next 15 minutes are spent just attempting to stay afloat as he is constantly pushed under by waves and logs of shit. Soon he finally pulls himself up onto a giant log as he watches the giant girl wipe her ass, not doing a very good job as she gets up and leaves, luckily not flushing. \"At least it's all over, now I just have to get ou--\" \"Jesus, Sis, took you long enough, you know I always end up sitting on the toilet for at least an hour after I get home from school!\" Tom really does cry this time as without looking an even bigger girl, apparently this one's sister, turns her massive dirty ass and plops it on the toilet with an audible groan. \"Ooof, the way this is feelin' it might be two hours today...\" SSSPPPPLLLLOOOOOOORRSSSSSHHHHH!!!</span></div></div>",

Helping girls find bras that could fit their bouncing breasts, or even better, underwear that fit their bubble butts, was great. The only thing he regretted was that Victoria's Secret didn't make underwear for plus size girls, so he never got to see the BBWs he craved. All that changed one day when a middle-aged woman walked in, nearly knocking over a perfume display with her absolutely humongous ass as her hips slammed violently back and forth, her ass jiggling like mad, only barely contained by a very thin pair of pink stretch pants that showed a VERY visible pantyline. Tom is immediately hypnotized and practically runs to help her. Unfortunately in his haste he trips over a display and flies headlong towards the woman. He closes his eyes for the impact, but it never comes. Tom opens his eyes to see that somehow he's shrank, and he's flying through the air!!! He saw the huge woman looking through panties that were sizes upon sizes too small for her, and soon he found himself slamming down on the same table flying through and getting tangled in a bunch of girls' underwear. He looked up to see the woman look almost directly at him, but apparently didn't see him. \"Hmm... I need to find a pair of underwear that isn't going to show pantylines... and having it dig deep into my crack is always a plus... And I definitely hope they can surpress horrible farts...\" Tom screams as the woman grabs a wad of the panties that unfortunately he's tangled in and sneaks off to the dressing room. Tom is horrified as the woman forces her way too tight pants down over her hips along with her equally tight panties. He's even more horrified when he sees the shit streaked ass end. He screams as the woman picks up a small pair of panties which unfortunately he ends up in. He tries to get her attention, but unfortunately all he gets is a huge view of her ass, and soon after her asscrack as he is wedged deep. He's forced even deeper as the woman forces her pants back on and bends over in the mirror. PPPPPHHHHRRRRRTTTT!!! \"Oof, these won't do, the pantylines are horrible and it didn't block my fart at all!\" Soon Tom sees some light as the woman gets her panties off, but unfortunately he's left in her crack as she forces on a thong this time, then her pants again, the thong digging much deeper and forcing him deeper into her stink. SSSPPPPRRRRRAAAAPPPPTTT!!! \"No, no, no, I can see the little triangle, and that fart smells just as bad as ever!!! Tom wriggled like mad to escape as she changed again, but cried as the woman forced on an absolutely tiny g-string. He was forced deep into her crack, until as his eyes adjusted he could see her bulging asshole in front of him. Unfortunately it gets worse as she bends over and the g-string plasters you up against her asshole. PPPPSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh,,, Tom hardly could stay conscious as the woman wiggled her hips back and forth. \"Oooooh yeah, I don't know what it is about this g-string, but it feels GREAT against my hole... And the fart was kinda quieted too! These are definitely the ones, just hope I can get them off when I need to shit, they're super tight...\" SSSPPPLLLOOOOORRRSSSHHHH!!!</span></div></div>",

Usually he would like someone with a little more meat on her bones, but at least she had an absolutely massive ass. Tom could barely hold back his excitement as he was escorted to Mandy's (the model's) dressing room. He sat down in a chair and was left there alone surrounded by the model's tiny outfits that looked like there was no way they would fit her huge ass. Getting a little curious he started looking at the clothes, when he saw an outfit set out, or at least the bottom half was. He was turned on as he saw the tiny pants and red panties. But that horniness turned to disgust as he saw the red panties had a huge shit streak in the ass section of them. Tom was about to make a hasty retreat when he got a whiff of the horrible stink from her panties. His head felt dizzy as the smell only got stronger, until suddenly he seemed to be getting smaller!!! Before he knew it he fell face first into the shit streak of her panties, her shit smearing on his face as he got up. Of course Mandy picks this moment to come in completely naked! \"Hmm... I was gonna really surprise that contest winner... Guess he must have chickened out. Oh well, I'm feeling really gassy today anyway, it would have sucked to have to hold it in around him.\" Tom jumped and screamed as she grabbed her panties, but he should have used the time to run as Mandy totally missed him and he was smashed into her ass, the smell from her panties getting 10 times worse as it mixed with the rest of her ass smells. He hoped to god that it wouldn't get worse, but unfortunately for Tom Mandy had gained a little weight and the pants she was to wear were already insanely tight before!!! Tom cried as Mandy struggled for what seemed like a half an hour to get the pants on, each tug and twist digging him deeper into her crack until he was being smeared into her sweaty shit stained asshole. Mandy eventually seemed to get the pants buttoned finally, forcing his body to be plastered to her anus as it suddenly bulged out. PPPHHHHRRRRAAAAAPPPTTTT!!! \"Oh yeah, that would have been a killer to hold in... Hmm... something's up with my panties, they itch like hell today...\" Tom screams but his mouth is soon filled with asshole flesh and ass gas as Mandy itches her asshole through her pants as she continued to fart nonstop. SSPPPRRTTT, SPPRRAAAPPP, SSPPPRRRSSSHHH!!! \"Ooooo, damn it, I knew I should have taken a shit before I got these pants on...\" Tom was soon blasted with an especially raunchy fart that splattered his face with shit. \"Damn it, I gotta get these pants off!\" Tom was put through hell as her farts got wetter and wetter, until a huge slimy log pushed it's way out and smothered his face, forcing him to eat some just to breathe. \"Oh my god, I can't get them o--- shit.\" Tom ended up experiencing Mandy shit her pants first hand drowning him in chunky liquidy shit. \"Oh geez, not again... at least that contest winner wasn't here...\"</span></div></div>",

She always seemed to be bumping into him, or squishing him against the wall when she passed him in their tight hallways. He loved it most of all when she would bend over right in front of him when he was watching TV, it was definitely his favorite 'channel'. Of course it had been a pretty bad experience the one time she had farted right into his face like this, but with how she was around him all the rest of the time, it wasn't that bad to have something like that happen once. Normally he would only be able to appreciate her during the day since she slept in the guest room on the other side of his house, but Tom was in luck yet again as his parents were renovating it. And his sister was gone this week for summer camp, so she would be staying in her room right next door!!! Tom couldn't wait until nightfall, and it seemed like it took forever for the sun to go down. As quietly as he could, Tom snuck out of his room and into his sister's, hoping to god that Misty wouldn't catch him. Luckily she was fast asleep, snoring quite loudly. Tom stared in awe as he saw his crush in nothing but a frilly pair of panties, having tossed her blankets away as her body was glistening with sweat. He couldn't resist and moved closer, hoping to be able to touch her massive booty. He slowly reached out his hand, but just as it touched her jiggling flesh, a sickening sensation ripped through his body, and he was shrunk!!! He looked around and saw her absolutely enormous ass beside him, and thanked god that he hadn't fallen into her crack as the smell of her ass sweat surrounded him. Unfortunately for him Misty chose now to roll over, her ass crack engulfing him in the process. \"Mmm... Tom's in the living room watching TV again... I'm so gonna bend over in front of him, I know he loves it...\" Misty's apparently dreaming about Tom, which would be totally hot if he wasn't currently almost drowning in her ass sweat. \"Oh yeah... he's totally staring at it... Oh crap, not now...\" Tom stopped as he heard a rumble from above, and hoped to god she wasn't dreaming about the time she--PPPPHHHHRRRRAAAAPPPTTT!!! \"Oh my gosh, Tom, I'm so --- SPPPRRRRSSSSHHHTTTT!!! Sorry. Don't worry I'll get out of your wa--Oops.\" Tom wonders what that was about as he feel her ass press down even harder on him. \"Oh my gosh, I really didn't mean to fall and smother your face Tom but... now that I have... It feels so gooooood.\" SSPPPPRRRAAAAPPPTTTT!!! \"Sorry, I'm really gassy today. Oh, and my pants are falling down too...\" Tom cries as she pulls down her panties still in her sleep, dragging him ever deeper. SSSPPPRRRRSSSSSHHHH!!! \"Oops, that was more than gas... let me get up-- Oh crap, I'm stuck. SSPPPRRRROOOOOOSSShhhheeeeennn... Sorry Tom...\" Tom screams as he is burried in Misty's chunky shit, soon only his head is barely showing with the rest of his body burried as Misty seems to wake up. \"Damn it, not that dream again... It's really hot but I always have to clean up after... Tom?!\" Tom is relieved that she noticed him, but only for a moment. \"Oh my gosh!!! You must have known how I liked farting in your face and shrunk yourself down for me to make it even better!!! That's so awesome! I'll never forget this Tom, and I'm gonna make sure I fart and shit on you as much as I can for the rest of your life!\" Before he can say anything more, misty settles her ass back onto the pile of shit and Tom.

Her body jiggled with every footfall, that fat continuing to shake for what seemed like minutes even after she stopped. He blushed as the girl caught him staring a few times, and she started to show off, making sure to bend over and show her huge cleavage, or shaking her ass a little more as she ran. But as she was doing this, the woman suddenly tripped, falling hard on her ass. Tom quickly ran up to her and offered to help her up. \"Thanks... Ouch that really hurt... I think that's gonna leave a big bruise...Umm... I know this is really straightforward, but my butt's too big for me to look back at it... Could you come to my house and look to see if it bruised? I was thinking of wearing a really short skirt later and can't wear it with a big black and blue mark.\" Tom couldn't believe his luck, this beauty wanted him to check out her ass!!! He of course agreed and in no time they were at her house. The woman giggled as she pushed him onto the couch, taking off her shirt and showing a lacy cami underneath. Tom was so turned on he was getting lightheaded... Until he suddenly shrunk!!! The woman continued and soon had her pants off and lifted up her cami to show off her ass as she looked back to see Tom had disappeared! Tom jumped up and down and she luckily saw him. \"Oh my gosh, look at you!!! You're tiny! What happened?\" \"Umm... I have no idea...\" \"Oh... I get it, you wanted to make real sure I didn't have a bruise anywhere on my ass, so you shrunk yourself so you could see better!!!\" Before Tom could reply she quickly grabbed him and slammed him against her sweaty stinky ass cheek. \"Do you see any bruising?\" \"Mmmrrpphhh...\" \"I take that as a no, but you know... I think there might be one in between my ass cheeks...\" Tom screamed as the woman pulled back a cheek to show a totally shit stained crack. Unfortunately for him she was VERY thorough, and smeared him all over her crack until he was covered in her shit. \"Hmm... no bruising huh? Well, I know you want to do the best for me, hell you shrunk yourself for me, so my asshole kinda hurts, you could rub it, right?\" Before TOm can say no, she has his face smothered against her asshole. PPPHHHHRRRTTTT!!! \"Whoops, sorry about that, but if you shrank yourself down to get closer to my butt you must have known what you were getting yourself into.\" SSSPPPLLLUUUUURRRSSSHHH!!! \"Ooo, that was a wet one, hopefully I don't SSPPPRRRTTTT, SSPPPLLLLAAARRRTTT SPPPreeeeeennnnplopplop. Damn... happens every time I scratch my asshole.\" She giggled as she dropped Tom into the pile of shit she had released. \"Do me a favor and clean that up hun, I'll make sure to come back for you when my ass itches again!\"</span></div></div>",

He was even happy with the flight, or at least most of it. He had thought he was going to get a whole three seat row to himself, but unfortunately as he took the window seat a very huge-assed BBW took the other two, smashing him against the window with her flab. He tried to introduce himself but she didn't even seem to notice him as she continually stuffed her face the entire flight. She seemed to be going back home to Hawaii herself, her skin the absolute perfect skin tone, not to mention she was wearing a very small sash-style black skirt and tight yellow spaghetti-strap top. She was pretty warm as well, as soon her sweat was soaking through her clothes, especially as she seemed to get tired and fell asleep against him and her boob almost smothered his face, forcing him to swallow more than a bit of it. He was only freed when the woman finally got off when the plane touched down, and Tom almost forgot about her horrible smothering as she still seemed to not notice him and walked off, her ass jiggling with the slightest motion. Tom tried to shrug it off even as his clothes were soaked with the woman's sweat, there was no way anyone was going to ruin this vacation!!! Tom was greatful as he was taken by car to his hotel, being told that his bags would be brought to his hotel room later. He quickly ran up to his sweet, flopping onto the huge bed. Soon he was riffling through the all included minibar, and saw a small unmarked bottle in the back. \"Hmm... what the hell.\" Before giving it a second thought, Tom gulped the vial down, and immediately felt strange. Soon his head was spinning as he fell back onto the bed... His eyes slowly came back into focus only to see that he was tiny!!! He had no idea what to do when suddenly he felt trembling under his feet getting closer and closer, until suddenly the hotel door burst open. It was the Hawaiian woman!!! \"Aaahhh, it sucks to not be able to go home until the renivations are all done, but at least I get an awesome hotel room!!!\" Before Tom could get her attention, he watched in horror as she ran with more speed than someone her size should be able and dove onto the bed. He screamed as her top slid up her huge stomach and soon all he saw was darkness. He couldn't tell at first what had happened, until his nose was attacked by a horrible smell. As his eyes adjusted, he realized he had been trapped in her belly button!!! Sticky belly lint was all over himself, and he was stuck to the bed as the woman got back up. He tried to move but ended up falling back spread eagle as the woman spun around, her skirt flitting up to show she wasn't wearing panties and her ass crack was VERY dirty and coming straight for him!!! He screamed as her ass came down like a comet, smothering his world in nauxious shitty film. She scooted her ass back and forth, no doubt she would have ruined the bedspread if she wasn't smearing almost everything onto Tom. PPPHHHHHRRRRAAAAATTTTT!!! \"Whoops, guess I ate a little fast on the flight...\" SSPPPRRRTTTT SPPPRRAAAASSSHHH SPPRREEEENNNNppprrrrrrrttttt.... The woman giggled a bit as she ground her ass into the bed again, Tom being smeared all over her anus. \"Man, my asshole itches...\" Tom was relieved as he was slowly taken out of his hell hole, but only for a few moments. \"What the hell... What the hell are-- How did you get so small?! Wait... I know you... You're that kid who sat next to me on the plane... Don't think I didn't notice you trying to rub up against my hotness! That's what this is isn't it? You shrank yourself to be closer to my ass!!!\" Tom just stared in disbelief as the woman just giggled more. \"This is great!!! But you know, if you REALLY want to experience my ass... I need to be on a toilet.\" Before Tom could say a word she was in the bathroom and had tossed him in the toilet, her huge tan ass soon blocking all light but the faintest sliver between her huge thighs. \"Get ready Toilet Boy!!!\" Tom screamed as he saw her dirty asshole bulge then rip wide as a huge log forced it's way out. The thing was huge and snaked it's way around the toilet, giving Tom less and less space until he was forced to climb on it. SSSPPPPRRRSSSHHHH!!! Suddenly it ripped open again as diarrhea spewed all over him, nearly drowning him before she was done, leaving him plastered to the huge log, unable to move a finger. \"Oh man, that was awesome!!! I'm gonna go get something to eat, you stick around until I need to make a return trip. Don't worry, I'll make sure I take you to my renovated house with my new huge toilet!!!\"</span></div></div>",

He seemed to have picked everything up he needed, and he already had a bag of sugar in the house... Or so he thought. As he looked in the cupboard to grab it however, he found it wasn't there. \"Where the hell did it go?\" Suddenly Tom remembered that he had given it to the girl's next door, as apparently they themselves were going to try and make a whole bunch of sweets for themselves. He of course wasn't able to say no to the huge trio of Latin beauties, and he watched as they walked away, their huge bubble butts jiggling like mad in unison with each step. But now he was in a bind. Knowing them they would have used the whole bag and eaten every bit of sweets they made that day, but it was either try and ask for some back or drive all the way back to the store. With a sigh he made his way over to their house, and knocked at the door. He heard a bunch of rustling on the other side of the door, then a bunch of yelling, then bangs and booms that he could have sworn was the girls wrestling. Suddenly the door flew open and somehow (only god knows how with how huge each of them were) all three of the girls fell out of the door in a heap, right on Tom. He could hardly breathe under their immense weight, and was smothered with sweaty flesh, which he couldn't tell where one of the girls' asses ended and another's huge stomach began until everyone slowly got off of him. \"Sorry Tom, we were just in such a hurry to answer the door.\" Tom blushed and said no problem as Maria apologized, standing in a too tight sports bra and a pair of tiny spandex shorts. \"Yeah, sorry Tom, but you know how Maria is, she's like such a clutz!!!\" Elsa giggled loudly as Tom saw her breasts jiggle in a tight spaghetti top and a short skirt. \"Pssh, forgive them Tom, I know you know both of them combined can't have more than a handful of braincells. Tom couldn't help but stair mouth agape as Mercedes crossed her arms over her massive barely bra covered breasts, visible drool forming as he watched her bend over to help her sisters up and showed off her chunky ass in a small pair of boxer shorts. \"Umm... Don't worry about it... I was just wondering if you guys had some sugar left over from the other day?\" \"Oh, was that it?\" Elsa pouted, seemingly having hoped for something else. Mercedes glared at her, before replying. \"Yeah, we still have a little left Tom, come on in and we'll get it for you. \"But Mercedes...\" Maria whined, before Mercedes shut her up with a glare as well. \"You two go to your room and leave Tom alone, Tom, go sit on the couch, I'll go dig around and find the sugar in the kitchen.\" Tom smiled as the three girls walked in seperate directions as he made his way to the livingroom couch. Unfortunately as he was sitting down, a strange feeling washed over him, and as he hit the couch, he found he was tiny!!! He stood up on the beat up cushion, the smell of ass sweat from those huge sisters having used this couch for so long wafting into his nostrils. He was so taken back by the smell that he almost didn't notice Maria tiptoe in, or as best someone her size can tiptoe. She seemed crestfallen as she didn't see him, and before he could get her attention he saw her huge ass come down, splattering him into the couch. \"Must have went to the bathroom... I'll wait for a bit...\" Unfortunately for Tom her spandex shorts had fallen, and apparently had been trapping a bunch of sweat, all of which poured out of her shorts right into Tom's face and mouth as he was forced to swallow it or drown. Tom screamed as Maria pressed of of him to get up, apparently going to find him. Tom couldn't even move, which was made worse as he saw Elsa sneak in, her skirt swaying back and forth as she made her way to the couch. \"Damn it... did he already leave? God, that Mercedes is such a killjoy...\" Elsa giggled to herself as she absentmindedly swayed her skirt back and forth, easily showing off her tiny thong underneath as once again Tom watched as a huge ass plopped onto him. Tom thanked god that the thong was blocking him from going much deeper in her asscrack, because he could already see and feel uncleaned shit being smeared on him. PPHHHHRRRRRBBBBBRRRRaaaaaattttatatata... \"Oh wow, maybe it was a good thing Tom left. Hehehe.\" Elsa continued to giggle and rip horrible ass on poor Tom, until Mercedes finally made her way into the livingroom. \"Hmm, sorry Tom, it looks like we used it all after... all? What the hell are you doing Elsa? It stinks like absolute hell in here!!!\" \"No it doesn't... it just smells like my butt!\" Mercedes rolled her eyes and plugged her nose. \"What happened to Tom? Probably got scared away by your farts.\" \"Oh, I thought he left.\" \"Oh well... scoot over, you know I like the middle cushion, it's the least beat up.\" Elsa stuck her tongue out at Mercedes, which caused her to snap and leap on her sister as the wrestled for the spot. Tom was in absolute hell as he was crushed by both Elsa's ass, then Mercedes' sweat soaked boxers, both of them ripping ass as they went. PPHHHRRRTTT PPRREEEENNN!!! SPPOOORTTT!!! Soon Maria came in and joined the fray, only adding yet another horrible smell. Suddenly Tom was saved as all three girls stopped and were looking right at him. \"Oh my gosh... TOM!!! Oh my gosh, we gotta help him!\" \"Yeah, he's so tiny and helpless!!!\" Mercedes quickly shut up her sisters once again. \"Wait... This is way too coincidental... You need sugar when you know full well we'll have used it all up... then you know we'll have you sit on the couch, then you shrink and hide well enough that at the very least Elsa farted all over you!!! You must... you must have set it all up!!! Our dream finally came true girls!!!\" Tom screamed as Maria and Elsa quickly excepted Mercedes' explanation and before he knew it, they all had their huge bare asses pointing at him. \"This is so great, now we get to fart on him as much as we want, and he totally loves it!!!\" SSPPPOOORTTTTT SPPPRRAAAPPPTTTT SPPREEEENNN SLUUUUUUUURRRRSSSHHHH!!! Tom cried as he was not only covered in gas, but also huge logs, chunky shit, and waves of diarrhea. \"Oops, guess that was a little more than farts... but he would have gotten out of the way if he didn't like that too... wouldn't he have? Hehehe.\"</span></div></div>",

It had seemed to take him forever, but what had at first been just a curiousity had become an obsession for him.  It wasn't his normal job, and he wasn't payed much, but Tom loved Rumor Hunting.  He had already found the origins of several urban legends that surrounded his hometown, and this one (a case of multiple disappearances that all seemed to have happened at the same place, but no one knew specifically where) was a real doozy.  After a few weeks of badgering his cop buddy, he had finally gotten the information he was looking for.  Apparently all of these disappearances had been focused around an obese Samoan woman's house, but every time the police had investigated they had found absolutely nothing.  Even more perplexing was the fact that even though they could pinpoint all of the missing persons going missing around (or as was suspected, in) the woman's house, she apparently had no idea about any of them. She had cooperated as best she could with the investigators, even agreeing to three seperate polygraph tests, all coming back that she was telling the truth about not even knowing the people who disappeared.  Most of them were either delivery men or handymen who were supposed to have been at her house around the time they disappeared, but according to Saila (the woman) and the polygraph, none of them had showed.  Tom somewhat thought of himself as a cold case detective, and even if the police couldn't prove anything, he was determined to get to the bottom of this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there he was, standing in front of Saila's house, readying himself to sneak in and figure out what was really happening.  With a deep breath and a quick check to make sure no one was around, Tom quickly darted up the walkway, hiding behind a nearby bush as he saw the Saila through the window. The FA in him didn't miss the fact that she was a beautiful pearshaped girl, not to mention that she was only wearing a too small  turquoise bra with her breasts pouring over the cups and a pair of matching panties (or they were originally panties, but apparently her ass had grown and had turned them into a thong).  He shook off these thoughts, trying to keep his head in the game and remember that this woman had apparently made a bunch of people vanish into thin air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as she made her way into what he guessed was her bedroom near the back of the house and prayed to whatever higher being there was that the door wouldn't creak as he snuck in.  Luckily it didn't make a sound, as he heard Saila close her door and hoped she was going to bed seeing as the sun had just gone down.  He was about to make his way quickly into the living room, hoping to find something to get him started, but his attention was drawn to a glass case against the wall in the entryway with what looked to be a large pendant.  His eyes couldn't pull away, and he could barely keep himself from reaching out to it as his vision slowly started to blur.  Suddenly there was a tremendous flash and the next thing he knew he was unconscious...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to he heard rumbling all around, and was horrified to find he was only a few inches tall!!!  He quickly realized that someway, somehow, the pendant must have shrank all those other people too.  Unfortunately he didn't have much time to think about it as he suddenly saw the cause of the rumbling was Saila walking to the door.  She was absolutely massive, even given the size difference, and now he realized that she apparently didn't have air conditioning as she was glistening with sweat.  \"I swear I shut that door, damn thing.\"  Tom tried to jump and scream, but Saila never even looked down, and Tom was quickly stepped on as she shut the door.  \"Luckily\" he was only between her toes, but unluckily those toes were smothering him with toejam and sweat.  He screamed like mad, only forcing some of the muck to get in his mouth, as Saila made her way to the living room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom soon was dislodged and sent flying as Saila walked, landing on a very used couch.  He pushed himself up to see that he was in the middle of a giant crater in the middle of three cushions, the one nearby having a similar crater. He was horrified as he realized that her ass must take up both cushions!!!  He ran in the opposite direction, having no interest in being smashed.  Tom was happy he had made the right call when Saila slammed her ass down right behind him, sending him falling onto the last barely open cushion.  But he didn't get up fast enough, and rolled over just in time for her lay on the couch on her side, her arm going up and him being trapped in the dank prison of her armpit.  It smelt horrible, and he swore he felt hairs rubbing against his face with disgust until Saila finally got up and scratched her armpit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on what looked to be a soft cloth, as he looked up at his unaware tormentor.  He hadn't noticed that she was wearing glasses until she took them off and rubbed her eyes, setting them down nearby before, to his horror, she grabbed the 'cloth' he was on.  He realized too late that it was a kleenex, and before he could get away he was blasted with waves of snot.  He could barely breathe by the time she stopped, but he was elated to see that she was looking right at him!!!  \"Oh gross, another one of those damn bugs...  Well, down the toilet you go to see your brothers and sisters Little Buggy.\"  She still wasn't wearing her glasses!!! Tom came to the conclusion that his 'brothers and sisters' must have been the missing people. At least he had figured out the rumor... now if he could only survive...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look good as Saila made her way to the bathroom and tossed him in.  The snot keeping him stuck to the kleenex as the kleenex kept him afloat and gave him a great view of what happened next.  PPPPHHHHRRRRTTTT!!!  \"Whoopsy, I always have to go to the bathroom when I flush one of you buggies.\"  Tom cried as he saw her wrench down her panties with some difficulty, before plopping her giant ass on the toilet.  He cried even more as he saw he was right under her ass hole as it bulged before blasting runny chunky shit all over him.  It didn't get better when the force of the shit freed him from the kleenex, as he was quickly almost drowned in a brown flood.  \"Aaawww, it always seems to come out easier when a buggy is cheering me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom could only wave an arm in meekly as she got up without wiping, her glasses finally back on.  \"Little Buggy? Wait your not... Oh my gosh!!! You're a person!!!\"  Tom was elated that she had seen him, too exhausted to even speak as she got him out and cleaned him up.  \"Oh my gosh, that's so weird.  Here I was having fun thinking I was taking a dump on a bug, and now I found out it was a guy!!!  Don't worry, I'll take care of you for free and everything, but... well I wasn't kidding when I said it comes out easier when there's a bug in there, and I'm sure it'll be even better if you're there. Hehehe.\"  Tom was about to protest but she quickly brought him around to her ass for 'safe keeping', dropping him into her panties she was finally wrenching back up.  Tom started crying again as he realized she still hadn't wiped... PPPHHHHRRRRAAPT!</span></div></div>",

He smiled, knowing that not only was this a perfect place to get some rest and relaxation, but... well... it was the perfect place to check out some butts, and if he was lucky they would be of the bigger variety.  He would have to get up soon and take a look around, but for now he was happy that he had gotten a prime spot, even as the areas around him filled up with huge amounts of people. Soon he found himself getting a little bit sleepy, and almost fell asleep when he suddenly startled himself awake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately when he opened his eyes everything around him was... HUGE!!! Or more correctly, he was tiny!  He had no idea what had happened, but he knew he  had to get some help... somehow.  But fate apparently had decided for him as he saw a colossal shadow fall over his towel.  As he looked up, his eyes became the size of saucers as he saw the figure who was blocking out his sun.  It was a absolutely mammoth woman!!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forgot about his size for a few moments as he watched her humongous thighs jiggle as she stepped up to his towel and looked around, her swimsuit (though a seemingly large navy blue one piece) was slightly too small for her and clung harshly to every curve, and only seemed to accent her jiggling.  He couldn't help but notice she had left on a white spaghetti string top that was MUCH too small, and had slid up her stomach to barely hold onto her bouncing breasts, and by the size of them they needed the extra support.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom only snapped out of his stupor as the woman stepped up right next to his towel, and he realized the reason she kept looking around was because she was going to take his spot!!!  He jumped and flailed to try and get her attention, but unfortunately she was too into making sure that the person who owned your spot wasn't around (though she would never think to look down for a tiny man).  Without a thought, and without giving you a moment to react, the woman flops down on her stomach, smashing you with her gigantic breasts!!! SQUIILLSHHH!!!  Tom was bombarded by the apparently very sweaty material of both her swimsuit and top, the smell almost as strong as the pressure as the woman shifted back and forth to get comfy.  Tom tried to scream but just got a mouthful of sweaty fabric until the woman finally decided to get up minutes later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted up, he was lifted as well for a few seconds, but unfortunately soon fell back onto the towel, just in time for her to slam her monstrous ass down onto him!!!  Tom almost cried as he realized that if he thought the smell of her breast sweat was bad, he had absolutely no idea what a bad smell was.  He was crushed to a pulp as the woman shifted constantly back and forth humming a tune to herself, what little breath he got being stale with the stink of ass sweat and shit.  As she continued to shift, the swimsuit material was quickly swallowed by her ass crack, bringing him along with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried in horror as the woman decided to get up and brought him along again, but instead of falling again as he had hoped the woman pulled out her wedgie, and somehow pulled the material over him!!!  Taking off for the beach this time. Tom fought back vomiting as the smell got 100 times worse as the material once again began to form a wedgie, this time with him as the forefront.  PPPRRRRRPPPTTTT!!!  \"Whoopsie... Oh well, no one'll be able to hear me over the waves anyway...\"  PPPRRRAAAPPPTTT!!! Tom was bombarded by fart after fart, his only solace being that he wasn't too deep yet.  That quickly changed as the woman bent over as she waded into the water to splash some on her legs, her swimsuit rocketing up her crack and smashing him into her asshole.  He actually did vomit this time as the shit smeared pucker ground against him.  PPPPRRRRRAAAAPPPPTTTFFFFF!!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried to hold his breath, but unfortunately the woman squatted into the water, nearly drowning him and only offering her farts for him  to breath.  He cried in disgust, knowing that the only reason he could even survive on such a vile gas was because of how small he was and how little oxygen he actually needed.  The woman finally stood up, but just as Tom took a breath...  PPPPLLLLUUUUUUUPPPPSSSSHHHHH!!!  He was attacked by a horribly wet fart, some shitty bits spraying and one hitting him right in the face.  \"Ooo... that was a wet one...  I should probably get to the restroo---\" PPPLLLLAAARRRSSSHHHHHH!!! \"Oh no, not now, not again!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom screamed one final time as he saw her hole bulge out hugely, before ripping open and spewing shit all over him!!! Tom was completely smothered with her shit as the liquidy mess sprayed everywhere.  The woman blushed madly as Tom was forced to eat shit just to breath as the woman ripped a few more farts.  \"Well... I'll just have to squat down into the water and hope it slowly washes out...\"  PPPHHHRRRRPPPTTT!!!  Tom felt a tear roll down his face as he realized that he'd have to pray she kept farting on him, the only alternative being drowning in liquidy shit and water...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom sat in the restaurant, waiting for his date.  He wasn't exactly extatic about it, having only agreed to ask the girl out on a dare from his bodies expecting her to say no.  It wasn't that she wasn't attractive or nice, she was actually a pretty attractive in most people's eyes and was very nice, she just wasn't really his type.  The type Tom liked were the bigger girls, bigger than big in most cases, the BBWs.  But this girl could barely be called chubby from what little he had seen of her, though he had to admit that wasn't much since she was always behind a desk at his work as one of the higher-up's secretaries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed a little to himself, suddenly wishing that he hadn't asked her on this date, that he wasn't really sitting in this chair...  When suddenly he wasn't.  In fact, he felt like he was falling through the air!  In horror, he realized that he was doing exactly that, and before he knew it he landed on the table in a heap.  With a moan of slight pain he pushed himself up, half expecting the table to give out under his weight at any moment and fully expecting the whole authentic Mexican restaurant to be staring at him.  When neither seemed to be occurring, he looked around in confusion and stood up.  Something wasn't right.  He looked from right to left, before it suddenly dawned on him, everyone was giant around him, not to mention everything!!!  He was standing on the table next to a napkin/silverware bundle, and he had somehow shrunk to only a few inches!!!  He tried not to panic, but there wasn't much else he could do at this point, especially since it seemed that no one else had even realized he was gone!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing up a storm, he suddenly stopped in his tracks when he heard the hostess above the din of the restaurant. \"Party of two for Tom? Oh yes, Tom is already waiting for you at the table. Right this way.\"  He couldn't believe it.  Not only was he shrunk to a few inches, but now his date was going to probably be the one to find him!  This wasn't so bad, he decided, since she was a very nice person, but he wouldn't have minded her being a bit on the attractive side as well...  But to his amazement, being led by the hostess was not a barely chubby woman, but an absolutely pear-shaped goddess!!!  He couldn't believe his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the stomach up she looked as she normally did, a barely chubby secretary, but from the waist down... Well it was like her hips had exploded!!!  She was wearing a pink short tee up top, and a pair of jeans below that Tom had no idea how she managed to get on.  She must have searched for hours to find a pair that not only fit her colossal ass, but also conformed to her comparatively small hips, and even then she still was wearing a belt!  She walked in 3 inch strappy heels, her hips slamming from side to side, her butt no doubt jiggling like mad with every step.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was so mesmerized that he didn't even try to hide and continued standing by the napkin as the hostess sat his giant date.  \"Hmm... he must have just went to the bathroom, I'm sure he'll be back in a moment.\"  The woman nodded and sat, her comparitively small breasts still jiggling and shaking like twin unreal balloons at his size.  He stared up at her as she quietly mumbled to herself, loud enough only he could hear.  \"This is so embarrassing, if it had been anyone but Tom I would have said no... I've never been out with a boy, even the idea of it makes me too nervous.  I should just leave before Tom gets ba--.... TOM?!\"  Tom jumped as his date suddenly spotted him, glad her outburst had apparently gone unnoticed by the rest of the guests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he is suddenly very happy with being found by this BBW beauty, he quickly waves to make sure she knows he's real.  \"Maria!!! You have to help me!  I was sitting here thinking about you and... I somehow shrunk!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked at him quizically for a moment, apparently he was hard to hear.  \"You were thinking about me... and just shrunk? You mean you shrank yourself for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I was thinking about us dating and had a weird feeling and then--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? You were thinking about my feelings? You mean... Oh my gosh!  You mean you knew about my feelings about being embarrassed about going out with a guy and shrunk yourself?! That's so great, Tom! I knew it was a good idea to go on a date with you!\"  Tom just stared at her dumbfounded. Did she really think he did this on his own?  \"This is so great, now I can go on a date with you and no one needs to know!  And since you shrank yourself... you must be able to grow back! It's kind of hard to hear you, so just grow back if you get uncomfortable, K?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was about to yell that he couldn't grow back, that he hadn't done this on purpose, when suddenly Maria's face contorted, followed by an \"Aaa... Aaaa---- AAAACCHOOOO!!!\"  To Tom's horror, and with perfect timing as he opened his mouth to yell, he was sprayed with mucus from head to toe, a lot of it getting into his mouth.  He tried to spit it out and wipe the junk off his face, but before he knew it it dried like glue, his mouth being stuck shut!!!  \"Oh my gosh Tom, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to... I don't blame you if you grow back and leave right now...\"  Tom wanted to tell her that was disgusting, but without being able to open his mouth, he was forced to just stand and look at her, obviously unable to grow back.  \"Tom... Are you saying you're alright with that? I mean... even though I sneezed all over you you still want to do this date with me?  ...You're the best!\"  Tom screamed internally, this gal may have been beautiful, but she wasn't very bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Tom, this really is great.  Now that you're tiny like this, we can go on all the dates we want and no one has to know I'm out with a guy!!!\"  Tom just stared at her dumbfounded, as the waitress came over to get Maria's order.  Before Tom could try and get the waitress' attention to get away from this oblivious woman, Maria quickly grabbed him and folded her arms, unfortunately slamming him right into her armpit under the short-sleeved shirt.  Tom could actually scream now as Maria's rancid sweat melted the snot, but he almost wished he couldn't as this allowed gallons of the sweat to force it's way down his throat before she finally pulled him out.  \"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry about that, Tom, but you know how nervous I am... You're sure you don't mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom glared at her, sure she wouldn't be able to hear him no matter what he said, so he replied sarcastically.  \"Of course I don't mind... Why would I mind getting snot blown all over me or being forced into your sweaty armpit?\"  But with his luck, apparently the room was just quiet enough for her to hear at that moment, and of course she took him seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you can stand that stuff Tom but... you must really like being with me!  Don't worry, I'll make sure you're with me every second until you decide to grow back!\"  With this, and before Tom could protest, she decided to push him in between her breasts, giving him a good view, though he was stuck from the waist down in breast fat.  After a few moments the waitress came back with heeping platefuls of burritos, tacos, and nachos.  Apparently Maria  was VERY hungry.  As Tom stared on in astonishment, Maria began digging in, smashing dishful after dishful of Mexican into her gullet.  She was very messy about it as well, bits and pieces falling out of her mouth as she chewed and all over her cleavage and Tom.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom couldn't believe she had eaten it all.  But after paying her bill, she he found her walking down the street, apparently making her way home.  \"I guess since you haven't grown back, you must want to come home with me, huh?  You're a naughty guy, but you're so cute I guess I'll let it slide. But we have to go quite a ways through a bunch of people... How about this, how do want me to take you home? Or more to the point... where on me would you like me to put you?\"  She blushed at her own attempt to be sexy, but Tom, unfortunately, wasn't even paying attention to her at this point, talking to himself as he was still reeling from her enormous meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder why she doesn't have hardly any fat up top, she eats so much so fast it goes straight past her top and right into those butt cheeks.\"  Maria blinked down at him, apparently having a hard time hearing him again, thinking he had responded. Of course she was able to hear him right at the end, and a sly grin spread across her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right into those butt cheeks, huh?  Even after watching me eat all that Mexican, you know it's gonna be World War III back there... But... Oooh... So you're into THAT kinda stuff, no wonder you let me sneeze on you and all that!  Well, if you're sure.\"  Tom nearly cried as she went to a secluded spot and quickly undid her belt and zipper, loosening her pants just barely enough for her to shove him very roughly into her enormous fatty crack.  \"Enjoy it back there, and don't worry, I can already feel what something brewing...\" PPPPPHHHRRRTTT!!!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was immediately bombarded by horrid gas as Maria zipped and tightened her jeans, trapping a majority of the smell in with him.  With each sway of her hips Tom was sent screaming deeper and deeper into he nasty crack, and the deeper he got, the more often she seemed to fart (and the more horrible/wet the farts got).  Before he knew it, to his absolute disgust/horror, Tom found himself right in front of her huge butt hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pulsed out a few times, before a horrible rumble was heard and... SPPPPPPLLLLOOOORRRRRRPPPPTTTTSSSHHHH!!!!   PPPRRREEEEEEENNNNNNN!!!!  SSPPLLLAAARRRRSSSSHHHHPPPPPPPTTTTT!!!  Tom was splattered with more than just horrible smell this time, shitty bits splattering him from head to toe.  \"Ooops, that was a bad one, that's probably too much for even you.  Don't worry hun, I'm home, but my family's over, I'll get you out as soon as I get to the bathroo-- Dammit.\"  Tom did not like the sound of that.  \"Okay... My sisters in the bathroom...  Umm... Just hold on Tom...  Just don't move around much and we'll be fine...\"  SSSPPPLLOOOOORRPPPPTTTTPTTTTpprrrrrooooppssshhhtttt...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom couldn't take it anymore as Maria leaned against the door to the bathroom, apparently barely able to hold in what was knocking at her backdoor as she sprayed him yet again with shitty bits.  In his panic he kicked at the BBW's ass hole, hoping this would force her to panic and take him out without waiting, but unfortunately his banging and kicking just led to--- SSSPPPPRRRAAAAAAAAPPPPTTTTTTTTPlloooooooorrrrrssshhhhpleeeeeeeenploplpolpop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom cried as he was covered in semi-solid, semi-liquid shit, forced to swallow some just to breathe what little horrendous air their was.  \"Damn it, Tom, I told you to stay still and I'd get you out...  Unless... You didn't want to get out.  Oh Tom... I guess if you like it back there that much well...  I can always just hide out in my room with you in there until my family leaves for dinner... Don't worry, I'll have even more for you once the bathroom's free.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're more than a little excited, knowing that you're finally going to get the heck out of this place. It wasn't like living here was all THAT bad, but being poked and prodded all of the time with experiment after experiment was getting more than slightly annoying... A few months earlier, you had been out drinking with friends and had decided to walk yourself home. Unfortunately that turned out to be a bad decision as in your drunken stupor you ended up getting lost and wondering around a part of town you weren't familiar with. After trying desperately to find your way back, you had walked into a random building to try and make a phone call to one of your friends. Unbeknownst to you, the building you walked into was a storage facility that was filled with chemical by-products of a still unknown organization. Not finding a phone, and suddenly getting noxious from both the fumes and the booze, you tried to lean over one of the drums and puke, only to lose your balance and fall in. After almost drowning, and completely covered in sludge, you stormed out of the building and were somehow able to find your way home, only to wake up the next day absolutely tiny!!! Long story short, once you were found and immediately taken to the hospital, it was found they couldn't do anything for you, until a company decided to try and find you a cure as long as you agreed to letting them run tests on you. Though they had run thousands of their tests, they were still no closer to finding you a cure, and with a dwindling budget, they had decided it was time to let someone else just take care of you. Apparently they had become your legal guardians however, and were responsible for finding you a competent replacement, so they had decided to host some interviews of a very select few (but still diverse) list of people. Wanting to get your true reactions, they hadn't told you who would be on that list, but you were sure that whoever they were it would at least be better than here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on a small table in the middle of one of the experiment rooms, a lot of the different machines and devices they whipped up to try and help you all around, as a monotone voice you've heard way too many times talks over a speaker system. \"Alright, Lizzy. We will now show you your prospective guardians. We have taken the smallest risk possible by finding a small but diverse selection of people. We will be leaving the final decision to you, so please make a careful choice. The first choice has permission to enter.\" You can't help but roll your eyes at the voice, but quickly perk up as the door to the lab bursts open, your jaw dropping as you see your mother who's apparently put on a little weight and is spilling out of a business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long dirty blonde hair matched yours perfectly as it swayed behind her, her breasts sizable but not much bigger than yours, though her bottom half had been where most of her weight gain had gone except for her pudge of a belly. You were glad she was one of your choices, though she was a bit of an airhead, and didn't seem to always think things through, you still loved her. \"Oh my gosh, Honey, it's so good to see you again! It seems like forever since you got sent to this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it HAS been forever... So they chose you as a possible guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course, Dear, I don't even know why they have other choices, I AM your mother after all.\" You can't really argue with that logic, and you are actually beginning to think it's not worth seeing the other choices when the voice comes on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice # 1, please answer the following question and demonstrate to the best of your ability. What would Lizzy be doing in your house from day to day?\" You think you know the answer, of course your mother will just be taking care of you, maybe giving you something to watch on the TV when she's gone or something, until your mother speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would keep her busy with chores, of course! I know she wouldn't be able to do the normal things, but at the very least she could help me out while I do the household chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom, how would I even help you with any of the chores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Honey, you would have different chores. Hmm... I WAS asked to demonstrate... So while I'm doing chores, if I had a cold, you would help me out. And it just so happens I have one.\" She giggles a little as she picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mom, what do you mea--\" Before you can finish the sentence, your mother shoves you into her nose, twisting you around and getting all kind of sticky boogers all over you, only to pull you out to... AACCCHOOOO!!! More green goop and spit splatter you, which just causes her to giggle more. \"Mom!!! *Coughcough.* What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now, Lizzy, don't take that tone with me just because you're tiny! You don't expect me to just let you lounge around all day and do nothing to help around the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. This is how she always was, once she got something in her air-filled head, even if it didn't make sense, it was almost impossible to dislodge it. Thinking it better to concede rather than argue further, you tried a different approach. \"Well... I guess I see your point, but can't I do something less disgusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother hears the first part, but apparently nothing but mumbles for the second. \"Well I'm glad you understand Honey, but it's hard to hear you... Oh, I thought of another chore!\" You try to protest but your mother just grabs you again and this time brings you around to her ear, and to your disgust shoves you right in, adding yellow and orange to your already green body as she goes into both ears, finally totally able to hear you except your too grossed out to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice # 1, your time is up, please leave until you are called in for the final decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. I know you'll pick me, Honey, so I'll pick you up as soon as you send away the other choices, alright?\" You scowl at her and try to wipe off the gunk as she blows you a kiss and walks out the door.</span></div></div>",

You are pleasantly surprised as your childhood friend Sarah walks through the door in all her chubby glory, her tummy spilling over tight pink shortshorts into an amazing muffin top and peeking out under a tight white spaghetti strap shirt with showing through black bra. You are once again optimistic about the choice you've been given. You smiled as she flicked back her brunette hair, and you could help but giggle a little thinking about how Sarah always carried herself and her 'plush' body type; she truly didn't care what others thought, and she was sexy in her own mind whether they thought it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Lizzy!!! Oh my gosh they weren't kidding, you're absolutely tiny!!!\" You're once again sure this is going to be the correct choice as Sarah picks you up and hugs you tightly. You get a whiff BO, but try to pass it off as the voice comes on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice # 2, please answer this question and demonstrate to the best of your ability. You are out with Lizzy in your back yard when a neighbor runs over unexpectedly, what would you do?\" You look up expectantly at Sarah, hoping this would go at least a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd hide her before the neighbor saw her... Like this I guess.\" With a nervous giggle, you are zipped towards her buldging chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, wait, what are you mmpphh!!!\" She shoves you between her overflowing breast flesh, shoving you so deep you're enveloped by the globes, and something else. Apparently Sarah hasn't showered in a while, and she absolutely reeks!!! You cough and gag as she giggles above, causing her mammories to jiggle and shake as the voice continues her 'test'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You notice the neighbor staring at your cleavage, and may have seen Lizzy, what do you do?\" You are suddenly smashed even more as Sarah adjusts her bra, smearing you around in a seemingly normal movement until somehow you end up at the side of her bra, stuck by her strap as she slams her arm down on you, smashing you with her even more disgusting armpit to \"hide you better\". \"The neighbor wants you to help her carry something, which requires you to lift your arms up, while she is leading the way in front of you, what do you do while she's distracted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning quick, Sarah pulls you out of your BO prison and gives you just enough time to say \"Sarah, just stop! This is disgust---,\" before you are slammed headfirst into her bellybutton that somehow smells worse than her cleavage and armpit combined as you choke on lint. You can't hear anything but your own sounds of disgust before Sarah pulls you out with a POP and sets you down. She smiles and giggles as she bends, showing her smelly cleavage in all its glory, and gives you a kiss that blows nasty breath all over you. \"Make sure you choose me, alright? We're gonna have so much fun!!!\" You glare at her as her ass jiggles goodbye, too glad to be away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... have the next person be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice # 3 you ar--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time!!!\" You stare in amazement as a very large pearshaped blonde girl bursts into the room, her massive form jiggling like mad in a T-shirt that leaves her belly fully exposed, and you have no doubt that her ass is more than half hanging out of the VERY overgrown khakis. You have to squint at her pudgy face for a few seconds before you recognize her as an even bigger... \"Amy?\" She was one of your old high school friends. You hadn't talked to her in quite a while, but you couldn't help but notice that though she was always a bigger gal, she had gotten quite a bit bigger still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, you remember me. That'll make this easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choice # 3, please answe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, she's comin' with me whether I answer your questions or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Amy... What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm gonna take you. You see, I never had the opportunity to have you when we were in high school... And... Well, I always regretted it. You were always hanging out with your other friends more than me, and either way I knew I'd never get you to want to be with me once I showed you what I want you to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I mean... I'm sorry you felt that way but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly it! I saw you playing around with your other friends, and you would always just be kidding, but you would smack their asses, or even compare sizes with ones like Sarah! But I could never get you to do any of that to me, I couldn't even get you to slap it once! Well... now you're gonna be with it all the time and tend to it 24/7!!!\" You scream in horror as Amy turns around and pulls her khakis the rest of the way down her monumental pantyless ass, the jello-like globes flopping all over and releasing an absolutely horrid stench! \"At first I just wanted to have you touch my ass, then it grew too me wanting you to kiss my ass, then I wanted to just smother you with it... And now I'm going to get you to do all of it and more!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Amy, you can't AAHHH!!!\" You are crying as Amy reaches behind her as best she can and drops you on her shelf of an ass.right next to her squiggling ass crack. \"You see, I can't even get back there to touch it myself!!! I knew even if I convinced you to touch it, you'd be turned off by... well it doesn't matter anymore, this is gonna be great!\" You try to get up to run, but she wiggles her ass and you scream as you fall headfirst into her sweaty ass crack. You are bombarded by ass fat as she wiggles it back and forth, driving you deeper and deeper until you at first see little specks of shit. You're more than ready to throw up, but that's nothing as you get deeper and realize there's layers upon layers of shit smeared all over her ass cheeks and now all over you!!! \"See? I can't even wipe my ass, so there's stuff all over it, but now I have you to clean it for me! And you might as well do it by kissing and licking it, that would be my fantasy come true!!!\" You start crying at this point, this girl is the craziest you've ever met, and she has you trapped in her ass with nothing you can do. SSSPPPHHHRRRRAAASSSHHHTTTT!!! You try to scream but choke on fart and a splatter of liquid shit. \"Oh, and you better hurry, 'cause stuff like that happens all the time, actually this pair of pants is the only one I haven't had an accident in... yet. Hehehe.\" You thrash and spaz out, trying to do anything to escape, which just causes a shiver of pleasure to run up Amy's spine. \"Ooooh, yeah, this is gonna be grea--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy?!?!\" SSSPPPRRRSUUUUUSSSSHHH!!! You are blasted with another raunchy fart in Amy's surprise as Sarah and your Mom burst back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is Lau-- Oh my god!!!\" You are jiggled all over the place as unseen to you Sarah and your Mom fight Amy to get you back, pushing and shoving each other all over the lab until Sarah slams into one of the machines. The machine quickly powers up, before it suddenly fires on all of you, enveloping you all in a green light before the light slowly seems to be absorbed into everyone except you. \"What the hell was... what's going on?\" You are more than a little confused as Amy's ass somehow gets smaller around you, and you happilly pop out onto the floor as you realize all three of them are shrinking... and you're growing!!! Before you know it you have completely swapped heights with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm normal again!!! That laser must have taken the chemical out of me... and put it into you three!\" You smile evilly, remembering what all these three did to you as the ever annoying voice comes over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lizzy, now that you are normal size we no longer need to find you a guardian, but we are also not responsible for these three. You are free to go, but could you take them with you?\" You smile wickedly, having heard the first exciting thing that voice has ever said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way!\" You quickly pick up your mother first. \"Look Mom, I'll pick up whatever slack your absence will cause at the house, but that means you'll have to take my spot in helping me out, okay? Don't worry, I'll keep you busy with this cold I just got from you.\" You giggle as you shove her far up your nose, her screaming and squirming the whole way as you pick Sarah up next. \"Don't worry; I'll make sure you're hidden at all times too.\" Sarah screams as you pick up your mom's bra and put her in the cup, smashing your sweaty and even grimier boob on top of her and smothering her before grabbing Amy finally afterward. \"You know, I would have never thought of doing anything like that to you in my life, but now that I've experienced it, I can't help but wonder how great it would be to have an ass slave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lizzy, please... Waaaiit!!!\" You giggle merrily as you pick up your Sarah's underwear and throw Amy in the back, making sure to wedge the panties as far up your ass as possible before.... SSSPPPHHHHRRRRAAASSSHHHTTTT!!! SSPPPRRRLLLLRRRSSSHHHH!!!! SSPPRRRAAANNNNsshhheeeeennproprop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo... guess I'm the one having the accidents now... I think I'm gonna have a lot more too if it feels that good... Go ahead and clean it up for me too, unless you don't want any chance at being clean again\u2026 Hehehe.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle smiled happily as he sat eating dinner across from his surprisingly wonderful blind date.  When he had first been goaded into this endeavor, he had dreaded the woman who he would end up being \"stuck\" with, but...  He couldn't have been happier once the date had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him eating her own healthy portion of dinner was Corra, a woman of medium length, layered black hair that framed a beautiful, almost pixie-like face.  As beautiful as her face was, her body followed suit in an extraordinary blue dress that fit her form like a glove, and what a form it was.  Her DD+ breasts were hugged perfectly by her cups, an excessive (but not sluttily so) amount of sun-kissed cleavage presented to the world.  In a bottom-heavy hourglass fashion, her womanly waist gave way to a monumental set of hips, her bum (which he had as of yet only gotten a glimpse of) no doubt enough to turn more than a few heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was actually feeling like she should be the one disappointed in HIM, his curly brown hair barely kept in check with some brushing/hair gel, his hand-me down grey suit looking like something he had stolen from a thrift shop compared to her dress, but...  She seemed to be having just as good of a time as he was.  Enough so that when the date was over and he had walked Corra to the door of her apartment building she had asked him up for some hot coffee.  Kyle had blushed like an idiot, nodding like he had gone stupid with a grin to match as she showed him up to her apartment to...  pour him some hot coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wasn't sure what he had expected, this was the real world after all, not some video game with a secret mini-game or something...  But he didn't mind when it all came down to it, because just the few extra minutes to talk to Corra made it worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the cup, however, no matter how much Kyle enjoyed the conversation, he couldn't concentrate on it.  3/4 of the way through, it was all he could do to keep his eyes open and nod, let alone understand anything Corra said.  By the time he finished, well... He didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartling awake, Kyle felt like an absolute jerk.  Who falls asleep DRINKING COFFEE with a date you're enjoying?!  Disappointed horrendously with himself, he quickly stood up to apologize and began babbling incessantly that he would make it up to her, so busy with his mouth that it took him much longer than it should for his eyes to notice...  How huge everything was around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice soon trailed off, his mind not able to comprehend what it eventually concluded could only be an absolutely giant bedroom.  He had just noticed he was naked when his thoughts were soon cut into by a very loud laugh from behind him, causing him to turn around and realize first that it was more likely that he was small and the room wasn't big, but second that regardless Corra was now absolutely GIGANTIC compared to him.  \"Hehehe, finally awake, are we?  Took you long enough, but I'm sure the wait'll be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried to enjoy Corral winking seductively at him, but he was just too floored.  What the hell had happened, and HOW the hell had it happened?  \"C-Corra, I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you're little voice is just to DIE for!  But we only have so much time, so let's just cut to the chase, hmm?  I slipped something into your drink to make you tiny, it IS possible, and we're going to have a little bit of fun in my bed!  How's that all sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened his mouth to protest, ask for help, beg to be taken to the hospital, but apparently sensing this from him, Corra quickly moved to shut him up by standing in all of her glory to force him to notice she was now only in her underwear.  A pink bra with just a bit of lacing did it's best to contend with her now even bigger melons, shifting and surging with each movement, while down below a matching pair of thong panties did their best to cover well... ANY of her lower body, only mildly succeeding.  Needless to say, Kyle's mouth was open, but no sound was coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take that as a 'good'.  Hehe!  Alrighty, well let's get started then!\"  Kyle wasn't sure what she meant, but he quickly found out it didn't matter what he thought as before he knew it Corra's breasts were surging towards him.  He had just enough time to put his arms up pointlessly in defense before her breast fat was smothering him as Corra giggled like a schoolgirl.  \"How's that feel little one?  Are big ol' Corra's breasts a little too much for you?  Hope not!\"  Kyle wanted to tell her yes, but as she shimmied and squished her breasts against him into the mattress, he couldn't do much but get mouthfuls of boob flesh and hints of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done, Kyle felt like a smear on Corra's mattress, but she just seemed to be having the time of her life as she smirked down at him.  \"Aaawww, you look like you're having a tough time...  How about a little break?  Can't say I wasn't nice to you!\"  Kyle had his doubts about how \"nice\" this would be, but he soon found out as Corra's fingers had yanked him up and her ruby lips were upon him.  In the next instant, Kyle was subject to a blur of lipstick, giant tongue, and spittle.  Corra's moans as she essentially gave him a full body french kiss rumbled through his body, and soon he was subject to what became the make-out session of a lifetime, so much so that Kyle actually found himself enjoying it despite it all.  But it was not to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, breaks over!  That should be more than enough to get you through the next part...  Hopefully.  Hehehe.\"  Kyle would have been filled with dread, but he was too exhausted and covered in drool to really care, especially when she tossed him on the bed and he stuck to it spread eagle facing up at her.</span></div></div>",

The entire expanse shimmied and wobbled as she got as best she could right over top of him, giving him ample time to notice how little of her thong actually showed from this angle, not to mention how much sweat was practically pouring off of the expanse.  But soon he couldn't see much as Corra plopped down onto him with reckless abandon, having what she felt was the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was crushed and mashed as Corra bounced, ground, smeared, and every other verb you can do with an ass all over him.  Corra was nearly drooling she was having such a good time, especially when she thought of what it must be for Kyle to be buried so deep under an ass that she could easily smother him with at normal size, not to mention the sweat she could feel squelching all over him as she crushed him.  She was enjoying this so much that, well... She was getting more than a little bit wet down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing more than a little, Corra reigned herself in with an impossible amount of willpower, forcing herself to get up off of Kyle...  Only to find he wasn't there.  With another boisterous giggle, Corra dug into her crack in a very unladylike fashion, soon extracted Kyle's sweat-soaked form from her bum and brought him to her face.  \"Hehehe, that was an amazing end to a great first date, huh?  I might have gone a little far, but... I hope you had even half as much fun as I did.  But before I take this TOO far, I think I'll turn in for the night.  Although...  Sorry Kyle, but I just can't resist at least getting a LITTLE feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried to tell her that she had done enough, and that if she just let him go he'd never speak of this again, but Corra was too busy blushing like mad as she pulled the front of her undies open, only having a moment of hesitation before she dropped Kyle into the cotton crotch before letting it snap shut.  \"Oooohhh...  That IS amazing...  Yeah... You're DEFINITELY sleeping there tonight.  Don't move around too much though, alright?  I can't be held responsible if you get me a little... 'frisky' in my sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had to fight every instinct he had not to freak out as the giantess' sex loomed over him, especially when she had the brilliant idea to lay on her stomach to sleep, effectively smothering him yet again in just about the most intimate way.  \"S-sweet dreams little one.  Mmmm...\"  Needless to say, even as Corra had the best sleep she had had in ages, Kyle's night was nearly restless, to afraid that one twitch or movement would lead to the literal biggest sexual experience of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with all this, Kyle DID fall asleep eventually, happily waking up to a normal size bedroom and a tray of bagels across his lap.  \"Morning sleepy head!  S-sorry if last night got a little bit... Umm... 'Much'.  It was my first time trying something like that, so...  Ahem.  Anyway, finish your breakfast, you've had a 'big' night!  Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to scream at her and storm out, but he WAS normal size again, and she HAD apologized...  After eating the bagels and getting dressed, he found himself quickly getting shooed out of the apartment, almost insultingly so.  \"S-sorry, that was a LOT of fun, but umm...  That went a little...  Well I think I liked it a little TOO much, and you're a really nice guy, so...  Well let's just keep this a one time thing, okay?  No hard feelings?  Hopefully your next girl is a little more your size, huh?  Hehehe.  It was fun though, but have a nice one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood awkwardly as the door was practically shut in his face, a range of mixed emotions racing through his mind.  Apparently he had not only survived the encounter with his blind date, but had even gotten away with never having to be near her again.  He wanted to be happy, chock this all up to a horrendous experience and be done with it, but...  For some reason he found himself having the crazy idea that...  Just MAYBE him and Corra could work out.  Against all better judgement, Kyle wrote a note on the back of a receipt he found in his pocket, \"Here's my number, give me a call if you feel like having a 'little' fun sometime.  Haha, sorry, couldn't resist. - Kyle\", and with more than a little fear and just as much embarrassment, he quickly shoved it under the door before making the walk back to his place.</span></div></div>",

STOP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ran as fast as his legs would carry him, weaving down this corridor, stumbling up a random set of stairs, anything to get away from no less than the royal guard... How did he get into this predicament, let alone into the castle? His morning flashed into his mind in fits and starts between twists and turns of the castle hallways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was a lowly merchant\u2019s son in the country of Tushini, ruled by the women of the Bombula family for gods knew how long. He had \u201cinherited\u201d the small rug shop from his father (see also, was forced to take over when his mother passed and his father took off somewhere). His father had never made much money, and Kyle, well... He made even less-so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so when the tax collectors came he found himself selling the shop to them to pay off his father\u2019s debt, and was homeless at the ripe age of 20. With the despair of his situation not fully kicking in, he found himself aimlessly wandering through the capital, until when he finally noticed where he was, he felt very out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wondered into the Queen\u2019s district, a part of the town only the most successful merchants or highest appointed officials called home, let alone walked through like he was doing. Needless to say, he was getting more than a few withering stares as he walked through a part of town not meant for his eyes. Filled with awe that outweighed any embarrassment, he decided to continue exploring until he was undoubtedly shooed out. It\u2019s not like I have a home to go back to anyway... He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing a suit of armor so shiny it hurt his eyes, a church so big his entire district could fit inside of it, and a private bath that must use more water in a day than he usually saw in a year, Kyle wasn\u2019t sure if he should be inspired to work harder in life or despair in the fact that no matter how hard he tried he would never live here... So tangled in his thoughts, Kyle found himself wandering once again until he ran smack dab into the walls of none other than the castle itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall was so high he couldn\u2019t even see the castle anymore beyond it, so wide he couldn\u2019t see where it ended looking in either direction. With a sigh, he decided it should be time to find wherever he would be sleeping tonight... But something was itching at him. If the Queen\u2019s District was this amazing... How spectacular must the castle be? If I have to go back... I\u2019d like to see inside at least once... Knowing this would never be, he banged his fist against the wall, as if this would cause it to move... Until it suddenly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the grinding of stone on stone, the portion of the wall he had hit moved away, slowly making room until it opened into a doorway to a set of stairs, leading down into some sort of tunnel. Everyone in Kyle\u2019s district had heard rumors as kids that there were passages like these leading into the castle, but he never really thought he would ever find one... Ever instinct told him to flee, but... Can I really pass up an opportunity like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a moment\u2019s more of hesitation and making sure he wasn\u2019t see, Kyle quickly made his way inside, the door slowly closing behind him as he made his way down the stairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt like an absolute idiot as he ran his hand along the tunnel wall. It had been great fun for a few moments\u2014Until the door in the wall shut behind him, leaving him in complete and utter darkness. With the door unresponsive from this side, he pressed forward, but soon he wasn\u2019t even sure this seemingly endless set of tunnels led to the castle. He was beginning to think he would be trapped down here forever when he turned a corner and slammed into a wall. After all that, a dead end?! Nearly fully in despair for the second time today, he almost didn\u2019t recognize the stone on stone grating sound from before until another doorway had completely materialized in front of him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly laughing with glee, Kyle stepped through the doorway without a moment\u2019s hesitation, glad to be out of that deathtrap. To his relief, whatever corridor he had been let out into was currently deserted. He could barely believe his eyes as he followed the hallway, the rugs he was walking on being more ornate than anything his father could get a hold of. Drapes worth more than his entire district adorned the walls, and when he eventually found a window up a small set of stairs, he was left speechless at the view onto the city. He had really made it into the castle!!! Jumping for joy, he couldn\u2019t help but run down the corridor, to excited to explore the rest of the castle to really think about anything else... Like running smack dab into a pair of royal guards around the corner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he had what felt like a whole garrison of them on his tail as he careened through the castle. In desperation for a place to hide, he decided to duck through the next door he came across. Bursting in a shutting the door behind himself, he took in the room around him and tried to catch his breath... Only to cough on a vile stench. He appeared to be in a very ornate bedroom, a very large bed with expensive linens all over it signifying the person was important but... the smell of BO and things that Kyle didn\u2019t want to think about pointing more to someone of VERY common birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the guards clanging around outside looking for him, Kyle decided he didn\u2019t have much time to complain and took the only action he could think of... Hiding under the covers. Quickly moving forward through the fetid air, he yanked the multitude of blankets aside-- To find a very disheveled woman in nothing but a very sheer nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had a moment to notice this before he was assaulted with a stench 20 times worse than the rest of the room, now unmistakably overpowering with the smell of a very dirty ass. So busy with fighting the urge to vomit, he barely was able to put a hand to her mouth before she screamed, hoping against hope he could convince her not to let the guards know he was there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha dreamed happily in blissful sleep, dreaming of her perfect prince. Almost a year had passed now since she had found out she would soon be Queen, and the now 19 year old had grown to meet the challenge, in more ways than one. Her already bulbous and non-proportionate hips were now well on their way to rivaling the Queen\u2019s, and she had even put on a bit of pudge in the middle now, her breasts going up a size or two to follow suit. She had become much more self-dependent since the days before she was introduced to just how... Overpowering her mother\u2019s butt could be, and this had led to a more mature version of herself. She relied on the servants much less, and took her position as princess much less for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this self-reliance also led to a certain aspect of her only deepening... She loved her own stench (or \u201cmark\u201d as she called it). Although she was still appalled at what her mother could accomplish with her bum, she couldn\u2019t help loving every bit of what her own body could produce. A favorite part of every night had become burying herself under as many covers as possible in order to keep everything in her own personal dutch oven. From the stench of her continuous sweat, the cheesy smell of feet, and especially the continuous bellowing of her butt, everything was trapped inside, and nothing was more of a turn-on\u2014Well, except for one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought had slowly taken root in her mind since her servant-turned-\u201cmentor\u201d Priscilla\u2019s son had helped her get dressed last year. Sure, it was amazing to be able to enjoy the stench her body could produce, but... Wouldn\u2019t it be even moreso to be able to share it with someone? Even she had to admit that her smells were very near reaching her mother\u2019s levels of atrocity, so she would settle for anyone who would even just put up with the smell to be around her. And maybe... Just maybe... Over time... They could learn to like it too? The very thought of this made her even more turned on (a mean feat at this point), but it had caused it\u2019s own problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was more than happy in her progress towards her being a proper queen, but when it came to finding a suitor... Whenever one showed, she couldn\u2019t help but give them a little test or two. It... Never ended well. Once she had refused to bathe, and the poor guy couldn\u2019t even stand next to her. Another time she actually farted, only once, and it was enough to send the suitor and his entire entourage running for the hills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling a bit in her sleep, she subconsciously steered her thoughts back towards her smells... When she suddenly felt very cold as her covers were snatched away. At first she assumed it was Priscilla, but instead as her vision cleared she saw... a man. His plain looking clothes couldn\u2019t look more out of place in the castle life she was used to, but he was tall, fairly muscular, a mess of brown hair adorned his head, and his sea green eyes were peering into her own\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha shook herself out of her still turned on daze, opening her mouth to scream bloody murder about an intruder when the brute suddenly put his hand to her mouth...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle was more than panicking at this point (not to mention ready to toss his breakfast all over the disheveled, smelly, raven-haired woman from her stench), but he didn\u2019t have any other options if he wanted help at this point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I know this is really strange, but I swear I\u2019m not here to hurt you. I just was really down on my luck and wanted to see the castle, and now\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud banging could be heard outside; they were starting to search the rooms for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you, I just need a place to hide. I know I\u2019m trespassing, but I swear I won\u2019t do anything wrong. Will you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disheveled woman stared back at him for a few moments that felt like hours, her green eyes diving into his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was furious. This random peasant had the gall to barge into her bedchamber, pull her covers aside, and then ask her for help?! She had absolutely no reason to help someone like him, let alone hide him from the guards, but... Despite everything, something was giving her pause. She didn\u2019t feel in danger at all. In fact, the way his hand was gentle touching her lips like this was kind of nice-- Angrily shaking her head to move his hand and stop yet another turn-on induced daydream, she made a show of rolling her eyes before conceding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine, but... No funny business... Lay down, quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo thankful to complain about the smell, and frankly too panicked to really think about it much anymore, Kyle quickly laid down on the bed as his savior scooted up into a sitting position against the elaborately decorated headboard. It wasn\u2019t until he was laid down that he realized she had spread her legs to accommodate him, a fact they realized in unison as her milky white skin went deep pink with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no funny business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only grunt in response as his head was soon buried between and underneath a pair of massive thighs, the sweaty flesh smothering him even more as she pulled her blankets back up to cover him/her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had been able to deal with it through panic-induced adrenaline, Kyle was suddenly very much reminded of his savior\u2019s stench as she fidgeted and shifted above him, every twitch seeming to raise the temperature in his hiding spot, smear her obviously unwashed thigh meat on his face, and make her produce more and more sweat (not to mention smell). It was all he could do to get a breath in now and then, but each time he choked on the fetid air he was trapped with he wished he hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha wasn\u2019t exactly sure she had made the right choice in helping this peasant, but if the tingling sensation she was feeling running up her spine every time she twitched or he breathed against her thighs had any say, her body definitely thought it was. Her whole body was flush, and it was all she could do to force herself to answer when the guards came to her door and began to pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Agatha! Our apologies your Highness, but there appears to be a rogue on the loose in the castle! We must check your chambers to make sure you\u2019re safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m quite alright! I don\u2019t\u2014Stop moving! \u2013 I think I would know if he was here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Highness, we must make sure you\u2019re safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha felt lightheaded as the guards burst in and began searching the corners and wardrobes in her room. She couldn\u2019t take the feeling of his face under her legs, let alone his breath... With a flurry of panic as the guards looked around, she brought her legs up and pushed the peasant down slightly with her feet, causing a strange bulge at the end of the bed and a moan from the man beneath the blankets. Sure the guards would hear him, she did the only thing she could think of; covering his face with her feet to keep him quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was miserable as her heard murmurs through the blankets and this woman\u2019s leg flab, none of which he could make out. As if the smell and smothering fat wasn\u2019t bad enough, every time he took a breath he not only nearly got sick, but also caused her to twitch and shift above him. This not only smothered him more in a seemingly never-ending cycle, but each movement only seemed to raise the temperature AND the sweat/stench level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her thighs suddenly lifted off of him, he was both relieved to be done with the smothering and horrified she was revealing him to the guards. Instead, she seemed to want him to scoot down, and when he didn\u2019t move fast enough, she pushed him down with on her own. \u201cOuch, that hurt\u2014mmrpph!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only cringe in silent agony as something even worse than the woman\u2019s thighs smothered his face now... Her cheesy, sweaty, very unwashed feet. As if this wasn\u2019t bad enough, she continued to use his face as some sort of massaging stone, rubbing it all over with her raunchy feet, even forcing them into his mouth from time to time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this had the desired result of shushing him, it made Agatha no less nervous. She couldn\u2019t stop moving her feet, and the ticklish feeling she was getting from all this was becoming so unbearable she was beet red from keeping herself laughing. She felt like she was sweating waterfalls now (she was), and she was so embarrassed she felt faint. All this combined meant she didn\u2019t notice the guards start to stare until they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2014Umm... We\u2019re sorry to have... I-interrupted you, Your Highness... W-we\u2019ll be on our way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a near panic, the guards all but evacuated the room, leaving a very bewildered but relieved Agatha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... Did they think I was... Oh Goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was nearly unconscious when the covers finally lifted up and the woman removed her feet from his face. He was so relieved to have semi-fresh air, he almost forgot what he should really be thankful for; the guards appeared to have left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching his breath for a second, Kyle sat up to look at his savior, who somehow appeared more sweaty and red than he remembered. Although her stench still hung around the room, and she had practically tortured him, he couldn\u2019t help but be thankful. She had helped him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat looking at each other, Kyle finally had time to notice she was only in her nightgown and this woman was... Well... Pretty well endowed. The blue nightgown she wore didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination, her breasts fitting into it very snuggly, with (to his embarrassment) very erect nipples. Her torso had a bit of pudge to it, her belly button noticeable through the fabric along with a pair of love handles. His eyes traveled lower to view her hips and the thighs that had been smothering him, but she had already covered her lower half again with the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that was probably for the best, and before she could catch him ogling, Kyle decided to thank her while he could. \u201cI-I\u2019m... I\u2019m really sorry to make you do that. But I really appreciate it. I\u2019ll umm... I\u2019ll get out of your room now. If umm... If I ever can, I\u2019ll return the favor. My name\u2019s Kyle... Can I know your name, in case we meet again?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Agatha could only blink in response for a few moments. She wasn\u2019t sure which was more astonishing, the fact that she had just subjected him to smothering by both thighs and sweaty feet and he was still thanking her, or the fact that he appeared to not know she was the princess. She actually opened her mouth to inform him, but quickly changed her mind. What if it got out?! Testing a suitor a little is one thing, but no one can know that their princess can be this much of a slob! \u201cI-it\u2019s... It\u2019s Aggie. Just Aggie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Kyle thought that name sounded familiar somehow, but he quickly brushed it off. \u201cWell, thank you Aggie. I\u2019ll try to get out of here on my own now... Hopefully we meet again in better circumstances...\u201d Knowing full well he would probably never meet someone from the castle again after all this, Kyle quickly made his exit, turning the opposite way he thought the guards had went, looking for any kind of way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha spent the rest of the morning in a daze. Although a part of her felt guilty for helping Kyle (after all he could have been a thief for all she knew), she was actually really happy with herself. Of course, it helped that he was the first male to be around her true self without vomiting everywhere or passing out, but she tried not to think about that. After all, he was gone now anyway. Still... The smell in her room released from under her blankets was even getting to her, but he had still thanked her for helping him as if it had been nothing at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to take her mind off it all, she instead decided to ring for breakfast. Eggs and ham and heavily buttered bread would do nicely, and the more the better. By the time her 3rd or 4th serving of it all came around, she had almost forgotten about Kyle... Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as Priscilla entered her bedchamber at just after noon, only to put her hand to her face almost immediately. \u201cOh my... Why have you not bathed yet? You smell even worse than usual this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha opened her mouth to respond, but realized she couldn\u2019t tell Priscilla about Kyle. \u201cSorry, I umm... I slept in this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriscilla wanted to be mad, especially when looking at all the platters the princess had obviously been munching off of, but was a bit taken aback by the princess actually apologizing to her. Maybe she really will be ready soon... Doing her best to not breathe in the stench that filled the room, she made her way over to one of the wardrobes, pulling out a deep purple and black dress made of some very heavy material. \u201cI can assume you\u2019ve forgotten the ball is today then? Well we won\u2019t have time to bathe you now. I can help you do up your hair, but you\u2019ll have to wear this. We can put oils on the parts of you that show, and this material will keep in the rest of the stench under the dress. Even dampen the sound of your... emissions to some degree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha again opened her mouth to let out a scathing remark, but after noticing the empty trays around her decided that Priscilla was most likely right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Agatha sauntered through the halls in what appeared to be a very largely hooped dress. No one would know that this morning she hadn\u2019t bathed, or that she was anything but the perfect princess. Her hair was twisted and twirled up perfectly, and she smelled faintly of lilacs and roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually was annoyed by balls now, especially with all of the suitors that had no idea how \u201cunprincesslike\u201d she could be flocking to her side, but she was somewhat glad for the distraction today. She could just go out there, do a few hours of dancing, and completely forget about-- \u201cKyle?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly jumped out of his skin as Agatha called out to him. He had been fairly lucky in eluding the guards up until now, but whenever he was close to getting out, he was stopped by more people coming in for the ball. He had just stopped to look around the corner of a hallway, too busy watching some guards at the other end to notice Agatha walk up behind him. At first he was just relieved it wasn\u2019t a guard, but for a second he didn\u2019t recognize the person speaking to him either, until... \u201cAggie? You look... Well you look amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was happy to receive the praise, even about to beam before she realized the situation they were in. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were leaving?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was, but... I couldn\u2019t get out. Umm... I hate to ask, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to help you again?\u201d Agatha put her hands on her hips, sighing in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would at this point... I need to be making my entrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle realized he didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d help either. His eyes wondered as he tried to think of something, anything she could do... And then his eyes rested on her dress. He had heard about, even seen a few hoop dresses before, but this one was ridiculous. It flared out so wide and deep behind her he thought it might actually get in the way of her walking. But when he thought about it... That meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm... You could... Let me... Hideunderyourdress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha blinked at Kyle, hardly able to catch what he said with how quickly he had said it. \u201cYou want to... Hide under my dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, but... It\u2019s a hoop dress, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... Yes, but\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that means there should be a lot of room under there, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, usually, however\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Aggie! I\u2019ll make sure no one knows I\u2019m there. Whenever you get the chance, just walk outside, and I\u2019ll make my exit! You\u2019ll never have to see me again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was appalled. Did this commoner know no bounds? How could he ask such a thing of a woman, let alone the princess?! But... A thought was tickling at the back of her mind. No one would ever have to know... And Kyle didn\u2019t know she was a princess, after all... And... It might be... a little enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting herself from letting a blush form on her face, Agatha took a deep breath, and forced herself to nod in approval. With a few moments of hesitation, she hitched up her dress just a bit, and before she knew it Kyle had dove underneath it. Feeling his hands on her legs sent lightning bolts up her spine, and it was all she could do to keep from falling back on top of him. Not wanting to get cold feet now, she forced herself to start moving forward. Although it was slightly awkward at first, they eventually were able to move together, until no one would notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was immediately assaulted by a now somewhat familiar stench, quickly informing him that Agatha hadn\u2019t cleaned up much before getting dressed. On top of that, her dress was apparently of some really heavy material, because it was like being under the covers with her all over again. Almost losing his balance from the smell alone, he was forced to put his hands on her legs... and was forced to realize how big they really were. Her slightly above average calves exploded into small tree trunks, the fat that had smothered his face earlier jiggling and rubbing together with abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this going on, he almost didn\u2019t realize that he didn\u2019t have anywhere near as much room as he thought he would... He was suddenly aware of the Bombula family secret, this was no hoop dress. Agatha\u2019s ass filled so much of the dress there was hardly any room for him to fit at all, crouched or otherwise. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, Agatha wasn\u2019t... exactly... wearing any undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Highness, the Crown Princess of Tushini, Agatha Bombula!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha realized this mistake as well a moment too late as she was announced to the room, unable to turn back now. She instantly felt her body shoot up 10 degrees, a fact that was punctuated by the near-instant onset of what could only be swamp ass. As she walked into the room and waved to everyone, she was very glad for Priscilla\u2019s choice in wardrobe. At least no one will be able to smell it... Well, no one else anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha proceeded forward into the crowd, making sure to make polite conversation with a few random dignitaries before making her way over to stand next to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nearly forgot to keep up with Agatha\u2019s movements as he heard her being announced. Aggie was that Agatha? He was under the dress of the Crown Princess?!?! He was so dead. For now though, all he could do was his best not to trip Agatha up, although that was becoming difficult. The smell was worse than the bedroom already, and the grinding and clapping of her cheeks just above his head was more than a bit distracting (not to mention fighting the constant urge to look up and stare at it). As if all of that wasn\u2019t enough, his \u201csky\u201d suddenly started raining down on him, leaving him with nothing to do but cringe and enjoy his skin crawling as Agatha literally watered him with her butt sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha had hoped that she would be able to make a short trip outside, but the dancing started too soon. Forced to dance or insult her guests, she forced herself to waltz with a few suitors. She had been more than a bit worried at first, but Kyle seemed to be able to move along with her well enough, and she soon felt like he almost wasn\u2019t there... Except for the constant presence of his hands on her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she had almost gotten used to this sensation as well, focusing on dancing more than Kyle. Suddenly, she felt a twist of pain in her gut, a violent gurgling sound barely audible to her above the music. Her breakfast/lunch had caught up to her, and from the feel/sound of it was very cross with her. In the middle of the song, she couldn\u2019t excuse herself even to the side of the room, but her stomach would not be denied. Hoping against hope that Priscilla was right, Agatha gave a slight push... And only heard the smallest of reverberations, not audible to her dance partner over the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle felt like he had literally bathed in Agatha\u2019s butt sweat at this point, her chubby thighs so slick with sweat and body grease that he could barely hold on. He was thinking she would make an exit as soon as possible, but instead he started to hear faint music... And then the dancing started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly glad one of his childhood friends had a mother that taught him how to dance, because he would otherwise have fell flat on his face after the first few steps. The temperature and smell around him somehow just kept getting worse, but the fear of what would happen if he was caught, not only for himself but for Agatha, gave him resolve enough to see it through... And then he heard gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he convinced himself she must just be hungry, but the louder the gurgling became, the more he realized it wasn\u2019t coming from her stomach. Convincing himself he had nothing to worry about, Kyle focused himself back on the dancing... Only for Agatha\u2019s thighs to tense up under his fingers for a moment and-- PPPHHHRRRAAASSSHHHTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was blasted with a hot surge of air and sweat from the deepest parts of Agatha\u2019s ass from above, and suddenly the smell of her thighs and feet from the bedroom were like roses compared to this new stench. For the first time the thought of just giving himself up truly came into play, sheer force of will the only thing keeping him from doing nothing more than causing Agatha a few misteps in her dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha could only blush in shame as she realized what she had done to poor Kyle as she stumbled a bit in her dancing. Regardless of the fact that she couldn\u2019t smell a thing, she knew it had to be atrocious for him under there. She fully expected him to give himself up now... Or at least pass out. But... Neither happened. Instead, after only a few stumblings caused no doubt by Kyle\u2019s reaction to the sudden fart, she was once again able to dance freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was... Thouroughly impressed. This lowly commoner had withstood something at point blank range that had sent an entire suitor party running for the hills. Not to mention, he could very easily lift up her dress and escape. In the confusion her stench would cause he could easily get away... Maybe there was hope for her being able to share this side of herself with someone after all... Sitting with Kyle while she-- bllllrrpttt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fart ripped its way out of her ass in surprise. How could she be thinking like that? She was a princess; she would find a legitimate suitor who could appreciate her... \u201cother\u201d side... But... Who knew how long that would take? When would the next time bet that she got to do something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a moment or two more of hesitation, but soon her stomach decided for her with another angry gurgle. When the dancing is done or he can\u2019t take anymore I\u2019ll make sure he gets out from under there... But for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was dry heaving slightly as the stench took its toll, but was otherwise able to push through. Although he was appalled Agatha, let alone any princess, could do something like that to him, he was sure it was accidental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBRRRPPPPPFFFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was less sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fart was even more dank than the last, the smell of rotten eggs and spoiled meat mixing with the most ripe ass sweat to make a cocktail of vile stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming this far, Kyle continued to do his best to keep up with Agatha\u2019s movements, but any confidence he had in her that she wasn\u2019t doing this on purpose was shattered when after another slight pause, she began an absolute onslaught. PPLLLOOOORRSSHHHT PPRRAAAMMMPPFFFF BLLLRRRRRPPPTTT SPLORTSPRAP! Preeeenf... BLLOOORTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was having the time of her life. Never had she had so much fun at a ball, nor had she ever been so turned on. It was all she could do to not touch herself in front of all these people. She started to make it a habit to suddenly stop for a moment right before she farted, causing Kyle to bury his head and face against her bum when she let them rip. She was enjoying her time with Kyle so much that people were starting to give her weird looks, especially with how sluggish he was becoming at following her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant yet euphoric sigh, Agatha took a moment between songs to take a breath, moving back into a nearby hallway for a moment. \u201cK-Kyle... I\u2019m umm... I\u2019m sorry about all that... I know it must have been rough... Just umm... I can\u2019t go outside right now, but no one should come in this hallway for a while so... Catch your breath and I\u2019ll come back for you. Promi-- Wait... PPPHHHHARRRRSSHHH!!! Okay, now promise. Hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t even respond as he literally fell out from under Agatha\u2019s dress, a small cloud of stink wafting up from him as he lay on the ground. \u201cOh goddess... That\u2019s horrible smelling... S-sorry, again... I\u2019ll umm... I\u2019ll be back, just umm... find a place to hide, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha happily strode back into the dancing hall, feeling the most alive she had since she realized she had a thing for her own stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, on the other hand, felt worse than he had this morning when he found out he was homeless. With what little strength he had left, he dragged himself to a nearby bench which doubled as a storage compartment, lifted up the lid, and crawled inside. In a moment he was out like a light, glad to be away from Agatha and her lethal emissions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Agatha returned to the hallway. She had enjoyed the rest of the ball immensely, continuing to fart with no one else the wiser, even allowing just a bit of the stink out by lifting her dress a touch to scare away suitors every now and again. She had almost forgotten about Kyle as she was desperate to go to the loo, but realized she needed to get him out of the castle as she had promised first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kyle was nowhere to be found. She looked down the length of the hallway, in all the rooms, even into one of the potted plants. She called his name a few times as well. She had decided to look one more time, when suddenly the nervousness of thinking Kyle had been captured and her unfinished business caught up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgatha was suddenly doubled over in pain. She needed to go. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wild look of desperation, she saw a nearby bench, and luckily remembered it had storage underneath. Knowing she wouldn\u2019t make it any farther than this, and hoping nothing valuable was in the storage compartment, she quickly hiked up her dress (allowing just about the most vile smell she had ever produced out into the world), lifted up the lid, aimed, and let fly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had just enough time to wake up at the sudden light invading his hiding spot, before his vision was filled with a giant butt. He opened his mouth to scream, but was drowned out (both figuratively and literally) as Agatha\u2019s butt blasted him with much more than a fart. SSPPLLLUUURRSSSHHH PPPRRAAASSSHHHTTT PPLLOOOORRRMMMFFFTTT PREEEEffftttt SPLART SPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could only cry as he was blasted with yet another worse-smelling concoction of Agatha\u2019s. Chunky and gooey logs and splatterings of soupy muck rained down on him with no signs of stopping, the space in the storage quickly filling up with Agatha\u2019s filth. Her boisterous bowel movement echoed up and down the hall, and soon it had attracted the attention of a few guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, Agatha let out a contented sigh, standing up with one more SSPPRAAAFFTT!!! Her ass was steaming with filth as she put the dress down over it. She stepped away and turned to view her handiwork, mildly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more impressed when the bench suddenly gave way as the guards arrived just in time to see the pile of shit pour out of it... Along with a very unfortunate man named Kyle. Agatha could only stare in shock as Kyle coughed on what she had unknowingly buried him in, the guards more than a bit disgusted/confused until one finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the intruder! We found him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards quickly moved between Agatha and this \u201cdangerous man\u201d, their swords pointed at the wretched creature as he tried to stand up. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t attack you, Your Highness! Don\u2019t worry; it\u2019ll be off with his head for trespassing. Mandatory sentence by law! You won\u2019t have to ever see him again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wasn\u2019t absolutely sure that was such a bad thing now, but Agatha was in a panic. The shock of what she had done wearing off slightly, she couldn\u2019t help but realize how much she enjoyed the thought of knowing Kyle was here with her during her massive dump... How much she didn\u2019t want to not see Kyle... In fact, she was sure that she wanted to see him all the time... She didn\u2019t want him to leave anymore, and she definitely couldn\u2019t let him be executed! Then again... There was a way to get both...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment of hesitation, she stepped in front of the guards. \u201cYou can\u2019t arrest this man, he\u2019s not trespassing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I beg your pardon, Your Highness, but... Then who is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is my betrothed... And you will treat him with respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although he was still thankful for Agatha saving him, the feeling was growing more dim every day. Now that she was betrothed to him (the wedding weeks off awaiting his training for being part of royalty), she was constantly with him, and she went out of her way to be able to let herself go around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only bathed when Priscilla would make her, she wouldn\u2019t sleep unless he was in her dutch oven with her, and she insisted on always burping or farting directly in his face. She even refused to use the loo without him being with her, although he was glad at least he hadn\u2019t had to be under her again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, tonight he was in a bit of a predicament. In the middle of yet another night \u201csnuggling\u201d with Agatha (it had taken him nearly an hour to undo himself from her grasp without waking her), he had snuck out to get a bit of piece and quiet. Trying to find a place to hide out, he had gotten a bit turned around in the castle. Finding a door off the study, he had realized he found a room with a wooden outhouse-like toilet. Thinking he could shut himself in alone for a few moments at least, he sat down on the seat... only to realize the hole was much too big for someone his size a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had valiantly fought the inevitable, but his strength eventually gave out and he fell in. Sickened, he was nonetheless sure he could get out after a rest. Unfortunately, this was all the time needed for disaster to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked up in horror as he heard the door open, followed by Agatha\u2019s face as she looked down. \u201cK-Kyle? Is that you? What are you...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me! I umm... I fell in, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait... Did you know I go to this bathroom every night? I mean, ever since my butt started to fit it? I know you\u2019ve come with me every time I go to the bathroom, but I felt bad waking you up this late... Is this your way of saying you really want to be there with me... Even if it\u2019s under me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Aggie, that\u2019s\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014The sweetest thing anyone\u2019s ever done! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you never miss a thing from now on! Speaking of...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried to reason with her, tried to convince her otherwise, but instead was presented with a butt he was becoming all too familiar with. PPPLLLLAAARSSSHHHTTT SSSPPPPRRRROOOOOMMMFFFTTTT PPREEEENNNSSSHHHTTT!!! Kyle was once again pelted by Agatha\u2019s ass as it unloaded all over him, easily coating him with filth and then some by the time she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only look up in disgust as she stood up, pulling her nightgown over her butt without even attempting to wipe. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t mind if you enjoy yourself down there for a while... Just know this butt is ready for you when you come back to bed...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle began to seriously consider taking the death penalty, glad that at least this was over for tonight when he heard the door open again. Had Agatha come back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t even say a word as the face that came into view this time was none other than the Queen! \u201cOh, Kyle... What are you doing down there? Oooooh, I understand, you little devil! Don\u2019t worry, I know you two have your own idea of fun... But even my Dear Robert would never have gotten into the toilet for me... I\u2019d like to give it a try... You won\u2019t mind, right? We\u2019ll keep this our little secret!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle again tried to protest, but it seemed like he had no say in the matter as an even bigger butt than Agatha\u2019s completely consumed the seat above him, and if the horrible gurgling sound had anything to say about it, it was going to be there quite a while.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dillian sat alone in a booth, for the umpteenth time reconsidering his current dating situation, if it could even be called that. For what seemed like forever now, poor Dillian was trapped in a never-ending dilemma. Stay with his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d Mila, and be constantly berated to death figuratively by both her AND her sister Mel\u2019s ass (the former at least MOSTLY apologetically/accidentally, the latter very much on purpose), or break up with her and very likely end up LITTERALLY berated to death by her sister\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo only make matters worse, despite everything, he had begun to truly have feelings for Mila over time. Couple this with Mel\u2019s constant indirect threats of death meant that Dillian stayed in his current situation, and had no end of his torture in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head to attempt to get his mind out of this slump, Dillian tried to convince himself that today would be different. Mila had PROMISED him that it would be just the two of them today. Although he couldn\u2019t help dreading what would happen when Mel found out, he thought it would be worth it if he could further his relationship with Mila without Mel\u2019s interference. \u2018Who knows, I might even actually enjoy my time with Mila...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so here Dillian sat, waiting for his wayward girlfriend to arrive at \u201c\u2019Bacon\u2019 Jim\u2019s Burger Shack\u201d. He was actually beginning to think she wasn\u2019t showing and he might get an evening to himself when Mila suddenly burst through the doors. Within moments she had made eye contact and was sauntering over, Mel for once nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could barely keep himself from drooling as he watched her approach. The buxom brunette\u2019s breasts were mashed into an ill-fitting sports bra, her midriff out for the world to see above a pair of just bigger than tiny workout shorts. She was a bombshell, picture perfect even... At least until he started noticing a few... flaws as she got closer. She was literally glistening with sweat. Her formerly white sports bra was already leaving little to the imagination, but the fact that it was stained almost yellow AND soaked through with sweat only brought on more attention. Her purple workout shorts were slung low on her hips, barely keeping her decent in the front, her jiggling thighs slapping and jiggling together with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the smell. It got to him before she did, a stench that told him she not only hadn\u2019t showered after a recent workout once again, but also probably hadn\u2019t washed in the last few days. As if to add insult to injury, she dropped a gym bag next to Dillian before sitting down across from him. As he looked at the unzipped object, he could only recoil as he saw literal stink lines coming from inside, the wet slap of it hitting the seat of the booth no doubt from countless overworked gym attire that was literally spilling out of the poor bag. Dillian found himself more than happy they had been placed in a secluded far corner booth of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeya Dill! \u2018Hope you haven\u2019t been waiting too long! I had to give Mel the slip! I told her I was going to the gym, but I knew she wouldn\u2019t believe me unless I went there... So while I was there I had a really good workout! Don\u2019t worry though, I haven\u2019t showered for a few days, so even MEL didn\u2019t want to come with me, let alone follow me here afterwards! Oh, and I got to finally empty out my gym locker! I always end up leaving clothes there after I change... I haven\u2019t ever brought any of it home to wash!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis information did nothing to help Dillian\u2019s nose, which was being simultaneously attacked by Mila\u2019s \u201cfresh\u201d stench across from him along with the horrendously fermented stench right beside him. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad I have a boyfriend who doesn\u2019t mind a stink every now and again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only roll his eyes at this, doing his best not to cough on the BO around him and enjoy his first real date with Mila since being forced to be her boyfriend. After a few moments of talking, he even was able to get relatively used to it (no doubt an ability hard-learned after what he had previously been through), when the waiter forced her way through the stink to ask them what they wanted to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dI-I\u2019ll just have a Jim\u2019s Signature Bacon Burger... With fries and a water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you... Cough. Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh I\u2019ll have... 3\u2014No, make that 4 Seven-Bean Chili Four-Cheese Burgers please! With a chocolate shake, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian couldn\u2019t believe his ears. The chili on those burgers would make the most iron of stomachs broil with gas, he didn\u2019t even want to THINK what the cheese would do on top of it to Mila\u2019s lactose intolerance on top of that, let alone the milkshake! \u201cM-Mila... Do you... Do you really think that\u2019s such a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila looked at Dillian in complete bewilderment for a few moments, before her face broke out in a beaming smile. \u201cOh! I guess I SHOULD get something healthy too even though I was just at the gym, huh? You\u2019re sooo sweet to look out for me Dill! I\u2019ll have two side orders of the cheesy broccoli too! Hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only smack his forehead in disbelief, the waiter quick to move away from the stench before he could protest. With Mila blissfully unaware of what all of these items would no doubt do to her digestive tract, Dillian eventually decided it was his duty as a boyfriend (and someone who would most likely have to spend the rest of the evening near her) to tell her. However, upon opening his mouth to say so, the smell around him suddenly increased once again, this time with the smile of overly ripe cheese mixed with especially raunchy sweat. He had a moment as he fought back a gag to wonder what this new horror was, until he suddenly felt something very wet slap itself (or more accurately themselves) into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian\u2019s eyes were back to watering like mad as he looked down to notice Mila had slipped her feet out of her gym shoes and had placed her sock-clad feet on his legs, a playful smirk from Mila signaling that this was apparently supposed to be sexy. She moved her feet in as sensual a fashion as she could muster on his legs and crotch, the smile only growing as the disgusted shivers running up his spine registered to her as sexual desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo, we\u2019re finally on a date... Just the two of us... What ever should we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each squish and squelch of Mila\u2019s toes and socks against his lap released a new burst of smelly feet, the last thing on Dillian\u2019s mind was sexual endeavors. All he could think about was how to make it stop. \u201cU-ummm... M-maybe since Mel\u2019s always trying to separate us you c-could sit over here with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila\u2019s face immediately broke into a wide grin, and she was quickly moving to sit with him, taking her feet off his lap, putting her shoes back on, and soon grabbing the bag next to him and tossing it to the other side. Dillian was quite pleased with himself, having both stopped Mila from torturing him with her feet AND getting that disgusting bag away from himself... Until he realized that now there was nothing between him and the original SOURCE of both of these atrocities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a joyous smile, Mila plopped down next to him in the booth with a wet slap, a horrid squishing sound coming from her butt as the monstrous thing squeezed the air out of the seat cushions. She seemed content to just sit next to him to Dillian\u2019s relief, until a light bulb seemed to go off over her head and she had a better idea. \u201cI kind of like sitting on the inside of booths, you don\u2019t mind, right Dilly?\u201d Thinking this would give him an avenue of escape if nothing else, Dillian was quick to start standing up to exit the booth when Mila quickly pushed him back down. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about getting out, I\u2019ll just squeeeeeze past...\u201d Dillian did not like where this was going, but before he could object, Mila had pushed him back as far as possible in the seat, and proceeded to take up every inch he left between himself and the table (and then some) with her own body, specifically her butt and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only groan as his lap was engulfed by yet another sweaty being, this time being Mila\u2019s butt. As if to prove it was possible, his lap was immediately soaked through with even more sweat, and although he hoped it would be just as she passed, instead Mila decided to stop square center and wiggle and grind her hips into him instead. \u201cOoooops, I think I might be a little... Stuck... You don\u2019t mind though, do you Dillian?\u201d Dillian tried to let her know otherwise, but Mila soon silenced him as she tried to contort a bit and wrap her arm around his shoulders, which only ended up smothering his face against her side-boob and armpit more than anything, his pleading moans of elevating disgust only cementing the knowledge he must be enjoying all this. \u201cOh Dilly, this is sooo romantic. We\u2019re going to have the absolute BEST date night ev\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IN THE HELL?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian was happy as could be as Mila suddenly continued and moved to the inside of the booth, his breaths relatively fresh, that was until he realized what had startled Mila into suddenly moving off of him... Mel had found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THOUGHT you seemed too happy to be going to the gym, and here you are sneaking off with this loser!\u201d Mel stomped her foot angrily, sending the seizure-inducing psychedelic design of the yoga pants she was wearing into a jiggling frenzy, her spaghetti strap cami above rolling up to show of a bit of her midriff as her breasts tried to escape their confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DID go to the gym, Mel! And it\u2019s none of your business where I go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be true, but I can\u2019t trust a loser like this to be around you alone, who knows what he\u2019ll try to do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my BOYFRIEND like that!!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dillian could only sit and unsuccessfully try to calm the two vixens down as they continued to shout over any of his protests until they seemed to notice people beginning to stare. \u201cWell at least sit apart, he\u2019s probably feeling you up and everything!\u201d Suddenly Mel roughly grabbed his arm, attempting to wrench him out of the booth away from Mila. Instead of budging however, Mila had grabbed his other arm and kept him firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he would be if you\u2019d mind your own business! And we just got comfortable, he\u2019s not moving an inch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d With a huff, Mel gave up on trying to pull Dillian out of the booth (Mila wrapping her sweaty arms around him in triumph) and instead decided to sit down... On the same side of the booth as them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Dillian was squished between two somehow equally sweaty bodies (Mel\u2019s no doubt from looking everywhere for her sister). The twisted and jostled on either side of him for more space in the booth, which really just meant they took up more and more of his space. By the time they were interrupted by Mila\u2019s food arriving they were both practically sitting on equal portions of his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, there was a slight mix-up with your order, it will be out shortly. Umm... Were you wanting to order anything miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mel had already begun digging into one of Mila\u2019s burgers angrily, dribbling splatters of chili and dribbling of cheese down her chin/front in the process as the waiter again slinked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s my food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a toll for making me run around to find you!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian wanted to try and calm them down again, but he was too busy being sprayed with bits of partially chewed food and saliva as the two started eating as fast as they could while continuing to argue, completely oblivious to the shower that Dillian was receiving. As the two wolfed down the burgers and cheesy broccoli like they were in a competition, their slobby natures were laid bare; chili, burger grease, and cheese mixed together and plopped down onto their heaving chests, mixing again with sweat to somehow make their grimy bodies smell even worse as the same chests smeared and wobbled against either side of Dillian. As if to add insult to injury, the speed at which they were eating soon caused gas, and their continuous spraying of food onto poor Dillian was only paused for one or the other to let out a gigantic belch right into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only sit and hope for it all to stop, his skin crawling like mad, until the binge was suddenly ended as the food ran out, immediately punctuated by a gigantic gurgling from Mila\u2019s stomach. GGGGGGRRRRRRRRMMMMMSSSHHH... \u201cOh god... Bathroom! Move guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the literal roar that Mila\u2019s stomach had just unleashed, Dillian tried to move out of the way to let her out... Only to be stopped by Mel\u2019s lack of movement. He swore he saw a wicked smirk cross her face, before it suddenly changed to mock-distress. \u201cOof, soooorry Mila, but all that food made me really bloated... I think I\u2019m stuck in the booth!\u201d Mel made a point of sticking out her post-binge belly into the table to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian opened his mouth to call her bluff, but was quickly silenced with a PPPPRRRRRRFFFTTT!!! \u201cI gotta go... NOW!\u201d PPLLLOOORRFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk returned to Mel\u2019s face as she continued to fain being stuck, until suddenly Mila decided she couldn\u2019t take it any more. Before either of the other two knew it, she was standing on the seat and trying to sidle past them, nearly stepping on Dillian\u2019s crotch in the process of moving sideways. Dillian could only watch in awe as apparently her shorts had snagged as she tried to stand up on the seat and shifted down, leaving her ass completely exposed as it eclipsed his vision... And then suddenly blocked it out entirely as she lost her balance and sat back on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPRRRAAASSSHHHTTT!!! BBBRRRAAAFFFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only flail in distress as Mel laughed uproarishly, Mila\u2019s ass doing it\u2019s best to devour his head until it really looked like she was just sitting on top of the booth. For Mila\u2019s part, she was more than embarrassed, but this feeling was overshadowed by how... GOOD whatever Dillian was doing felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Dillian was doing was screaming into the depths of the swampiest ass he could ever have imagined, one that periodically made it even worse as it blasted both horrible gas and sweat from even deeper recesses of his current prison all over his face. To Mila however it just felt like he was doing his best to make out with her butt... And it felt AMAZING. Before she knew it and in spite of everything around them, she found herself gyrating her hips down onto Dillian\u2019s poor face, releasing her farts with reckless abandon. BLLLAAAPPTT PPLLOOORRFFTTT PPREEEENNNFFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Dillian there was only so much that their secluded location in the restaurant could mask, and when people started to look for the source of the horrible sounds they were hearing even Mel had to put an end to it. Suddenly \u201cable\u201d to get free, she moved aside and pulled Mila off of Dillian (no mean feat as Mila\u2019s ass did its best to keep it\u2019s suction hold before letting him go with a horrible squelch). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t stop him! That felt really--- Ooooh... Sorry Dill, we\u2019ll have to continue that later...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila actually had a moment of wanting to protest, but suddenly realized the reason she had gotten into that position in the first place when her stomach let out another roar, sending her still exposed ass on a jiggling run to the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian was left reeling, sucking down \u201cfresh\u201d air as fast as he could and trying to keep from hurling all over the table. His body fighting a losing battle with the latter, he tried to get up and run for the bathrooms as well, only to be stopped again by Mel. \u201cWhere do you think YOU\u2019RE going? Running away AGAIN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian nearly threw up into her lap in response, but the anger he felt for her right now was enough to keep himself together as he grumbled a response. \u201cWhat the heck is your problem? We were doing just fine until you showed up! I know I was a jerk when we first met, but I really like her now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? ALL of her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian didn\u2019t like the sound of what \u201call\u201d implied, but he couldn\u2019t back down now and let Mel win. \u201cYes, really! ALL of her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine... Then I\u2019ll give you a chance to prove it! Do what I say right now to prove you really like her! But if you back out, I swear to god I\u2019ll take a dump down your throat myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, name it!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks could practically be seen flying as Dillian and Mel glared at each other, the air around them so filled with aggressive energy that they didn\u2019t even notice the waiter standing next to them again. \u201cUmm... Your order\u2019s ready, Sir... Sorry to, umm... Intrude.\u201d The waiter practically ran from them this time, although the lingering smell from Mila\u2019s recent explosions was reason enough not to stick around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a humph, Mel grasped for something to prove Dillian hadn\u2019t really changed, her eyes flitting from his food around the room, then landing on... Mila\u2019s gym bag. An evil smile slowly crept onto her face, sending a chill up Dillian\u2019s spine as she stood up and started rummaging through it, reanimating its vile stench in the area once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rummaged through the bag, Dillian realized he had a chance to escape, to run and get out of this. But... Besides the fact that he didn\u2019t want to lose to Mel (or put up with her probably very serious threat), the more Dillian thought about it... The more he realized he meant what he said. He really did like Mila now. Sure she could be a little... Okay, she was the grossest girl (besides Mel) he had ever met, but despite all that, especially for the short amounts of time they were alone, he really enjoyed it (at least when she wasn\u2019t trying to show him how much she stunk). Gritting his teeth with resolve, he decided right then and there he would go through with this, whatever it was that Mel came up with, to prove how he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis resolve was put to the test as Mel suddenly grabbed his water and chugged it, putting the empty glass on the table before pulling a horribly overused, padded sports bra. The material was literally soggy with sweat, a fact that was made even more apparent as Mel took the bra and squeezed it with a triumphant sneer, wringing out all the sweat... into his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dillian was of course disgusted, and wanted to ask what the hell that proved, until he remembered who he was talking to. Of course she would come up with something like this. Convincing himself it was better than her threat of choking on her shit at the very least, Dillian grabbed the glass and did his best to chug it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first his body didn\u2019t register what he was doing, and the liquid went down fairly easily. About halfway through, however, his taste buds registered the salty, stale taste of months-old sweat, and soon it was like the liquid was literally clawing its way down his throat. By the time he was at the bottom of the glass, it was like he had to fight to swallow each individual drop to keep it from coming back up, but with one final cringe he gulped the last mouthful, putting the glass down in front of him in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught a fleeting glance of surprise from Mel, but she quickly masked it as apparently this wasn\u2019t all she had prepared. \u201cNow your fries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian couldn\u2019t help but frown, realizing this was probably going to ruin his whole meal. His frown furrowed into disgust as he realized she was handing him a tube sock. It was white at one time, but was now entirely stained a horrid yellow that got progressively worse until it was almost black where the bottom/toes of Mila\u2019s foot would have been, and instead of being filled with a leg/foot it was now filled with his French fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the fetid article of clothing, he opened up the top end to realize the fries had absorbed portions of the sweat and grime that was in the sock, turning the usual golden fries slightly green. The taste wasn\u2019t much better than the looks when he started eating either. Foot cheese was definitely not a cheese meant to make cheesy fries, and the deeper he got into the sock, the more the flavor increased, and the soggier the fries became. By the time he reached the sole of the sock, the fries were almost black from absorbing whatever was on the bottom of the sock, and Dillian was actually wishing he had some bra sweat left over to wash down the much worse taste and feel of the now slippery, grimy fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, with only a few moments where he had to stop or risk upchucking everything, Dillian was once again victorious, much to Mel\u2019s chagrin. Although his stomach was in knots, and his tongue wanted to fall off, the rest of Dillian\u2019s body was actually feeling pretty good, until he saw Mel grab his burger... And shove it down the back of her yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only watch in horror as she slammed her ass down on the seat next to him with an audible squishing splatter, smearing her ass all over the seat before finally stopping to--- PPPLLLLOOOOORRRRFFFTTT!!! \u201cAaawww...\u201d With a contented sigh, Mel reached back and pulled the burger back out from her pants, and plopped it onto his plate. The thing was surprisingly still intact, and looked like it had been all steam-pressed down into a much flatter version of itself, burger, bacon, lettuce, and all. Visible stink lines came off of it, and Dillian was pretty sure the pool of liquid it was now sitting in was only partially (and a small amount at that) burger grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m eating that. That has nothing to do with Mila!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re twins, dumbass. Eating that is pretty much as close as you can get to Mila doing the same thing. If you really like her, you know how she is. Do you really think she\u2019s NOT going to accidentally do that to your food some day? And you know I wouldn\u2019t even let you THINK about pointing out what she did and making her feel bad about it! Anyway, would you rather taste something a bit more ripe from back there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian blanched at the very thought, but looking back to the burger didn\u2019t make it much better. Could he really do this? With all the enthusiasm of a death row walker, Dillian gritted his teeth and grabbed the burger. It was... smaller now, but even the feeling of the soggy bread against his fingers sent his skin crawling. When he finally built up the willpower again to take a bite... It was like \u201cmaking out\u201d with Mila\u2019s ass all over again, if not worse. He couldn\u2019t even taste burger. It was like the poor thing had become the embodiment of Mel\u2019s butt. The sweat of her ass was the burger grease, the usual aroma of burger was replaced with nothing but fart smell, and the whole thing literally tasted like shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian was literally fighting back tears as he forced his way through the vile \u201cfood\u201d. Doing his best not to think about it, he actually bit the tip of his fingers before he realized he had done it. Somehow he had forced the ass burger down. He had beat Mel. He turned to beam at her triumphantly, only to see her holding something out of a nightmare. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your desert! Hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was dangling from the prongs of a fork in Mel\u2019s hand was the remnants of a thong. The thing looked like it had once been a light color of some kind, maybe even white, but any trace of that original color was now long gone. The thing was dripping what he could only hope was sweat all over the table. The side straps were yellow, almost green from sweat, the front stained with a different shade entirely, along with off grey stains that had nothing to do with the original coloring. Finally, the back was... well it was brown. And green. And every color in between. It was smeared with what could only be absolute filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel could only laugh maniacally at Dillian\u2019s look of absolute horror, he victory all but assured by his face alone. But something about the sneer she had on, the cruel laugh, the evilness in her eyes... Something caused Dillian to snap. Faster than even he could register what he was doing, the thing that used to be a thong was in his mouth, and with a gulp... It was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mel and Dillian sat in shocked silence for what seemed like an eternity at what had just transpired. \u201cW-wow... I guess you really do...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it was like everything he had just ate hit Dillian at once, the monstrosity of his \u201cdesert\u201d hitting him like a baseball bat to the face. \u201cBATHROOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strength he didn\u2019t know he had, Dillian practically lifted Mel out of the booth, leaving her standing and staring after him as he bee-lined to the bathroom with all intent of purging every bit of his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blur, Dillian burst into the bathroom, swinging open the first stall and diving face first into-- Mila\u2019s butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila had barely made it to the bathroom before she had quite literally exploded. Her movement had been so potent that the toilet had not kept up with her courtesy flushes and had very nearly overflowed by the time she was done. She was about to make her way back to Dillian and Mel when she realized... The stall didn\u2019t have any TP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Dillian, in his haste to find a bathroom, he had entered the wrong one. Even more unfortunate, Mila had just turned to look at her \u201cmasterpiece\u201d with her shorts still around her ankles when he burst into the stall she had been in too much of a hurry to lock. And so now he had re-lodged his face into an all too familiar ass, albeit even more dirty than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oooh Dillian... I know you\u2019re eager, but... I didn\u2019t even get to wipe, there wasn\u2019t any toilet paper... Mmmmm, but I guess if you don\u2019t mind...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian could only cry tears of mud as the stall door closed behind him and Mila shoved her apparently VERY dirty ass back, smothering him against the now closed cubicle door and continuing where in her mind they had left off with him making out with her butt. Mila was in absolute heaven as she ground and bucked against his face faster and faster, smothering Dillian more and more with her dirty butt until she reach satisfaction with an ecstatic moan and stepped forward, an unconscious but (barely) alive Dillian slumping to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest... Date... Ever!!! Hehehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian slowly came to, the smell of ass still firmly lodged in his nostrils as he looked around and realized he was in Mila and Mel\u2019s room, more specifically in Mila\u2019s bed. He thought about just going back to sleep when he noticed Mel sitting in a chair beside him, startling him enough to nearly fall onto the floor. \u201cGeez, over-react much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where\u2019s Mila?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe went to the store to get us stuff for breakfast tomorrow. She\u2019ll be back in an hour or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian couldn\u2019t believe it, how could Mila leave him alone with his tormentress like this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel just rolled her eyes at his obvious distress. \u201cAfter you passed out and we brought you here, Mila made me promise I would make sure you were okay and not mess with you until you woke up.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I get it, you really, really like her now. I thought you were just running to go get sick at the restaurant, but Mila told me about how you checked to make sure she was okay... And how it was the best date she ever had. So... I promised I would try to get along with you a little better. So although it would have been too perfect to bury your head in all the gym clothes she brought home while you slept, I didn\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian couldn\u2019t help but be slightly impressed (although he also noticed that she was still thinking of ways to torture him, even if she hadn\u2019t acted on them). He even thought for a moment that this might be a turning point for them, and new kind of relationship between them... Until she suddenly stood up and started wrenching down her yoga pants to show off her jiggling bare ass. \u201cW-what are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Mila wanted me to stop getting in between you two now that I know you really like her for her, but... I still think you\u2019re kind of a pussy. I mean, you pass out all the time! Even Mila agreed you could toughen up a bit.\u201d Dillian couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing; who could go through what he did with these girls and NOT pass out (or worse)? \u201cSooo, we came up with an agreement. I\u2019ll try to not to get in the way of your relationship, but when she\u2019s not around, you and I get to... \u2018bond\u2019 a bit while I toughen you up! Win-win really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillian begged to differ, as this essentially just meant although he might be able to have a real relationship that Mel could all but openly torture him now, but he found he wasn\u2019t given time to argue when Mel suddenly jumped up onto the bed butt-first. Her giant globes of flesh parted in slow motion to engulf his face in dank, swampy ass as it came down in full force. Dillian tried to scream, kick, anything to get her off, but Mel only shifted her hips above him to drive him deeper. \u201cWow, Mila was right, this really does feel amazing... Anyway, keep struggling like that, it\u2019ll raise your endurance\u2014and no passing out! I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re able to handle anything Mila throws at you, although... It may take a few years to whip a loser like you into shape...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPRRRROOOOFFFTTTT!!! \u201cWheew, pre-dump farts are the WORST, huh? You better hope Mila doesn\u2019t take too long, \u2018might get a bit messy otherwise...\u201d PPPRRAASSSHHHTTT!!!</span></div></div>",

Looking around, he realized he had fallen asleep once again in the pilot's seat, a bad habit learned from not quite being able to trust the auto-pilot of the hand-me-down ship that he was currently flying in.  The Rainbow Guppy, a name engraved into the ship in such a way that he'd have to replace the entire hull to change...  Something he couldn't quite convince himself to commit to. \"Jaaaaaaax... Waaaaakey waaaaaaakeeeeeey!!!\"  Speaking of the auto-pilot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Jessi Plus\" edition, or so he was told...  He wasn't sure who the hell Jessi was, and why anyone would want a \"Plus\" version of her, but...  He kinda wanted them dead.  \"I'm awake, Jessi...\"  He ran a hand through his messy hair, getting up and taking off his clothes as he made his way to the ship shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, oh my gosh, Jax...  You're so naughty!\"  Jax rolled his eyes, how could a ship be this flirtatious?  In a few moments the mist-shower had done it's job, and he was clothed again before plopping his mostly average body back into his pilot's chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jessi, run me through the job for today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a delivery!  Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax wasn't laughing.  He had to have the most ditzy auto-pilot in the universe, one of quite a few reasons he spent so much otherwise unneeded time in the pilot's seat.  \"Just...  give me info on the planet I'm delivering to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure!

I guess it's like a swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"It's a desert... Or just really hot.  Like, buckets of sweat hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. \"Oooo, I've always wanted to visit the Amazon!

As he surveyed the area, the ocean he was swimming in seemed to get even deeper than he thought, as he noticed coral beds hundreds of feet below him.

First off, if an AI was technologically advanced enough to have it's own personality, who in the world would choose to give it a hyper, naive, and bubbly one? Most travelers are given intellectual, rational, and calculating AI counter-parts, while Jax was given Jessi PLUS which seemed to be the opposite of all those traits while finding a way to flirt with Jax while being unable to enter human form. His eyes widened in fear at the thought, he couldn't help but be a little nervous over her seemingly increasing amorous behavior towards him and her odd interest in smells despite her inability to know what senses even were. But the ship was cheap so he couldn't complain too much. Another question that came to mind was what exactly was he delivering to these planets? And his final question he asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which planet is offering the most money for delivery?\" Jax asked Jessi PLUS as he entered the main deck of the ship and look out to the surrounding stars. He couldn't help but sigh at the vast amount of planets, and the fact that he was stuck with the most undesirable ones. But since no one else would go to these planets, they paid nearly double, and usually for pretty basic products, so Jax saw it as easy money... usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, hehehe. You always ask questions that you like know the answer to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the 'really smelly' one isn't it?\" Jax answered hanging his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaaa! You're so smart... and um kind of like cute, for a human...\" Jessi said, attempting to whisper despite the fac that her voice was comng through the speakers that filled the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax just rolled his eyes as he sat in the ship's passenger chair and said, \"I guess we're going to the swamp planet, please locate a proper place to land, I'd rather not have to swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... you're no fun, I wish I could swim. If I could swim I'd go like really super deep into the water and enjoy the feeling of warm... slimy... salty... fish and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JESSI! LANDING GEAR NOW!\" Jax yelled as he noticed Jessi lose control of the ship during her day dream. And in response Jessi PLUS instantly leveled the ship and ejected the landing gear to avoid a crash landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" the speakers sheepishly emitted as Jax shook his head and went towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessi, upload the coordinates and package please,\" Jax asked before leaving, and in response his wristband flashed a bright light signaling the containment of the package and coordinates to the customer. Now that he was equipped, Jax opened the door and was instantly hit with a strong BO and used bathroom like aroma that caused him to take a step back as the smell felt like a wall hitting him. Through his watering eyes he was happy to see that they avoided the lakes that filled the swamp like planet and was presented with three paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. There's a large shack in the distance, from where you were it seemed a little bigger then normal, but maybe they could guide you through the dangerous wooded terrain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Brave the thick, wooded area and get to the customer as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If Jax could find a boat, the flow of the thick swamp lakes might get him faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could barely keep on his feet, the smell was so strong, not to mention the lack of conventional air.  Luckily, he felt his cybernetics and nano-machines kick in, and soon he was able to breathe normally...  Unluckily, in another lack of upgrading, his cybernetics/nanos, though amazing at making him be able to survive in any type of air (or otherwise), did NOTHING to mask the smell or even the FEEL of the gaseous air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... why do all the planets I visit smell so damn BAD?\"  Jax rolled his eyes, adding the smell dampener to his list of upgrades--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaaaxyyyy, how does it smell?  Is it awesome?  I wish I could smell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax rolled his eyes as Jessi spoke over his sub-dermal communication device.  \"Jessi...  It's sad to say that I really believe you do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do... Why else would I like, say it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind, Jessi, let me get to the delivery...\"  Happily, Jessi shut up for the moment, giving him some time to take in his surroundings. Checking his wrist PDA, he saw that the straightest route would take him through some sort of forest...  With trees that were dripping some kind of goop...  Not the most promising of paths.  He also supposed if there was life on this planet, they must use some kind of transportation to get across the swamps...  But without some kind of guide, there was no guarantee he would even be able to use it depending upon the technology/lack thereof.  \"So...  The best course of action would be to find a guide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Oh!  I know where to find one!!!  Or... At least there's some kinda life over in that shed-looking place over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax arched an eyebrow in doubt, but at least there DID seem to be some kind of giant shack fairly nearby... \"Alright, making my way there now...\"  Making his way to the shed, Jax did his best to avoid the usual pitfalls of swamps, making sure to test his footing before committing his full weight, etc.  He still couldn't get used to the smell, and it didn't help that the planet itself seemed to function like a cluster of butts, the pools of filth around him randomly releasing swamp gas with actual small fart sounds.  By the time he made it to the shack, Jax was almost wishing he had forced his way through the \"forest\" just to get this over with.  But now that he was here...  The shack was a lot bigger than he had expected.  The door was huge, so much so that it hardly made a sound when he knocked on it, getting no response from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure there's an... INTELLIGENT life form in there, Jessi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... It's at least as smart as me, so yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Jax rolled his eyes as he noticed the door was slightly ajar.  Steeling his nerve, he used all his strength to force the door open, the air released from inside somehow making the air even harder to tolerate.  Still, this was his objective... With a sigh, Jax stepped inside...  Only to have the door swing shut behind him, the sound of the latch clicking sealing him inside.  No turning back now...  As he turned from the door to look at the inside of the shack, his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  A humongous scaly tail suddenly shoots out and wraps around him, as a voice says, \"Oh good, I could use a little 'sssssqueeze toy' to help me pussssssh all of thisssss out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  \"U-umm... O-occupied...\"  SSSSPPPPUUUUURRRRSSSSHHHHTTTT!!!  He sees an absolutely massive pair of hips/ass sitting on a toilet that instead of ending in legs, ends in the 8 legs of an octopus, and a very blushing face past an extra large pair of bare tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

At first he wonder what could be so awful but he didn't have to wonder long as his regrettable entrance to this large unmarked shed was followed by a a deep sounding burst of gas and waste echoed throughout the shed and caused the already worn wood walls to rumble slightly. His eyes darted to the source of the sound, only to see a grey skinned women who wore a whit tank top that seemed pointless due to the slime like sweat that coated her body made the shirt see through, revealing her enormous chest that put the fabric of the tank top to its limit. Her short hair was slicked back as if she just left the swampy waters, but what instantly caught his attention was her multiple legs, all leading into thick and plump thighs, that eventually connected to the mountainous rear end that seemed to barely fit on the wooden bench she was on. And as Jax's eyes wandered to her lower half another short wet burst sounded from below her, followed by several heavy splashes, which lead to Jax realizing that he must have walked into this woman's outhouse, that apparently 'dumped' into the swamp itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry I think I might be...\" BBBRRRUUMMPPPPLLRRRRT!  \"I'll be an hour or more...\" The woman sheepishly said almost wispering but forced to talk louder to be heard over her own blasts of gas. \"D-do you mind u-uum...\" she began to say but Jax was ready to answer her before she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-no I should apologize,\" Jax said happy he stumbled in on someone a little more kind then his past encounters. \"I'll get out of here... right... away.\" Jax said, but he couldn't reach the latch to the door that was easily a foot over his head, which made him realize just how large this woman must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" She said, almost a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I can't reach the latch, do you mind if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN STAY!\" The woman said with excitement causing her stomach to growl as her sudden jolt of energy caused her monstrous bowls to loosen slightly, causing her to moan as she felt what seemed like a steam train move through her eventually reaching its explosive exit as a orchestra of splashes and juicy gas left her, sending tremors through the floor of the well used outhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually looking for someone to help-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!?\" The woman said cutting him off. \"I can use help, I can use help!\" The woman yelled with glee and raised her hand as if she were in a classroom. Jax wanted to explain but the deep yellowish stain that covered the under arm of her battered tank top caused him to grimace slightly wondering if this woman ever bathed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paaww-ease,\" the girl said with big eyes, gripping the bench with her hands and leaning over a bit, and moving closer to him, showing off both her enormous chest that now leaned againt her knees, and her general size, which seemed to nearly double Jax's height. And Jax didn't stand a chance, the smel may have been nearly unbearable, but the woman was so voluptuous he lost all train of thought as he nodded in agreement, causing the women to smile brightly as she grabbed Jax by the hand and pulled him close, and into the smell the fumed from under her, and the smell that came from her own oily body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: She's constipated and needs her belly (or more) rubbed to REALLY get things going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The pile below her is starting to build up, and refuses to spill into the water below.

Whether this was from some sort of arousal, or just a her being an alien thing, he wasn't sure, but the drooling effect of seeing them through her otherwise disgusting tank top was hard hitting regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Olivia, what's yours?\"  The woman's otherwise gray face flashed a bit of the same pink of her nipples as she paused to push again with a SSPPLLLUUUUUURRRSSSHHHHTTTPLUUUURRRPPP!!!  \"Oooh...

Before he knows it, Olivia has lifted up her massive mammaries and dragged him face-first against the pudge of her belly.  Of course he had his mouth open to ask her what exactly she meant, which meant that he immediately received a mouthful of the oily concoction that covered her entire body.  He nearly hurled down Olivia's front as he was forced to ingest some sort of mixture of drool, snot, and the most disgusting sweat imaginable.  In a panic, he did his best to flail and get away, but Olivia only released her breasts and they splashed down and pinned him to her giant front, any attempts to get away only succeeding in making out with/grinding up against her underboobs, tummy, and love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jax, you...

It feels REALLY good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how good it feels to Olivia, all Jax feels is disgust as his body is soon as practically covered in slime as hers is, even if otherwise rubbing up against a giant \"woman's\" front like this wasn't ALL bad...  The sound of her stomach was more than a little distracting, although it was probably the only reason he hadn't lost his cookies yet as it roared tremendously, her ass obviously kicking into maximum overdrive at Jax's impromptu \"belly\" rub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

But that left Jax with the paint peeling stench of her body odor that seemed to radiate off of her, and it seemed like every time Jax tried to get a breath of fresh (or fresh-er) air Olivia's hand pressed him against her roaring stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... *BBRROOUUPPLLSSRRT!* Ohhh...\" Olivia moaned between bursts, and started to become enraptured by the blissful feeling of her release and the massage Jax was currently treating her to. And as if she began to forget Jax was even there, she pulled her tank top down and over Jax sealing him in with her slime slicked body with her tank to that has soaked up an unforeseen amount of filth to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMM-HHHMM!\" Jax tried to moan, as Olivia shut her eyes and pressed her hands against her tank top that covered him, but his struggles didn't improve his situation as he began to work his way up. He eventually was forced between the canyon that was Olivia's  chest, nearly fitting most of his upper body between them, as the concentrated stench between her breasts hit Jax like a wrecking ball. He began to gag and gasp for air as her breasts came close to smothering him, but any time he opened his mouth, he was punished with the taste of collected sweat and filth. But then something shook happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBRROOOUUUAAARRSSSPPPLLLUUURRRRTTT-CCRRKKLLE-SSPLLOORRSSHHPPPT!  <br>\r\nBBRROOUUMMFFFRR-PPRROOUMMPPLLRRT!<br>\r\nPPLOORRT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jax, you...\" Olivia paused to catch her breath, as her more recent release clearly took some effort, which explained where her focus went. And anyone outside the outhouse would have understood after seeing the beaten down shack rumble slightly as tremors shot through the ground. \"You... I mean no one... Well, I never had anyone willing to help me with my... blockage,\" she said not realizing that you were struggling to stay conscious while trapped within her slick, sweat soaked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say... YOU'RE THE BEST!\" Olivia shouted while hugging you, and incidentally smearing you against the several streams of slimy sweat that ran between her breasts. \"I can FINALLY feel my belly... Hmmff! Starting up,\" Olivia said as she began to shut her left eye and grunt as she forced some of the bigger stuff out of her. Jax could only here muffles of what she said as her boobs seemed to seal off most of his hearing, but he could have swarn that he heard her say that she was 'starting' causing him to struggle for freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" *CCCRRRKKLLE-PPPLLOOSSRRRHHH-BBBLLUUAARRRT!* Olivia once again became lost in her sense of relief as if she's been holding this in for weeks. But her grip on Jax griped on him to a worrying degree as she lowered him, and for a second Jax was thankful as he was released from Olivia steamy chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaah... T-thank y-you...\" Jax barely muttered as he gasped for air as he was released from Olivia's chamber-like tank top. But when he looked up at her, her eyes were shut and her head was tilted up as if she was being pleasured by her release, but Jax didn't have much time to think as he began to sink lower, and lower, until he began to slip between the center of her tentacles. \"WAI-!\" Jax began to say but it was too late, and as Olivia's face was washed over with a new coating of sweat and a deeper shade of pink blush she began to thrust his face against her sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooaaoo...\" *CCCRROOAAARRKKLE-BBBLLLOOUUAAAARRRSSSPPPLLLRRRT!* Olivia's soft coos were completely masked by her ground shaking blastes of gas and heavily landing pipes of waste. And Jax was now faced with stenches that would have caused him to fight for air on their own, but combined, he was starting to go into tunnel vision as his energy put into his struggle began to weaken. The smell and feel of Olivia's cheesy, filthy, and absolutely unwashed privates brought tears to Jax's face, which was repetitively rammed by the very area that was currently torturing him. But the fuming aroma that was once held at bay by Olivia's booty and constantly being built stronger under her... was now hitting Jax in a nearly physical way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jax's vision was getting more than a bit faded at this point, the atrocious smell of Olivia's shit seeming like it was even going to overpower his nano-machines, a first for him...  Although at this point he was begging for the release of passing out.  Hopefully this behemoth of a octopus woman would just leave him be and he could try to get help from someone who was a little less...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSPPPLLLLLUUUUURRRSSSSSHHHTTTT!!!  SPPLOORRT!  SPPLAATTT!  SSSPPPREEEEFFFTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, a LOT less disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Jax was about to pass out (a happy circumstance, he decided, even if he didn't wake up again), he suddenly felt himself shift slightly, and before he knew it Olivia's sex was not so much smashing up against him with Olivia's thrusts as before...  But more devouring his face like a drooling french kiss.  Sensing the lack of oxygen, his nanos kicked in suddenly, and he just as suddenly found himself fully awake as Olivia's sex sucked onto his face, the horrendous fishy, musky smell being smeared into every orifice as Olivia began to gyrate her hips into his face, her tentacles pressing harder and harder into his back as she went.  Jax screamed for release (or attempted to), but only received mouthfuls of the most foul tasting juices imaginable for his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, Jax!!!  I never--  OOOOHHH!!!  SSSPPPPRRRAAAASSSHHHHTTTT!!!  Oh here it comes!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax could only cry as Olivia's sex clamped down on his face, and before he knew it, he was being blasted out by a veritable tidal wave of gross sex \"nectar\", finally free but now covered in a horribly nasty combination of bodily fluids.  \"Oh gosh...  That's the best I've felt in SOOO long!  You really ARE the best, Jax!!!  Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax could only cough and sputter, trying to get his breath on air that was nearly bite-able with thick shitty smell.  \"Please...  I'm here for help--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, I know!  And what a help you are!  I would never have asked this when you came in here, but now... Well I know you'll be up for the challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax stares at Olivia dumbfoundedly, too taken aback at how bad of an idea trying to get help from this girl was/too tired from his resent sexcapade to resist as she suddenly turns around, presenting an absolutely gigantic pale gray ass...  Well, at least the parts that weren't completely splattered in green and brown shit (which wasn't much).  The bulbous butt was literally drooling shit, to the point that Jax wasn't completely sure she had even stopped pooing.  The sight alone was enough to make Jax dry heave, but the smell was enough to make him throw up in his mouth, especially when Olivia's tentacles suddenly latched onto him and dragged him closer.  \"Olivia, do--!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use...  Jax's body was smashed unceremoniously into the completely disgusting butt, his face especially being smeared into the deepest, dankest bits of it.  Before long he was literally making out with this octowoman's ass hole, while it still spluttered gas intermittently.  SPPRRTT  FFRRRFFTTT  PLOORT!!!  \"Aahh...  You don't mind, right Jax?  Oh, who am I kidding, you're the best helper ever!\"  SPPPRRRSSSHHHTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax tried to back out and get some distance, but he only found a wall against his back, which Olivia took as a cue to smash him up against it.  In an instant, Jax found himself wishing to be making out with Olivia's fetid crotch again, as his current predicament was him making out with an even more decidedly dirty orifice and by her moans he was doing a VERY good job of it.  \"Ooooh, Jax...  Keep that up and I'm gonna... I'm gonna...  PPPLLLOOOOORRRSSSSHHHHTTTT!!!  Aaahhh...\"  Jax was horrified for the umpteenth time today when Olivia seemed to \"orgasm\" again, this time instead of \"juices\" a milkshake of butt blast was forced down his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Olivia was done, Jax was covered head to toe in shit, his stomach having been force fed a fair share of it, and Olivia's ass looked just as dirty as ever...  \"Thanks so much Jax!  And here I thought humans were all selfish!  Hehehe!\"  Jax could barely stay standing (although wether he was standing or just plastered against the wall, he wasn't sure), let alone run away like he wanted to, but luckily she seemed to be done torturing him for now.  \"Sooo...  Is there anything I can help YOU with?\"  Olivia cocked and eyebrow seductively as she turned back to Jax, obvlivious to his disgusting state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gone through all the torture this girl could POSSIBLY put him through, Jax decided it was about time to seize the opportunity to try and get this damnable job out of the way, finally getting out what he had been trying to all along.  \"I-I need to make a delivery...  And I w-was hoping for directions...\"  He showed her his coordinates as best he could with his poo and god knows what else covered device, causing Olivia to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're so sweet!  You're on a job and you're willing to stop and help little old me?  Hehehe!  Well of course I'll help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  \"I know exactly where that is!  I can take you through a shortcut through the swamp and get you a lot closer!\"  (Jax's nano's keep him alive as Olivia drags him through the swamp, him being able to experience every disgusting bit, especially when she swims right through the shit storm she just released INTO the swamp. (Long winded, sorry. XP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Other choices.</span></div></div>",

No c'mon lets go while the sun is still up!\" She said as she flung you over her shoulder. She probably wanted her to hang on to her back, but she was so slimy and moving so fast you couldn't get a grip. Your face rubbed up against her acne infested back, some so fresh that they popped on impact, while your hands reached around her back and grabbed her chest accidentally, causing your hands to sink deeply into her pillow like breasts that were barely covered by her grime coated tank top, causing her to yelp in surprise and stop in her tracks. \"EP! Uh-uh... not right now, silly. You have a job to do... LATER!\" she said a little over enthusiastically, catching herself off guard, only to repeat herself, \"M-Maybe later, I mean,\" as she slapped your hands away and continued moving causing you to slide down deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oliv-\" Jax began to say as he feared falling off, until he looked down and realized he had a lot more to fear. Her still shit smeared rear practically left a trail as Olivia sped through the woods, and Jax's foot was already being devoured by it as he slowly fell in like quicksand. Soon, his entire lower body was stuck between her cheeks as the still steaming crap acted like a lubricant and sped up his inevitable imprisonment. \"Olivia!\" He yelled one last time before his neck fell between her cheeks and his legs got lost amongst her 8 scrambling tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there,\" She said basically ignoring him. GGRROOBBBUUMMBBLE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, sorry but all this running is getting my tummy moving again. But don't worry it's just gas, hehehe,\" She said to Jax, who was now muffled by her sweat and shit soaked cheeks. BBBRRROOUUPPFFFLLRRT!<br>\r\n\"Phew... at least I think it's gas. Well no worries just stay away from my um... well my... rear,\" she said blushing as if saying the word embarrassed her, even after she used you as her personal toy just minutes ago. <br>\r\nPPPLLLLHHHHUUURRRAAAAVVVVMMMMFFFFFUUUBBBBT!<br>\r\nBBRROOUUMMFFLLLLRAAAUUURRRRHHHHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMFF-OOLLFF,\" Jax tried to yell, but his cries were nearly muted by her cheeks or over shadowed by her echoing bursts of gas. All while his mouth would get coated in the same shit and grim that currently rubbed against him relentlessly by both of her bouncing cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple more minutes...\" GGRRMMMUUWWBBUULLMMMLLE! \"Uh oh... gimme on sec Jax...\" She said as she once again stopped. Jax could feel her once bounce cheeks flex and stiffen around him as if to hold him in place as she grunted and released a whirlwind of waste that was much more then gas.<br>\r\nFFFFFFFFSSSSSSPPPLLUUUAAARRRRVVVVMMMFFFFFRRRSSSSSUUUUAAARRRRFFFHHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... much better\" she said as a spray of liquid shit layered the ground and several tries behind her. All Jax could do was bare witness as the deafening blast nearly drowned him, and may have done so if not for the nano bots working over time to provide his body with fresh oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERE!\" Olivia yelled out as Jax still struggled to get free, finally leading Olivia to wonder where he was, spinning around to comically look at her own back only to obviously fail. She she felt around with the tentacles only to find your legs under her and pulled you free scrapping you against the ground. Jax wanted to say something but he was in aw at the size of the building in front of him, the door itself had to be 20 feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Jax said looking up at the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she knows everybody, I guess you could say she's our leader. Any transmission that leaves this planet goes through here and... OH! you got some dirt on ya, let me help,\" Olivia said mistaking her own brown skid marks for dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia I can... WAI-!\" Jax was interrupted by Olivia throwing a cupped and full of swamp water, drenching his face and blinding him slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops-oops, I can help!\" She said as she took her tank top and began wiping Jax's face with it, smearing whatever grime it held on to Jax as he nearly tripped backing away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh! You've helped enough Olivia,\" Jax said as Olivia held up her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" she then proceeded to knock on the large door, sending echoing thuds throughout the home. \"She wouldn't hear you if you knocked with those tiny hands, hehehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Jax said as he looked at the door and was a little shocked that she was actually helping him this time. But when he looked back at her, she was already slithering through the woods, and jumped into the swamp, followed by several large dinner plate size bubbles that he doubted came from her mouth. Jax simply stood there nervously as her heard large foot steps come to the door, and as it swung open a nearly visible stench billowed from the entrance and in front of the fog was this large hulking green woman. Her hair was long and sloppily tied in a ponytail, her breasts were large enough to be considered boulders and possibly heavy enough as well from Jax's point of view, her waist held a thin skirt put together from the forest that Jax could nearly look up, and her belly had rolls but the rest of her body was toned and chiseled like a goddess. She was a female Ogre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Who are you!\" She nearly growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... delivery service?\" Jax answered taking a step back just in-case he had to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Good!\" She roared as she opened the door and welcomed you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 : She made the order, but she doesn't trust you, you're going to have to prove that the product you delivered works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2 : Other <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jax stares up at the giantess of an ogre, not believing his luck in the slightest.  All he was here for was to drop off a package, get paid, and move on with his life...  And now he had not only been essentially raped at least twice by an octowoman, but now had to go on a date with some giant ogre's daughter?  Needless to say, he was once again regretting buying his ship and especially not updating the autopilot...  Oh how he wished it was even a <i>fraction</i> more accurate...  Despite all this, he found himself thinking it couldn't get much worse, and if a little date was the price he needed to pay, he was willing to at least give it a go.  \"S-sure...  I'm sure your daughter's... Lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogress blinks down at you a few times, before breaking out in a crooked smile.  \"Oh, you have heard of daughter?  How you know name?  Nevermind.  Good, good.  You meet her now, I bring you to person later.  Good?  Good.  Me Delight.  Your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax is more than a little confused by her response, but stammers out his name regardless before he finds himself following \"Delight\" into her abode.  The smell that had wafted out only became stronger, and Jax found himself wanting to make a run for it, but he at least had a \"saving grace\" of putting up with Olivia, which had bolstered his ability to put up with this kind of stench...  At least slightly.  \"Hopefully we can do this date in a less smelly area...  but on this planet, I doubt it.\"  So enraptured in his own grumblings, Jax actually didn't notice his view as he followed Delight... At least until she farted.  Suddenly he was snapped out of his thoughts as he was drenched in a spray of ass sweat from the deepest part of Delight's ass, stopping him dead in his tracks as he tried to wipe the disgusting film away, only to have Delight stop at a door and look back at him questioningly.  \"Jax, you come now, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax shook the haze out of his head, forcing himself to nod and move forward as Delight opened a gigantic door for him to show him in.  Stepping into the room, he was first astonished by the amount of technology that was actually in here, and he was left wondering how the hell any of it was functioning.  Cables ran through pools of pond scum, moss grew from monitors, dripping with what could only be described as ooze.  This, of course, was quickly overshadowed by a smell that made him feel like he was taking a whiff of the outhouse at point blank range after Olivia was done with it.  Again, his instincts scream at him to make a break for it, but before he can actually make his first good decision since coming to this planet, Delight suddenly picks him up like a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo shocked at the sudden manhandling of this ogress, Jax nearly misses it when she holds him in front of her daughter...  But his attention is VERY quickly grabbed.  \"Jax, meet Lovely.  Daughter, meet boyfriend.\"  Jax can only stare at the giantess ogre before him.  Apparently she's the actual one all of the transmissions of the planet are going through, various keyboards, controllers, and touch pads surrounding the couch she's sitting on in every which way.  Jax is surprised he even notices this, however, or the couch underneath her because... well...  this ogress is STACKED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax would guess she has a little pudge to her, but it's hard to tell past a pair of completely naked green knockers that are so big you question how she's even able to get to all the electronics around her.  But amazingly enough, even with breasts that make her mother's look like pebbles, Lovely's ass is even bigger, engulfing so much of the couch that he had to do a triple take just to realize she actually WAS sitting on something (and a VERY used something, at that).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaww, come on, Mother...  You know the boys you set up for me are never man enough...\"  Jax is actually okay with this, happy to hopefully dodge that bullet as Lovely shakes her veritable mane of brown/black hair (he can't tell whether that's her natural hair color, or if that's just how dirty her hair is), her smirk showing off a single lower fang that pokes out from her very plump lips.  On top of everything, it seemed the only article of \"clothing\" she did have on was a pair of red framed glasses that strangely complimented her swamp-green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Delight is not willing to give up this easily, and sets Jax down on the armrest of the chair, making sure to give him a \"helpful\" nudge so he stumbles into one of Lovely's overflowing ass cheeks, a horrendous peeling sound being heard as he pushes himself off of it.  No matter how big this woman's assets were, it did nothing to mask the fact that she had most likely not showered in a LOOOONG time, the filth now sticking to his front driving home the point.  \"Daughter get know delivery man, then decide.  Leave you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax is crestfallen as Delight walks away, leaving him next to the behemoth \"beauty\" that was Lovely.  \"Geez...  Mother is always doing this...  No one has been able to SURVIVE being with me for more than 5 minutes, let alone a tiny little hu-- hum--  AAACHOOOO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax is completely blasted by Lovely's sudden sneeze, but although part of him wishes he would be blown off the couch so he can have a chance at getting away, he has no such luck as snot and spit coat him from head to toe.  Try as he may to get it off of him, he's only slightly successful, the slime acting like a glue to root him to the spot, unable to even talk to her at this point.  \"Hmmm...  Well at least you can take a bit of snot...\"  Jax cringed as he watched Lovely wipe dangles of snot off onto her arm, before a smirk crosses her face.  \"But let's just cut to the chase, hopefully this just knocks you out and I can get Mom to take you away, but...  I'd prefer you don't die, it'd be a hassle to have to bury your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of horrible scenarios play themselves out in Jax's mind, but his thoughts are soon interrupted by a horrendous rumbling that sounds like a muffled version of a terrible fart, only nothing seems to come of it...  Until Lovely leans her weight to the side for a second and with a hellacious \"WHOMP!\" the nauseous plume of gas comes tearing out from the bulk of her ass cheek and all but sticks in a cloud around him.  Jax wishes he could pas out, wishes he could run away, hell wishes he could DIE as the fart as green as her skin takes up every bit of air around him, but the snot and spittle forced him to stay and endure it all especially as his nanos kick in for the seemingly hundredth time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...  That even knocked out that ogre my mom tried to hook me up with, and he was at least my height...  Well, I guess I just had to find someone a little bit on the... smaller side.\"  Jax can only sweatdrop as Lovely looks at him in a much more attracted way, forced to witness the \"lovely\" scene of Lovely shifting her massive bulk until she is laying on her side, her breast up against the back as her butt literally overflows the front of the couch onto the floor for all Jax can see, one hip jutting up impossibly.  \"Tell you what, do me a favor and I'll see what I can do about getting Mom to let you finish your little delivery, alright 'Boyfriend'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax by this time is VERY sick of helping people out, but can only muster a nod to Lovely's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he very much is forced again to realize the mistake of his \"helpfulness\" when with a LOT of difficulty, Lovely pulls her upper ass cheek away from the other with a terrible peeling noise, strands of sweat, body filth, and god knows what else trying desperately to keep them together.  With little foreplay, Lovely tears him from the couch arm with her free hand and places Jax on her lower cheek before using both hands as best she can to pull her ass cheeks completely apart.  \"It's been FOREVER since my bum hole has gotten a good scratch-- Hell, since it's been TOUCHED, so...  Go ahead and get in there and give it a really good massage, okay?  I mean, since ya don't mind my butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJax looks at the filth covered, shit smeared, pimple infested abyss that is Lovely's sideways ass crack, every inch only getting dirtier until it ended in the absolute \"black\" hole that was her poor, unattended asshole.  Jax was left with a choice.  Keep up the trend of helping people out, hoping Karma would eventually pay him back, or throw away any \"progress\" he had made up until this point.  Although he hated himself more today than just about any other in his life, he couldn't help but feel that if he quit now, all the hell he had been through up til now would have been for nothing... Not to mention there was no guarantee he would get out of this alive if he suddenly got on these ogress' bad sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith actual tears rolling down his face, Jax made the slow and arduous trek towards Lovely's least lovely of areas.  Each step tranfered more filth onto him, especially as the \"ceiling\" of the ass cheek looming over him came lower the closer he got.  As if to add insult to injury, Lovely seemed to be enamored with his ability to withstand her farts, and therefore was giggling as she pushed out little poots every few moments, not enough to push him back out, but enough to continuously add to the already always growing stench of her butt.  PPPRRPPTT!!!  PPLLAAARRTTT!!!  PPRRRFFFTTT  SSSLLRRRTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an especially potent burst, Jax lost his footing and fell forward, only to land on an absolutely giant batch of pimples, all of which of course pop and spew gunk on him at the slightest contact, even bursting others around him he HADN'T touched, causing more than a few twitches and moans from Lovely.  \"Oooohh...  Jax...  And here I thought you couldn't handle me...  And now you're even popping all the annoying acne in my ass crack!  I think...  I might be starting to fall for you, my little Delivery Boy...\"  PPLLRRRTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Continued in next chapter, character limit reached.)</span></div></div>",

Lovely is so startled/aroused that she completely forgets to hold back her ass cheek and Jax is in seconds completely buried in ass fat, his body plastered to Lovely's hole and being smeared and scraped across it with every jiggle and twitch of her butt (which is a LOT).  \"OOOOHHH  JAX!!!

Unfortunately, although the soft couch kept Jax from feeling any pain, it didn't help the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh-ough,\" Jax moaned and wheezed as the couch that he was pressed up against has probably absorbed more punishment then Jax is ready to imagine, while Lovely's bulging ring pressed itself against most of his chest, just under his chin, occasionally hitting his chin as it twitched. While the rest of his body was entombed within the now sealed valley that is Lovely's ass crack. Jax's already torturous environment only got worse as time went on as Lovely occasionally shifted in her sleep, smearing Jax with the hair, filth, and clearly apparent acne that plagued the deepest depths of her ass which Jax was currently trapped within. The swamp's humidity was clearly not kind to Lovely either as her crack gained its own swamp-like space and began to sweat profusely, with no where to go but on to Jax, coating him to the point that the couch cushion under him was forced to soak some of it, adding to its already retched stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm-Meat... Roast... Rrrrr-Rotten Roast... Mmm-Rrr...\" Lovely spoke incoherently as she dreamed, snored, and moaned, but Jax and lovely weren't the only ones moaning. Lovely's plump belly seemed to churn in her sleep, giving off loud ominous groans that even Jax could here. The sounds seemed to try and warn Lovely of a war that was being fought within her as sounds ranging from copious amounts of bubbles to bass filled grinding of cheap metal being twisted. But all her subconscious did was have her hand move to her belly, otherwise she was a large soft statue, apparently in a coma after being so intimately touched by Jax after going so long without a single man being able to survive the darkest parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGRROOUAAMMVVLLUUVV* The more loud and violent churning made itself known to Jax below her, as her began to sweat... or maybe that was her's... it was hard to tell at this point. But Jax has been around to know what those sounds meant, and he was in a dangerous place if it was true. So he tried desperately to escape, using the additional adrenalin to fuel his attempts at movement, but despite the slick rainfall of sweat, Lovely's monstrous weight made it impossible to move. But he still tried, he couldn't give up, in seconds Lovely's ring began to swell to the point it pressed against his chin as her subconscious tried to contain the inevitable. And like a failing dam, her anus began to leak small puffs of gas that made Jax heave slightly, and only weakened his attempts at escaping, until escape was no longer relevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr...\" Lovely groaned in her sleep as the now unending sounds coming from her belly became uncomfortably, and if it was giving HER discomfort... then something large was on its way. And with a single sigh, her swollen-pulsing anus finally gave way and released.<br>\r\nBBBBRRROOOUUUUUUUUMMVVVLLLLLAAAARRRPPPHHHHFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPLLLLOOUUUHHHRRRRBBBBVVVMMMRRRRRRAAAAUUUDDDDDDPPPPPT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFVVVVVVLLLLUUURRRRRRHHHHH-BBBBBBLLLLLLAAAAARRRRVVVVVVDDDDHHHHPPPPPPRRRRT !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch under her which once absorbed the blows she gave it couldn't take in the avalanche of wet gas that she was sending it. Her expansive cheeks jiggled and rippled due to the seismic blasts she was releasing under her. During this Jax was in a state of shock, everything seemed to move a little slower as he was pummeled by the gas she was releasing. He was stuck in the originating point of the green tinted fog that billowed out from under her, the gas exited her so violently that it seemed to move straight through the center cushion that she was sitting on and steam from the cushions on the left and right, turning the entire couch into a steaming pot of whatever Lovely was cooking, with Jax being the main ingredient. The blasts even shook the floor of the stone castle slightly, catching Delight's attention as she sighed with disappointment, thinking that her daughter killed another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter... Daughter-Lovely!\" Delight shouted in attempts to wake her seemingly comatose daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... huh?\" Lovely moaned while in the process of waking up and continued on to say with a yawn, \"One sec mother, Hmf!\"<br>\r\nBBBVVVLLLLRRRRUUUMMMMFFFRRRRAAAAAAPPPT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFLLLOORRRMMMVVVVRRT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, morning mother.\" She said adjusting her red rimmed glasses and stretching her arms over her head, completely ignoring the visible stench emitting from below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter...\" Delight said shaking her head slowly with a look of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, Jax!\" She said as she finally lifted herself off of the couch which was now steam pressed into the shape of her two globular buns with Jax barely moving in the center. \"See! He's fine, you found a good one mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh?\" Delight said gawking at Jax as he squirmed and slowly gained his sight back, only to see a giant green face staring back at him, causing him to yell in surprise and Delight to clasp her hands in happiness. \"Good-good! You date daughter now, yes? Go-go, now-now, get-get,\" Delight said putting Jax in Delight's hands and pushing them out of the stone castle doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess we're dating now. So you're officially my boyfriend!\" Lovely said with excitement. Her glee filled expression then melted into a mischievous gaze as she brought Jax closer to her face and said in a more seductive tone, \"...and lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA-BUT-I... MISSION-PACKAGE,\" Jax tried to argue but all his frustration came out in a flustered rambling that went ignored by Lovely as she pressed Jax into the BO fuming region between her breasts which was her cleavage for what she thought was safe travel. And once Jax get situated enough to see where they were going he noticed Lovely stopped at what he could guess was their destination and date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Large and very familiar out house, she needs to make a pit stop. But 'someone' clogged it... or burried it is a better term, Jax is gonna need to help her solve this dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the door shut behind Jax the echoing sound of a woman's voice surprised him as he stumbled back and pressed his back against the door he entered through forcing the latch to the shed to lock. But he ignored the sound of the door latching as the smell that seemed to steam from his left filled the air and forcing him to look over and see a massive pile of logs with what looked like an explosion of waste on the wall behind is that was still dripping.  \"U-um I was actually just here to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a kind young man you are, to wonder into a woman's bathroom to help her.\" She said, speaking as though she ignored that he said anything at all. And it was then that Jax was able to tear his practically gawking stare from the massive, yet destroyed steaming wooden toilet and up to the corner of the of the tall shed which was filled by a massive spider like form of a woman. Her human torso was was still slightly larger then Jax, but most of her form billowed from her hips and into the gargantuan bulb that was covered in black and purple hair with what he hoped was accents of brown hair coating the rear... but that hope was lost went the back of her spider like rear dripped with the same brown waste that currently buried the outhouse toilet. Her chest bounced freely under her shredded shirt as she slowly lowered herself closer to him, and as she leaned in closer to him he tried his best not to star at the large amount of under-boob that her torn shirt couldn't cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just leaving,\" Jax said as he tore his gaze off her chest and frantically jumped for the latch, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, good thinking human. Let me get that,\" The drider said as she landed on the ground with a thud, and displayed her true size, which made Jax feel like a bug compared to her... and bugs and spiders don't get along well. This scarey thought distracted him, as he barely noticed the woman approach him, by simply bumping him out of the way, not bothering to excuse herself, and causing you get knocked into the same bench that struggled to hold the pile of crap that spilled over on to the floor of the outhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Jax said in disgust as he turned around and backed away from the toilet, wiping off any crap that may have gotten on him, and accidently bumping into the rear of the spider woman's bulb causing it to jiggle and twitch slightly as if the feeling caused a pleasurable feeling through her. She moaned a bit, and froze in place as she took a second to enjoy the feeling of his body pressed against the filthiest part of her massive rear. This sensation apparently caused her to loosen her once clenched backside to the point that her still dripping backside opened up and released a blast of juicy gas that filled the shed with a fog like steam, and a stench that seemed to compete with the still fuming pile covering the bench. <br>\r\nBBBRRROOOUUUUUPPPPPPLLLSSSSRRRRRRT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then cleared her throat and said \"Hmm, anxious are we? Well let me get into position first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! *COUGH* No, I was just looking for *COUGH* help around the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet to help me,\" She said, once again ignoring Jax as she opened the outhouse door, but her large bulb like rear was so massive it pressed itself against the sides of the door's frame. But instead of moving any further she began to lift he furry back legs slightly revealing her pulsating ring that seemed ready to burst and still fuming slightly after her most recent blast. \"Now, if you could... Ugh\" The belly of her spider like form began to churn and growl as if she swallowed a lion. But she shrugged it off like a common occurrence and continued on to say, \"Ehem, just move the waste into the toilet was the room fills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the toilet-\"<br>\r\nBBBBRRROOOUUUUPPPLLLLUURRRRFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSSPPPPOORRRRLLLLUUUHHHHHRRRAAAAVVVMMMMFFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCCCRRRRKKLL-BBBRRROOUUFFFLLLAARRRPPP-SSSPPPLLOOORRRFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaste began erupting from behind the drider woman, who outside the shed was shutting her eyes and smirking as she enjoyed the sensation of finally getting some long deserved relief as the stench took on a visible form and a greenish fog began to billow from behind her and steamed from the top of the outhouse door and any crack in the weak wood of the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Stay and help... however you possibly can, she might help you if you help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions 2: Run! She hasn't listened to word you've said, look for someone else to help you, but first you have to find an escape rout.</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, he pulled on a pair of jeans and a crumpled T-shirt, making his way to the door and tugging it open to find... what looked like a delivery person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you Justin?  Sign here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin blinked a few times, trying to remember what he could have ordered, and failing to find a memory, tried to think of an occasion for him to get something sent as a present, with similar failure.  Nonetheless, he could only shrug as he signed for the package--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  Alright boys, go ahead and put it together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--which turned out to be more than a few packages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin watched in bewildered amazement as a crew of men started carting in box after box, apparently deciding to use his living room to put together some sort of... machine?  In an undetermined amount of time, they seemed to finish... Leaving some sort of pod type contraption big enough to fit him standing inside of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, almost forgot...  Here ya go, sir.  Have a good one!\"  With that the delivery person handed Justin a letter, and him and his crew disappeared almost as quickly as they had shown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill utterly confused, and having missed his opportunity to ask the crew what the hell this all was, Justin just opened the letter in hopes of finding out...  And was not disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, it's Ky!  How's it goin'?\"  Justin couldn't help but narrow his eyes slightly as he read the opening line.  Sure, he liked Kyle well and good, but...  Bad things always seemed to happen when they were together.  Nonetheless, he continued reading.  \"So...  I know we haven't hung out in a while, and an acquaintance of mine you don't know yet, Serenity, invented a little something and...  Well I was really tempted to use it, but she likes to set traps for me, so...  I'm giving it as a gift to you!  She doesn't really care about other guys so you should be fine!\"  Justin was feeling more and more dubious, but he forced himself to continue.  \"So I know you've always wanted to visit the middle ages, right?  Well this thing is kind of a...  Time continuation simulator?  I don't know all the details, but you should be able to go ahead and visit that time!  I guess it's set up so you only have to press the button inside and you should be good to go!  Anyway, hope you like it, and don't have too much fun without me!!!\"  Justin scowled as he finished reading.  Sure, he'd love to visit the middle ages, but...  Was it really worth the risk?  He leaned back to rest his back against the device...  Only to find nothing behind him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second in took him to fall back, he realized he had meant to lean against the door, only to have it automatically open, sending him reeling and trying to catch his balance as he stumbled inside and... rammed into a console with a flailing hand... hitting some sort of button as the doors slammed back shut.  Justin could only stand mouth agape in horror as the machine seemed to awaken, his eyes falling onto the bottom part of the letter...  \"P.S.  Serenity sometimes has a little TOO much fun with her inventions, so...  Hopefully nothing too weird happens...  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Ky...\"  Blinding light filled the small capsule, and soon Justin couldn't hold onto consciousness any longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-the hell did this one come from, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not look at me...  The outer walls are impossible to get through, so...  He must have been trying to escape from within?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...  Have you ever heard of a male being in this prison, let alone a... cute one like this?  He would never survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... No...  I mean, it IS a female prison, you dolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then why would he be from inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know?  Anyway...  Our shift is almost over, can we not just toss him back in and let him fend for himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...  I suppose you are right, good luck little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin could barely keep his consciousness from fading again, let alone comprehend what the hell was going on as two burly (and quite frankly quite smelly) women dragged him before throwing him to the ground, a large iron gate slamming itself in place before he could even muster enough strength to sit up.  \"W-wait, hold on!  What's going on, where the hell AM I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ock, as if you do not know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't!  My friend sent me some kind of device, and I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he going on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno...  Poor thing must be raving mad.  'Only logical if he has survived with... THEM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaawww, well in case you really forgot then...  Welcome to \"Widow Abbey\", the place where all you filthy little females-- and well, I guess you-- go to spend the rest of your lives.  Enjoy your stay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin tried to grasp what was going on, tried to rationalize how even something as crazy as Kyle's device could lead to a situation like THIS, but all he succeeded in doing was missing his chance to ask more questions as the two guards walked away snickering.  Looking down to see that he was in essentially burlap clothing, he knew that the machine must be working, but with no way to figure out if he was even still in it...  \"Could this have been a... ONE WAY TRIP?!?!  DAMN YOU KYLE!!!\"  Just wanted to just sit here and scream, but he knew it wouldn't do him much good...  No, he had to turn around, figure out what was going on, if he could get help, and if he could even SURVIVE this place... His apparently new home... \"Widow Abbey\".</span></div></div>",

Bitter sweet because although Kyle dreaded being around this girl he couldn't help but slightly enjoy the feeling of her plump chest pressing themselves against the back of his shoulders due to her larger size then Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Grace,\" Kyle said stuttering.

It seemed as though whenever Grace disgusted Kyle, which was often, he was left mute and couldn't say a word for several minutes leaving Grace to think that he was comfortable around her. And this meant Grace rarely left his side since no one else would be friends with her... for several reasons. <br>\r\nGrace was a unique girl, she was tall and already full figured while only being in grade school, but what usually catches people's attention is her fluffy bear ears that protruded from her long bouncy brown hair. She seemed sweet and kind, her skin was pale and freckles ran across her nose and scattered themselves along her shoulders and thighs in a cute way. But female bears whether they be hybrid or anthro have a bad rep for being hulking hot heads and abusive, so most people avoid Grace just because of her intimidating stature and nationality, despite her generally thin frame, but those who get too close usually run off anyway after getting one whiff of her. She was a tomboy to most, but those who knew better knew she took that trait a step further and seemed to never bathe. If she did it was most likely only because she was starting to actually smell herself, which usually took weeks if not a month to actually happen. She also didn't seem to groom herself too well, her face and back had occasional acne and her armpits... well they were starting to show signs of puberty in more ways then one. As if to remind Kyle of this Grace swung her arm over his should and pressed him against her, shoving him in the stink cloud the emitted from under her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early,\" she said as Kyle could barely speak as he gagged on Grace's smell. He then looked at her and her green eyes looked down on him before she gave him a mischievous smirk as she said, \"You know what I want big guy, let me see it,\" almost in a suductive tone causing parts of Kyle to stir that usually never did around Grace.<br>\r\n\"I want your lunch!\" She then grabbed his lunch bag and continued to ask, \"Oh! Your mom made you tuna and milk, can I have it!? Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, I think it-\" Kyle was about to tell her that it went bad a couple days ago, but she already engulfed it giving him a quizzical look, waiting for him to finish his sentence, but he just said, \"Nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see ya at lunch,\" Grace said as they reached the school and she stopped to hug him, pressing Kyle into her unrestrained chest that nearly filled her loose fitting flannel shirt. Once lunch rolled around Grace sat next to Kyle with her tray full to the brim of food, but she had a stressed look on her face and her forehead seemed to have a little more sweat then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling okay Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my stomachs just a bit upset. But nothing to worry about, I think I'm just hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When aren't you? haha,\" Kyle said jokingly receiving a playful punch to the arm from Grace, unfortunately a playful punch still seemed to leave a bruise at her strength, which caused Kyle to rub the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a wuss,\" Grace said noticing Kyle rub the spot she punched, and while devouring her food she continued on to say, \"So you coming over?\" While nearly spitting food at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, movie night right?\" Kyle asked stuttering slightly as he struggled to speak as he watched Grace devour her food like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any movie, <b>Horror Movie Night MWAHAHAHA!</b>,\" She growled in an intimidating low voice that was actually a bit comical to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You sure you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! I can handle anything,\" Grace said with a close eyed smirk, but as if to challenge her statement he stomach gave off a bubble water cooler type gurgle that caused her confident closed eyes to open in worry. *GGRRUUMMBBUUBBLLOORRB*<br>\r\nBoth of them didn't bother to say anything, Kyle was slightly disgusted, and for once Grace was a bit embarrassed to show weakness, and worse, to show a much more disgusting side to her that Kyle hasn't witnessed yet.<br>\r\nSoon school was over and the two of them went straight to Grace's house, with her mom and older sister watching television. Both of them filled the couch to the fullest, and put its carrying capacity to the test as the cushions seemed to be flattened to non-existence. As they entered Grace's mother jumped from the couch in excitement to see Kyle while Grace's older sister seemed to look away and apply a bit of make up and bounce her curly black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,\" Grace said as if she were embarrassed by how her mother acted, but her mother just couldn't contain her happiness that her daughter had a friend despite her uncouth nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi dearie, oh and you brought your friend!\" She then lunged at Kyle as if she were going to pounce on him, but instead hugged him, practically engulfing him withing her large frame. She seemed to be covered in perfume as if she was trying to smother a stench she's doing her best to hide, but the only thing she was currently smothering was Kyle with her enormous chest that nearly engulfed Kyle's entire head.  And as she hugged him she began to stand and lifted Kyle nearly a foot off the floor as she said, \"I'm so happy to see you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom please, you're gonna suffocate him,\" Grace said nonchalantly, as if this happens every time. And hearing that caused her to drop Kyle back on his feet as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hun, I guess I don't know my own strength, I think it runs in the family haha. C'mon Wendy lets leave Grace alone with her boyfriend,\" She said causing Grace to uncharacteristically blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ky! Good to see you,\" Grace's sister said, as she strutted over a bit flirtatiously and leaned forward and kissed Kyle on the cheek leaving a residue of red lipstick behind and as she drew back from her tiny kiss she continued to lean forward as if to give Kyle a view of her large chest that seemed to lay in clear naked view. But before Grace could punch her sister for being a flirt with her friend their mom grabbed the back of Wendy's shirt and dragged her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was just saying hi, why can't I stay!?\" Wendy yelled at their mom, who simply retorted, \"Because you can't behave yourself, now go to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" Grace said rolling her eye, still a bit frustrated with her family's welcome party and looked at Kyle and said \"Ew! you got make-up on your face,\" causing Kyle to rub it off as they laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got settled in and started the movie, Kyle noticed that Grace seemed shook up by the scary movie especially since she was all over Kyle, grabing his arm and sweating. The sleeve of his right arm found itself under her's and was forced to soak up what seemed to constantly flow from her armpit. Soon that sweat seemed to mean something else as Kyle noticed her squirm in her seat as if she was uncomfortable, but before he could ask, her stomach answered the question.<br>\r\n*GGRROWWMMMBBUBBLE*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I'm sorry Ky-Ky but I've been holding this in since lunch...\" and with that said he knew what was coming but had no idea the caliber and strength of what he was about to witness.<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPHHHHHLLLLUURRRRRAAAVVVVVVVVRRRFFFFFFFUUURRRRRRHHHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... ehem,\" Grace sighed, but instantly replaced her bliss with shame, feeling as though she lost her only friend. Her fart rumbled the entire couch and caused the cushions of the couch to warm up to levels that made Kyle sweat, and Grace to sweat profusely. It was as if her single blast of gas turned the entire TV room into a sauna, a sauna that smelled like a the wet grimey corners of a dumpster. But to Grace's amazement, Kyle never said a thing, instead he continued to watch the movie as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that was big, ha, ha,\" Grace said with a nervous laugh trying to make the situation into a joke. But all she got outta Kyle was a, \"Mmm-Hmm,\" in agreement as if his mouth was taped shut.<br>\r\n\"You don't mind if I...?\" Grace continued to ask, and Kyle once again remained silent, completely crippled by the disgusting smell that left him mute once again. \"Good! Now I can finally enjoy this movie, all this gas has been making me sweat hahaha,\" she said actually laughing this time, feeling more comfortable around him then ever as she leaned to the side, nearly resting her left butt cheek on Kyle's lap as she occasionally let go crude and occasionally wet blasts that sometimes overpower the sound of the movie. <br>\r\nBBRROOUMMPPT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPVVVUUOORRLLLBBT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFRROOUUMMVVVRRAAPPPPMMMAABBT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on this way as Kyle suffered speechlessly in Grace's nearly constantly building stench and as Kyle left Grace stood at the front door smiling and waving good bye, feeling as though they just became leaps and bounds closer to each other. Unfortunately this is when Kyle's father got a new job and they were forced to move, and as the years went by he couldn't help but remember Grace and her ability to leave him literally speechless. Even thinking about it caused him to soon realize that actions as gross as her caused other symptoms, much more intimate symptom that were 'hard' to hide. Getting a job back in his home town didn't help either, he went to the bus station that was in the middle of his old town and waited for the bus until a chill went up his spine as he heard an all too familiar voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a few more moments to compose himself, Justin was eventually able to force himself to get up and look around what was apparently his home for the foreseeable future...  And it wasn't looking fantastic, to say the least...  Although the cell was actually fairly large, a surprising fact to Justin, the furnishings were practically non-existent.  Two existed, both against the same wall.  The first was what he could only assume was a bed, a metal framed, metal-spring undercarriaged monstrosity with a slab of a mattress that used to be white (but was now a terrible mix of yellows, browns, and greens) and was actually dripping a substance that Justin didn't even want to identify.  The second item immediately at the foot of the \"bed\" was the rotted skeleton of a bench which sat above an equally abused rusty bucket.  \"Is that... the toilet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and the likes of you better keep it tidy, cleaning day was today, so you have a week until the next one.\"  Justin nearly jumped out of skin as a new guard suddenly barked from behind him.  He opened his mouth as he spun around to plead his case about getting out of here, but as he spun he was left to stand mouth agape at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn absolute monster of a woman stood next to the guard, who although she put up a good front yelling at Justin seemed a little afraid of the woman as well.  Her skin was a deep crimson, and she stood somewhere between 8 and 10 feet tall, answering Justin's wonderings of why the cells were so large.  A shock of long black hair adorned her head, the left half of her face almost completely blocked from view by the tangled locks.  The other side was parted by a large horn that curved back slightly, its obsidian black surface somehow even darker than her hair and almost seemed to absorb the light around it.  This allowed Justin to see her right eye, which practically shined with its yellow hue as it studied him closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all of this was practically forgettable when it came to the rest of her body, a perfectly hourglass figure pushed to the max...  Barely concealed in what looked like it used to be something like Justin's current burlap sack garb, but what had obviously given up the fight long ago.  Her breasts were jiggling like they had a mind of their own in what had practically become a ghost of a sports bra, or the closest thing you could make out of burlap.  Down below, her pants had faired even worse, now little more than a loin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claudette, meet New Boy, New Boy, meet your new cellmate...  Get along you two.  Or, I suppose do your best to survive, New Boy.  Hahaha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin tried to lurch forward as the guard opened the gate to his cell, but this just got him a hard shove towards the back wall, the behemoth that was Claudette soon blocking any escape as the gate shut behind her.  Justin sighed, deciding that the guard wouldn't have been much help anyway...  Of course, he had much more pressing matters on his mind as Claudette moved over to the bed, plopping an ass that took up at least half the bed on its own with a hardy Ker-SPLAT SQUuuuiiissshhh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt like an eternity, Justin and Claudette stared at each other in silence, the only thing breaking it being Justin doing his best not to cough as an awful stench that could only be the giant \"woman\" in front of him.  Trying his best not to stare at her body, Justin once again looked towards her face, noticing that her matt of black hair concealed more than just her face.  The completely cracked and stunted remnant of her other horn's pair could barely be seen through the tangles, and even more interesting, a large scar that started just underneath the broken horn and continued all the way down to her chin.  Where her other yellow eye should have been was an eye patch that was practically woven into her hair, the patch itself being made of a completely patchwork of small multi-colored cloths that should have clashed, but somehow... looked really good, or at least the small glimpses of it that Justin could see through the black tangles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the awkward silence became too much, and Justin couldn't help but panic.  What was this \"woman\" in here for?  How long was he going to be stuck in here with her?  Was she going to KILL him?!?!  His addled brain spun around in circles, until he desperately clung to one thought...  It was always good to start of meeting someone with a compliment, even if they were a giant red demon looking woman in a jail cell... Right?  \"Y-your eye patch...  It umm...  It looks amazing on you.\"  Justin felt like shooting himself the minute the words were out.  Of all the things he could have said, he had to essentially mention what must have been a horrible injury!  Well...  At least he could take solace in the fact that if she DID decide to kill him, it would probably be fairly quick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle Choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  It turns out to be Grace, and a \"wonderful friendship\" is rekindled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  It's Wendy, and she makes a move since Grace never did!/It's Grace's Mom, who misses having Kyle around almost as much as Grace and Wendy!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Kyle? Is that you?\" said a woman who seemed to be holding back excitement. This caused Kyle to turn his head strictly out of instinct, because if his guess was correct then he'd rather not turn his head at all. As he turned around, his head was at thigh level to a woman, causing him to slowly tilt his head back and look at the woman who must have been just short of 8ft tall, but what truly sent a chill up his spine were the twitching furry bear ears that poked out from her long black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Kyle wanted to say 'Hi' but a rush of terrible memories came flooding back as he realized that it was Wendy... old, taller, larger, and curvier Wendy. Last time he saw her she was a dolled up little girl, but now, she's an absolute knockout. She wore a t-shirt that was probably supposed to be fashionably loose fitting but her large chest changed that and nearly made the shirt into her sports bra, which would probably would show some under-boob is not for the second shirt under that one that she had tucked into her leggings. Leggings that were essentially a second skin on her... and gave Kyle a good look at her nearly naked frame as the leggings clung to ever curve and dove into any crack... including the deepest crack on her body. Anyone with a viw from behind would nearly wonder how she plans on getting the leggings out of the deep crevasse that is her thick bouncing booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!\" She said as if she just met a celebrity. \"It is you isn't it!? It's been so long, you look...\" she paused to try her best to think and choose her next word carefully \"... good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy? Wow yeah, it's been a long time.\" Kyle said as a mental sweat drop went down his face as he suffered through small talk, hopng that the bus would come early. But in the back of his mind, he couldn't shake how absolutely gorgeous Wendy was, and she never really interacted with him other then flirting so he didn't have much of a reason to try and avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if she knew what he was thinking she asked, \"Hey! Are you waiting for the bus? Let me drive you, I was just on my way to my car. We'll get to catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah sure. Thanks I appreciate-\" But Wendy didn't wait for Kyle to finish, she simply grabbed his arm and pulled, showing him how much her strength has grown as well. Once they got to the car, it wasn't exactly what he expected. The first thing he noticed was that it was a VW beetle, which was kinda small for her, also... it was full of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh yeah, I keep forgetting to go to the laundry mat, um...\" she began to think realizing that her passenger seat and back were buried in dirty clothes. She opened the door and Kyle felt as though she just opened a gym locker as the stench of BO, grime, and sun-baked filth billowed from the car door causing him to swallow a lump in his throat as he wondered what he was getting into. \"Here, I have an Idea.\" Wendy said as she directed him into the driver side seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sat, thinking he was going to drive once Wendy cleared out room for herself somehow, maybe was room for clothes in the trunk after all. But she didn't go anywhere, instead she followed Kyle and turned around bending over to fit herself in as well. For a moment time stopped, Kyle watched as the leggings rode up her calf nearly reach her knee as the fabric tried desperately to compensate for the added amount of pressure pressed against the rear of her pant as well as her thick thighs. The leggings came close to spitting, but instead, the wedgie that lived within the deepest part of her crack broke free and into the open air giving her seemingly inflating booty room to grow as she bent over. Then it happened... *THUD*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. A little snug but this should work,\" She said, and then repeated her last statement in a more seductive tone, \"This should work just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to say something, but the newly freed fabric that was once taking residence within her over heated booty now rested... or better yet compressed itself on Kyle's lap, wafting the terrible odor that clung to it. Not to mention the fact that he was surrounded by Wendy's dirty laundry, so of which look as though they've never seen the laundry as a pair of panties found its home in the crevice of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're actually kinda comfy Ky-Ky. Sorry I've gotten a bit bigger hehe, you don't mind do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wanted to groan, say 'yes', tell her to 'pull over', but this all became impossible as the stench wafting from her filth soaked clothes and her huge buns, that were currently burying his lap, kept him mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... excited? Is that why you're speechless?\" She said, leaning back a bit, nearly resting her back against his chest and face. \"Oh my god, it's true! My sister tried to tell me,\" she said forcing Kyle to sit in silence as just them memory of Grace made Kyle speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually like it when girls show you their... true colors,\" she said in a gitty tone as if she just solved a mystery. \"My sister tried to tell me that you were the only one she knew who didn't mind when she... showed off. Well, I think we're gonna be close friends then, actually even me closest friends don't know about my true self... so I guess we'll be a little closer.\" She said, saying her last statement in a slow flirtatious tone that made Kyle sweat a bit. Kyle was starting to get anxious, he felt trapped, and wasn't even sure where Wendy was driving him, since he never told her where he worked, so in an attempt to escape he began to squirm and fight with his legs the were buried under Wendy's massive thighs and butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh? You wanna get closer? I can help you.\" She said clearly misunderstanding his intentions. She then grabbed his hand and brought it to her breast, Kyle actually enjoyed this for a second as is hand sunk into the warm pillow like breast, but thin he felt her put his hand under both her shirts and could feel the coating of sweat that practically dripped of her breasts and collected into a film within the space under her boob. \"Oooh, very good Ky... just don't... don't rub too... you're gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle barely understood her as Wendy got lost within Kyle's gasp of her large breast, and the rub down he was giving to the sweat filled space between them. It was that sensation that sent Wendy over the edge, forcing her to pull over as she fell back HARD, pressing his face against her back as she grabbed his other hand and began working her other breast. Was she going too...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna, I'm gonna...!\" Wendy couldn't even speak anymore as she simply moaned, but the thing she kept from saying was the only thing Kyle was curious about until it happened.<br>\r\nBBBBRROOUUMMMPPVVVLLRRRRAAAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPHHHHVVVVVLLLUUUURRRAAAMMMFFFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBLLOOOUURRR - PPPFFFRRRAAAMMPPPRRRT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... sorry Kyle, that got a little carried away...\" Wendy said, out of breath, completely ignoring her violent bursts of gas since her mind was on other matters. Juices dripped from between her legs and completely stained the front of her legging, causing them to nearly appear see-through. All the while, her armpits now dripped with sweat after exerting herself, and Kyle was left under her forced to soak up any sweat and wetness that dripped off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin's Next Options :<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 : Justin's new cell mate becomes infatuated with him, wanting him to be by her side, with her when she sleeps and while she goes through her other daily routines. Unfortunately, Justin has no clue how horrific some of these routines can be especially when mixed with her terrible new diet of prison food. Also, due to her over powering stature he has now say in the matter, while she has no interest in listening to what he wants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
