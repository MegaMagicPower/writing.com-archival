They resemble a heavy set human in shape.  They are tiny, about 3 millimeters tall, but are very strong and fast for their size, like ants.  They live in towering colonies of several billion, but they do not have appointed leaders.  Their intelligence matches that of primitive man.  Also, their planet is filled with odd, more formidable beasts that the Xexi have all tamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUbs: another humanoid race, but very highly advanced.  Ubs have bulbous heads with no noticeable features like eyes or mouthes.  However, they have an extremely sensitive sense of touch and an ability to extend their proprioception (the ability to tell where your body is in space) to outside their bodies.  Their bodies and limbs are thin and bony, but strong.  Ubs stand at around 16 feet tall, but weight about as much as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMa-Istu: an extremely powerful yet peaceful race.  Their heads are similar to that of a humanoid dragon, as are their limbs.  However, they have 10 arms with hands, and no legs with feet.  Their bodies end at the torso, so they move around either by shuffling or by grabbing objects and pulling themselves forward.  They are a huge race, at 500 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstral Jelly: odd, living goo that floats in bulk in outer space.  Nobody knows how intelligent it is, but it has the ability to form into complex shapes, and seems to be able to tell the difference between living beings, artificial objects, and common space debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can choose to start a story with one of these choices, or think of your own race, which I strongly encourage.</span></div></div>",

With one hand you haul the produce bin, and with the other nine you unearth your popular eu-ener, the tastiest root vegetable known to your people, the Ma-Istu.  For twenty years you have owned this farm, and by now you can be as productive as ever without even thinking of what you are doing.  Instead, you think about the new discovery that today's top astronomers broadcast last night.  The news that life positively exists on other worlds is especially interesting to you, who has lived alone, save for your robotic machinery, for the past twenty years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your thoughts when the soil bursts from the ground a little ways off.  You sigh at your rotten luck, but then remember that the meteorite showers had already occured this year.  Shuffling up with curiosity, you approach the object that fell from the sky.  The object is about half the size of your head, but is not shaped naturally.  With one hand, you gently lift the object, then hold it steady with three more.  Looking closer, your eyes widen: this thing is made out of manufactured metal.  You are excited; this object must have come from intelligent life from another world.  Judging from its small size, its probably only a test craft, but you still handle the object with great care so as not to damage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the alien craft closer to your head to see it in either great detail, and you notice very faint sounds coming from inside.  Slowly turning the craft over in your hands, you can feel under a finger a part of the craft covered with glass.  Even more intrigued, you wipe away the soil from the craft.  Your eyes widen when you see what is inside.</span></div></div>",

And it's unlike any other creature you've ever seen or heard about, so your guessing about the testing craft coming from an alien civilization is confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you think, it's quite understandable that whoever sent the miniature ship into space has placed some lifeform inside it: since this is probably a reduced model of the ships the aliens are planning to use for space travel, they're trying to find out if life is able to survive inside those flying machines. The answer is clearly yes, since the creature inside the craft is moving and producing strange fleeble sounds. But those sounds seem to be moans of pain... well, of course the little being is hurt after that impact! And the tiny space traveller must be dazed, in fact it apparently hasn't noticed your presence outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer though the glass window for a better look at the creature. Judging from its size (no larger than the smallest of the phalanxes of your fingers), it must be an insect, and it's actually covered by a shining carapace, coloured like the smallest of the Three Suns (that's a mix of purple and orange); the only uncovered part of the body is the head, which is pink on the front and sports an odd tuft of brown hair on the back.<br>\r\nWhat really seems odd to you about that bug is the fact it has only four limbs, and apparently only a couple eyes on the top of the front part of its head. Well, it's an alien bug, so you shouldn't be surprised if it's different from insects of your planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" you wonder, tenderly cradling the spacecraft in your hands as if it was a baby Ma-Istu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it's your duty, as a good citizen, to carry the alien object and its occupant to the authorities... but you suddenly imagine the little bug being dissected in some lab, an idea which makes you cringe. Sure, it's just a bug, but you has always loved animals, so that you even try to not step on insects while tending to your vegetables,  and kill insect only when they're dangerous for your plants.<br>\r\nYou think for some moments... what if you carry only the craft to the city, and keep the small traveler a secret? Yes, that seems a good idea; after all, authorities and scientists would be mostly interested in finding a way to communicate with the intelligent race which built the object, a simple bug would be of relatively lesser interest for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you've decided to not give the bug to authorities, you must face the dilemma of what to do with the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you let it free in the forest? That's an unknown environment for the alien bug, could it be able to survive there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should you keep the bug with you and take care of it? You've lived alone so much time, that even the company of a pet bug could turn out pleasant for you. Beside, the insect is certainly a lab specimen, so it must be used to captivity.</span></div></div>",

You cannot see how this creature could possibly survive in the wild if it is injured.  You feel great pity for the bug; it must be frightened stiff from its long journey.  You decide that the right thing to do first is to let the bug out of its prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you wipe the soil off the rest of the craft, looking for some sort of hatch you can open.  You find two, but they are disappointingly small; barely larger than the insect itself.  You concentrate very carefully so you do not damage the craft, and with a few tiny twists of an almost invisible knob, the door swings open.  Now you are even more careful than before as you lightly shake the craft over two of your open palms.  After a few minutes the bug finally falls out, landing safely on your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug is obviously greatly distressed.  After landing in your palm, it immediately tries to run away from you.  You feel sorry for the bug, but also ponder how pathetic its attempts to run away are.  It is surprisingly slow for a bug, and apparently very uncoordinated, as it tripped over the scales of your palm several times.  You try to comfort it by petting with your finger, but this causes it to curl up into a ball of sorts and start quivering.  You figure that it wil be a while before you can make the bug feel comfortable again.  Cupping a few of your hands around it, you slowly shuffle back to your domicile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the spaceship gently on a countertop, and decide to deal with that later.  First, you want to help your pet feel better.  You figure that the best way to do this is to...</span></div></div>",

It need medical treatment right now, but you can't take it to the vet, who probably wouldn't know how to heal an alien creature better than how could you; besides, the secret about the little space traveler would be blown out that way.<br>\r\nHaving to care care of your \"guest\" yourself, you can think of an only way to help it: the Life Flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife Flower is a plant gifted with amazing healing power, able to accelerate the healing process of the body of all the animals  which are known on your world; luckily, in your kitchen you have a big bowl of powder made out from that plant... you just hope that medicine will have the same good effects on that bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly fill a small cup with water and pour a bit of powder in it: green bubbles immediately start to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, my little one.\" you utter, tilting your hand and allowing your pet to slide down toward the water.</span></div></div>",

It stops struggling and relaxes on the surface of the water.  Looking closer, you are surprised how well the Life Flower is treating the bugs ailments.  Its right forelimb straightens out, and the gash on its head has greatly reduced in size.  When the green bubbles fizzle down, the bug looks as good as new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into the cup, and are overjoyed when the bug does not flee your finger and thumb.  Gently lifting it onto an open palm, you try stroking your pet again.  Instead of resisting you like last time, the bug does nothing, but seems to enjoy your gentle touch.

Besides, you will probably have a hard time convincing anyone that it is a real spaceship anyways.  Since it is so small they will probably think it is an elaborate hoax you are trying to pull off.  If you went now it might be hours before you could get back home.  It would not be a good idea to leave a pet alone for that long a time in a strange environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to spend some time with your pet.  If you spent some time playing with the little alien it might feel more comfortable in its new home.  But what could you do with the little alien?  It was far too small to play most games you would play with a normal sized pet.  A few things you could think of might be frightening to your tiny pet.  After some silent contemplation you finally come up with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be possible to knock out two problems at once.  You needed to find out what the alien ate as well.  Most animals could be trained using food and this one should not be an exception, unless the creatures from its world do not eat anything.  That is very doubtful though.  Since you are a farmer you do have a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables available to you and you gather up the bug in one hand and a small piece of fruit or a vegetable in the other nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the bug see what you have in each hand and it studies the fruit intensely.  Then you place each of the nine fruit and vegetable bearing hands behind your back.  You had expected the creature to start gesturing wildly in the direction of the arm that held the food it had liked the most.  There was the possibility that it might not have liked anything and paced around in the palm of your hand instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really happened came as a complete surprise.  The little bug pointed straight at one of your arms almost immediately.  There was a purpose in its movements that seemed like it belonged to an intelligent creature.  It was like the bug had figured out what you were doing far faster than a mere bug should be able to do.  Well, it was an alien bug.  Maybe the bugs on its homeworld were smarter than the ones on your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou presented the food item to the bug and it accepted it a little hesitantly.  It seemed to be cautious of the new food, but it started nibbling at it eventually.  Once it tasted the fruit it had selected its hesitation vanished.  You smiled down at the little bug as it enjoyed its meal.  All in all, that seemed like a good way to play a game with the bug.  No harm was done and this should be a fun way of introducing the bug to new food.</span></div></div>",

You gently stroke your pet to calm it down, but wonder who could be at your door.  You do not want to reveal that you have an alien in your house, and don't want to leave your pet unattended, so you palm your pet in one of your hands under your thumb.  After checking to see that your pet is both safe and obscured from view, you walk to the door and open it up.  A fellow Ma-Istu walks in, but he is not a farmer.  Judging from his uniform, he looks like he works for the government.  After greeting him with a handshake (being careful not to shake with the hand you are holding your pet in), the person introduces himself as a top astronomer, and gives you the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours ago, my radar picked up electronic signals in the sky that were unlike that of any of our planet's technology.  It seemed to swerve and land on your farm, and I tracked the projectile motion directly to the crater I saw in your vegetable patch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you can't deny that something landed on your farm; this Ma-Istu knows too much.  You gesture to the craft on the shelf, and the astronomer picks it up gently and curiously.  You are nervous that he may find out about your pet; what would the government do to an alien?  A horrible image of your pet being dissected crosses your mind, and it will not leave your mind.  Unfortunately, the scientist notices that you look uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright sir?  Is there something that you want me to know about this craft?\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't find any living being inside, nor nearby the landing area, but I'm worried about my farm being infested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe astronomer watches you silently for a moment, and you hope your acting was good; your speech had also the purpose of finding out if authorities were going to search around your farm for aliens... if that's the case, you'll have to be extremely careful about your pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your guest speaks. \"At this point, it's impossible to tell if this ship was meant to carry lifeforms or not, since its technology is clearly very different from ours.

If they suspected something had escaped from that craft they were likely to look everywhere for your little bug.  Even your house was likely to go through with a thorough investigation.  Hiding the bug anywhere just would not due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to think back.  There had to be a good place to hide the bug somewhere in the house.  Then you remember something your father had told you once.  When he was helping to build your house he had said he had built a special compartment into your room.  He had said it would be hard for anyone else to find unless they already knew where it was.  Your father had explained that you never knew when you would need a place to hide something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time you had thought him a little paranoid.  Now it appeared you would have to thank him for his foresight.  His thinking would probably help save your little pet from a gruesome fate.  The only problem was going to be finding that hiding place.  You vaguely remember where your father told you he had put that hiding place.  Since you had never really thought you were going to need it you had not being paying close attention to your father when he had explained just where the compartment was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to your room and place the bug down on your bed.  Then you begin your search for the compartment.  Every once and a while you check on the bug to make sure it is not trying to escape.  It is odd that every time you look at it the bug is staring right back at you.  That sort of focused intensity is odd in an animal.  You are just happy it is not trying to get away or you would have to spend even more time trying to catch it over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you start to get frustrated and a little scared.  Finding the compartment is proving even more difficult than you had thought it would be.  Then you heard a faint noise.  You looked up to see that your pet was trying to get your attention.  It was pointing at something as if it wanted you to see it.  When you did look where it was pointing you were startled to find what you had been looking for all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you thought that the bug might actually be intelligent.  Then you dismissed that thought.  There was no way something that small could be an intelligent creature.  It was a smart bug though and you let it know that by petting it gently a couple of times.  Then you started putting some supplies into the compartment so the bug would be safe if you had to store it in there for a while.  It would not take much and there was a lot of space.  You did not know what your father thought you would need to hide, but the compartment was almost two thirds your size.  The bug should be able to survive weeks in the compartment with all the things you place in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about making that your pet\u2019s home for now.  It might be a good idea to get it used to its home now.  If you had to store it in there when the government came searching for aliens it might try to escape at a very bad time if it was not used to the compartment.  But, you had reservations about storing your pet away like that.  It seemed a little cruel to keep a pet in some hole instead of out in the open.</span></div></div>",

You pinch yourself, you don't wake up. The air in the parcel is nearing to nothing and you cannot reach the top, even by jumping. To the top of the parcel must be 10 ft. The air is wearing thin now and all you can do is lie down and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your parcel opens with a rip. You can barely see as much light has hit you in less than a fraction of a second. All you can do is shout, \"Hello?\" and you wait for a reply...one comes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an incoherent language. Then your eyes fix on a huge spider, 60ft tall at least...and the worst thing is, you always had this phobia, arachnophobia. The giant arachnid just stares at you, and you scream and try to jump out of the parcel...and you hit your head on the side of the cardboard wall and fall onto a huge hand. You think you're about to be eaten...</span></div></div>",
