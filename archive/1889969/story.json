When you reach the top you find yourself indeed in a very crowded baseball stadium. As you take in your surroundings, you feel a small tug in the back of your brain like you should recognize this place as you make your way through the rows of crowded bleachers. You finally find a spot next to a boy with short blond hair and you sit. After a few minutes, I guess his team makes a home run because the boy jumps up with thousands of other fans cheering. After a moment of you watching him he turns to you with a smile. \" best game of the season right?\" you shrug not sure how to answer. \" umm... Right... Who's playing again?\" the boy laughs but stops when he takes in your confused face. He sits back down and looks at you intensely. \" your serious? You really don't know who's playing but, yet you're sitting here at the stadium watching?\" he's right, its pretty stupid. you feel embarrassment hit your face and hesitate before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you explain the situation or do you act like you know what's going on?</span></div></div>",

You look the boy straight in the eyes. \" I don't even know where this stadium is or how I got here. Can you tell me where we are?\" the boy watches you then slowly nods.\" yea, we're in san Francisco.  6th inning and san Francisco is whooping our opponents. And you probably got here like everyone else by driving and...\" he stops and studies you. \" what's  your name anyway?\" you open your mouth to respond feeling sure of yourself but nothing comes out and not a single letter comes to mind. Seeing your shock and frustration the boy grows grim. \" let me guess you don't know?\" numbly you shake your head slowly. The boy thinks for a second. \" do you know today's date?\" instantly you answer feeling so positive. \" September 19, 2012\" your feelings of triumph dersaperates when his frown deepens. \" umm.. No, that was two days ago. Today is the 21st. Where have you been?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you explain more to him or do you think he knows enough?   </span></div></div>",
