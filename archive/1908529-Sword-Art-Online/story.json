Inventory, everything you have to figure out yourself or ask the questions all players hate... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the charakter: you are mostly good natured, honorable, calm... Unless something serious and I mean SERIOUS is taking place for example: you see 4 people trying to kill one person out of greed or pleasure, than you put aside your honor, to stop them at all costs, likely slay them from behind or something like that, normally you would never do that, hell normally you wouldn't kill at all, if you see another way you try. As you can probably imagine you are very protective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings you hate: arrogance (always respect those infront of you), superficiality/discremenation (only because someone's small, doesn't mean he/she can't play the game, as well as others), sexism in both ways for example: you can't stand the sentence \"a woman has to stay in the kitchen\" as much as you hate \"you can't punch a women\" which connotes that you are allowed to punch men, you would rather say \"you can't punch a humen or living being.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwithout that you are mostly open for anything, very trusting to strangers as you face them with respect and honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sexuality is hetero and you got engaged 2 weeks ago with your girlfriend, you had a 6 years relationship (she doesn't play the game), at the start you thought you would never betray her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your character may change his opinions in a few ways, for example: after watching several people die by the hands of assassins (laughing coffin), you could start to distrust people more than before. </span></div></div>",
