A chest, small, and wooden, Nel grabbed it and moved it above into the light, she blinked looking at it, it was tiny, small, so small that was it the perfect size for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused she opened the chest, hands trembeling with exsitment, what could be in there? Treasures? Priceless Artifacts?<br>\r\nNope, just a note and a small bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel sighed to herself, before she reached out to the bag, but her hand stopped, she noticed her name on the note. Blinking confused she looked at it and picked it up, reading over it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Nel<br>\r\nI knew you would find this, hope I didn't dig it too deep for ya.<br>\r\nI know of your desires to be big and what have you and I wanna help.<br>\r\nSo, in this bag is a potion, drink it, and you'll gain incredible powers. Knowing you, you are probably pulling a face, wondering how all this is possible and not buying any of it\" Nel blinked at this part looking around, indeed she was pulling a face thinking and thinking that \"Now you're thinking that someone might be watching you and using magic to change the text, yet trust me there aren't.<br>\r\nAnywho back to the powers cause I know you're dying to know about them. <br>\r\nI won't go into all the details about them, the potion will allow pretty much control this reality, you can make yourself bigger, make others smaller, change there size gender, race or even your own, you can make things appear and disappear whenever you wish, all the good stuff, but wait it gets better!<br>\r\nAlong with all that awesomeness, you can change someone or yourself, and then make it so then people always thought that things where always that way.<br>\r\n<u><b>I really suggest you use the most of this power, it's really fun</b></u><br>\r\nI better underline that part to make you pay more attention to it hehe<br>\r\nEather way, have a huge amount of fun, don't make all this effort I've put into this a waist less I find another to give this power too.<br>\r\nHave fun<br>\r\nFrom<br>\r\nA friend in high places <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's mind was blown, she re-read the note a second time before opening the small bag, hands shaking a bit, seeing the potion. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and in one quick movement, reached into the bag, grabbing the potion and downing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange tingle rushed through her body for a few moments before nothing...</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed smaller as she looked around excitedly, she was taller! Her dress matched to fit her size as she was almost bouncing with joy, without a care in the world, she had grown! It had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost forgot that she could do more with her powers for now as she dashed home. Man even flying was easier, being bigger sure was amazing. Nel arrived back at her house in no time only to blink, looking around confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be her house? It had grown with her? I was a house fit for a 2 foot tall pixie not the 4 inched one she used to be. Confused with some mixed feelings, sure it nice that everything had grown with her and she hadn\u2019t lost anything, but at the same time, it would have been fun to explore the small house at her bigger size. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel headed inside, confused still but it was better than just hanging outside of the house. A few moments inside, Nel noticed a picture she had on a cabinet, it was one of her, Kevin and Claire, she remembered it was a nice picture of the three of them with Nel being the shortest in the middle. Now however Nel was still in the middle but even in the picture she was 2 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then clicked, it seemed her powers, changed reality itself? Or something like that. Changes she would make would affect the past, the world will alter to accept the change as if it was always that way. This power was under her control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Things were going to get interesting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was all too good to be true and Nel figured it must be  a joke or prank or even a test of sorts. Whatever it was she wanted to be at the safety of her own home before trying anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing through then quickly slamming the door, Nel took a deep breath. It was clear what her first test would be, she wanted to be bigger , though she didn't want to break her house just yet. Looking around she figured doubling her height was a safe bet, as Claire was able to enter and exit just fine at her 1 foot 7 inches frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingle rushed through Nel along with a pleasant warmth... Though... not much else? Looking around, the room was the same size, her clothes fit the same, she was the same size still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself at getting her hopes up she was about to head towards the kitchen when she noticed the picture of herself ando Claire. Nel wasn't was small in comparison!<br>\r\nA few seconds passed as this new information took a bit for the pixie to process before she dashed outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had indeed grown to 8 inches tall, it was simply that her house had grown with her to match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was twice her size now and could change it anytime she wants. Because she had outgrown her regular mirror she stood in front of Clare's mirror and looked at herself from all perspectives. But then she looked at the top of the mirror and had a nice idea. \"Why not to the limits?\" she thought loudly. Without closing her eyes she concentrated on herself and began to grow once more. Quickly her reflection met the upper edge of the mirror, which would made her about 1'9\". She was now bigger than Clare. Nel wanted to cry in joy because of her new size. Again she looked at herself from all perspectives and was completely mesmerized by the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she saw room for other improvements. First she looked at her C-cup boobs and bounced them around before her thoughts filled them with a arousing feeling. They pushed outwards while her hands were still grabbing them. The feeling of them growing was unbelievably nice. After some seconds her boobs grew to firm E-cups. Excited she bounced them around once more and her eyes filled with tears of joy. Afterwards she grabs her ass and it also expands to a firm and big ass everyone would be jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother look in the mirror and Nel couldn't believe how beautiful she had become. Some minutes ago she was just a cute little pixie many would oversee and now she grew to a demigoddess among pixies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" a familiar voice said behind her. It's Clare. \"Nel... is that you?\" she asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Clare. It's me Nel. How do you like my new appearance?\" Nel asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you become so... big?\" Clare didn't know what to say. Her 4 inch friend was suddenly towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Clare...\" Nel said with a smile. \"I can change some things now.\" Slowly Nel walked towards Clare who became more and more unsure by every step taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel wanted to have fun with Clare. She had dozens of possibilities open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel stood right in front of Clare. Clare was at eye level with Nel's boobs. She started stuttering at the view of her friend being bigger than her. Nel lifted her hands and stretched her index finger out. Slowly she tilted her hand down which caused Clare to slowly shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked Clare looked at her own hands and body to realize she was shrinking. Her friend's boobs were rising while her crotch came closer to her. Clare didn't know what to do and just stared at herself and Nel changing in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Nel couldn't see Clare behind her own boobs she keeled down. Once again were her boobs with Clare on eye level. But quickly Clare even shrunk past that. Nel stops shrinking her when Clare was about her original size. While Nel was kneeling down Clare nearly reached her boobs. That's how Nel's perspective was before her new powers appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nel... what...\" Clare said a bit frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Clare. I can change... anything I want. So I shrank you to my old size.\" Nel said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel please... Change me back... I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I was once at that size and was completely fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel... I'm a 1'7\" pixie. I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel interrupted her. \"-a 4 inch pixie now. Good that you realized that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel!\" Clare yelled very angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow calm down a little. I just swapped out sizes nothing to be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Clare interrupted her. \"No Nel! Change me back! I'm not supposed to be that size! Make me normal again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You are now supposed to be that size? Then let's shrink you more.\" Nel countered with a evil grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Clare shrank to half her size. Now not even eye level with Nel's bellybutton Clare's anger transformed back into fear. The world around her became once again bigger and Nel's thighs were now thicker than her entire body size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You happy now Clare?\" Nel asked mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel please. I'm sorry!\" Clare said with tears in her eyes. \"I'm really sorry. I'm just desperate. Please change me back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is more like it.\" Nel rises her finger again and Clare inched higher again. While she stood up again she stopped growing Clare when she reached her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... That's not my original size...\" Clare said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It isn't. I want you at boobs height so I can do that.\" Nel hugged Clare thigh and pressed her into her cleavage. Clare struggled at first but then gave up because she didn't want any punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Nel turned her around and both looked into Clare's mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Clare. I can even change other things like this mirror.\" Nel grew the mirror taller until her reflection entirely fitted into the mirror. <br>\r\n\"But that's not all.\" She continued while opening Clare's closet. \"I can make all your clothes fitting. Even that dress that was to big for you in the first place.\" Clare's clothes shrunk to her size now, while in the other closet Nel's clothes began to grow. \"I could even give you new proportions...\" Nel said while growing Clare's boobs and ass slightly. Her D-cups jump up one and a half cup sizes to nearly Nel's boobs. \"All in all I just want to have some fun.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what will everyone say? I was far bigger than everyone else and now I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nel snapped. She grabbed a picture where she and Clare were posing with their original sizes. The picture shifted until both were shown in their new sizes. \"Everyone will think we were always that size. Now calm down Clare. Do what you wanted to do before.\" Nel released her from her hug. Clare wasn't sure about all this and looked a bit worried. But she went of without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to business!\" Nel thought out loud. \"What can I do next?\"</span></div></div>",

She giggled and went to her objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of Josh's, the ruler of her village, door and knocked on his door gently. Shortly after he opened the door and didn't seem to be freaked out. Obviously her powers worked on a big scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nel. What's wrong?\" he asked while Nel started grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I'm taller than you.\" Nel said and as she says it the world around her changes. She gained two inches while Josh lost 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just nodded like it was already true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And The taller pixie normally rules the village. So because we are both some strong independent female pixie, I thought that I would be a better ruler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she speaks Josh's body starts changing. His statue smoothes a little, his waist shrank thinner while his hips widened, boobs grew out of his chest and his butt was also pressing against his pants. The little bulge in his pants shrunk away and left a vagina while his thighs thickened and his feet shrank. His short hair lengthened down his back and his clothes transformed into a red dress like Nel's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats what I'm thinking.\" Josh says while his voice changes to a female cute voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Nel adds. \"So can you do me favor, Jane?\" He blinked and his memories were completely rearranged. His name changed to Jane and Nel was now speaking to a official female pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Jane answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please squeeze your boobs?\" Nel asks and Jane nodded. Nel didn't realize at first how big they had become. But even compared to herself they were big. So Nel couldn't resist but to squeeze them. She massaged them a little and Jane became a bit red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all. See ya.\" Nel said and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice, she thought. Now she can really do anything. Not only did she become the ruler of the village but Josh was transformed into a woman and it all seemed natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what would the 1'11\" tall ruler of the village pixie do next?</span></div></div>",

She went outside and admired how her house had changed due to her new ability. Her whole house changed accordingly to her new size. Nel giggled and went for her next test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Kevin screamed from across his house as Nel knocked on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a problem she entered his house and looked for Kevin. Kevin is a friend of her and also a crush. She didn't talk to him often all though he also had feelings for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nel what's up?\" Kevin asked as he came in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel stepped closer and lifted him up pinning him on the wall. It felt amazing for her to be bigger than her crush. But this time she wasn't that shy and introverted. This time she wanted to feel powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel. Stop that. I know you are bigger than me.\" Kevin said as if it was normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel took both his arms in one hand and let her other hand touch different parts of his body. Kevin blushed a little as her hand touched him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be nice.\" Nel whispered and initiated her powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's whole body was hit by a strange tingly feeling. He yelped and noticed something strange. His voice was higher than normal. Even higher pitched than Nel's. Suddenly his hair crawled down his shoulders and turned light blonde. His stomach rumbled and suddenly his waist shrunk as thin as Nel's. He gasped as his chest was hit from the inside. Like if he had hiccups his chest pushed outwards in small spurts. After some spurts firm and bouncy D-cup boobs decorated his upper body. His shoulders and hips cracked as they shifted into a feminine form. His ass and thighs inflated faster as his chest until his lower body looked like Nel's. He breathed wildly as Nel bit her own lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel. What's happening to be?\" he asked with his new female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean, girl.\" Nel responded. In Kevin's mind his name changed to Keira. For a second she didn't know what's going on but realized something had changed. Her memories caused a heavy headache before she remembered she is actually male. By feeling her dick she remembered her original form. But Nel's hand wandered to her pants and within seconds her penis shrank into her body and transformed a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel!\" she screamed. Nel let go of her and she fell to the ground. She sat on the ground and couldn't understand what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd be pretty as a girl. And I wasn't disappointed. Say hi to your new self, Keira.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her mind went crazy. After a few seconds it calmed down again and she didn't knew what's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I laying on the ground?\" Keira asked Nel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Nel answered and oppressed a laugher. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she started panting and moaning quietly as her crotch got an arousing feeling. Her head fell into her neck as the sensation became stronger and stronger. After a few seconds something pressed against her panties and started to push farther outside. The feeling came to it's climax as Nel made a last push. Her panties slipped down because of the massive dick she was growing. It now pushed her red skirt a little upwards as it was fully erected. At it's full length it was going down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was already close to an orgasm but concentrated not to cum. She grabbed her new member and squeezed it a little. It perfectly worked like a real guys penis. Below the dick was still half her vagina left. Nel thought it might be better if it's still there. At least partly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira came back from the kitchen where she wanted to pick up drinks for them to and dropped the glasses she brought. \"Oh my gosh.... Nel?\" she said as she starred at Nel's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing isn't it?\" Nel said while squeezing her dick with one hand and her boobs with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira became horny by this sight although it was weird as hell.

Reaching down one giant hand, she snatched the terrified \"tall\" human up and tried to suckle more of her amazing milk, but found that her lips were too large to get any grip on something as small as the nipple. Trying to suck on her nipples seemed to please Hitomi though, as she started moaning. Carefully, Nel removed Hitomi's clothing and started kissing and sucking all of Hitomi at once.

Panicking a little, Hitomi threw her arms up to protect her head, but it was hopeless and she quickly found herself slipping into the warm wet tunnel. She was able to breathe, and after a second to calm herself, the overwhelming muskiness of Nel's sex started to take over Hitomi's mind.

Hitomi wriggled in orgasm while massaging the Nel's vagina from inside and inhaled pussy juice with her whole body. Nel couldn't take any more, and quickly sat down as her body wracked with orgasm. The spasms running through Nels cunt pulled and pushed at Hitomi, and combined with the wriggling of the lust craved human pulled her all the way inside Nel's cavernous pussy. Nel's cries rang across the whole forest as Hitomi found herself at Nel's cervix. She turned herself around, pleasuring Nel the whole time, and then started to work her way back out.

Nel looked, to her horror a large phoenix around the size of a bald eagle flew overhead.  It screeched a warning cry and circled around from above.  This startled Gerbo into flying away.

Nel is hit and gets blown down to the forest below farther ahead.  The phoenix is right on top of Gerbo, its mouth open and its talons ready. It was about to strike until a giant hand shot out from the tree tops and ensnared the phoenix.  Gerbo goes and flies for cover.  The fist tightens and a puff of ash comes out of its creases.  Nel is now huge!  She towers at a colossal 20ft tall.  Nel climbs up a large tree and brushes the ash off her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it!  I\u2019ve grown!

It was gigantic.  The tree was about 150 meters tall or more.  It completely dominates the landscape as it towers over every tree in the forest.  In this tree, a giant pare shaped hut with a door, balcony and windows made of wood dangle from a long vine on one of the trees mighty branches.  Clare eyes widen as she stares up in ah.  She couldn\u2019t help but feel the least bit jealous\u2026 and also worried.

It's quite overwhelming, you know - so big and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked sympathetic and nodded.  Suzie spoke: \"Nel, I can imagine how it is all very peculiar to you.  I have two questions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Nel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think finding the magic lamp, if there even is such a thing, will help you?  And, if Miriam is going to take us to her magician friend, can we pick you up and carry you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel pondered a moment, \"I'm hoping that I can use the magic lamp to become bigger because, in my world, bigger is better.

I'm sure many humans would be overly curious or otherwise distracting from my purpose, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls smiled knowingly at one another.  \"You're right about that,\" Miriam chuckled.  \"We have lots of 'bad apples' here in this city.

Crystal, the magician I know about, lives there but sometimes makes trips to practice her arts for groups of children at parties or other events.  She has a special salon she uses when people visit her home.  I was there once with my 'Interesting Arts through the Ages' class.  She's an odd sort but appears to have real talent though I know much of what most magicians do is fake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls strutted along.  Nel watched things whiz by almost fast enough to make her dizzy.  She listened intently to their chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been an interesting field trip, Miriam.  How did you happen to take that class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be interesting and it was.  We saw and did lots of things I had not done before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comments were interrupted when a group of three older men were approaching them from the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel, duck down,\" Suzie commanded and, instantly,  Nel disappeared into the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasant day for a long walk,\" Miriam said to Suzie as the men came even with them on the pathway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Suzie replied, \"and we are moving right along.  Our health coaches will be proud of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they were beyond the men who had, gratefully, paid them no heed.  Both girls resisted the temptation to look back to see what the men were doing.  They kept walking briskly and bantering 'nothings' back and forth until it was clear that no one was noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Nel, you can pop up again.  We weren't sure what would happen if those men stopped us or tried to talk with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much further do we have to go?\" Nel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much further now,\" Miriam stated,   We just cross the stream on the little bridge and wander into the old part of town.  I think I can find her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" Suzie cried. \"Now you tell us you 'think' you can find her place....this Crystal person.  What if you can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Suzie.  I can and will find it.  Don't you worry about that.  Let's just keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon into an area filled with large old homes close together, so close sometimes the sunlight was blocked completely.  While such a spot could have felt oppressing, it had a 'lighter' quality about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can it be so dark here and still feel so light,\" Nel asked from her place in the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's some general special magic here,\" Miriam replied.  \"Let me see now, we turn here and go another block...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked along quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we turn here and Crystal's place is on the next corner I believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" Suzie said.  \"My feet are starting to hurt.  I need to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm excited.  Will Crystal know about the genie's lamp?\"  Nel was practically jumping up and down in Suzie's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but if anyone in this city would know, she would be the one.  We'll keep our fingers crossed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is the place,\" Miriam continued, \"I remember the bright red front door and the elegant gold door pull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Door pull?\" Nel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a way to ring something inside the house.  A bit like a door bell but more splendid.\"  The three of them ascended the brick stairs to the front door of the three story building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tug the pull,\" Suzie requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest,\" Miriam said, stepping aside to allow Suzie access to the golden cord.

She saw humongous wings! Three pairs of them! They were like pixie wings, aside from their size and the number of them... She then saw that this maga-pixie had long blue hair with red twirling highlights. There were red twirls on the wings, as well. Her skin was fair, but still lightly tanned. When the pixie turned around, nel could see four blue trianglular markings on her cheeks, and her balcony was huge! When she opened her lime green eyes, the pixie looked down on Nel. She then came out of the lake, and got dressed into a green tube top and shorts with black trim. She looked down at Nel with a warm smile on her face... She asked, \"Nel Nightfall?\" Nel responded by saying, \"Yeah, that's me...\" The Pixie replied, \"I have been wanting to see you since you were born...\" \"Okay? I'll bite, who are you?\" The Pixie held her hand to her mouth, covering up a giggle. She said to Nel, \"My name is Asheria... And believe it or not... I am your mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was shocked, and she replied by asking, \"You're who?!?!?!\" \"Your mother... Several years ago, when you were born, I had to leave you behind, because I could not care for you.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because you were so small... I was permanently grown to fifty feet tall... Plus, my endowments are...\" \"Huge?\" \"Yes...\" Asheria took Nel in her hand, and held her close to her face. She saw she was on the verge of crying, and asked, \"Nel, are you crying?\" She responded, \"It's just that I haven't known about you... My mom, the biggest Pixie of them all! And here I am, the shortest of them all...\" Asheria brought her daughter closer to her face, and Nel hugged her cheek. Asheria also cried a tear, one that could envelop Nel easily. Nel flew to her mother's eye... Though huge, it was very beautiful, with the sparkles in it. Asheria whispered an incantation, and it caused Nel to become Human size, then the size of an Amazon, then to fourty feet tall.

There was a piece of paper inside the box as well, right next to where the bottle was. Nel picked it up and decided to read it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For those who like to think big\", she read out loud to herself. The little pixie then started to light up in anticipation, but continued to read the rest of the paper's message. \"Only drink one drop at a time. Further consumption can cause disastrous results.\" Nel wondered whether or not to drink it right now or to wait. Upon further thinking, she decided on drinking one single drop.

Perhaps it was to accomodate her growing figure? Unfortunately for Nel, the exact opposite of what she was hoping for was happening...she was shrinking! Nel struggled to keep her red dress on her body, but it started to slink off of her. She decided to rip off part of her dress to keep her looking modest and not naked. She finally stopped at 2 inches. The annoyed pixie flew up back on her table top and proceeded to get another drop. The bottle was much heavier now, though, and twice the height it was before. Still, she proceeded to place a single drop on her lips. She then sat on the table, next to the bottle, hoping for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?!-\" Nel started to say, feeling a tingling sensation in her body once again.

The bottle, which she was once bigger than even after her first shrink, now was almost the size of herself, and growing larger in height! Nel was always tiny for a pixie, but now she felt like a pixie in a human's house in her own home! Nel sat on the table and frustration and began to cry as she shrank further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the tiny Nel was now barely over quarter of an inch tall, shrunk dwn to 1/16 her normal height! The dress was not only too big for the little pixie, but was big enough to be a blanket for a king-sized bed. Noticing the bottle was still open, Nel wondered whether or not to simply fly into the bottle already and simply hope for the best. Before doing so, though, she noticed a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" the voice asked. Nel knew the voice anywhere: it was Clare! Clare was already almost five times Nel's height, but now she would be almost 80 to the little pixie. Nel flew behind the big bottle as Clare opened the door and let herself in. Upon doing so she noticed Nel's dress on the table, but did not see her friend (Nel flew out of the dress naked). It didn't take long for Clare to find her behind the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel!?!\" yelled in confusion the tall pixie. \"Why are so small, even more than usual?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bottle's contents made me shrink\", Nel explained to her gigantic friend, crying in frustration. \"And now I'm super tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there\", Clare told her friend, giving her a tissue to wipe her tears with, which Nel was grateful for. \"Don't worry your little head. I know someone who can help you return to normal, and I know where he lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" asked Nel, feeling a little more cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, the pixie elder in the magic forest!\" Clare smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but Clare, we can't enter there\", Nel tried to explain to her tall pixie friend. \"It's off-limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Nel, I'll go for you and head on back with an antidote\", Clare told the Nel, giving the girl a playful head rub with pinky finger. \"I'll be back soon. You stay here and stay put.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much\", Nel smiled, bowing her head in gratitude to her friend. \"I won't ever forge this. After this make all the short jokes you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Alice\" Clare giggled as she left Nel's house and closed the door. Nel proceeded to get back into her dress, as she was getting cold. Fortunately, it made a nice blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should happen next?</span></div></div>",

It's not that she minded being rescued by Clare, it's just that she wished she was big enough to solve her own problems. Even when they were little, Clare looked over the much littler Nel like a big sister, even though the two couldn't be any less related. At the same time Nel was also jealous of her friend. Clare was tall, pretty, and smart: most every male pixie their age had, at one point in time, a crush on the powerful pixie. Nel simply sighed to herself and went to sleep in her own dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passe dafter that, and Nel was woken by the loud scream of her friend. \"I'M BACK!!!\" Clare said out loud, not only scaring Nel, but resulted in her leaping out of her clothes! Clare noticed that her friend was still sitting next to the bottle the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find the antitode?\" Nel asked, placing her very tiny hands on Clare's left hand. The tall pixie nodded her head up an down in reply, and Nel lit up. Clare then took the little vile she was given and poured a drop of the liquid on Nel, soaking her head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry\", Clare yelled in fright. \"I'll get you a towel!\" As Clare ran to get Nel a towel from her closet, Nel felt her bigger getting taller. Within a few seconds the pixie was now her normal, 4-inch height. Nel decided to look at the vile once again: if one drop from the vile's content made her 4 inches tall again, what would happen if she were to drink another drop? Nel wondered whether or not to continue drinking it.</span></div></div>",

To do so, Nel decided to hide the bottle of liquid that made her shrink in one of her pantries. She then decided to get a class of water prepared for Clare's return from looking for a towel, and put in a drop of the liquid that caused the 4-inch tall pixie to shrink. She also put away the vile of liquid that allowed her to grow back to normal size, to prevent Clare from growing back...at least for a little while. Nel was too afraid to grow in her house, but at least this way she could still feel big to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare came back into the room right after finding a towel. Fortunately by this point Nel already had the drink set up. Clare proceeded to hand her friend the towel, astonished that her friend grew back to a \"normal\" height (in her eyes, anyway). Nel then told her tall friend, \"Here's a glass of water for helping me out: you deserve it.\" \"Thanks\", replied Clare, who proceeded to drink down the liquid. The blonde-haired pixie felt funny soon afterwards. She, like Nel before her, felt her dress growing, and Nel getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel, are you growing??\" Clare asked her friend worringly, but Nel just innocently lifted her shoulders up and shook her head left and right. Clare then came to the realization that she was shrinking!! But how, she wondered, as she shrank down to a stant 8 inches, 11 inches smaller than her regular height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...everything's so much bigger\", the once-tall Clare said in awe, looking at everything growing in size. Clare, who originally had to be careful not to bump her head on her friend's ceiling, was now just struggling to keep her own dress on. \"Why, I bet I could almost sit on your tiny furniture\", she added giggling. This comment caused Nel to sigh in annoyance, so she took another drop of the shrinking liquid (which she had kept behind her back) and quickly (and quitely)  placed the drop on Clare's left wing. Clare then felt her dress getting bigger still, and was now using both her hands to keep it up. At the end Clare was almost exactlly Nel's height, maybe a tenth of an inch higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare looked in shock and awe at her new, big environment, but especially at her Nel. For the first time in her life, she didn't have to look down to her. Clare knew Nel probably did this to her, but despite this, she also realized that maybe she was only doing this to prove a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want one of my dresses?\" Nel asked Clare, who quickly nodded in reply. Nel quickly flew up to her room and back again with a green dress. Nel typically wore red dresses, though she sometimes jazzed it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to admit it, but this is kinda cool\", Clare reluctantly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess you wouldn't mind if we were to reverse out typical sizes, with me being big and you being tiny?\" asked Nel, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Nel...\"</span></div></div>",

Before she could barely walk around Nel's house without bumping her head or butt into something, but now here she was, the same size of her friend. Or at least, that's what she thought. Shortly after Clare put on Nel's dress, she began to shrink once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel! What's happening to me!?\" cried a worried Clare, who now stood barely above Clare's chest. She was shrinking and fast. As Nel was about to laugh at her, she too felt a tingle in her body. She, too, was starting to shrink, and was shrinking even faster than Clare. At the end Clare was barely an inch tall, and Nel about half an inch tall. The two were on the ground completely naked, and since Nel put away the bottle, as well as the vile that made her grow back to normal size, she and her friend were stuck this way! They waited a few minutes for something to happen, but thankfully nothing did. It seemed the shrinking stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare, barely more than 1/20 her regular height, began to cry, using her dress to wipe the tears off her eyes. Meanwhile, Nel tried to fly up to her cabinet to open it to get the bottles, but to no avail. She then flew back to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clare, I'm sorry I did this, but if we're ever going to grow back to our normal heights we need to work together\", she told her worried friend. Clare agreed with her friend, standing up and dropping her dress, much like Nel did. The two naked pixies then proceeded to fly up together to the drawer, which looked as far away as the tenth floor of a building at their height. The two pulled on the metal bar together to open it up, and quickly flew directly into the bottle that Nel had recieved upon doing so, despite warnings not to do so. What will happen to the pixies now?</span></div></div>",

She needed... there!  The pixie's eyes settled on Clare just as her friend tossed her long hair out behind her, the fey girl's sodden locks clinging to the smooth skin of her back.  Before Nel knew what was happening she'd already bounded across the space separating the two of them and wrapped her long fingers around Clare's legs, flipping the pixie around and holding her upside-down in the air before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel, what do you think that you're-\" was all that the miniscule girl managed to get out before her massive friend let out a withering sigh, lowering Clare down until she was level with the very womanhood that she'd rubbed up against mere moments before.  Yet this time it was far larger, a yawning cavern that ached for something which would be able to fill it; unfortunately for Clare, she realized far too late that this was exactly Nel's plan for her diminutive form, the pixie's words muffled as she was shoved face first into her companion's swollen sex.  Nel gasped in pure ecstasy as she clamped down hard on Clare's body, contracting and releasing every few moments as she pulled the girl further and further inside of her.  Eventually the larger pixie allowed her body to slide back down against the wall of the room, unable to maintain her footing to the wake of just how good all of this was making her feel.  No longer did she have to be frustrated that there were no 'toys' small enough to help her pleasure herself, since at this size she was sure that she'd be able to find plenty of vict- volunteers to help with just that.  Yes of course, with a body this attractive, she was sure that there would be no shortage of men who would practically throw themselves at her feet for even a chance to touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie grunted to herself as the last of her friend finally slipped entirely inside her, the girl's head rubbed up against the deepest parts of her insides.  Quickly reaching her limit, Nel clenched Clare tightly one last time before the pleasure finally overtook her, spreading throughout her body in waves as she moaned uncontrollably.  With this ecstasy came further growth, the already gigantic girl filling out further and further with each groan, her feet smashing through the outer wall of her house as the room she was in became too small to contain all of her.  As the last of this latest spurt slowly faded away, Nel contracted one final time, launching Clare out from inside her and sending her rolling along the ground, coughing repeatedly.  The new Nel now stood just over 4 feet tall, more than twice the size of the next tallest pixie in her clan and possessed of a body that was to die for, her chest, hips, and ass far beyond the imagination of most of her species.  Yet, there was still a faint burning to be felt in her loins, as though even her latest exploits had yet to truly satisfy the urges she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nel regains consciousness several moments later...</span></div></div>",

At first the growth was barely noticeable, but it soon became apparent- Clare was getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel could only watch dumb-struck as Clare quickly surpassed her in height.

Nel frantically gulped and gasped at the clouds billowing about her, swallowing great mouthfuls of air. Nel was still stretching. Somewhere above the veil of the clouds Clare voice boomed \"My, my Nellie, you've been packing on the pounds!\" Nel strained against the force tugging at her; her nails gouged rock from the walls. It was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was aware of quickly flying through the air, like doll, held by Clare as she reeled from her exertion. Nel felt dazed, confused and nauseated. She was aware of the sensation of rising upwards. Soon a set of breasts swam before her, vast and powerful. Clare held Nel in one hand, her buttocks fitting nicely the curve of her palm. Clare's smile was truly awe inspiring as it beamed in front of Nel. Clare's sickly sweet breath washed over her on waves. Clare giggled thunderously. Nel bit her lip. She felt a tension building in the pit of her stomach. \"You HAVE been putting it on haven't you\" Clare teased, all the while grinning. Nel felt a flush of anger - \"You're one to talk!\" she yelled, probably not entirely appreciating the fact she was squaring up to a pixie of Clare's stature. Clare's smile faded slightly. Nel continued unabated - \"You must be hundreds of tons - you.\" Nel was passionate now \"Great.\" \"Big.\" \"Fat.\" \"BITC---!\" Nel's stomach gurgled uncomfortably, which somewhat detracted from the rant's climax. She clasped her stomach, it felt like trapped wind or indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare's smile had turned to look of acute annoying. \"Who do think you're calling a bitch, Nellie!?\" she fumed. The huge index finger of her other hand prodded Nel in the stomach - hard. What happened next surprised both pixies, as much as one can surprise magical creatures who have had a fun-filled day of growing to garantuan size and...never mind. Nel belched loudly - even Clare heard it. I was not this that shock Clare, however. Nel's eruption was accompanied by her positively bubbling in size, she just puffed up! All of a sudden! Nel outgrew Clare's palm as a seat. Clare managed to catch her, almost as a reflex action as much as anything. Nel was now big enough that she required a hand per butt-cheek. Nel look at Clare. Clare looked a Nel. The two presented and odd pair - Clare, now a pixie big enough to dwarf human houses, holding Nel; Nel, a pixie large enough to play the game of dragon politics and play it well, perched of plump buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel then hiccuped, bumping up her height more. Clare felt those perfect butt-cheeks swell against her hands - it was like holding a parade balloon. And again. And again! It was Clare could do to keep a hold of Nel as she bubbled and bulged in height. Nel was wracked by hiccups too sporadically to speak or express glee. \"You're-hic<i>blump</i>- I-hic<i>bloompf</i> -BIG now. Clare was sweating with strain. \"Troub-Hic-bnng!\" \"Tro-hic-bwmm\"  - Trouble!\" She blurted out. HIC! Clare couldn't hold Nel anymore - she dropped her onto the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now this way merely a tumble for Nel; her pillowing posterior  cushion the impact nicely...squashing the farmers market stalls. For the moment the hiccups subsided. Before Clare could open her mouth to gloat at the fact she remain, as ever, the biggest, Nel's hands clutched her stomach again, she looked in genuine distress and pain. Nel was big now; Clare could hear Nel's stomach rumbling and gurgling, visibly distended. Nel felt a rising in her, like a surge of a tidal wave. Nel attempted to stifled it. Her cheeks ballooned outwards, but it had already begun: the release and the ...ugh... bigness.  Her growth this time was smooth but sure. Her hips and ass burgeoned, her blue head bhouyed upwards by their girth and volume. Her hips were great monstrous bulwarks of flesh, her thighs great warships sailing the town's cobbled streets. Almost as if the repressed belch had made up for a lack of expression by stretching her body to vast proportion to accommodate it. Nel let out a burp like the heavens splitting.  After her gassy outburst, Nel patted her stomach and climbed to her feet - supporting herself with a building which needless to say crumbled. She rose. Nel was big. She started to stand to her feet; the ground diminished. Nel was really big! She began to straighten up.Nel was really REALLY big. She wobbled on her new legs, her boulder-kin breasts threatening to unbalance her. Nel was CLARE big! Nel stood erect. In fact, as Clare and Nel both soon noticed, Nel actually taller by a head! Nel burped meekly, a peep no more, and blushed with surprise, putting a finger impishly to her mouth. \"'Scuse me!\" she giggled. Nel was BIG!</span></div></div>",

Sure, a few hours ago she may have been able to fly this high, but as she was now she felt mighty at this height. This size. And big she truly was. The pixie town that she so often had visited looked so strange. It reminded her of a complex of rocks with ants swarming it. The city crumbled below her colossal feet, and Nel felt a sadistic joy over how she could consider herself a goddess to her former friends below her.<br>\r\nSpeaking of friends, Nel hadn't even bothered to see how Clare found her new friend now at equal grounds with her. She stood shocked before her, slightly covering in sight of the new slightly taller Nel. Nel took a few step foward to her and looked down on her friend, mocking her with a cruel smile about the height difference. \"Hows it feel Clare, to be the short one, eh?\" she said in a mocking tone. Clare sank her body in fear. \"Funny you know. You grew so much and tried to play the monster queen of the turf, but despite you progress, still got beaten by little Nel. Well who's litle now, huh!?\" Nel mocked further. She took a look at herself, and began noticing her equally improved figure. She quickly compared them to Clare, and found hers to be the superior. \"Im sexier than you. Well i was that before, but now i got the height as well, and my beauty.... its just stupid how much better i look\" Nel said followed by a sadistic grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare then became filled with rage. And without a word, she swung her arm into Nels stomach, which followed Nel taking a step backwards gasping for air. \"Just because you're bigger doesn't mean you get to play the bully\" Clare yelled angrily. \"Ill get bigger, and then we'll see who laughs\" She yelled taking a nother swing into Nels undefended solar plexus, this one stronger than the former. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel fell and slammed into the ground and fought to get her breath back on track, so that she could retaliate against Clare. But something stopped her. She had felt breath-difficulties before, but this time, something was wrong. It was a feeling of uneasy in almost whole her torso, and it allowed her to only take short breath, which was a horribly painful way to breach and to cheap-shot from Clare. Clare took a few steps back, getting full of herself and raised her hands. \"Come at me, Nellie\" she taunted. Nel managed to get a foothold, while bending over while holding her stomach in pain. Finally she managed to get a deep breath of air into her lungs. She held it for a good 5 seconds, while feeling the strange uneasy be replaced by an equal feeling of tensity in all of her body now. She finally breathed out. From her mouth leaked small clouds of the blue gas she had consumed before her latest growth spurt, and with the leaving air came back the feeling of her skin stretching like rubber as her body once again grew. Clare's eyes widened as she frightfully realized that Nels growth had returned. Nel breathed in and out again, feeling the process of tensity in her body become growth when the air left her stomach. As she breathed out gasses with every suck, the she grew and grew. She suddenly tumbled unto her butt, likely stomping a large portion of the pixie town below her. Her swelling buttockss continued to grind away the rubbled city below. Her bosom again swelled as she grew and grew, becoming more full and bouncy with every breath of air she released. Bigger and bigger Nel swelled in size, as the finally fleeing pixie population and Clare both despaired as their former acquainted outgrew virtually anything they had ever known off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nel's breath finally returned to a normal rate, the gasses stopped leaking, and she stopped growing. Nel took a looked at the hopeless face of the now small Clare before her (well, small compared to her). She smiled at Clare as she saw how she now at least was 3 of Clares heads above her even when sitting down. Nel then rose up, and now literally feeling the air become colder around her upper body. Clared looked up at Nel, now easily five, if not six times her current size, making it around a whooping 1000 feet. Nel found the view better than ever. Everything had been small before but now..... Nothing was anything for her view. Clare, the town, the forest around it, heck even the very landscape was dwarfed by her now. She had wanted to be bigger, and now she hardly could wish for more. She was ruler.... no the goddess of the land below her now.<br>\r\nNel looked down on the still hopelessly frightened Clare and miniature city below her. A smile found its way onto her face. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel took a deep breath and took a second to admire her new colossal stature. If size was what she had wanted, then truly she couldn't wish for more now. She then took a look below her, and saw that Clare, staring hopelessly up at Nel in awe and fear. She smiled sarcastically at her. \"What was that about getting biger you talked about before, Clare?\" Nel said joyfully. Clare fell on her bottom still staring at Nel. \"Guess i won in being the overgrown bitch in the end, eh\"? Nel said. She looked at her body, and again found wonder in how much bigger her breast had grown. Nel was sure she literally never had seen this big breasts. And not because they were big enough to crash entire towns by now, but more because the biggest Nel had known was that busty shopkeeper from the Bazar in the now torn to pieces town, and compared to her, Nels were LARGE. The same could be said for her ass which had also vastly swollen with the latest growth she had been doing. She allowed herself to take a feel first at her giant butt and legs, and slowly felt her way up towards her breasts, on which she took a squeeze. They were so sensitive....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Clare watched confusion as the now enormous Nel felt about on her proportionous body. Clare was big, but what did it matter? She was now like a very small child compared to Nel who roughly were about 5 or 6 times her size. She curled herself up abit, as Nel continued to take joy over her body. Suddnly, after having touched herself abit, Nel let out a loud moan. \"Uuuhh! This is amazing. Who knew pleasure was this good at this size of body\" Nel said loudly. \"I even got the body better than you Clare, maybe you should consider gas treatment?\" Nel said full of herself. Clare looked at herself. Even though she had gained some proportion herself, she felt so small compared to Nel. In all ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nel got enough of enjoying herself over her body. She got the serious look back and bowed down before Clare and grimly smiled at her, as she covered backwards in fear. \"But anyways Clare, dont you think you were a little.... violent before\" Nel said in a calm tone. Clare understood Nels intentions almost instantly and instantly rushed onto her feet to try and run away. Little did it help, as Nel simply got on her knees just about as fast as Clare had gotten up, and with one hand, grabbed her over the shoulders with her big hand and held Clare down. With the other hand she grabbed around Clares into right arm, and lifted her into the air, while getting back at her feet. Nel then held a struggling Clare in front of her head, as she kept smiling. \"You know, Clare, for the second tallest pixie alive, you seem so fragile\" Nel said calmly. <br>\r\n\"Let me go Nel!\" Clare cried. <br>\r\n\"As you wish little one\" Nel grinned, as she dropped Clare down into the ruins. She landed flat, and likely half passed out from the impact.Nel bended a little over to see. Clare hadn't completely passed out, but was coughing heaily from exhaustion. \"Aw im sorry Clare, wasn't that the way you wanted to be out down?\" Nel said sarcastically. \"I know how you can feel better, lets take a nap with each other, like at a sleepover\" Nel then said in a dark voice. As so Nel got down on her knees behind the flat Clare, still towering above her. Then she slowly sank the middle of her body below Clare, until she completely covered her, with most of Clares upper body being buried under Nels colossal bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Clare's adreneline went mad as she tried to struggle for both freedom and air, as the giant Nel slowly squeezed her to death, to no help. Nel was simply too big, and Clare felt as her bones felt like they slowly went out of place, under the weight of her giant former friend. Suddenly everything blackened before her eyes, as all air left her and she began to suffocate. With deep fear in her, she finally lost consciousness and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Nel felt Clare stop to struggle and rose up behind her. She looked at the silent body of Clare. Curiously she rolled it over to see if Clare was done for. She saw that she wasn't. Nel then got on her feet. \"Guess you got enough punishment for now. But dont get in my way again Clare\" Nel said calmly. She then looked across the landscape wondering how best to excersize her new size correctly, next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Annoyed over this she began to brush herself all over to get the worst off. Nel did however, remain rather filthy on her front. If there was a one thing she hated it was being filthy. At any time she had done any dirty outside-work, she had quickly gone home and taken a warm cleansing shower afterwards. Nel would actually have loved to take a shower with her current body. But the problem was that at her current condition, no shower in the world would fit her. <br>\r\nNel however quickly thought of a solution. She looked around the landscape, guessing she proberbly could spot it from her current height. It took her a little effort to spot anything, but then suddenly it was visible. Far away, not too far for her however, she could see the ocean. Nel got herself to take one last look down at her ruined former neighborhood, her small gigantic friend Clare still sleeping like a beaten cage-fighter, and the forest her home earlier had been in, before she began to take her cityblock long steps on her walk towards the ocean in the not so far away horizon. Her steps cause small quakes to wake up and panic anything living in the forest that was stamped below her feet. As she walked the sea steadily approached, and Nel got exited for her coming giant sized swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after Nel had left, and still left some heavy quaked as she walked Clare woke up. Still exhausted from Nels punishment, she coughed slightly regaining her breath. Once she had done that, Clare thought over the situation abit. She reached the thought of how she was pretty much pointless now. Sure she was big, but she could do nothing with her size, as Nel proberbly just would find her and take that from her, as she likely would want to do the same. These thoughts was however, quickly replaced by a great shock to Clare. She found that she wasn't actually as big as she thought. Actually she wasn't big at all. She had awoken up besides a wrecked bench from the town She and Nel had wrecked earlier. Clare looked around confused. How did she get small again. Then suddenly she noticed a large shadow above her. She looked up and thought the worst. It wasn't however.<br>\r\nAbove Clare sat, yes SAT, a man and floated mid air in a with crossed legs. He had the longest and most untamed haircut she had ever seen. And it was all orange. Weird markings and lines of the same colour stretched across his body, only that they had a weird light to them. Maybe even glowing. He had no wings and was roughly the size of a human, if not slightly taller. He sat and stared into the forest which the giant Nel just had stomped her way across and smiled. Clare dared out a silent and drawn out \"Whooooo are y....\" before he shushed her. He then looked at Clare glowing eyes and a terribly large smile.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young fisherman would with this trip mark his exact 100th. He would, like he would with his old master once a month sail out from habor, pass the couple of miles until they reached Dragon Council Cove, and set up camp. Normally people would laugh at one for visiting this cove. The over 300 feet tall, almost straightly vertical rock walls surrounding the cove made it impossible to go ashore anywhere, and because of the more than often appearing dragons many fish had left it. So only a madman would fish there. But some madmen knew the tricks on how to do it anyways.<br>\r\nHis master had studied the valley and had learned a secret. Even thought there only were a few 100 feet down from the waters surface to the bottom and no fish ever in sight, he had found a way to find a living from the placer anyway. By throwing a certain chum the old fisher had prepared down into the dephts, the unique Flamehead  Mackerel would surface from their caves underneath (whom hardly any besides himself and his master knew of), and swarm out of the cove. From there on you simply had to throw a normal fence-net into the water and the fleeing fish would be an easy catch. He sure had a wise master<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day it had been a fine catch. Hordes of the Flameheads had swam into their nets. They had already gotten hold of 2 batches. However on the third quite the anomality had taken place. Suddenly no fish would come up, even after to whole bottles of chum had been dispatched of. Annoyed the master had walked back to the ship to get the \"special chum\" which would be sure to lure them out. As the master began to bumble about in the back of the ship, the young fisher had taken a deep breath while looking at the sea horizon. Then suddenly the entire boat shaked as massive quakes were heard. Now the Flameheads surfaced and fled the canyon in greater numbers than he had ever seen on his 100 trips. They did not concern him now however. He rushed to the other side of the boat to inspect the source of the quakes. Perhaps a crash on the cliff?<br>\r\nWhen he came there the first thing he saw was his master, who had fallen down. Proberbly from a heart attack from the shock of the sudden chaos. Then he saw the odd thing. His master had just had a grand nosebleed. It looked like the same kind like the ones he had when he saw a bit too skanky dressed young girl. His first thought was the dirty thought of bikine dressed girls playing with bombs at the cliffs, and he quickly turned his head to disapprove of that theory, and find the true answear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis theory WAS disproved. However not entirely. Instead the image was far,FAR stranger than what he had expected. There, 300 feet up on the cliffs stood a, not big, not giant but positively colossal (and arguebly the most curvaceous woman he had ever seen. For a second he stood and admired the sight in awe. The girl had wings, but she was far too large (and far too humane-looking) to be a dragon of any kind. Her body was extrodinaryli sexy, breasts the size of farms, legs that could have fitted a ideal model, and a bottom with the most perfect shape he had ever seen. And her very form was so enormous that it blotted out the sun for the small boat, leaving them in her massive shadow. He looked blindly in shock as the giant fairy (as he guessed it must've been with those wings, even though her size was far beyond that of any faire, or fairy village in general) carefully descended her legs into the water, the surface hardly barely reaching half way up to her knees. Then suddenly her face gained an expression of suprise, as she began to study and feel the seafloor with her feet.<br>\r\nHe used this to snap back to reality, and figure out a solution to this (likely) dangerous situation. He quickly grabbed his old master, threw him over the shoulder and ran with him into the cabin, were he placed him on a matress they had lying around. He then quickly got out, and looked at the giantess, now finding her to having gotten onto her knees, and studying the seafloor with his hands. He ran onto the stearing deck, and quickly began turning on the engine. To his misfortune, the engine was unruly and had a hard time getting up. Stressed, he raised his hands and delivered a mighty blow to it. That was inarguebly the biggest mistake he had ever, given the situation. The engines chimney gave up a large explosion as it spat out a pitch dark cloud, and then stared to bumble, ready to go. The young fisher raised his heads to the giantess, who, as he had guessed, curiously stared at the boat, and most likely him. He quickly turned the roar to full turn, and the engine to full speed. Suddenly the giant womans expression changed to a joyful smile, as she rose to her full height. She then rose her left leg high into the air, roughly at the same time the boat reached a direction in which it could flee the scene. But before they moved more than a few feet, the girl trampled her feet into the seafloor below, making a mighty wave. The fisher saw that the girl broke the seafloor, revealing more fleeing Flameheads than he had ever seen in his LIFETIME. The waves grew as the water that had been trapped in the caves blew up, and in an instant sank turned the ship into a chaotic scene. In the rumble, the fisher hit his head on a uknown object and then passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fisherman woke up. After getting to himself and thinking the situation through he quicly noticed that the boat, greatly smashed and wrecked were no longer in water, but rather on solid ground. Had the wave washed them ashore. Whatever had happened he quikcly knew he had to get his teacher to civilisation. He rushed down, grabbed the old man and ascended the cabin. What met him when he got up left im petrified. The solid ground the ship was placed on had turned out to be the girls hand, easily holding their small boat in her palm, and once he had climbed the final step the giant womans face had met him with a happy smile. He looked down and saw that the girl, now stood in the water with the surface reaching buttheight (the cavesystem had to have been massive underground). She then carefully placed the boat on a cliffside, still facing the paralyzed sailor at her face. He watched as she quickly filled her mouth with air, and with a small blow (giant to him) blew him off the boat, and let him fly across the forest, still holding his master. He bumbled into a treetop, now once again passing out from the motion, shock and general overwhelment of the strange events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow....</span></div></div>",

The ecstacy of taking advantage of her new...... perks were amazing. She was giant, sexy and powerful, and she loved feeling so. Right from playing ant-god with the human fishermen, to seeing how she could break a cavesystem few hundred feet deep loose underwater. \"Speaking of water\" Nel said to herself. She had taken the trip to sea to wash herself, and now where she basically had her own seawater-bathtup, she would enjoy herself. <br>\r\nNel sank down into the deep cove, until she could rest her head on the cliffs behind her, and her legs stretched far enough to reach out of the cove. The dirt which had covered her body quickly washed of in the water. But Nel still felt dirty, and she began to rub her frontal body with her hands to clean herself completely. \"So dirty\" she said to herself, as her hands began to feel themselves across her precious parts. Before Nel knew it she had begun to play with her new enlargened assets again. Nel had never been the most well curved fairy in town, so she had never known the pleasure of having THIS big breasts. She kept massagin them with one hand as she sank her other down to her butt to get another feel at it's new size. It was amazing. Nel only felt just how much her body pleasured her when her hand began to move beyond her ass, and down between her legs. The tickly gave Nel a shiver, as she pulled her hands back to herself and stared down at her lower body. She turned her head to the left and right, as she quickly scouted the area. She were alone. Carefully she returned her hand to her legs, and felt her way back. She then let out a pleasured moan as she began to rub herself. <br>\r\nHow amazing it was to be big for once. As Nel rubbed, she began to think what she could do in the future. She could travel to big cities and enjoy her strength again. She could travel the country, if not the world, searching for a home fit for her. Perhaps she could search for a new source of magic, and maybe she could.... the mere thought made her giggle with happiness. Then suddenly a great shiver once again shook her body. A spasm spread from her core and ran down her love body all the way to her feet. Nel took her hand back up from the water, and let out a big sigh of pleasure, as she stared out unto the sun. Sunset was already commencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

The water ran in a fresh and cold, and a young mammal from the flock sank its head to take a sip from it. The rest was soon rudely interrupted, when suddenly a mighty hand broke apart the treetops shading the sun. As the deers fled the scene, the hand pounded into the ground below, wrecking apart the natural enviroment. <br>\r\nIn the cove below, the gigantic Nel lifted up, and was soon on her feet.

She were not terribly warm from the get-up of cloth she could salvage from the ruins of her fight with Nel. Her magic powers were terribly rusty after having returned to her normal size. It was likely the pixie body couldn't handle that big a change in such a short while. And to that, it wasn't after all very natural to use ones magic to make fire. At all! It wasn't their natural element. Clare had only tried it ones, ages ago. Meanwhile, as she struggled to get the fire running, with her small pile of debris, the long haired, orange glowing freak were floating around in circles above her, observing as she struggled. \"Will you help me, or just keep being useless up there\" Clare yelled. <br>\r\n\"Oh im perfectly warm up here. Superior existance, remember?\" the man said gleefully. With a great sigh, Clare managed to make a force a push of magic from her hands into the debris, and much to her joy, a fire rose. \"Oohh, the monkey learned to spell\" The man said, as he broke out in a short hysterical laugh over his own, weak humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had identified himself Raziel. He had told her that he was a god of size, and that he was repsonsible for the last few hours of trouble. Clare had just judged him a crazy wizard. But she approved of that once he shrank himself to the size of an ant. For fairies. So small she could've squashed him with her hands, just to grow human big again, and laugh at her. And for the last few hours he had been a nuisance to her, as she had struggled to make a bonfire, as the nights darkness slowly crawled across the land. <br>\r\nAs Clare sat down to get some warmth, Raziel shrank down to her size level, and sat on the opposite side of the bonfire, and smiled into it, with a mad look in his eyes. It was akward for a few seconds to see him like that. Then Clare broke the silence:<br>\r\n\"What did you do to us, anyways?\" She asked. Raziel lifted his eyes towards her, with a curious expression on his face. His smile then returned as he answeared. <br>\r\n\"To her\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Pardon me?\" Said Clare<br>\r\n\"It was only mean't for your friend. The one who is big now, remember?\" he said sarcastically. Clare showed an angry expression, before she continued to question him<br>\r\n\"What was only mean't for Nel then?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"The water\" he said silently<br>\r\n\"You mean the potion?\" Clare proceeded. <br>\r\n\"It was just water. I was in one of the drops, at the size of an atom wathcing her. She whined and whined over her size, and as the god of size i heard her prayers. They annoyed me, so i decided to punish her by making her smaller, and it worked. Right until you came along\". Raziel explained.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What did i do?\" Clare asked frustrated<br>\r\n\"You brought along that purifying potion to fix her size, because you thought she had been hexed. I had to make her bigger to not have my cover blown while continueing to have my fun.\" he said annoyed. Suddenly Raziel smiled. \"But then, when she wanted to mess with you i had an idea\". He said.<br>\r\n\"To make us gigantic and evil\" Clared asked angryli.<br>\r\n\"Its not my fault the power got to your heads, besides you weren't supposed to steal from her anyways\" Raziel said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Steal what? Did you put something in those vials\" Clared asked. Raziel nodded. \"Well, what?\" She asked<br>\r\n\"Potential\" he said in a deep tone. <br>\r\n\"Im not sure im following you\" Clare said, confused<br>\r\n\"Potential for growth. Its a magical thing that alters the natural outcome of things, in this case in a direction to make your friend bigger. She so wanted it, and she seemed so playful, so i decided to give her some through the vial\". Raziel explained<br>\r\n\"Then why did i get bigger?\" Clare asked. A thoughtful and intelligent expression appeared on Raziels face<br>\r\n\"You must understand that \"potential\" is a very complex thing. Once i \"put it into something\" i cant really control how it flows. For some reason you got some of it, and managed to use it faster than her, but nonetheless, she won, and i took it away so that she only remained with it\" He said.<br>\r\n\"If that was your master plan or something like that all along, then what was the point of showing up here and telling me all of this now!?!\" Clare yelled at him, as she stood up.<br>\r\n\"I got bored with your friend\" Raziel said ignorantly. Depressed, Nel fell down on her bottom again. For a god he sure was hopelessly childish. As they sat at the bonfires heath, the wind howled around them. A thought came to Clares mind:<br>\r\n\"Just how much.... \"Potential\" does Nel have?\" She asked. Raziel counted abit on his fingers a little before his answear came:<br>\r\n\"Well you used like.... 5% of what i put in there, sooo.... alot i guess\" He said passively.

Have fun kiddo\" he said, as he disappeard in a warp of orange light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare, still shocked, took a look into the wild Nel had trampled down before she left. Nel was already colossal, and if Raziel was right, she still had something off 70-80% left of that \"growth potential\" left. What if she got even bigger? WAY bigger?!?!?!<br>\r\nClare looked into the horizon and noticed the lights of a large city. Someone had to know, she mustered strength in a rage of adrenelin, and lifted her wings, starting to fly towards the light.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun sank into the horizon, the freeways that surrounded the city filled up with cars. Cars of people leaving the city, either being filled with families who left after a having spend their day off, shopping or sightseeing, or hardworking people, who left their jobs to return to their homes on the nearby countryside or in the suburbs. Naturally such jumble of transportaion led to a great chaos of queues and traffic jams. The people in their cars took to the road well aware of that. Yet on that specific day the chaos was boosted astronomically by a certain incident. It could have been the small car crash at 353, or it could have been unusually large number of trucks on the freeways that day. But no, those small time problems was of no trouble. The problem was the presence of the colossal, 1000 feet tall (heck maybe colossal didn't define this one) pixie. Thats right, a gigantic pixie. As the blue haired bewinged giant marshed through the large masses of cars, she causes tremors to sunder through the ground with every step she took. Her feet, roughly 100 feet long easily flattened multiple cars with every step, and likely many more people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in particular annoyed Nel. She had been having lots of fun with public destruction back in her village, but at the time her sized had reached its prime, all signs of life had fled the village. Now she was forced to walk through hordes of people and cars, and even though imminent destruction took place wherever the feet landes, the feeling of warm blood being squashed under her feet was utterly disgusting, add to that the feeling of car wrecks below her, hurt her feet. Nel could easily just move her legs on the opposite sides of the road, but that would have left her in a akward position with her legs spread wide above the panicing crowd. That image made her uncomformatable, though she was sure it just was a matter of getting used to (as if was hard to hide ANYTHING boiduly at her size from anyone). That, plus as disgusting and painful it was, she still enjoyed the feeling of feeling large and powerful, to the people below her. <br>\r\nAfter a short walk of 10 minutes (it was actually quite short when your legs was about 400 feet long) and a few miles of disastrously wrecked freeway behind her, Nel finally made it to the city. The people on the sidewalk and the cars on the road were even more numerous of before. As she majestically marshed through the city, the buildings got bigger and bigger in size, the deeper she came. Finally she arrived at a large plaza. Large enough to let her stand bask at her new playground. As her destructive path ended the people who weren't fleeing in wild panic and let their curiousity get the better of them stood and looked at her, from both the ground and from inside the buildings. Nel smiled as she watched the people stare in awe. She then spread her arms and took a stand, and yelled \"HERE I AM! I THIS CITY IS MINE\" so loud it could be heard across the entire town. She quickly dropped heerself on her knees and supported her falling body with her hands, taking a catlike position, before she loudly screamed. Many people were squashed under her hands, and others began the flee. A smile found its way to Nels mouth once again, as she prepared to take the city with storm, she being the storm....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she noticed that she was crawling in the opposite direction of where the sun shone. Though it had almost sunk below the horizon, it still managed to hit the tallest of the buildings. She noticed that one of these tall building actually casted a shadow that covered her. Feeling annoyed, she gave the building an angry stare. She then rapidly began to dash on all four towards the building. Quickly she then rose to her feet, and hammered her left shoulder into the building, tearing her colossal body through the walls. The impact had hurt, however the feeling paled when compared to the joy she felt of the destruction. She removed herself from the wreckage, and watched as the building collapsed, still with a great deal of people inside it. Nel did a few stretches. \"Phew, that was fun\" Nel said to herself. Curiously she looked over her shoulder. There were still plenty of bulding who could reach up to her. She thought of how she had enjoyed playing human demolition machine. A grim idea came to her mind as the sun slowly set in the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel quickly began to dash towards another tall building, at the opposite end of the plaza. A single step before the building she maneuvered a jump perfectly landing her feet on the side of the building, using it as the ledge to push herself of and land flat back at the plaza, creating a massive crater in the form of her colossal, curvaceous body. She saw as the building tore itself from its fundament and tipped into another building behind it, and as they both subsequently fell, the debris ruining everything it hit in its path.<br>\r\nFeeling the adreneline rush to her head from the ecstasy of causing havoc, Nel quickly got back up. This time she ran to the tallest building at the plaza, as well as the only one towering above her 1000 feet. She quickly jumped up and curled her hands and legs around the building, squshing her ginormous breasts into it. They flattened against the walls, before the volume got the better of the buildings density, and crashed the walls. As nel tightly held onto the building, she looked into the window, and saw a single small man, who likely had given up escape at the sight of her havoc. She winked, thinking he might notice that it was for him at her size. Then she kissed the windows of the floor. The great pressure of the suck tore the the windows apart and the turmoiled the air inside the floor so the man tipped. As the man got up and looked right at her, she once again winked to him, before performing a mighty rock with her body. The motion tore the lower floors off the building. She tightened her grib on the building, and felt her mighty body crushing walls around. Finally she dropped of the building, and saw as it too fell and smashed at the other buildings.<br>\r\nFinally the tallest of the building had fallen. She looked around the now desolate plaza and beheld the destruction she had caused. The sun finally fell below the horizon and nighttime started. Nel kicked around a few debris, as she hummed a happy tone to herself. Then Nel looked around her city playground and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While watching the city from her height, Nel saw a great light across the cityscape. The source of the light was hidden between multiple building, yet it was still visible as if it was a sun on the earth. Nel looked around fast. The area she had terrorized was desolate and in ruins. Her curiousity led her to slowly stroll between the building the the upcoming streets, slowly nearing the destination of the light. The deeper she got into the city, the more populated the streets began to be again. People would still flee from her, though a few got caught in her wake. Some just not running fast enough, others simply not being able to take their eyes of her. One guy just stood and stared and began to take pictures. That one guy Nel decided to step over, as the attention he gave her reminded how big and beautiful she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Nel stood before a river. Though it was wide it was of no trouble to her (as wide didn't mean much on her scale). Two mere steps and she was across the river, once again standing at the banks of the city. The source of the light was only a few block away. Much to Nels irritation however, the buildings began to be a lot closer, She could no longer follow the pahts around them, and even though they only reached her thighs height, she couldn't jump over them. Either she had to take a detour or... MAKE way!<br>\r\nNel aggressivly hammered her leg into the building in front of her, smashing the wall. She used the strength of her enourmous size to grind her way through the remainer of the building. Once she was through and had left the building in ruins, Nel prepared for the next one. The next building only reached her knees in height, so Nel had a faster way to get through. She lifted her right leg and stomped it right into the buildings roof. Quickly she did the same with her left leg, and the proceeded to step to the other side of the building. The building collapsed behind her, but Nel were too busy with proceeding to the next building, on which the other side of the light source was. This one was roughly the same size as her. Aggressivly she began to pound her shoulder onto the building, until it finally began to crumble on the middle. It fell over, and quikcly, Nel began to rampage her way through the remains of the building, ignorant of the destruction she caused. When her havoc was over, Nel finally stood before the source of light. It was......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel had always been a small-time, village gal (though it was hard to categorize her as SMALL in any way now) and as such had never really cared about the bigtime world changing stuff. Yet information got around the world. And though her home had been small, it too had heard the tales. The tales about how some scientist-wizard-thingies had made a revoloutionary energi system, based on creating a artificial tree that could generate vast amount of energies. Enough magical energy to power large portions of major cities. As it was now it was hard to imagine that she was standing before anything else. The source of the light that had caught her curiousity, had been a large tree, roughly the same size as what Clare, was when Nel left her. Yet instead of brown bark and green leaves, it looked crystaline to it. And every inch of it glowed of light-blue shinning light. So strong that you could see its roots glow when it dug below the earth, and likely spread to the entire Island-district of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to Nels mind, after she saw the roots. She looked the island district. Though she had left a path of wreckage, a majority of the building still stood. They were all lit up. There must've been thousands of lights, spread across a area of a couple of miles. And standing there, in the middle of it all, next to the source of all that power, it actually made her, Nel, the most recent superpower of the WORLD, feel pretty small. Confused over how she could feel this way, given her situation, she fell on her knees in front of ther shinning crytal tree, and stared deeply into its illuminated surface. And as if the answear was woven into the rays of the trees light, the solution came to Nels mind. Spawning a menacing smile on her face, she leaned foward and grabbed the tree with both her hands. An electric-like surge streamed through all of her being, as she could feel the power vibrate from the tree. Slowly she glided her hands down towards the threes roots. Once she could feel them, she began to grind her feet into the ground where the roots lit it, until she could feel her hands around some of them. Once her hands was in position, she took a deep breath. Then with a grunt, she pulled the roots up from the ground. Surges of energy surged through her again and again. She felt her hair stretch into spikes over the voltage.The lights around her began to either completly pass out, or flicker like mad.<br>\r\nWhen she had a few roots in her hands, she began with the 2nd phase of her idea. Stuffing her mouth with all she had in her hands, she began to chew and suck the roots. Energy poured into her mouth, and send ever more voltages through her body. The miracle tree began to rise and sink in the level of light it shined, as a reaction to the chaos that came from Nel sucking its power dry. However after a few seconds of sucking the energy, Nel began to feel a heavy heath rise in her mouth. Even though she wanted to remove the roots from her mouth and stop draining the energy, she felt a her hands tightly forcing her to continue, as well as her mouth continue chewing and sucking. Nel kept going for a full 30 seconds. Suddenly she tumbled onto her side lying and shaking over the voltage shocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, right as Nel thought she would burn up, the flow stopped. Nel managed to open her eyes, and get a clear view over what had happened. The tree still stood before her. Only different from before. It did no longer glow witha  pretty blue color. Instead it was light gray and pale. Nel took initiative to get back on her legs. As she stood up, a few shocks still ran through her nerves. She shaked her blue hair back in its place, and took a look at the tree, which had begun to crumble into large ash-like lumbs on the ground. Then she felt a common feeling build up from the core of her body. The smile returned to Nels face. \"Try to make me feel small will ya world?\" she humourristically said to herself, as she let the feeling course through her, and began to once again charge into ever new heights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Being 1.7 again, you went through terrain faster in the air than on foot. Walking really worked better when you had legs the length of cityblocks. But all these thoughts about her previous enourmous size was out. Now where she was back to herself, the only thing that mattered to her was to somehow stop Nel from getting bigger and, most likely, crazier. Then she could think about the lifes she had taken herself, while feeling that thrill of true gigantism.<br>\r\nLuckily Nel had been a relatively easy target to find. Thanks to her size, she had left large crater-like footprints, and many other types of collateral damage from her supposed self-enjoyment, on her hopfully final form (which Clare desperately hoped they could revert some way). All that power within a being who had been so small no too long ago, and if used right, it would only make little Nel bigger than what she already was. Clare could almost feel the tension between her and Nel, or at least how it would be if she found her. It tightened, as she flew across the ruined landscape, mile for mile.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she crossed a hillside. Nels footprint dug deep into it. She flew low, to get the feeling of how big Nel really was to her. She must've been less than an ant when compared to the footprint. She glided over the hills top, and on the other side was a most fearsome view. A few steps in terms of the footprints ahead, was the ruins of a giant city, which Nel had forced her way through. Proberbly to continue her game as goddess. This was it. When Clare got through here she would face Nel. She took a gulp, as she hovered on top of the hill looking at the path of ruines Nel had made. Then, right before she could take of, she felt some sort of gust come towards her. As if a large shockwave burts from the city. But it wasn't a concussive shockwave. It was more like a moving psychic barrier. As if her mind instinctively told her not to move foward. That was until Clare saw what true terror came from the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Nel. Once again growing. Clare didn't even think about how she could do it. She just stared in deep fear as Nel grew so far beyond her, the same way she had done earlier, only the distance between her and Nels peaks became bigger than ever. Nel was clearly enjoying her growth, as if it was drugs. Clare could clearly see that in the mad, constantly changing rubber-face that which positively was flashing with all kinds of different joys in the world. Simoutaneously she was pleasuring herself, clearly endearing both her giant bosom and vagina. Below her, the earth just came further away from her. As she got taller and bigger more of the land came into her view. She could proberbly see Clare from there. Then again, Clare was less than a speck for the growing pixie. The rubbery sound that followed the growth could be heard, even from the few miles that Clare was away from Nel. Clare didn't know how to react, besides passively floaring further and further from her growing friend. Suddenly Nels spurt stopped. The city that before had hidden Nel from Clares view, now seemed like a model city, and Nel its creator (even though she was more of its destroyer).<br>\r\nClare realized she proberbly needed to try to run. Soon Nel would move, and it wouldn't be fun being anywhere near the length her legs could walk now when she did.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the other side of the world is nice at this time of year\" Clare said to herself, as she flew away from her former destination, with all the might her wings could carry....</span></div></div>",

As she panned her vision across the landscape, taking in this new perspective, a bird collided with her head -  a bird could genuinely threaten pixies of less pronounced stature. Nel, with a start swatted at her head. She inspected her hand gingerly. \"Owch.\" She brightened. \"Wow!\" she boomed \"is that my voice!?\" feeling it rumble out. She put a hand to her throat \"Is that MY voice!?\" She grinned and turned her attention back to Clare. \"How'd you even see anything at this size Clare!?\" She peered at the ground in mock distress,  holding her bangs back from her face, \"everything's so itty bitty!\" She straightened up and opened her eyes wide, stretching skyward. \"Guess we just have our heads in the clouds...\" Clare did not look amused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" boomed Nel, putting her hands on her hips \"you need to stop being such a big ass bitch Clare!\" Clare snapped to attention. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" she boomed back, Nel had twenty feet maybe on her, but she wasn't prepared to take orders.<br>\r\n\"Well\" Nel returned, drawing herself up self-righteously  in attempt to appear even larger \"Then I'll -!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra's royal entourage worked its way through the throng of pixies, some watching and some running, for they had hurried to the town after reports of a \"big\" problem. When they reached Josh and some of the guards, the nature of the problem became clear. Pixies. Big pixies! Kassandra, after a conversation with Josh, intimated to her court sorceress and mage that they'd need to work overtime on this one. Kassandra bit her lip and looked apprehensively at the colossal pixies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare lunged at Nel, unperturbed by Nel's height advantage, crashing hard into her stomach. Nel reeled but rebalanced and grappled with Clare. The gigantic pair struggled momentarily. Nel somehow managed to get the better of Clare and took the opportunity to hurl Clare onto the ground with a seismic slam. Buildings shattered to rubble as Clare's body smashed down upon them. Clare rolled quickly, squashing more under her, and grabbed Nel's leg before she had time to move. As she rose, Clare pulled Nel's leg, swinging her and sending her stumbling across the town - stamping on structures and tumbling onto her ass - shaking the ground hard with the impact of the fleshy moons. Nel stood, wincing in pain. She inspected her ass and angrily stripped the wooden picket fence that lay in a line across it. Nel buzzed her wings in rage. Then the pair clashed again - huge breasts heaving in a succession of slams; kicks and punches. Nel went down hard on her front, but caught Clare as she bore down on her and kicked her back. Nel stood, huge and sweating with exertion, she grabbed Clare and threw her forward. Clare blundered forward; tripping over the town hall's wall. She sprawled out onto of it, crushing large parts with her heaving bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was preparing for Clare's next assault when the shrill piping of a horn came from a nearby tree. She bent down as close as she could and attempted to focus her eyes on the tiny figures on the tree. Kassandra, shouting through the horn, yelled authoritatively at Nel. \"Miss! As Queen of the pixies, I request and demand that you cease and desist in the behavior!\" Nel flushed, Kassandra was pretty scary, even at Nel's size. \"Don't blame me!\" Nel boomed, shaking the tree \"I only got this big to stop Clare! I'm just trying to  help\" Kassandra had began shouting again but was drowned out by Nel. Clare grabbed her from behind and the two struggled again. Clare had a good hold on Nel and was crushing the air out of her. Clare heaved Nel up from the ground and went to hurl her to the ground. Nel kicked furiously and Clare lost her footing, Nel was apparently too big to handle, and tumbled backwards pulling Nel with her. Clare would had have sprung up again, tenaious though she was, but was interrupted by Nel's tremendous butt and hips falling on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare gasped as she was squashed under her friend's weight. Nel looked apologetically at her. \"Sorryyyyy!\" she thundered. The voice came from the tree again \"Hold on!\" Nel saw many tiny pixies flitting to the scene of one giant retraining another. \"We'll take it from her Miss\" came a male pixie's voice. The little forms were already getting busy about Clare's pinioned Brobdingnagian body and the odd one flitted about Nel's colossal form. How tiny they look. Nel giggled, the pixies poking her here and there felt like little static charges. \"Quit it!\" she laughed teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra's voice came from somewhere near Nel's  lofty head. \"How did this happen Miss?\" \"How exactly did you two ladies become this large?\" Nel shrugged her mountainous shoulders unhelpfully \"We drank our milk?\" She added evasively. Kassandra didn't get where she was by being stupid and rather than be offended by the titanic girl's lack of co-operation and risk  being swatted she chose to laugh. \"Hah, don't be coy my dear!\" There was a brief pause. \"Don't worry we'll have you two as right as rain in no time flat!\" There was a gusty sigh from Clare underneath Nel. Nel too was pretty disappointed. Clare had always been big. She, Nel, had always been small. Little Nel Nightfall. </span></div></div>",

Clare listened quietly, still pinned by Nel\u2019s enormous body. She had decided to cooperate too, but on the inside her thoughts raged. She had never felt better in her whole life. To lose this all, was a horrible thought. Her hands caressingly touched Nel\u2019s ass. If this is hard for you, imagine how unbelievable cruel it is for Nel\u2026 She has always dreamed of being enormous and now that her dream had finally come true it is taken from her! She reminded herself. Nel, caught by surprise by Clare\u2019s gentle touch stopped her explanations for a second. Making a small noise of pleasure \u2013 at least it was a small noise for someone of her size. Other bystanders perceived it as a loud and thundering sound. <br>\r\n\u201cSet me free Nel!

The unbelievable pleasure and power connected to it, she had not succumbed to it, because she has had an aim. Clare had been overwhelmed by the rush, acting more by instinct than by thought. Both finished the report and watched Kassandra quietly.  Patiently the Pixie Queen let her both largest subjects finish their story, watching them concentrated the whole time. Finally she spoke and despite the difference and size Nel and Clare were able to hear her sultry but gentle voice clearly (perhaps the queen used magic).<br>\r\n\u201cIt is quite obvious that of you were affected by a chain-reaction of the effects of very potent portions, altered, emphasized and enhanced by your own magic abilities and your bodies. To counter this kind of magical reaction with a potion alone might cause unforeseeable adverse effects. So I will try to restore your former height by using diverse spells and counter-hexes and an antidote-potion.\u201d<br>\r\nKassandra strolled over the branch she was standing on, while she talked. Nel and Clare both admired the grace of her flowing movements. Kassandra was big for a pixie, the biggest known pixie until today, but she possessed almost unnatural agility and grace. While Nel and Clare had wreaked havoc upon a city and landscape while both were just trying to stand at large heights, nothing Kassandra had ever done had looked clumsy. This grace was not bought with a lean and scrawny body. On the contrary Kassandra was very well endowed. Her large bust was dominating nearly a third of her torso and was even more emphasized through her body size. A fact the queen tried to hide most of the times, by choosing very modest and stylish clothes to draw of the attention from her large bosoms. It has proven to be a futile attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t do this on my own. It\u2019ll take a powerful ritual; a lot of magic energy will be needed.\u201d Kassandra said. Her bright green eyes seemed to glow while she was looking at Nel and Clare \u201cI\u2019ll need the help of the human witch Kathrin. You both know her, so don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d The pixie queen sounded comforting and quite. She gave both behemoth-pixies a warm smile.<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is another matter!\u201d Kassandra continued. Her attitude changed, she suddenly seemed \u2026 darker. Normally Kassandra wore her very long red hair in a ponytail, but today she wore them open. The red mane gave her an almost fiery aura. \u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t enjoy this, but both of you have to punished for the damage and suffering you\u2019ve caused today. Overwhelmed or not, you acted reckless and endangered many of us and the humans.\u201d<br>\r\nIt was incredibly but even being so much smaller then Clare and Nel Kassandra\u2019s words were not without effect. Both giantesses lowered their head in shame, even felt a bit threatened by their queen\u2019s angry attitude. <br>\r\nKassandra\u2019s features softened a bit: \u201cFirst of all: Clean up this mess, then follow me!\u201d<br>\r\nClare and Nel nodded at each other and started to unleash their magical energy. Stones slowly hovered back, walls reappeared, cars \u201cun-flattened\u201d and slowly the traces of their rampage vanished. Nel felt a drop of sweat on her brow. Restoring magic was the most complicated and depletive form of pixie magic. Sparks danced around the towering, nude bodies of Clare and Nel. Nel admired Clare\u2019s focus, the tall blonde pixie didn\u2019t even blink while more and more sweat showed on her statuesque pale body, shimmering in the sunlight. <br>\r\nAfter five hours Nel was completely exhausted, staring blank at the repaired pixie city they were leaving behind, moving on through the large gaps in the forest. She dropped to one knee, flattening some trees beneath her gargantuan body. Angrily she spat some curses\u2026 Now she\u2019ll have to repair this, too.<br>\r\n\u201cTake a break, Nellie! I\u2019ll handle this!\u201d Clare said through gritted teeth. Nel wanted to complain, but with a short gesture of her left hand Clare cuts her of. Gratefully Nel sat down completely, breathing heavily, admiring her impressive busts movement while doing so. She closed her eyes and tried to regain energy. Half an hour later she heard a triumphant \u201cDone\u201d from Clare. Smiling she turned to her friend just to see the sweat bathed blonde pixie to tumble and hit the ground. Plowing through the newly restored forest at her full considerable length, folding trees like matches. <br>\r\n\u201cClare!\u201d Nel shouted and dashed forward. Clare was breathing but out cold. Kassandra set down in Nel\u2019s right ear. <br>\r\n\u201cShe had done well, don\u2019t panic my dear. She is just exhausted. We need to go now!\u201d Nel heard the queen\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n\u201cBut the new damage\u2026 and Clare\u2026\u201d she tried to argue. \u201cI\u2019ll handle the new damage after the ritual. At your size it is unavoidable to destroy something, even when you\u2019re just moving. This is why we repaired towns, humans and pixies, first. So we can proceed to the woods and thankfully Clare managed to keep it up until now. But now you\u2019re the only one who can move Clare.\u201d Almost mechanical Nel nodded. Gently she pulled Clare in her arms and lifted her up carefully. On her inside she hoped that no one would notice how immensely she was turned on by being able to perform such a feat of strength.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll guide you. We\u2019ll go to the hidden valley in the south!\u201d Kassandra said. And so the strange convoy moved. A giant Pixie, carrying an unconscious giant pixie, was followed by the pixie crown guard and moving southwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hidden valley carried the name rightfully. Large towering mountains, even taller than Nel was now, circling a large almost round valley. While the single entrance was an enormous crevice for the most beings, it had been a bottleneck for Nel, especially, with the still unconscious Clare in her arms. The valley itself was sparse, its ground was plain and craggy, with only few trees to be seen. By pixie standards it was immense, but Nel\u2019s and Clare\u2019s bodies at the north side nearly occupied a quarter of its total area. Kassandra had left Nel and flown to the middle of the valley where the silver haired human witch Kathrin was preparing a ritual circle with the help of some pixies. Nel rested with her back against the cold stone of a mountain. Her weight and strength had quickly reduced any disturbing ledges and irregularities. Clare, still sleeping, rested next to her, with the head on Nel\u2019s left leg. The blonde pixies eyes were still closed, but her breath was more relaxed now. Feeling that her arms were still aching, Nel muttered \u201cNow we are even, Clare!\u201d. Softly she stroked Clare\u2019s hair. Suddenly Clare\u2019s eyelids started to flutter. And she made some soft moaning sounds<br>\r\nAlways been tall, unlike Nel she had never dreamed about additional height. But the events of today had changed her point of view quite literally. No stranger to the joy of sexual sensations the growth has surpassed every pleasure she has known before. Her incredibly large body has proven to be sensitive beyond any measure. And now she awoke from her sleep of exhaustion she saw the most beautiful eyes she knew, the large gentle eyes of her friend Nel. The wild rage of pleasure and growth, the longing for more of this sensation had driven them into a fight without thinking. Clare smiled, admitting the truth to herself. There had never been a pixie she liked more than Nel and most likely there would never be a pixie she would love more, as friend or lover. Her hand found Nel's cheek and stroked it gently, her index finger ran playfully through Nel's long blue hair. Before both knew what was happening their lips were locked in a passionate kiss. Nel felt Clare's enormous bust pressing against her own bosom, while their tongues probed each other. Skilled Clare touched all the right spots to make Nel moan in pleasure, while she was trying to return the favor. Their enormous bodies slammed against the mountain ridge, crushing solid rock to fine powder through the impact alone. Nel came, her booming voice echoing through the valley, Clare followed swiftly. Longing for more they kept on.<br>\r\nThe ground shook violently beneath Kassandra and her entourage. The human mage Kathrin struggled to stay upright. Their camp was on the far side of the hidden valley, but the ferocious lovemaking of the two behemoth pixies was forceful enough to make the mountains tremble on this side nonetheless. Her guards gave her nervous glares, but Kassandra just smiled gently. \"Let them have their fun!\", she ordered.<br>\r\nOn the following day no one had slept at all. Nel and Clare looked exhausted but happy, the pixie guard and the human witch just tired. They prepared the ritual and the portion, with the enormous pixies sitting in the center of the valley, occasionally exchanging gentle touches and kisses. Finally Kaasandra and Kathrin gave both of them the portion and started the spell. Magic energy channeled and crackled through the air. Wild arches of mage fire glared at the mountain tops. Kassandra ordered her guards and Kathrin away from the two pixies, with a sad glare. They won't like what is happening next, she thought sad. Seconds later Nel and Clare screamed in agony. While growing had been a joyful and arousing experience, the reversal of this magic was quite the opposite. Nel clutched her head with both hands, feeling incredibly drained and sick. Next to her Clare mimicked the gesture, both titanic pixies curled up and finally passed out.<br>\r\nFluttering Nel opened her eyes and almost immediately regretted it. Her stomach rebelled and she felt miserable. Everything around her had changed since her last waking moments. 'Everything is so big again', she realized. Her almost numb fingers touched something warm and soft next to her. Clare, she thought, while she helplessly patted Clare's back. Clare answered with a pained moan. Suddenly she became aware of the long and shaped female leg in front of her. 'The Queen!', she realized and started to stand up slowly and shaky. The unwilling noise from Clare told her, that Clare was doing the same. Then Nel noticed she hadn't shrunk to her old size. While Kassandra was still a head taller than Nel and Clare both pixies towered the Queens guard and with a quick glimpse at Clare's chest Nel observed that certain other improvements to their physique hadn't been completely reversed, too. Both of them still had large busts and shaped figures. But she felt too miserable to take joy from this observation.<br>\r\nSmiling gently, Kassandra hugged both of them. \"I know you're not feeling well at the moment. But I welcome you back in the kingdom of pixies\". She released them and took a step backwards. With a formal voice she declared: \"You both have endangered other pixies and the human realm as well. I sentence you to work in the palace for two months, as punishment for your reckless behavior. After that you're free to return to your homes.\" Nel and Clare nodded weakly. Both knew this was a mild punishment. Kassandra nodded gracefully and turned to the towering human witch behind them. \"I thank you for your help, Kathrin\". The beautiful human smiled back at her. \"It is always a pleasure, Your Grace.\"<br>\r\nKassandra took a last look at the destroyed mountain site, marked by the love game of two titanic pixies. Then she smiled at Nel and Clare. \"Follow me home!\", she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These, she thought, were novel little contraptions, borne aloft not by magic but by harnessed and reigned birds: in case of the coaches of the Empress herself, this was drawn by a pair of haughty eagles, while the coaches of the footmen, towards which Nel and Clare were being directed, were altogether smaller and drawn by several ravens. In the evening light the young witch watched the small figures of Clare and Nel walk, seemingly a bit downcast, towards the line of coaches. Clare was the first to embark, the ball-like orb of the coach tilting slightly with her weight. Nel lingered just a second, her eyes focusing on nothing in particular; Kathrin thought, as she looked on at the bluehaired pixie, she saw Nel\u2019s frame tremble or flicker, thought she saw her form expand and contract in a moment less than a heartbeat. But Nel shook her head and stepped up into the coach, drawing the door closed behind her with a click. As the coaches flew away into the sky, Kathrin waved after them. Once she could no longer see them skimming across the tops of the trees, Kathrin furrowed her brow; for a while, she contemplated the huge rocks that were pulverised remains of the clouded heights of the valley mountains, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days later, Nel and Clare were allocated their roles within the castle walls for the coming months. Clare had found herself in the scullery and kitchens, where she was resigned to cooking and often sweated so profusely that her uniform was reduced almost to transparency in places and clung to her skin. At other times she was required was required to serve and wait on the table and upon the Empress and her guests, but, although she escaped the sweating and cloying heat of the kitchens below, she found the uniform for this very constraining, especially in the bust and backside, and oftentimes found herself the toast of the Barons and Dukes for the indiscreet and not ungenerous gaps her bosom made between the buttons of her taught maid\u2019s blouses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, Nel found herself cleaning and dusting the rooms of the palace, sometimes in rooms so remote from the rest of the castle that she could not see or hear others in the adjoining rooms. The dust, and there seemed to be an awful lot of it gathered on the ornate mantelpieces and postered beds, aggravated her allergies and as she stretched, crouched, and crawled to dust to the steward\u2019s exacting standards the uniform rode up the crack of her backside awfully. Nel, having been reduced from the size of a mountain, had to confess she found adapting to indoors a little difficult, especially seeing as she was returned, not to her former size, but a size fractionally larger than Clare had been before her similar immense inflation. This made negotiated the tighter corners of the room uncomfortable to say the least and she was especially embarrassed when, having squeezed her hefty bosom and plump hips under a bed to sweep dust-bunnies, she found herself stuck and the butler had to lift the frame to let his meaty underling wriggle free. Nel, for all the world, swore her hips shouldn\u2019t have got stuck. She often found herself perched precariously atop stools, one leg stretched out behind her for balance, and wobbling as she attempted to dust a particularly overlooked cranny of a room. Though she was sometimes called upon to provide fresh linens and blankets to the Palace guests, Nel did not have as much to do with the Palace servants or guests, for which she was glad, but she was expected to report to the Empress\u2019 butler in all matters. This cold individual, with a large aquiline nose, made little secret of his contempt for Nel and was in the business of making her scour and dust rooms she considered clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the evenings Clare and Nel, exhausted from working, would take the opportunity to meet each other in one of their respective rooms. One of these nights Clare, fresh from a day in the kitchens, perched on the foot of Nel\u2019s bed. Clare flopped backwards onto the sheets, her taught bosom wobbling, a detail Nel caught with a sideways glance from her place by the armoire. Clare rolled onto her side, propping her head up, and ran her eyes over Nel. \u201cYou\u2019re filthy\u201d she eventually opined. Nel turned her to regard Clare outstretched on the sheet in the soft, amber light of the candles. \u201cWell you stink\u201d Clare scowled and curled her head to sniff tentatively at a sodden armpit before pulling a face and plucking at the clinging fabric of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pause that followed Nel brushed her hair, craning down in the candlelit gloom to look into the dresser mirror; she could not quite suppress the slight curl of a smile at the way her swaying chest hung and filled her nightgown. As Nel adjusted the strap of her nightgown Clare sighed; the bedsprings clinked: \u201cSay, Nel.\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d, Nel, still faintly involved in the arch formed by her hanging breasts, absentmindedly returned. <br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed anything weird happening?\u201d<br>\r\n Nel put down her brush, \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Clare, still lying on her side, continued: \u201cYou know about yourself? Anything weird?\u201d<br>\r\nNel, her curiosity piqued, turned and leaned against the armoire, her hands behind her, \u201cLike what exactly?\u201d<br>\r\nClare scratched her thigh, \u201cLike, well, okay. Today I was in the kitchen\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can smell\u201d added Nel.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u201d snapped Clare impatiently. \u201cI was in the kitchen today and the cook, after making me peel a complete mountain of potatoes and vegetables. I hate vegetables now mountain after mountain of god damn vegetables. Anyway, sorry, she says I have to take over at the stove while she goes into the village, for whatever reason.\u201d There was a slight noise from the hallway and Clare paused before lowering her voice a fraction.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, as I was stirring the pot, I,uh, hit my head on the shelf above the stove.\u201d<br>\r\nNel  snorted, \u201cThat was a great story Clare; you should turn it into a book someday\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Miss Sarcastaboobs.\u201d<br>\r\nNel, still quite amused with herself, added \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\nClare, still conscious of the hallway, continued \u201cWell? Have you ever seen this shelf?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s at least several head-heights above the stove! You have to get a stool to get down the pots and pans\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d, Nel shrugged, \u201cyou\u2019re a tall girl\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot THAT tall though! I dropped the spoon into the soup and rubbed my head, looking up at the shelf. I can\u2019t understand how I could have hit it. And here\u2019s another thing: when I was waiting the table for that big function the other day, I was taking round a dish of berries and nuts, when I got this strange feeling that came over me like a shiver. suddenly, and without any warning, the front of my maid\u2019s blouse blew open! It sprayed a few buttons onto the table; one bounced off the aspic and hit some Baron on the forehead; It was mortifying\u201d<br>\r\nNel, intrigued again, asked \u201cDid anyone say anything?\u201d<br>\r\nClare rolled her eyes, \u201cThat particular baron quipped something like \u201cThat one has more wobble than the jelly\u201d and everyone burst into laughter as the steward swept me out of the room\u201d.<br>\r\nNel snorted again, \u201cWell, Clare, you\u2019re a big girl too; these uniforms are too small for the pair of us; I didn't mind it at first that the Empress left us on the large side for a pixie, but that was before she stuffed us into these uniforms...I can scarcely go ten minutes without a butt-cheek saying hello\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nClare sat up and continued emphatically, \u201cBut don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot as weird as using a hillside as a pillow\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d as she said this the bedsprings clinked, \u201cI don\u2019t just mean haunted feather-duster weird, I mean weird given our 'condition'.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d, Nel cocked an eyebrow, \u201cyou think you had a few growth spurts, since we arrived?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, said Clare, rubbing her arm, \u201cI\u2019m not much bigger if I am Have you noticed anything?\u201d<br>\r\nNel thought for a moment, \u201cCan\u2019t say I've noticed anything as drastic as that there was the day I was balancing on a stool and a vase fell off the cabinet behind me, I figured I clipped it with my outstretched foot though\u2026\u201d Nel looked about, \u201cI can\u2019t tell though\u2026 I\u2019m not used to quite this perspective as it stands.\u201d<br>\r\nClare closed her eyes and thought back, \u201cIt was like a quick expansion and contraction, of suddenly swelling up and suddenly deflating back, like a balloon stretching.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d, repeated Nel as she thought for a moment, \u201cmaybe the potion, or whatever they used to shrink us, wasn't potent enough?\u201d the footsteps of someone passing the door made Nel stop for a moment. When they passed she continued \u201cand maybe it couldn't quite contain us? What with all the volatile magics in us at the time...\u201d<br>\r\nClare blinked, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying our bodies might be unstable?\u201d<br>\r\nNel tilted her head and stuck out her bottom lip, \u201cJust a tad\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe candle sputtered a moment before Clare asked \u201cWhat will we do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to have lingering effects\u2026\u201d Nel cupped her bosom briefly, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m having them.\u201d<br>\r\nClare was quick to add \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve just had them when you\u2019re asleep? Or just haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an easy way to tell about all this Clare...Stand up\u201d Nel said, motioning Clare towards her.<br>\r\nClare hopped from the bed, bouncing ripely in the room\u2019s candlelit penumbra, and came forwards to stand toe-to-toe with Nel. The light from the dresser candles had all but gone out and the smell from the smoke mixed with the smell of Clare\u2019s body, outlined darkly before her. Nel came forward from the armoire, straightened up so her chest pressed against Clare\u2019s...except it was clear that... <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d, Nel quipped, \u201csomebody\u2019s been eating all her vegetables\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the following weeks Clare found that her fluctuations in size were an inconvenience, but one which she managed, more or less, successfully to conceal from those about her. Since Clare was, with the way her body was beginning to bulge out of her clothing through every hole and gap, ever more resembling a rising loaf of overproofed dough, with great bulging egg of her chest straining her blouses to breaking point, her feet curling up inside plimsolls, and her thighs pressing together inside her skirt even as her hips threatened to rip it asunder at the seams,  neither of the girls expected that the most radical effect would eventually come from Nel, who, hitherto, had had comparatively few problems with random fluctuations in her height, weight or her \u201cbodaciousness\u201d. True, Clare was beginning to provoke questions, like: why was the new girl always hitting her head? why wasn\u2019t the new girl given a properly fitting uniform? did the new girl seem different? why was the new girl always nipping out of the kitchen? why were they alway finding buttons in places? why, suddenly, was the new girl able to lift whole crates of potatoes like throw-pillows? was the new girl stealing pumpkins? And it was true that both Nel and Clare took to fretting about keeping Clare\u2019s episodes a secret, coming up with all manner of weird excuses, like: she was wearing a sprite-sized uniform; she was clumsy; that was supposed to be exposed; she had good genes; it was their imagination; boys always think they\u2019re bigger than they are; she had an upset stomach; the weather was changing and it affected her badly. Nel deflected attention from the occasionally bulging Clare with expertise and precision, for lying came quite naturally to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, so concerted were Nel\u2019s efforts to cover up Clare\u2019s various \u201clittle\u201d accidents and mishaps that she scarcely noticed her own. It was strange, given Nel\u2019s intimate and, for that matter, first hand knowledge of their unstable affliction that she should fail to think much of becoming suddenly stuck under a bed or catching a vase upon a mantlepiece as she passed by and breaking it when carrying out the duties she had been assigned about the castle. Perhaps it was that she, being, for the most part, and unlike Clare, was left very much to her own devices and would seldom see another soul in the vast wings of the Palace until her senior servants would come in to inspect her handiwork, fastidiously combing over every inch and jot of the room until something unsatisfactory was discovered. For her job was never satisfactory, despite her efforts, and when it was discovered, as it inevitably was, be it a speck of dust on the windowsill or a feather slightly protruding from the quilt, it was rained down upon Nel in the calm and reserved triumph only imperial butlers and stewards could command. A tone which, more often than not, was intended to make its recipient, usually Nel, of whom, it had been decided, they would make an example, feel worthless, make them feel far smaller than they were. Nel was often treated to such scathing critiques of her cleaning and housekeeping, perhaps because they did not like her attitude or the circumstances under which they had been landed with her, and would be left to redo the room, from top to bottom, with her anger and resentment fulminating in her head and belly. The Steward remarked once to the Butler, vis-a-vis the attitude of his blue-haired pixie, that he had had to make her redo the windowpanes of the Rose room, which she had basically missed altogether; the young pixie had not said a word, but her eye had twitched, which the Steward took as a sign of her rebellious soul. Having completed the task as she should have done in the first place the Steward had sent her about the rest of her day, but, watching her go down the corridor, to see that she did not slip off, this young, blue-haired pixie had, presumably because she thought the Steward still inside the Rose room, clutched and pulled at the backside of her garments! As if they were uncomfortably tight or hitched up! Such coarseness and how indiscreet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes Nel would lie awake at night, her hands and knees sore, and glare at the ceiling, her teeth gritted, and think that the steward might not be so quick to censure her if he knew that she was forced to dust and scrub the rooms and chambers of the palace only because she had, just over a week ago, towered over these ramparts and turrets and that even the largest of the Palace vaults, cloisters or halls could not have contained her! Oh how he\u2019d change his tune, thought Nel with a quiet smile to herself, if I were just a fraction of that size again! For Nel had, although she had only sought to reach such proportions as a means to contending with the then enormous and size-delirious Clare, become quickly accustomed to having that new perspective on the world and, although she had for a long time wanted to be taller, never had she imagined that she would be THAT large or that it would feel SO right! Nel had been reminded of this feeling when she was folding a quilt in one of the royal chambers, upon which was embroidered a landscape, a map of the realm, with the castle, the blue mountains and the vast forests stretching across it. Nel had examined this stitched landscape for a moment as she smoothed it flat across the bed and thought again of the view from such great heights that she had enjoyed, so it seemed, only for a moment. She thought of looking down from the summit of her stature at the matchbox houses and the forest which seemed only like the bristles of a deep green carpet, and Nel contemplated throwing herself down upon the bed and the quilt and stretching her body across that fabric landscape as if she were a part of it. Think of this now, lying in bed, Nel gave an involuntary wriggle. It was perhaps these memories of her former size, and her fondness for her larger stature, that worked somewhat to embitter Nel as she dusted and cleaned, made her difficult, intransigent and, no doubt, stoked the fires of her resentment. Quite apart from being almost constantly irritable and on edge, there were times during the last week when Nel, who had never been an exceptionally angry person, felt she could scarcely contain herself, like her anger was overpowering her. During these episodes, usually face to face with one of her superiors in the Palace staff, Nel felt her cheeks flushing and a sensation as if her belly were full of molten lead, churning and burning. Apart from this her vision would swim as she felt light-headed, dizzy and often sick, in fact often having to fight down the impulse to wretch, which, doubtless, would not have been well received. But Nel managed to keep herself bottled up, focusing on keeping herself upright when her knees inevitably began to wobble and tremble as if they were made of jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, therefore, on one of these occasions that Nel finally snapped. Nel had, on this occasion, neglected to sweep from the mouth of the fireplace a several cinders and a few flecks of soot. The fire had not been lit that year and Nel had overlooked this. The Steward drew himself up, sighing as if he did not like being so pedantic, and flicking his swallowtails out behind him, while managing to look down his nose at Nel, through the little circular lenses of his glasses, despite being a head shorter than her. During his lecture on the value of detail, the Steward noticed the twitch in the girl\u2019s eye again and resolved to set her right! Meanwhile Nel was becoming more and more aggravated. The room was long, more of hall really, how could she had done it all herself? Nel gritted her teeth and felt her blood boiling, hearing it in her ears. Her cheeks flushed red, as the Steward crooked a finger at her and said \u201cCome\u201d as he turned his back and began to walk the length of the hall. Nel rolled her eyes and followed, fighting the urge to be sick with rage. Again!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe windows look a touch dusty\u201d said the Steward, not turning but indicating them with a wave of his hand as they walked. Nel focused on putting one foot in front of another; her knees were wobbling and, looking down at her feet, she saw perspiration forming on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by a table, the Steward paused a moment to hold up a chess-piece to his eye for closer inspection, making a show out of it for Nel, who all the time felt herself becoming angrier, but took the chance to clutch at her backside and dislodge her undergarments. Replacing the piece, he moved on down the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he walked on the Steward indicated the chairs and the chaise longue on his right, which he said were in a sorry state and should be shine and plumped. Nel, following in town, felt something plummet in her stomach; her eyes wide, she said nothing as her vision swam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were drawing towards the other end of the hall as he the Steward remarked that the rug would need adjusted. By this point Nel was drifting behind clutching her stomach, but as he continued on she felt something bubbling up from the pit of her stomach. Anyone looking in would have seen quite the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Steward walked on casually, oblivious to the fact Nel was neither listening nor following him now. As he approached the end of the room where the fireplace lay he seemed unaware of the shadow beginning to stretch across the hall. He fastidiously ran a finger along the mantelpiece and rubbed it as it loomed behind him taller and taller \u201cYes\u2026\u201d he said, pausing for effect, as the chandelier jingled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll just have to do it again\u201d he said wearily, \u201cam I understood Miss?\u201d No reply, the shadow now spreading over the end of the hall. The Steward asked again \u201cMiss?\u201d, conscious of a kind of rubbery sound from time to time. There was a crunch from behind him and the scraping of furniture and a rumbling. Incensed by the girl, he rounded on the blue-haired pixie in fury, his finger brandished: \u201c Do I make myself...perfectly...clear\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel had, only moments before, been trailing the steward\u2019s coat-tails disconsolately; however, now, she found her shoulders pressing hard against the ridged ceiling and her head, crooked at the neck, slowly scraping along the curve of the roof. To the steward, who all the while had remained practically oblivious, the change must have practically instantaneous; yet it was hardly that for Nel and, behind his turned back and clasped hands, it went something like this. Nel had, her pent up anger now mounting to bursting point, found herself overcome by feelings of dizziness and nausea and she faltered as she walked behind the steward. Her hands resting on her belly, Nel\u2019s anger thawed into a mixture of confusion and discomfort. It felt as if the rage and frustration welling up inside her over the passing weeks had suddenly burst, sending it running down into the pit of her stomach in a cold stream, like meltwater flowing down from a glacier to the valley below in the midst of Summer. Nel felt her gut groan as she stopped walking altogether. Nel struggled to focus on the slim, tall figure of the steward as he walked onwards as her vision seemed to swim. She was suddenly aware of her legs feeling weak and Nel looked down to see them trembling like strands of kelp caught in a current\u2014they felt as if they were made of jelly and might give way under her at any second. Nel\u2019s eyes grew wide as, after a momentary pause, her legs suddenly wobbled, so much so that her knees knocked together a few times; more surprising still was that her legs appeared to be growing longer before her eyes! Releasing her aching stomach, Nel clapped her hands onto her thighs, even as she did so feeling them thickening beneath her fingers. She managed to stifle a cry of surprise as she found herself climbing higher, on what seemed like ever-growing stilts. Nel released her legs and held her arms out to her sides in a bid to balance on her elongated legs, wobbling and teetering like some huge, gangly fly or wading bird. Nel looked again at her legs to see the tights of her uniform split open like banana peels as her legs spurted up again, revealing the white flesh beneath. It crossed Nel\u2019s mind to attract the steward\u2019s attention and he strolled on, oblivious, muttering something or other. Nel wobbled back on forth on legs now fully three times her body-length, before feeling the plummeting sensation in her guts again and she had just enough time to stabilise herself before hips flared outwards and her buttocks suddenly bulged, quite as if she were a rubber balloon being abruptly pumped full of a quantity of water. Nel\u2019s hips and butt-cheeks swelled from this particular spurt until her skirt sat about her waist like a thin, delicate band of sapphire on a lady\u2019s finger. Nel was struggling more than ever to keep her balance at this point, feeling not unlike a spinning-top, when she noticed her arms stretching too! Growing longer and branching out from her body, atop her trunklike legs, towards the sides of the room. Her arms now long and unwieldy, there was nothing Nel could do when, after only a few moments wherein she seems to have stopped growing, her chest swelled up with the same violence as her hips had done, the great orbs bursting the buttons from her powder blue blouse within seconds, seeming, after their surge, to eclipse her torso altogether. Nel thanked heaven that the steward was, in his old age, becoming hard of hearing, so as not to her the rending and tearing of her maid\u2019s garments, and she could only pray that he did not notice the buttons sent forth from her burgeoning bosom like sparks from a fire. Nel\u2019s chest was now so heavy that it was becoming a strain to remain upright, despite the size and sturdiness of her legs, and began to slowly bear her down towards the floor! It was in that instant, just as her nipples threatened to graze the carpet, and Nel herself was sweating from the exertion of holding herself, moreover her monstrous chest, up, with her now huge arms braces against the walls, that Nel\u2019s torso caught up to the rest of her. Nel suddenly was conscious of the weight easing and lifting as her trunk lengthened and thickened, casting her shadow across the hall as her shoulders lengthened and cracked. Nel was able, at this point, to straighten herself up somewhat. She had only a moment to cast a confused glance about her at the size of her head before, with a suddenness that shook Nel\u2019s vision, it inflated to fit her body with a pop, tousling her blue hair. All this happened in the time it took the steward to cross the hall and Nel stood and watched him as he stood there, hands clasped behind his back, bracing herself for the reveal. Nel bit her lip as she saw the steward draw a deep breath. But Nel caught her own breath as she felt the plummeting sensation again and the trembling of her limbs. She soon found her wobbling knees bending and her arms crooked at the elbows, with her hands, pressed flat against the walls. Nel winced as her head bumped against the ceiling and she bend her neck\u2014she was getting too tall for the room! Even now the steward, ever the primadonna, had not turn, instead seeming to casually inspect his fingernails with an air, Nel guessed, of regret. Nel could only dimly hear the steward muttering something, but whatever it was it detracted from by another growth spurt, wedging Nel, even with her back bent, in the ceiling space, her head brushing aside the chandelier, her legs crooked and knees turned inwards, and her arms braced against the walls. Nel attempted to blow her hair from her face when the steward, standing before the now much taller Nel like a cricket turned on her, fury on his face, brandishing a tiny finger at the space where Nel should have been. But, of course, she was not. The steward\u2019s eyes were met not by those of a young girl, blushing from embarrassment at being hauled up for her shoddiness, but instead met only a tattered pile of clothes where the girl had been and, instead, his eyes followed the trunk of a massive and shapely leg upwards, towards a pair of hips like an onion dome at the foot of the towering column of a torso, which, as it extended upwards, and as the steward\u2019s eyes lifted along its height, widened not only into broad, rampartlike shoulders, but branched out into long, powerful arms reaching across the width of the hall and billowed outwards in a bosom like an avalanche, which hung there, half eclipsing the view of the midriff, like an enormous soft pillow, before his eyes reached the heart-shaped face, framed by blue hair, hanging above him like the moon in a morning-sky and, finally, his gaze met the huge green eyes of the girl, which were full of embarrassment, shock and boldness. Perhaps it was natural, then, that some of the steward\u2019s ire disappeared suddenly and he found himself lost for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked down at the cricket of a steward below her and attempted to shift a bit inside the hall. She could see his little eyes glinting, and wondered if it was fear or surprise she saw on his minute features. Nel was still somewhat shocked herself at this sudden growth spurt and had barely had time to adjust, yet she still took the opportunity to be defiant: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she spoke, feeling her voice rumbling out from her mouth, \u201cmy head must have been elsewhere, would you like to repeat that last part?\u201d Nel smirked a touch when the steward said nothing and instead remained stock still before the fireplace: \u201cThought so\u201d, she boomed, attempting to draw herself up as much as possible, \u201cnot quite so critical of me now are you?\u201d Nel tried to reposition her legs in the hall, bringing them together. \u201cBecause, if you were\u201d, she went on, smiling down at the floor, \u201cthat little growth spurt made me big enough to kick your butt! Ha, made me big enough to squash you flat!\u201d Nel, though she was annoyed, was far too elated to find herself tall again to follow through on her threats, but had forgotten, or seemed oblivious to, the tendency people had, when one was now a giant, many times their size, to treat what you said with a certain seriousness. Nel had not noticed the maid who, attracted by Nel\u2019s booming voice, had slipped in at a sidedoor, who, at Nel\u2019s taunt, screamed so loud it hurt Nel\u2019s ears. Nel was startled and bumped her head against the ceiling with a crash, which sent spiderweb cracks spreading across the hall. Nel swore and looked down as best she could: \u201csettle down, lady!\u201d The maid had fainted and had been joined by another and then another. Nel looked back to the steward to see he had been joined by a worried-looking young lad and that the door at the back of the room held the forms of several similarly distressed maids. Nel tried to smile sheepishly: \u201cIt\u2019s my first day?\u201d Without warning the young boy shot off too fast for Nel, whose maneuverability was limited as it was, to grab him. She helplessly watched him dart through a doorway, knowing he was off to alert the Empress. \u201cAww, no, don\u2019t do that\u201d she moaned as he disappeared. Another maid who had just entered screamed and ran back out crying \u201cmonster!\u201d followed by another few shrieks from other staff. Nel\u2019s head clattered with the chandelier again; she was getting worked up again: \u201cCan you just\u2026 not?\u201d Nel moved her foot and crushed a chaise longue, the broken timber stabbing into her sole. Nel howled in pain and stumbled backwards, Nel arm brushing a large gargoyle from the wall. Nel fell onto her giant rump, crushing more furniture, and slammed her head against the rear wall. \u201cOW!\u201d cried Nel clutching her head, \u201csee what you made me do!?\u201d The steward and the others were quickly retreating through the doorways: \u201cOi!!\u201d, Nel boomed, \u201cwhere do you think you\u2019re going!?\u201d Nel, becoming annoyed by now, was about to move when another large gargoyle fell onto her head. \u201cRRRRRRRR!\u201d Nel, her head dusty with granite and her butt-cheeks pricked by furniture, was about to scream when she abruptly froze, her eyes wide\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moments later in the Palace grounds there came a rumbling, a rumbling which shook the boughs of the trees and juddered the stones in the rockery. Those in the garden cast about them, got to their feet and looked in confusion at the stream of servants and waiting staff fleeing from one of the Palace\u2019s various service entrances. Meanwhile, those with a better view of the hall where barons, counts, dukes, their wives and others would retire after dinner to mingle, smoke and drink brandy, speculate on the affairs of the kingdom, be entertained by the recitals or performances the Empress would arrange and make witty remarks, situated on the far left wing of the Palace, where the rumbling was worst, could see, through the high and latticed windows of that hall, something swelling up from inside, as if someone were inflating a hot-air balloon inside, a balloon fashioned of white silk and bedsheets. Only several moments passed before the roof of the hall began to heave, the ridge starting to curve, the slates dislodging and sliding off to crack on the ground and the roof itself was soon straining at the eaves. Scarcely had the roof begun to bow when there burst forth from the lateral facade of the hall the long, white trunk of an arm in a shower of dust, glass and masonry. This arm was propelled, obviously, by its owner\u2019s increasing size, which had sent it through the side of the building, from its place braced against the wall of the hall, when space began to become an issue. And now, as this huge limb lay tensed on the lawn, its palm planted down, still lengthening and thickening, there came from the other side of the building a similar crashing and shattering that suggested that another arm had burst from the side of the hall. Soon though, the roof was shuddering and bulging further, accompanied by a horrible splintering of wood and cracking of masonry. The roof ridge split like the shell of a duck\u2019s egg and there rose from this fissure, in a cloud of slate dust and broken masonry, a giant blue head. And as the onlookers looked up in shock, this blue head climbed higher, shards of slate falling from those long tresses and clattering on the roofing and guttering. In sporadic leaps and spurts the blue-haired head rose from the hall. The edges of the roof crumbled as a pair of huge shoulders forced their way through with the long neck and head. People were fleeing across the lawns, through the hedgerows, and out of the gates as the roof of the hall started to crumble further still as a giant bosom, a huge mound of marble flesh, rose upwards from below. A growing shadow was now spreading across the grounds, swallowing up the flowers, the trees and statuettes. Those attracted from the other reaches of the grounds by the commotion stood on the grass rapt with shock as a giant figure stood up from the hall, bits of masonry and roofing clinging to its massive form. Brushing its body down, the giant figure, still climbing, drew back its blue tresses to examine the scene before letting a surprised and brash laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel, now suddenly finding herself restored, despite the Empress\u2019 counter-measures, to huge and still-increasing proportions, could not help but laugh. She had been concerned all this while that it would be Clare who caused a scene like this, her already confined bosom suddenly erupting one morning in the kitchen and her legs and buttocks shooting through a rear wall as her golden head ploughed through room after room. But instead it had been her! She had been so concerned with covering up Clare\u2019s little spurts that she had been oblivious to her own not-so-little spurts! Nel curiously hefted and weighed her own bosom in her huge hand, feeling her nipples and, also, feeling her skin stretching beneath her palms. Her bosom gradually threatening to obscure her view of the ground below, Nel glanced down, through the chasm between her breasts at the length of her torso, along her expanding midriff, fixing for a moment on the gorse of blue hair atop her lower regions, and settled on the rooftops and Palace lawn gradually receding from her as she continued to grow. Seeing her perspective on the world still changing, Nel soon realised that her long calves, as the grew longer and thickened, would soon begin to eat up the hole made in the roof of the hall by her head, shoulder and chest, and from which the still climbing figure of Nel protruded like a giant sunflower. To avoid the eventuality where her feet would become stuck in what was, to her, no more than a large shoebox, Nel unclasped her chest, for she needed her arms for balance, and tentatively brought up her left leg and stepped free of the remains of the hall, the black shadow of her leg passing over the lawns as he foot planted down on the grass by a copse of tree with a resounding boom. Straddling the grounds and the hall awkwardly for a moment, as he outstretched arms helped her adjust to the ungainliness of her still increasing size, Nel hauled up her right leg, bringing it up and around over the rooftops, lodging and shattering a slender steeple in the process. Nel now stood on the lawns of the Palace gardens; about her saw the flowerbeds and rockeries which seemed to her like little jewelry boxes or assorted sweets, the meticulously kept hedgerows winding across the grounds like a dark green snake and she looked down about her at the trees which looked less like the tall and ancient trees they were, looked after by generations up generations of gardeners, but more like shrubs or bushes growing in array on the grounds. Looking at these trees, and at the figures of people flitting across the lawn, Nel could not help but wonder how big she must be and if there would soon be a point when these trees resembled toadstools compared to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, even as she thought this, Nel felt the swelling rumble of her body beginning to sputter and wane, and it was with a mixture of elation and disappointment that she saw the ground slowly cease to recede before her, the feeling of the grass rumpling beneath her feet diminishing, and felt herself grinding to a halt. A slight \u201cAwww\u201d escaped from Nel\u2019s lips; she could not help but wish she was just a bit bigger; she had been many times this size before! But, Nel thought as she cast about, this would do still nicely! Nel, the initial mood of surprised contemplation of herself, and herself in comparison to her surroundings, beginning to disperse and the almost petulant and impish feeling of glee at finding herself, once again, much bigger beginning to creep in, Nel heaved a huge breath and placed her hand on her giant hips, elbows turned out, and grinned, her vast bosom stuck out before her like the battlements of some castle. Moments later the trees in the gardens shook with a peal of laughter. Looking down at the servants, gardeners and domestic staff flitting across the lawns or into domiciles encircling the Palace, Nel could not help but laugh; she leaned forward, the better to see the ground, casting her shadow more darkly across the grounds: \u201cYeah\u201d, she boomed in jest, \u201cyou better run.\u201d Despite her efforts she could not see the Steward, who had no doubt scarpered before ever she outgrew the hall; Nel could not help but be slightly galled that she could not seize this opportunity to teach him a lesson in manners, now that she had tipped the scales in her favour. Nel cast about her again, looking out over the rooftops and steeples of the Palace, towards the grand hall, the pinnacle of the mage\u2019s tower, the bell tower atop the cathedral, which was just beginning to strike tea-time, and the gardens sprawling away into a thick wood which encompassed the Palace; Nel\u2019s carmine lips curled as smile creased her face again: \u201cYup, this is JUST what I needed!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A quarter past the stroke of six found Nel, now standing taller than the trees and better built than the Gothic masonry about her, skirting the Mages' Quarter of the Palace, a sort of labyrinth of vaulted buildings and spires, containing library upon library, vast lecture halls, vaults of arcana, artifacts, potions and useless junk. Even at her new size, the room at the top of the Mages\u2019 tower, which was central to the quarter and rose above it like a spearhead of turquoise and brass, and was where the Imperial Archmage resided, was still higher than Nel. Nel craned her neck and stood on her huge tiptoes to try and peek in through the many latticed windows that lines the upper tower, but to no avail. Nel had always wanted to attend the University here, but it was, to say the least, rather exclusive and was not easy for someone like her to gain entry\u2014 students were typically backed by wealthy financiers, be they parents or benevolent, philanthropic lords or ladies. Now Nel relished the opportunity to see the University, which was adjunct to the Palace, and to gain access to the University by the ever-so-slightly unorthodox route of straddling one of the buildings as it were a garden gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking her leg over the rooftops of the Mage\u2019s sleeping quarters, Nel stepped into the courtyard, taking with her a chimney stack from the dormitory. A tall tree in the courtyard gardens, wafting gently in the breeze, brush softly against Nel\u2019s thigh. Nel craned over out of curiosity to peer inside the dormitory windows, which seemed like a doll\u2019s house to her, and presenting to the upper floors of the University corridors, at the south wing of the courtyard, a marvelous eyeful of tremendous rump, the huge, white expanse of her rear seeming to swallow up the view from the high windows and, as Nel inspected more closely, threatened to bust the very facade of the building. In the dormitory, the pupils who had retired to their dormitories after dinner, were shocked when the windowpanes were suddenly filled by a great, green iris and pupil, peering in at them with apparent curiosity. From somewhere the young mages, some of whom had hidden in wardrobes or under their beds, heard a booming chirrup of laughter: \u201cHa! Boo!\u201d. Nel titled her head, the better to peer at the little figures inside the dormitories, who were skittering about like mice, panicked by something. Nel laughed again: \u201cMy teachers said I\u2019d never fit in at the Mage\u2019s school; Wow were they right! There\u2019s no way I\u2019d fit in THERE now!\u201d boomed Nel as she poked a windowpane gently with an outstretched finger. Her curiosity overcoming her, Nel prised up the roof to peek inside, coming away surprisingly easily, to a chorus of shrieks and yells, while Nel, instead marveled at her own strength. Inspecting the contents of the dormitory, Nel looked down upon the neat little rooms of the upper stories, arranged before her eyes like the compartments of a jewellry box: before her were little four-poster beds, some made and unmade, decked with blue curtains, and scarcely more substantial than a matchbox, and dark, wooden bookcases that reached to the ceiling, stuffed with books the names of which Nel could not distinguish at her size, and round, high-backed little armchairs, of blue leather, with bright dots of golden buttons, which looked very comfortable, except that Nel\u2019s rear would never have been accommodated by one of them, and delicate torch-brackets with flickering flames, and glossy armoires, and cute little, claw-footed bathtubs, in which a small bearded mage was frozen amidst a pile of bubbles, scrubbing brush poised under an arm, and long indigo curtains which billowed as Nel drew breath, and the large footlockers, or trunks, at the foot of each bed, which, when Nel picked one up to inspect it, rattled like a box of pins. Nel dropped the trunk back into the room as delicately as she could and let the roof down again, letting it go with a crash. Nel straightened back up to her full height, hands placed on the small of her back do that her huge chest thrust even further outwards as she stretched, her eyes scanning the rooftops of the University. <br>\r\n *<br>\r\nThe Imperial Archmage, a Professor and Magister for come fifty years now, a certain Algernon Charles Loyola, had retired to his quarters, in the high, glass-windowed chamber at the top of the Mages\u2019 tower, after a hearty dinner in the refectory, where he had indulged himself in a nap before the evening\u2019s course of work: a night of poring over tomes, translating antique texts, examining the skies, copying out passages, watching alembics, writing letters, feeding the owl, napping at his desk, finishing his yet unfinished book on volatile magics and his memoirs, napping some more, combing his white beard (which long ago more or less eclipsed any view of his torso), shouting at young mages who had been partying in the courtyard form one of the windows, staring at the ceiling in rapt concentration, napping in his chair, reading letters from his associates in the guild of Mages in other provinces, pretending to read letters from his associates in the guild of Mages, poking at the fire, browsing the many cabinets of books that lined the room, napping, walking up and down the floorboards in the twilight, and occasionally just looking out over the spires of the University in calm contemplation. It was to this last activity that the Archmage now sought to apply himself, waking from his nap, for his old age had made him increasingly thoughtful as the years passed, he had always been somewhat zany and this had not been lessened by the advancing of time. On this evening the Archmage crossed the dark, hard wooden boards of the floor to the window. Drawing open the rich, blue curtains by the golden cord, the Archmage looked out into the crepuscular light. Today though, instead of being drawn to the fading light, turning the hills beyond violet and the trees of the forests black, his eyes were inextricably drawn to the University rooftops and the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite apart from the tall tree by the cloisters, a tree he remembered as a young student, whose leaves were now touched with the orange light of the evening and blowing gently in the breeze, the Archmage was shocked to find himself looking down at an enormous pair of buttocks upended in the courtyard, jutting up many feet into the air, like a great, white peach! Taking off his glasses and rubbing the sleep from his eyes with a finger and the heel of his thumb, inspecting the lenses of his glasses, blowing on them to fog said lenses, polishing them on the sleeves of his robe while glancing calmly about the room, and finally returning them to balance atop his nose, the Archmage looked again. But, yes, it was unmistakable, that was a colossal rump, even down to the freckle on the left cheek. Indeed the huge buttocks, seeming like the moon as they caught the evening light coming across the rooftops, waggled back and forth as if to emphasise their, admittedly quite significant, impression. Of all the things to happen around the University during his incumbency as Archmage this was arguable one of the stranger ones, certainly ranking alongside the time the bins came to life and tried to swallow the janitor or the time the aedificium had been upturned to balance precariously on its spire. And as the Archmage looked from his tower her saw the buttocks generate the huge trunk of a torso and broad, broad shoulders, about which fell a curtain of blue hair, crowning a huge equally huge head, which meant the figure, the one who owned such broad shoulders, powerful ribcage and ample buttocks, came some way up the height of the tower! It seemed like small comfort really that the giant girl, for as the figure turned in the warm sunlight and presented something of a profile there could be no doubt that it was feminine ( as if the wide flair of the buttocks and hips were not clue enough), was not big enough that the Archmage was looking out at her giant eyes or the wall of her blue hair, but was instead looking down at her towering over the rooftops below. As he watched the figure make her way to the aedificium, in long, booming footfalls, several questions surfaced in the Archmage\u2019s mind: first, where had this giant maiden come from? Second, what on earth had caused her to grow to such proportions? Third, what was she doing here, at the University? Fourth, who was this girl? Fifth, admittedly quite irrelevantly, what were her measurements? For it was a wonder the girl remained upright! Sixth, and most importantly, what ought he to do? The Archmage sighed wearily\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was attempting to peer through a round, ocular stained glass window, which an ordinary person would never have been able to dream of doing, to see inside the University\u2019s large aedificium which housed the labyrinthine vast arcane library of books, tomes, spellbooks, grimoires, cabalistic texts, scrolls, octavos, scholarly works, manuscripts, papyruses, and many other texts, and to which people, even mages, were allowed only very restricted access; such a place, naturally, piqued Nel\u2019s curiosity. The interior seemed to Nel like looking into a kaleidoscope, but she felt she could almost distinguish row upon contorted row of bookcases. Nel tilted her head to exclude the light, the better to see inside, but her nosiness was suddenly curbed when she felt a sharp and frightful pain in her buttock, as if she had been pricked hard with a drawing pin or bitten by some large, flying insect. Clapping a huge hand over the stricken cheek, Nel lept up with a yelp: OW! Casting about Nel scowled: What was that!? She boomed. She was conscious of a bright object like a spark before another such pain afflicted her cheek. OWCH! Who was that!? Nel\u2019s eyes flicked upwards to see the small, white and blue figure atop the tower, beard fluttering in the breeze. Nel drew herself up, thrusting her chest out: OH! THAT was a BIG mistake beardy!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The evening sun was setting as Nel, a strange sight at several stories tall, rubbed her cheek, where a red mark and a smarting had been left by a bolt of magic, flung by the Archmage atop his tower.  Before Nel could react further, another bolt whistled down from the heights, striking her on the chin. Nel yelped and flailed a little before composing herself, only to clench her fists, grit her teeth and snort through her nose like a vituperative dragon. \u201cThat HURTS! Stop that you little\u2014\u201d, boomed Nel, only to be interrupted by another flying spark, \u201cOWCH!\u201d Nel took a booming step backwards, almost unbalancing for a moment, for she was still not entirely adjusted to her new size, neither to the weight of her immense, wibbling bust nor to teetering atop her cumbersome and treetrunk tall legs. Regaining her balance, Nel glared up at the tower and the figure at its top. Nel stamped her foot, blocking another bolt flung down from the tower with her hand, and stormed towards the tower with large, thunderous footfalls. Reaching the tower, the next volley of bolts landing on her hair, and therefore of little concern to her, Nel stood on tiptoes and attempted to reach the ringed balcony on which the Archmage was standing. But, must to her dismay, it was out of her reach, even at this size! Nel\u2019s outstretched finger was pricked by a shard from the Archmage and she hastily withdrew it with a yelp, sucking her finger and thumping the tower with her other hand. With climbing out of the question, next Nel tried planting her hands against the tower and attempted to push the tower over! But, much to Nel\u2019s frustration, the tower had been standing for centuries for good reason and she could not budge it, at least not by pushing. As Nel fumed and thought of a new course of action, a fireball came sizzling down from above and caught her upper arm. Nel clapped her hand over the singed area and glared up at the balcony: if only she could have a nice, juicy growth spurt about now. But, despite Nel\u2019s rage, no sudden surge came. She looked down about her for something to use, arm still wound around her body, tucked under her bosom. Nel, seeing no other option, slammed the girth of her hip into the tower, shaking it as if a battering ram had collided with it. Satisfied with the results, Nel could not help but laugh triumphantly and swing her hips into the tower again, sending a ripple through her buttocks and sending a few slates from the spiretop sliding down. Nel slid a huge hand down the curve of her bulwark hips and eyed the tower thoughtfully for a moment. Biting her lip, she gave her ass cheek a slap with a sound like a peal of lightning before gleefully swinging her hips into the tower again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archmage, standing atop the tower, nearly lost his footing as the giant pixie thumped herself into the foundations, having to steady himself on the balustrade to prevent from falling. Scarcely had he had time to stabilise himself than another huge thud shook the tower. Clutching the dark wooden balustrade, the archmage looked over the parapet. He could only distinguish, for all the shaking, the girl\u2019s mass of blue hair, her pointed ears, expansive shoulders and, he glimpsed with a feeling that made him feel a profound sense of vertigo, the black chasm as cleavage. Swinging back from the parapet, the Archmage thought frantically. Thinking for only a moment longer, as the tower was convulsed by another shudder from the pixie\u2019s monstrous rear, the Archmage threw back his long sleeves and threw forth from his fingertips a plume of blue smoke, which travelled up over the parapet and resolved itself into a cloud, floating above Nel\u2019s big, blue head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was stopped in her battering of the tower\u2019s foundations for a moment, feeling a light sprinkling on her head. Nel looked up at the cloud and it\u2019s fine veil of drizzle falling. As droplets pooled on her cheeks, Nel let out a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019ll take a bit more than a little rain to stop me little guy!\u201d Nel wiped her cheeks and ran her hands through her hair: \u201cBut thanks all the same! I was getting a bit sweaty from all this effort!\u201d Nel dusted her left buttock for an instant, before bunching up her hands and resuming her demolition, rain still lightly falling on her head. Such was Nel\u2019s absorption in the task of levelling the Archmage\u2019s tower with her wrecking-ball hips that she failed to clock the cloud above her suddenly start to flush purple and to swell. As Nel drew back for another thunderous hip-bump she was suddenly convulsed by the most horrific jolt, which shot through her body in a wave of agonising pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel lurched backwards, her huge arms flailing and her huge feet shaking the courtyard and turning up paving stones in a series of staccato, thunderous booms. Just what gave Nel such an advantage over everyone, her by now prodigious size, was fast beginning to hamper Nel, no longer used to the bulk of her bosom, hips and limbs. Just as Nel had almost managed to compose herself, her huge breasts seeming to lag just a little bit behind the rest of her as they bounced back into place, she looked up in time to catch another bolt from the tower\u2019s top, this time catching her on her cheek. Nel yelped and stumbled backwards again, almost tripping over the oak tree that grew in the courtyard. \u201cHey!\u201d Nell thundered, clutching her cheek and stamping a foot, \u201cNo fair!\u201d But suddenly, even as she said this, Nel felt a gurgling in her stomach; clutching her stomach, Nel briefly looked down and then back up at the tower. \u201cOh you\u2019re for it now beardy!\u201d Nel felt the rumblings in her gut intensify, fuel by her rage. Nel felt the familiar swell of her stomach, bulging out as if a weather balloon were being inflated, and grinned as she felt the sensation subside and seem to travel up and up through her monolithic frame. Nel fixed her gaze at the tower\u2019s spire, as if she intended not just to attain its height but soon thereafter to pick her teeth with it! Nel braced herself, the feeling swelling inside her, still rising upwards and upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Nel\u2019s body seemed to shake with the force of a belch; nothing more. In the pause that followed all that could be heard was the wind soughing in the tree and sound of crows cawing and taking wing in some far-off field. Nel only had time to frown down at her huge but ungrowing trunk before the Archmage, recovering faster from the thunderous eruption faster than Nel herself, sent flying from the tower\u2019s top a gusting flurry of snow and sleet, which drove into Nel\u2019s face, cramming her nostrils and blinding her eyes. Nel flailed backwards once more, trying to shield her face and claw the snow from her eyes, thundering across the cobbles and flagstones of the courtyard. So bewildered was she, so unused to the ponderous bulk of her own body, so unused to the potential obstacles architecture might cause her, that Nel blundered into the cloisters partitioning the west courtyard of the mage\u2019s university from the east. Nel\u2019s foot caught on the machicolated masonry and, with a yelp, the giant pixie was sent flying across the courtyard, her shadow passing over the students fleeing her like that of an aeroplane; stumbling off the grass in the eastern courtyard, Nel almost regained her composure, but her huge, ungainly body bore her on as she flailed her arms, only to plunge headfirst into the vast and imposing walls of the aedificium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top of the spire, the Archmage sighed with relief. Crossing the circular walkway of the tower, he looked down over the wooden railing at the eastern courtyard. The huge, blue-haired pixie had crashed through the facade of the aedificium, housing the mage\u2019s labyrinthine magical library; there now protruded from the hole in that facade, amidst the still settling clouds of grey mortar and dust, the trunks of two long legs and a pair of huge buttocks powdered with broken masonry, while the rest of the giant pixie, it was to be assumed, had crashed into the atrium of the library, where she was either unconscious, stunned or stuck. The Archmage leaned on the railing, as if contemplating the huge legs and rump of the girl, which stuck out from the aedificium like a branch of coral, or as if a smooth, white meteor has struck earth and lay there smoking. He was lost in thought, twisting her beard around a finger, as the apprentices began to emerge tentatively from the sheltered cloisters. What an awful mess... Oh well, all in a day's work as Archmage!...Still not the strangest thing to have happened at the university... He was just about to return to bed and let the Empress and others deal with the giant young lady when he was distracted by something....</span></div></div>",

The dust of ages and the pulverized walls tickled in her nose and she felt the uncontrollable urge to sneeze, despite the fact the unbridled landing on her enormous chest had forced all oxygen from her lungs. Dizzily the gargantuan pixie blinked, hoping to regain her orientation. She gulped, she was pretty sure she had swallowed something, when she realized a familiar sensation spreading through her large body. <br>\r\nNel felt the first little rush of warmth, the spreading pins and needles. Feeling it spreading through her whole body, becoming more and more intense \u2013 especially in the ample swell of her bosom and the velvet folds of her womanhood, the sensation increased with every passing second. Nel opened her mouth with a thunderous sigh of satisfaction, and started to massage the sides of her abundant breasts with her huge hands, carelessly carving through the stone walls in her way.<br>\r\nThree seconds in, the blue-haired pixie could tell this spurt was going to be a big one.<br>\r\nShe felt a long, sweltering swell that made her almost pass out in pleasure, filling her gigantic body with molten pleasure until I felt I would burst. The pressure built and built, until finally, it could only burst. With a cracked cry of delight Nel once again began to grow...surging, swelling larger, while her body quivered with an earthquake of pleasure. Unable to constrain herself any longer Nel reached her huge hand down toward her crotch and to finger herself. Quickly her head broke through the back-wall, while growing breasts and torso filled the building more and more.<br>\r\nThe arch-mage was still assessing the damage, when he heard a new crashing sound. Far below the sculpted, one-story thick legs of the gargantuan pixie were ploughing across the courtyard, easily smashing aside or flattening any objects in their way. She was growing!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nFrom the top of the Mage\u2019s spire, the Archmage could not help but gawk down at the scene unfolding in the courtyard outside the library. Having toppled the giant, blue-haired pixie that had suddenly intruded upon the cloisters, sending her tumbling backwards with a flurry of spells, things had taken on a new, more perplexing aspect. One would not have thought that things could become much worse, but shortly after tumbling headlong through the edifice of the Mage library, something the Archmage had felt some regret about but chiefly owing to the work that would be involved in repairing the masonry and reorganising the strewn books, the giant pixie\u2019s legs, which had hung limply out of the library like wilted petals, had begun to suddenly snake their way across the cobbles on the courtyard!  As they did this, the flesh of these already impressively long limbs grew thicker and rounder as if watching the trunks of oak trees across many, many years. The Archmage had been about to repair to his chambers, where he intended to arrange for the restraint and containment of the giant young pixie while the Empress passed her verdict, when he noticed this unexpected development. Indeed, noticing this, the Archmage could see that as these legs thickened they seeming to flow away from the base of the giant pixie\u2019s huge arse, which was lodged uncomfortably in the hole her body had made in the library, flowing down into and across the courtyard like streams of white milk. And as his gaze followed the legs up to the those fleshy cheeks stuck in the masonry, like some great cloven cheese, he could easily discern them seeming to undulate and bulge, protruding more and more from the architecture! Looking down from the spire, the Archmage could only watch those cheeks swell and fatten, seeming, as they definitely grew larger, to pitch towards him like a moon crashing to earth or, he reflected, like puffball mushroom growing so rampantly in meadow that its bulk had split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/301608596084-0-1/s-l1000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/3016085960...</a></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something mesmeric to the experience, terrible though it was, for what man of letters could not appreciate orbs of such smooth beauty? Or appreciate the appropriateness that a little knowledge was a dangerous thing? For it had become clear that the magic housed in that labyrinthine library, in the form of its many magical books, tomes, grimoires and octavos, was having some terrible effect on the young, albeit tall, lady he had sent collapsing upon the library. She must, the Archmage reasoned, have received some terrific dose of magic, available to her only because of her great size, for ordinary pixies would never have been able to swallow whole one book, let alone many. What was worse, and though deducible from the Archmage's vantage, though not necessarily appreciable, was that, as Nel\u2019s legs lengthened and her arse swelled, the rest of her, inside the vault of the library, amongst the veritable vortex of bookcases, was also growing! The result of this was not only that she gradually ate up more and more space, causing more and more damage but that her body lengthened, plunging further into the library. Because of the angle at which she had \u201centered\u201d the library, by the unconventional new entrance, Nel lay cushioned by her huge chest, her face upon the cold floor; now, as she grew, her lengthening spire pushed Nel deeper into the library, pushing her huge face along the floor, knocking over bookshelves and driving drifts of papers and books before her. And, as she gritted her teeth in pain, occasionally snatching deep breaths or sharp gasps and yelps, Nel in turn occasionally swallowed more books, spluttering as she did so. It was not long before Nel had grow so much that her shoulders were straining against the inner walls and her head was piling up uncomfortably against the rear wall, her neck bent at an awkward angle, as she continued to grow, her body bent, twisting and crumpling up inside the library like a carpet gathered into bundles by careless feet. By this time, of course, the discomfort and pain had taken on a slightly different tenor and the muffled gasps and yelps that echoes out onto the courtyard were now mixed with those of pleasure, a rare, self-centred pleasure that one derives from find oneself improving, becoming larger, more beautiful still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was not quite appreciable from the Mage\u2019s spire, what was not immediately obvious to Nel, so squashed was she in the confines of the library, was the other changes being wrought on her body during all this. The Archmage, however, was able to see these particular changes. As those long legs stretched and the meaty buttocks swelled, the Archmage saw the bales of white flesh begin to change in colour, as if a cloud were passing over the face of the moon, or oil were darkening the waters of a lake. This began in patches across the giant pixie\u2019s skin, patches here and there on her calves and thighs, a large patch on her left buttock, but some these quickly grew as if the soft, fragrant flesh were being eaten away, leaving her skin mottled with a dusky turquoise, such as you might see in the clouds in the night sky. These grew until the pixie\u2019s body was adorned with large patches of this colouring, collaged with those of her pale white flesh, which seemed to have grown more pearly by contrast, so much so that her left leg and buttocks were all but covered by this colouration, as if it were slicked with a clinging, tarry film or she had grown a second skin, while the great trunk of the right leg and a slice of the right ass-cheek were for the most part the ivory white flesh of before, save for some dark mottling. These patches of dark colouration even seemed, the Archmage could see, to fulminate and ripple like stormclouds on the giant pixie\u2019s very skin. Another change came soon thereafter, aside from the eruption of the mysterious patches of dark turquoise, hither and thither, heedless of new skin or old, there broke out lines and traceries of vibrant sea-green runes, which would intermittently flare up and recede, only to refulge again, seeming to incise themselves in fiery, green-blue lines and filigrees upon her powerful legs or upon her huge ass. These runes, thin and delicate to the eye, at first glance looked like the giant pixie\u2019s veins expanding in a pulsing network beneath the surface of the skin, and indeed seemed to slip and shift beneath her almost translucent, white skin like jellyfish floating and drifting just below the surface of the sea. As she continued to grow, some of these lines seemed to knit together and encircle the huge fleshy limbs in rings of sea-green, where the now glowed strongly, while others continued to pulse, float and fade across the giant pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ak6.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/25433645/thumb/9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://ak6.picdn.net/shutterstock/video...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time most of these changes had taken place, and really it had only taken several minutes for all this to elapse, so violent and sudden a reaction was taking place, Nel had already grown substantially larger and it was with a look of horror that the Archmage had to watch the library wall, increasingly overburdened by the swelling cheeks and hips, which now bulged out absurdly from the hole through which the pixie\u2019s upper half had entered, as if a hot air balloon were being prepared for flight inside, as it began to buckle and sag. Even as he watched, the great bulk of the young lady\u2019s hips and buttocks drooped more and more from the library, like a huge pear ripening and fattening, drawing closer to the ground as the giant, tree-trunk legs bent at the knee, spanning the courtyard, and the hole in the library\u2019s edifice was made wider still of flaring hips and a growing waist-line! Not long had to then elapse before the giant girl\u2019s haunches met the stones as the wall gave way beneath her, leaving her torso, head and arms for the most part still inside, as if stuck in a rabbit\u2019s burrow. At this same time, the terrible growth spurt and transformation she had undergone tapered off and abated. The dust had not had the chance to settle when the Archmage saw the huge haunches he had just watched grow more huge brace themselves as the giant pixie prepared to extricate herself from the library. Gradually, and in clouds of crumbling masonry and dust, the giant blue-haired pixie withdrew herself from the library, revealing by degrees the great column of her spine, which had also become covered with that murky colouration and traced over by the runes, her great, wide shoulders as they took with them a greater portion of the library\u2019s facade, in no small part because the tremendous bulk and volume of her breasts would simply not have allowed her otherwise as they too emerged from the library, half-cleaved like double moons by dark-turquoise and creamy white, and finally the great monument of blue hair crowning it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, no, not blue. It was at this point, in case it was ever doubted, that the Archmage realised the extent of the young lady\u2019s transformation, beyond gaining more prodigious size, for her hair, beforehand a royal blue, had grown like molten rock, flowing like lava around her huge face! The Archmage was dumbfounded at the effect the mage had taken on the young girl as she drew herself up and up and <b>UP</b>, rising on her immense legs to now tower over the spire, which now, where previously it had risen above her head, now could only graze her hipline or maybe her navel. From the balcony the Archmage could see the giant pixie dusting off her transformed body and inspecting her limbs and curves with a mixture of shock and curiosity. It was not long before a wide smile broke out across her face and her gaze shifted from her arm down the Mage\u2019s spire. \u201c<b>OH</b>!\u201d Nel boomed, with an air of delight and amusement, \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble <b>NOW</b>!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Kassandra had appointed Nel and Clare to positions as personal servants at the court - as much a protective measure as a gesture of reconciliation. After all Clare and Nel had wreaked havoc as giantesses and Kassandra was pretty sure, there were quite a lot of pixies filled by spirit of vindictiveness, who wouldn't accept their readmission into the citizenship of the pixie kingdom and demand a gruesome punishment. They might felt betrayed by Kassandra's benevolence and feel prompted to take 'justice' into their own hands. Nel and Clare had been awfully quite during the journey, both didn't speak about it, but the loss of their towering size was actually more bothering them than they liked to admit. Despite the damage they had caused, the loss of the feeling of pure unadulterated growth combined with indescribable pleasure and the fulfilment of all their sexual urges weighted heavy on their hearts. They were unarguably still tall for pixies, their bodies drop-dead gorgeous, but they were pixies again, no longer titans, who dwarfed even mountain ridges. Kassandra heard their soft moans, when they comforted each other in the nights, their libido still increased far beyond normal measure. Not willing to waste time, Kassandra sent out her most elite guards under the command of the legendary heroine Athenia, to retrieve the remains of the portions from the ruins of Clare\u2019s former homestead. Obeying without questions, they fulfilled the mission and the potions were locked in the deepest vaults of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare sighed deeply and continued to clean the room. It has been a hard day so far and she longed for the end of the day, when she finally would fell asleep in Nel\u2019s gentle embrace, the abundance of their naked, ample bosoms pressed against each other, their nakedness only covered by one of the velvet palace blankets. While the feeling of nausea and vertigo, which had plagued both of them after shrinking back to pixie size had finally abated, their libido was more active than ever. Occasionally they even met in secrecy during their shifts to make love, unable to constrain themselves any longer.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Silently taunting Clare cleared the personal arms displayed on the side wall of the throne room. One of the servants had considered himself witty and funny and had replaced her maiden outfit by a distinctively smaller one. Not the first time one of the other servants granted her this kind of unwanted attention. Some were very kind to Nel and her, others openly despised them and only hold back because she wouldn\u2019t disobey one of Kassandra\u2019s royal decrees. Unwilling to risk the major-domo\u2019s wrath, he was obsessed with timeliness, Clare had abolished the thought of getting a new one and chosen punctuality above modesty. Her outfit revealed far more skin than it was prudent. She pretended being unaware, that her top, though still valiantly wrapped around her generous curves, left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Her skirt was so tight that it made it look as if her butt was covered not by fabric, but by a layer of black, glossy paint; barely long enough to cover up the swell of her ass, it revealed her endless long, exquisitely toned and shapely legs in all their glory. The lining was so tight, it knitted her panty to something more akin to a thong, which buried deep in her crotch and wasn\u2019t exactly helpful for someone, who was desperately trying suppress an overly active libido. Luckily today most of her tasks had been connected to work in rather less frequented rooms and even the throne room was deserted at the moment. Clenching her teeth, Clare swore vengeance to anonymous prankster. She was quite sure she could hear an occasional giggle and aroused deep breaths in the distance and behind the walls were the servants\u2019 passages were hidden. They shouldn\u2019t overdo it. By now Nel and Clare had discovered that they not only were extraordinarily beautiful and tall, additionally they were a lot stronger than they looked, even as fit and toned as they were. A fact that made Kassandra thinking about transferring them to the royal guard, after the public wrath had calmed down a bit. Approaching one of the hidden entries, she listened attentively, catching one of the voyeurs and beating him up, would sent a message \u2013 but more likely only get Clare in trouble, when her tormentors would frame her wrong evidence. Instead of hushed whisper she actually heard booming steps in front of the main entrance, approaching the room. Twice as motivated as usual, after all Clare sincerely wanted to repay Kassandra for her generosity by fulfilling her duties accurate and diligently, Clare backed into the passage. Servants had to be invisible in the official rooms, especially when their wardrobe was rather inappropriate. The massive, heavily ornamented, wooden door of the throne room flung open, split-seconds after she had closed the door. Almost holding her breath, she peered through a hidden spyhole.<br>\r\nThree pixies entered the room, among them the only two pixies taller than Clare and Nel throughout the kingdom: Kassandra and step-sister Brenna, nicknamed the raven, because of her straight black hair, cascading down her back, its hair-ends even covering most of the generous swell of her perfect butt. Only surpassed by her step-sister Kassandra in height, Brenna measured two-foot-seven, with a body to shame any but the most beautiful and sculpted of pixies. The princess was so attractive that it made ones knees rubbery just to glance at her, her beauty further emphasized by her impressive size. Her angular, delicate and almost best described as angelic face, usually displayed a dismissive smirk, while the colour of her large eyes matched her hair. It was such a dark brown, her iris almost seemed to be black like her pupils. Brenna radiated a certain unique exoticness, through the combination of almost impenetrable darkness and brilliant brightness. emphasised her rather dark appearance, the pixie princess\u2019 appearance was defined by the combination of this contrast. While her hair and eyes were dark, Brenna\u2019s skin was pale, its colour was something reminiscent of finest marble. Typically, she wore elegant long black dresses, that emphasised this contrast even more and showed of her breath-taking body, with perfect hour-glass curves. Clare couldn\u2019t help but staring at the creamy white abundance of Brenna\u2019s colossal tear-drop breasts, straining the corsage of the princess\u2019 dress, swaying gently with each of her gracious steps. Brenna\u2019s beauty was flawless, suitors for her hand arrived from all pixie kingdoms around the world, just to be rejected. But actually some of them were relived, when they left the court. While there was no flaw in her looks, the princess had a rather \u2018special\u2019 character. Brenna was charismatic, stunningly intelligent and smart witted. But all her good qualities gave her one hell of an inflated ego. Short tempered, dominant and sometimes distinctively cold-hearted she made sure only few people at court searched for her company. Most pixies in the kingdom were quite relieved that Kassandra was the legal heiress of the throne. A point of view, Brenna definitely didn\u2019t share. Glad that most underlings and nobles avoided her presence, she caused some rumours by building an own palace guard, some members with a shady reputation. Like the brutish pixie walking next to her.<br>\r\nRulana was extremely musclebound for a pixie, the proportions of her bulging body almost passed beyond 'ideal' and into the realm of 'impossible.', making her the most massive muscled pixie in history. Lack of discipline and respect and several charges concerning corruption and pub-brawls had earned her the dismissal from the palace guard. She had disobeyed superiors and skipped every drill, stating she was the strongest pixie around in no need for orders from wimps and useless exercises. To her own shame Athenia had beaten her in a following duel, easily compensating Rulana\u2019s greater strength wit speed, skill and determination. Bruised and shamed, Rulana had yielded. Only days later Brenna had appointed her to the position of her first bodyguard, much to the dismay of the court advisors and the queen herself. Rumours spread the princess and her hulking guard were sharing the bed at night, but no one dared to accuse them openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m right, sister! Why don\u2019t you stop denying it!\u201d, Brenna said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no trace of the usual warmth in Kassandra\u2019s voice, when she answered. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of discussing it \u2013 over and over and over again! The remains of potions are too dangerous to be researched by our alchemist! They shall be kept under lock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenna stepped forward, her face only inches from her sisters\u2019: \u201cYour ignorance will cost us dearly! You see danger, I see opportunity! We must understand, what has happened\u2026 Maybe we could use it for good! Think of the Manticore-attack 300 years ago, or if you are not interested in history, about the damage your new pets caused! We pixies limit ourselves without reason, making us willing prey for the predators that stalk our lands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare cowered in her hiding place. She wished to be elsewhere, anywhere but here. A dispute between the princess and her sister the queen was never good news \u2013 witnessing it even less so. The battle of the words continued, ending with Brenna turning on her heels and hurrying out of the throne room, Kassandra\u2019s voice accompanying her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe vault remains sealed and guarded! No one \u2013 not even you, sister \u2013 will be allowed to enter it! Anyone daring to ignore the royal decree will be seen as traitor and therefore be executed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall see, sis! We shall see, sis!\u201d, the pale princess murmured so silently no one, not even Rulana, who was struggling to keep her pace, was able to hear it.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kassandra, Queen of the Pixies, was an imposing figure even at Nel's massive size. The pixie queen was the tallest in the whole city at 2'8\" with awed whispers amongst the populace that her raw magic potential was responsible for her impressive size. Rumours of a more jealous or malicious nature opinionated that the queen had specifically sought out a spell to grant her her size and had kept the whole population's height suppressed at the same time, though these were few and far between given how much she was loved and respected amongst her people. Nel also loved her leader very much, to the point where she had a bit of a crush on the impressive pixie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen now hovered directly in front of Nel's face, her waist-length fiery red hair gently rippling in the breeze while her bright silver eyes gazed into Nel's accusingly. Her arms were folded over her ample chest, her legs bent slightly at the knees to keep her form-fitting dress from revealing too much to the frightened pixies below. She wore a dazzlingly white garment that clung to her impressive curves, vines and leaves embroidered with gold leaf and fastened from her stomach up to her collar with small gold clasps also fashioned into the likeness of leaves. One might refer to her as a statuesque stunner, a woman of ample height and curves that most definitely drew attention. Her guards had withdrawn from the two giant ladies, standing at attention in the air surrounding them, awaiting their next command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Nel,\" Kassandra said slowly, unfolding her arms and pointing the gold wand of her office at Nel's enormous face. \"Don't lie to me. How did you become so large?\" Kassandra's eyes flicked across the ground far below, spotting the ruptured pipe now empty of its previous payload, and her eyes narrowing as they returned to Nel's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's face flushed but her determination won out against her better judgement, her face scrunching into a stubborn pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" She folded her own arms across her heaving bosom. \"It just happened out of the blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah!\" Clare agreed, slightly muffled by Nel's bulk. \"We don't know what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be quiet, Clare. I'll get to you in good time. Well, if you won't tell me, Nel Nightfall, I'll have to draw it out of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen thoughtfully tapped her wand against her chin, studying Nel's face as her expression melted into one of mild anxiety. Kassandra's mouth slowly drew into a smirk. Before Nel could react the queen flitted up to the giantess's nose and with a flourish produced a handful of gold dust that she promptly cast inside one of her nostrils. Nel instinctively sniffed and her huge eyes widened as she felt the tickling in her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh no,\" she breathed before unleashing a sneeze, Kassandra quickly dodging upwards to avoid the hurricane blast of wind that toppled one of the buildings that hadn't quite been destroyed yet. The air was tinted a mild purple and the queen smirked knowingly as she slowly descended back into Nel's field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're bloated on raw magic gas,\" she stated. \"Goodness only knows how much you inhaled to get that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked down at the ground sheepishly, avoiding the queen's stern gaze, her cheeks blushing a deep red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kassandra sighed. \"I do believe you about intending to stop Clare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flitted down toward the slightly smaller pixie, hovering over her face that was just visible from underneath Nel's ample buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, young lady, are in big trouble,\" The red-head said sternly, gracefully settling on Clare's chin. \"You ate one of the guard's, as I understand it, which fueled your most recent spurt. I'll be able to restore him later on, but we'll definitely have to have a word once you're back to normal. Now, open your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare glowered and clenched her lips tight, shaking her head as much as she could. The queen frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Have it your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra chanted a few words of power under her breath and pointed her wand at Clare's mouth, which glowed with a pale light before being forced open, a groan rumbling from Clare's throat. The queen strolled over to the vast canyon of flesh and saliva and slowly leaned in, delicately sniffing at the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. As I suspected, your initial growth was fueled by a distinct cocktail of elixirs. I'll have to have my alchemist make a note of this particularly volatile reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the pixies flitted back up into the air and released the spell on Clare's mouth, the young pixie closing it with a small whimper of resignation. Kassandra hovered high up in the air for several minutes, contemplating her next move as she gazed at the swollen forms of the giant pixies below her. Her face was an unreadable mask, though her mind was working furiously, and there was an undercurrent of excitement running through her mind that she had not felt in quite some time. The reserves of raw magical power both of the girls now held was enormous and Kassandra was awed at the power she could feel emanating from them, physical as well as magical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made my decision,\" she announced, drawing the attention of her guards. \"I shall have to use a spell of transference to absorb the magical energies from both pixies into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard captain, a stocky young pixie by the name of Geoffrey, was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Your Highness, won't that simply transfer their combined size to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel thought she saw a flicker of excitement flash across Kassandra's face but it went so fast she couldn't be sure. The queen looked at the captain with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, Geoffrey. I will be able to suppress and contain it. Once I have extracted it all I can transfer it into some of our crystals at the castle for storage. Now, this will weaken me considerably, so I will may need your assistance to move once it is complete. Please be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain nodded and the queen flitted to Nel's forehead, chanting under her breath as she drew a ward on her skin that glowed with a pale gold light once it was complete. Kassandra did the same on Clare's forehead before flying over to the middle of the destroyed buildings, now a wide open space of flat ground covered in rubble. She gripped her wand horizontally with both hands, took a deep breath and began to chant the complicated spell. Nel felt the words of power resonate with her ward and soon, starting out slowly but increasing in speed as the incantation continued, felt the magic being drawn directly out of her body. She sighed involuntarily as her body gently shrunk, Clare's doing the same, as pale tendrils of golden light fluttered across the air and connected with Kassandra, pulsing with flashes of light as the energy was transferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra gasped as she felt the vast reserves of power flow into her, causing sweat to bead on her ruffled forehead and her heart to beat harder with excitement. She took a deep breath as she continued the spell, mentally suppressing the energy as it flowed into her and storing it deep within her being. As the energy continued to flow Kassandra was unable to entirely contain it and she groaned quietly as her body swelled a little larger, her dress gently caressing her skin as it became a little tighter, small gaps forming between the clasps at the front especially across her bulging breasts. Near the end of the incantation her body swelled again, growing another two inches at the protest of her dress, the hem now four inches above her ankles and clutching her curves far closer than before, her overall height now cresting 3 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen fell to her knees as the spell finished, Nel and Claire now restored, panting heavily and sweat dripping from her face onto the ground. The guards approached cautiously as Kassandra slowly climbed to her feet, heaving a sigh that strained her golden clasps and looking behind her as she felt her underwear dig into her slightly swollen hips and backside. She returned her attention to the guard captain as he approached...</span></div></div>",

They stopped as she turned to look at them and gasped, gently resting a hand on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...your Highness?\" The captain asked, taking a slow step back as Kassandra's body emitted a loud rumble from deep within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra closed her eyes, lightly furrowing her sweat-soaked brow as she concentrated to bring the energy under control. A small grunt escaped her lips as she gently grew another inch in height, the golden clasps on her dress creaking softly, before the rumbling subsided and the queen's expression slowly softened. Geoffey breathed a sigh of relief as the fiery leader of the pixies opened her eyes and smiled a little weakly at her guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All under control, captain. Now, kindly restrain our two young friends,\" Kassandra said, gesturing to the forlorn-looking naked girls nearby. \"And bring them to the palace. Oh, and I will require aid to fly there myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey nodded and motioned to two of his men, who stepped forward proudly and each gripped their queen under her arms. The remaining guards surrounded the newly-shrunken pixie girls and fastened restraints that kept their wings flat against their back and tied their hands together, to prevent assault and escape. Nel was downcast and sad, reduced to her former four-inch height, while Clare's eyes burned with anger. Once they were ready the group took off with their escort, flying out of Nel's home village and heading through the forest toward the pixie city further in. Kassandra turned her head to observe Nel as they flew and her expression softened with sympathy as she studied the poor girl, her eyes wet with tears of anxiety and hopelessness. Maybe there was something she could do to help the young pixie with her size problem. The queen's expression hardened as she turned a little further to observe Clare, the larger pixie's eyes focused on the ground but her expression a stony mask of resentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>That one requires some firm discipline,</i>' she thought. '<i>I shall have to come up with a suitable punishment for her.</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey took less than an hour and they soon flew over and through the pixie capital in the area, buildings of various heights scattered through a tightly-packed path of trees. The elevation from the ground provided safety and decent lookouts and the trees also made good cover from above and below. The residents of the magical city flitted about the buildings, going on with their day-to-day lives, those able to spot the convoy hurriedly making way and bowing to their leader. After crossing the city they arrived at the royal palace, nestled into the largest tree of the area with the building itself inside the plant. Legend had it that the very first pixie queen used her magic to sing to the tree and shape it into the royal residence, also making it the very first pixie building in this area. This was the line from which Kassandra descended, one that had always been steeped in magic. The pixies from the royal line always had the most magical potential and as a direct consequence were often the tallest. Kassandra was the tallest in several generations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards set their queen down ever so gently on the designated landing area in front of the main doors of the palace and the two prisoners were also deposited, not quite as gently. Nel and Clare were hoisted to their feet and directed to move inside while Kassandra followed them, straightening her struggling dress as she walked. Her cheeks blushed every so slightly as she found she enjoyed the sensation of her garments hugging and gently tugging at her body, though she swiftly banished such thoughts and her face changed to a stern expression once more. Geoffrey tried his hardest not to gape at his queen's larger backside as it swayed in front of him, her buttocks pressing tightly against the white and gold material. Kassandra noted that her body seemed to be assimilating the vast amounts of energy she had absorbed, making it part of her very being, and she smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I won't need to store it after all!</i>' She thought gleefully, her heart skipping a beat in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group made its way to the main throne room, an incredibly large and spacious chamber, though not ostentatiously decorated. The vaulted wooden ceiling stretched at least twenty feet above them and it was an amazing thirty feet long, ending in the wooden throne of the pixie queen that appeared to grow directly out of the wooden floor. A plush red carpet that stretched the entire length and small globes of pure light that provided the illumination were the only unnatural aspects of this chamber, the rest of the decoration being part of the wooden trunk itself, the walls twisted and curved into delicate and wondrous shapes such as great wooden pillars, statues and entire dioramas telling the history of the pixie queendom. The pixies took flight once more to cover the incredible distance and reach the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there Kassandra settled into the throne, noticing with another small smile that her hips now touched the sides of the seat, and set her golden wand on her wider lap as she surveyed Nel and Clare, now on their knees, on the ground below the slightly raised platform that her throne stood on. She let her stern gaze linger on the two pixies, both of them meeting her gaze - Nel with tearful trepidation and Clare with simmering anger. After a few minutes she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clare. You recklessly endangered your own people in your lust for growth and even consumed one of your own, adding his magical essence to your own. We have not experienced such a crime in a long, long time and you don't appear to show any remorse for your actions. However, you can rest a little easier in the knowledge that his death will not be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra stood up from the throne and inhaled deeply, grasping her wand, closing her eyes and tilting her head backwards. She focused her attention inwards, concentrating on the vast reserves of energy still stored deep within her soul. As the two naked prisoners watched with puzzled expressions the queen was able to, little by little, separate the energy that had been the former guard from the rest of the raw power. Even those pixies that had no magical talent were inherently magical creatures and so in some specific circumstances revival was possible, depending on how the pixie met their end. It still took significant power and talent to achieve this, however, and most of the time the pixies slipped into the vast well of magical energy that ran like an undercurrent throughout the entire world, forever irretrievable and once again one with the very energy that had birthed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure she had separated all of the guard's essence Kassandra began to chant and weave an ancient spell, the words deep and resonant and spoken in the pixie's original language. They reverberated throughout the hall and all of the people present felt the words rumble through their bodies, the raw power inherent in them clear. The guards and captives alike watched with growing awe as bright blue spots of energy begin to fall from the queen's wand and gradually coalesce together to form a humanoid body. Finally, at the crescendo of the spell, there was a blinding flash and the former guard was whole again, albeit completely naked. He collapsed to the ground, trembling with exhaustion, as Kassandra fell back onto her throne from her exertion. The echo of the powerful words lingered in the air, melting away far slower than conventional sound would. Several of Kassandra's guards rushed forward and hoisted the restored man between them, flying him out of the throne room as Kassandra motioned for him to be taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel and Clare stared at their leader with renewed fear, even Clare's anger cowed in the face of such ancient and obvious power. The silence settled over the group like a thick blanket as the queen recovered from her magical exertion and no one dared speak to disturb her. Finally, after several minutes had passed, Kassandra heaved a sigh that strained the clasps on her dress and sat up again, smoothing her dress over her lap and positioning her wand as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have decided that as part of your punishment, Clare, you will be shrunk to Nel's size for a full year, so that you may understand the responsibility that size carries in our society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare started to protest as the queen stood up and strode over to the defiant pixie, looming over her. The redheaded pixie chanted a few magic words and gently touched the tip of her wand on Clare's head and the young pixie cried out in sorrow as her body gradually deflated, trembling as it gently reduced in size and only stopping once she had reached Nel's height of four inches. The restraints shrunk with her, magic as they were, and once she was shrunk the pixie guards hoisted her to her feet at a nod from their queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her to the dungeon while I decide how best she should serve her time of rehabilitation! Also, the rest of you, leave us! I wish to be alone with Nel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young pixie looked up in surprise as Geoffrey bowed and with a bark of authority led his guards from the throne room. Once the two of them were alone the queen crouched down in front of Nel, eliciting more protests from her strained garments, and gently brought her to her feet with her hand softly lifting Nel's chin. The young pixie looked up in awe and fear at the enormous and gorgeously curvy form of her queen, who's face looked down over the bulges of her larger breasts with a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My young Nel...I hate to see you so upset. You should have come to me with your concerns about your size. A beautiful girl like you does not deserve the height you have been born with. I am quite a good judge of character, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra winked as she finished and Nel laughed in spite of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what I shall do...\"   </span></div></div>",

Nel's face still glowed a bright red as she drank in the incredible beauty of her monarch, her little heart hammering in her chest and her hands clasped before her. At her current height of four inches Nel barely reached halfway to Kassandra's knees if she were standing and the young pixie fell to her own knees, overwhelmed at the sight of Kassandra's body looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Nel,\" Kassandra said gently, delicately folding her hands on her knees over her golden wand. \"There is no need to be afraid. Why don't you tell me exactly what happened back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel swallowed hard and nodded, taking some time to organise the events in her mind. As she did so she felt goose bumps forming on her skin and noticed for the first time how cold it was in the vast throne room, especially without any clothes. Nel folded her arms as she started to shiver slightly and Kassandra's expression turned to one of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing! How discourteous of me. Of course you shall have clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen deftly waved her gold wand and small motes of gold light gently fell onto Nel's naked body, coalescing with a bright flash into a full bodysuit of a delicate golden material. Nel stood up and marveled at the garment, warming her instantly as it clung tightly to her body, fitting perfectly over her wings and the rest of her curvaceous form as she twirled on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my queen,\" she said shyly, averting the monarch's eyes and staring intently at her hands as they fidgeted at her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra suddenly reached down and gently lifted Nel into the air, her hands deftly curling around the smaller pixie's waist as she yelped in surprise. Nel's eyes widened as she was brought up to Kassandra's eye level, a twinkle of mischief glinting in the queen's eyes as she met Nel's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, no more stalling,\" she told her subject gently but firmly. \"I want to know what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel heaved a sigh and nodded, summarising for the queen what had happened only hours earlier. She started haltingly at first but soon found her footing and was able to explain what had happened. She left nothing out, starting with how she and Clare had consumed the potions, the extreme reaction mixing them together seems to have provoked, how Nel was able to inhale the magic gas to match Clare's size and finishing with Kassandra turning up to find them entangled as they were. Kassandra remained silent for a short time, mulling the information over in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have my alchemists make a note of this reaction and we will need to make efforts to control the distribution of both potions within the realm,\" the redheaded pixie said eventually, tapping a finger against her chin. \"On their own the effects are temporary but I had to use ancient and powerful magic to drain Clare. We can't risk this becoming public knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra returned her attention to Nel in her hand, beaming a smile at the little pixie that caused her heart to skip a beat. Nel was rapidly falling in love with her queen and she avoided Kassandra's larger eyes again, her cheeks flaring up once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your honesty,\" the queen said quietly to avoid overpowering Nel with her voice. \"You are a good person, Nel, and I will reward you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra gracefully got to her feet, Nel still in her hand, and strode back to her throne to settle in it again. She leaned her wand against one of the armrests and deposited Nel in her lap, pulling her dress straight as Nel landed on her plush backside with a mild \"oof!\". Before Nel could react the queen gently pulled her backwards so that Nel now sat facing forward, leaning back against Kassandra's large stomach. The pixie queen gently rested one finger from each of her hands on Nel's bare shoulders, so that their skin was touching. Nel sighed, enjoying the intimacy of her positions, drawing a loving smile from Kassandra. She really was a most fascinating little pixie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nel Nightfall, for your assistance in bringing Clare to justice, I hereby grant you my former height, to be yours for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra closed her eyes and concentrated on the energies she had absorbed from the two pixies, the majority of it now melded with her whole being and therefore readily accessible to her without the need for her wand to shape it. She let the magic flow through her body, her lips parting to release a quiet gasp as it gently warmed her from her core, and passed it to Nel through her direct contact with the small pixie. Nel's pupils dilated and she loosed a brief cry of surprise as she felt the magic flow into her, scrunching Kassandra's dress in tight fists as her small body quivered and began to expand in the queen's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerspiration began to build on Nel's bare skin as she gently swelled taller and wider on the soft material of Kassandra's dress, her toes curling and her breath coming in short, hard gasps as the magic relentlessly stoked her arousal. Her nipples hardened against the fabric of her golden garment that started to creak ever so softly as her generous curves bulged and swelled upward and outward, her blue-haired head rising higher and higher up Kassandra's stomach. The queen was not immune to the sensations, her own nipples tenting her dress with equal pride and her generous hips squirming in the throne as she found Nel's gradual growth surprisingly enjoyable, the increasing weight of the young pixie building a heat between Kassandra's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah!</i>,\" Nel gasped as her lengthening and thickening legs burst through the side seams of her garment, the magic fabric tearing apart with the barest whisper of complaint as the hems and sleeves continued to rise up the pixie's legs and arms, fraying as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the garment started failing as Nel's body showed no signs of slowing down its expansion, her broadening back splitting it down the middle in short, sharp rips while her expanding breasts started overcoming the body suit at the front, tearing open a hole that they eagerly filled and gradually widened. The growing pixie closed her eyes and frowned as the pressure at her backside became almost too much to bear, the side seams now split all the way up to her plumping hips. As her arms burst through the sleeves and her legs completely separated the two halves covering them she groaned and tightened her grip on Kassandra's dress, the seat of the body suit stubbornly refusing her swelling buttocks. Then, as she reached double her old height and her breasts burst free of the upper half, her butt violently tore open the seat of the golden pants, Nel grunting happily and even Kassandra feeling the vibration as the body suit tore open, the queen moaning quietly in response. She had felt Nel's shoulders swell to fit her whole palms and her cheeks burned red with embarrassment as her crotch gradually moistened under the young pixie's generous rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fragments of the golden body suit burst into small fragments of golden light as Nel outgrew it completely and the swelling pixie started gently rocking her hips as her juices poured down her legs from her crotch, slowly staining Kassandra's white dress and melding with the queen's own fluids as the magic continued to feed Nel's growth, her body devouring it hungrily. It felt so different to the magic gas, stretching and moulding her swelling body with a gentle, loving caress as opposed to uncomfortable and rude spurts that left her feeling bloated. Kassandra moved her hands down to clutch Nel's as her embarrassment washed away in a tide of raw lust and growing love for her young subject. As Nel shuddered up past Kassandra's breasts she turned her head to face her queen, both gazing into each other's lidded eyes before sharing an urgent and intense kiss, both slaves to the raw emotions and feelings burning with an intense heat within their bodies and especially at the core of their being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel came to a trembling halt at Kassandra's former height of 2'8\", the younger pixie groaning softly against the queen's lips as the magic faded and left both pixies with an intense buzzing, their arousal far from sated. The queen lifted a hand and ran it through Nel's hair as the two newly-bonded lovers broke their kiss, Nel's eyes widening with realisation as the haze of lust clouding her mind cleared a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my queen, I-I'm s-so sorry!\" The younger pixie stammered, leaning back and looking away, her gentle panting belying her remaining excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra laughed, one of the most beautiful sounds Nel had ever heard, and moved both of her hands to Nel's ample buttocks that put in some growth above and beyond the rest of her body, and gripped them with a grunt of satisfaction as Nel jumped and squealed on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beautiful Nel,\" Kassandra replied, leaning in so that her young subject could feel her hot breath on her cheek, kissing it before continuing. \"You have nothing to apologise for. In fact, I can see why you two enjoyed the growth so much. I may have to experiment a little more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel turned to regard the queen's face with a puzzled expression on her face. Kassandra had closed her eyes and furrowed her brow, and then Nel felt a low rumble build from deep within the queen's body. The pixie ruler loosed a throaty moan of pleasure as she expanded upwards by several more inches, her breasts popping two of the golden clasps and her hips now pressing firmly against the sides of the throne while Nel watched with wide eyes. Kassandra opened hers again and smiled before sharing another kiss with the infatuated Nel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've barely started,\" the queen said with a smile and pulled Nel close so that their bodies pressed together, releasing a surge magic far more intense than before that flooded both of their bodies, the pixies groaning in unison as they started to tremble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pixie queen loosed an undignified growl of lust as she unleashed the full extent of her power and her body surged upward and outward in an intense burst of growth, her ample curves becoming gorgeously more exaggerated. Her breasts gorged themselves on her energy, bursting free from her dress as the last gold clasps covering them rapidly surrendered and her hips and buttocks swelled urgently against her increasingly inadequate throne, bulging up and over the armrests and pushing her dress to the limit. Nel hummed with pleasure as she soon followed suit, shuddering and rippling upward to meet her monarch's face and the two pixies shared another intense kiss as the magic continued to build. The very nature of pixie magic dictated that a pixie's magical power is linked to their size so as Kassandra drew on her vast wellspring of magic energy, recently empowered through the spell she had used to drain Clare, the queen found her reserves replenishing faster than she could drain them. She had unknowingly discovered the potential for unlimited power for her people, though potentially an upper limit still existed. Either way, her mind was only vaguely aware of the implications as the two lovers shuddered through another burst of delectable growth, Kassandra hugging Nel tight as she felt more of her dress give way with muffled rips, her sweat-soaked flesh bursting through an increasing number of growing holes while the armrests of her wooden throne surrendered to her swelling hips with loud cracks, her buttocks bursting out of the seat and her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! N-Nel!\" The queen exclaimed out loud as her younger lover found new confidence in her size and started to suckle her monarch's ample breasts while her hands moved deftly to Kassandra's soaked crotch, slipping through a growing tear in her disintegrating dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen could only groan and squirm as Nel expertly manipulated her sex, every ministration sending fresh bursts of fluid soaking the blue-haired fairy's arm while she moved from one breast to the other, Kassandra urgently caressing Nel's own expanding body as she rapidly felt her climax approaching, the last of her embattled garment giving way. As the queen's swelling hips started to buck and rock Nel moved her lips up to the monarch's own, the pair sharing a deep and urgent kiss as they bodies continued to shudder and swell well past six feet in height. Both of their wings fluttered in joyful and ecstatic unison as they surged past the normal height for a human, let alone a pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen...\" Nel breathed as their lips parted and their eyes met, their sweat-soaked bodies now rocking against each other as Nel refused to relent in her administrations. \"M-my...my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra wrapped her arms around Nel's lower back, one hand squeezing her beautifully plump and perfectly shaped buttocks as she lifted her head to gently touch Nel's forehead with her own, never breaking her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mate,\" the queen answered in a single breath before Nel saw her eyes dilate and her head fall back as the most intense climax of her life ripped through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released a strangled cry and hugged Nel tight, quivering and trembling as waves upon waves of ecstasy swelled and crashed in her mind. Her hips repeatedly thrust upward, spraying liquid ecstasy against Nel and across the room as the younger lover did not relent and continued to urgently massage and manipulate her monarch's sex to send Kassandra into every increasing heights of release. Their growth paused, the queen losing what little concentration she had left over her magic, reduced to a shrieking and quivering pool of ultimate ecstasy as Nel showered her queen in kisses and even gentle bites across any and all of the trembling flesh she could reach. The queen's multitude of orgasms lasted several minutes, though to Kassandra it felt like several hours of delicious, mind-bending pleasure, and when it finally abated she fell back, humming in contentment in the warm buzz of the afterglow. Nel rested on top of her lover, her eyes gazing at Kassandra's serene face as an uncharacteristically wide smile lit it up like a warm sunrise, the queen meeting her subject's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my gorgeous little Nel,\" the queen said happily, the irony making Nel giggle as their eight-foot bodies untangled themselves from each other with Kassandra sitting up and Nel settling next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...did you mean what you said, before?\" Nel asked quietly, her gaze flicking away as her cheeks blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra smiled and reached out to gently turn Nel's face to meet hers, resting her hand on Nel's cheek after tucking a loose strand of sweat-soaked hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your confidence fails you once your victim is no longer at the mercy of your cruel and unjustified assaults!\" the queen answered with a mock-stern expression and Nel giggled, flashing a mischievous grin at her monarch that made Kassandra's heart flutter in response and melted her faux-severity instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen leaned in, pecking Nel on her nose before their foreheads touched again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am at the mercy of my heart,\" Kassandra said quietly. \"I have only known you for a scant few hours, yet you touch it like no one else ever has. I...I would be lucky to have you as my mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's face blushed a dark red as her heart pounded in her ample chest, her wings fluttering, and she met Kassandra's lips, both pixies closing their eyes as they enjoyed the moment. Their bodies pressed together as their hands gently caressed the other and Nel gasped as the monarch moved her lips down to her neck, nuzzling the younger pixie as her toes curled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be luckier,\" Nel answered breathlessly, closing her eyes as Kassandra's lips descended further down her body and she sighed happily as they found her breasts. \"M-my queen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you, I am Kassandra,\" the older pixie answered with a loving smile and pushed Nel onto her back as her lips continued to travel down Nel's gorgeously expansive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel panted quietly, her eyes closed, as she enjoyed Kassandra's loving kisses and gentle massaging before she finally reached the treasure between Nel's legs, the queen resting a hand on each of her deliciously thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And vengeance is mine!\" Kassandra announced with a sinful grin before diving in and Nel's eyes snapped open with a squeal as Kassandra's gentle administrations became instantly more intense, the younger pixie squirming and crying out with every pant as her sex rapidly moistened with her inflamed arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel clutched the top of Kassandra's head as the queen's tongue and mouth explored and engaged the younger pixie's mound with equal, if not greater, expertise and she groaned as she felt the queen release a surge of magical energy again that flooded both of their bodies with a familiar energy. There was a brief pause with Kassandra's ministrations as both pixies trembled and swelled in size once again, renewed perspiration building on their exposed skin. Nel moved her hands up to her swelling breasts as her arousal continued to build, squeezing and massaging the bloating mounds and losing herself in the ecstasy of her growth and Kassandra's caresses. Their surges in size were far more powerful this time, a result of Kassandra's growing magical might, and it didn't take long for the incredibly curvy pixies to reach either end of the throne room, Nel's head gently impacting one end while Kassandra's enormously endowed backside touched the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kass...Kassandra! We're getting quite large!\" Nel managed to groan between her desperate pants, the realisation of their size sending thrills down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen paused again, before smiling and...     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the bowels of Queen Kassandra's modest palace, in the relatively small area used as a dungeon, Clare sat, depression and rage battling to determine which would rule her mood. She'd been magnificent, practically a goddess, and she'd leu herself get destroyed by a mere Queen! With hindsight, it was too easy to see how foolish she'd Been to allow Kassandra to intimidate her. If Clare had acted, and consumed the Queen, her own power would have grown even further, and Nel would have had no choice but to submit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could escape this cell, Clare would make them all pay. Both Nel and Kassandra would become her toys and slaves, and he rest of kind would fuel Clare's powers.

She looked, and saw the royal alchemist outside her cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare don't respond to the male pixie, her expression dripping contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this?\" The man went on, his own voice expressing total confidence. \"This is the breakdown of those potions you and your friend had such a, well, large reaction to. And our Queen would hide this secret away, forever. With this type of power, our armies could rule this realm, yet she's took weak t see it! But perhaps you have a better vision of the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare saw his game immediately, and smiled. \"I certainly do.

The pixie male dropped his books, confused and surprised but certainly not displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...oh, my,\" he stammered, not sure of the proper response. While he appreciated the attention, he didn't want to alienate his new tool by offending her in some manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, my handsome savior,\" Clare whispered teasingly into his ear. \"You've earned your Queen's favor with your good works. Give us a kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further prodding, the alchemist did as she asked; it was his final, foolish, and fatal mistake. In a twisted inversion of Queen Kassandra's affections, Clare began to suck the magical energies from the alchemist's body, pulling his essence into herself even as his weakening form tries in vain to escape. In mere seconds, his form began to shiver and dissipate into its elemental magics, which Clare then absorbed as well. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith a passionate moan, she began to feel the familiar sensation of growth flow through her, expanding to almost double her original height.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare smirked, snatching up the alchemist\u2019s jangling keys from the cell floor; she whirled the keys loosely around her finger. Donning the alchemist\u2019s robe, which had fallen to the floor when he had dissolved: the robe fit her loosely and the hood easily covered her head and with it her identity. Her green eyes under the hood, like emeralds in the walls of a cave, looked with some distaste at the bagginess of the garment, blue and gold like dragonskin, and wondered how long it would take for her to change that for the better! The alchemist\u2019s book was a treasure trove of potential options, options which could made very drastic consequences in the wrong, or right depending how you thought, hands - which is why only the royal alchemist and the grand apothecary were permitted access to the recherche pages of those books or held the keys to the alchemical vaults. Clare had seen one potion which claimed to give the imbiber the attendant magic, down to wings, horns and breath, of a dragon; whereas another was supposed to render the drinker wholly invisible or potions charged with fel magic and elemental strength. It was well enough known that the mixing of these potions could cause weird and wonderful, but unpredictable results. In the vaults, which were like a giant library with shelves to accommodate the myriad of potions known to pixie-kind, someone might find more potions than the mind could comfortably conceive, each winking in bright colours in their phials, bottles and flasks on the shelfs. Clare\u2019s eyes narrowed with greediness, if she could find her way to the vaults and guzzle a few of those sweet little drinks it might give her enough of an edge to get the better of Kassandra, and Nel when she found her. Obviously the holy grail would be to find the potion, or the ingredients for such a potion, to make her bigger, big enough to get even and get revenge. Sucking up the occasional pixie was great for topping herself up, and Kassandra, nicely swollen with all the magic from her former size, would surely cause a massive, juicy growth spurt, but what Clare needed was a head start, something to supply the body of her size. Clare licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on Clare that she was conspicuously small for a pixie and she ought to bump herself up a bit before stealing about the palace. Hugging the wall, she peeked around the corner - a guard was dozing sleepily by a torch-bracket, young and short, but would suffice. Slipping her fingers into her mouth, she whistled shrilly. The guard started awake with a jolt, and looked towards the cell, where Clare, covered by the robe, was beckoning urgently from the doorway, before disappearing back into the cell. The guard came scuttling in, his helmet falling about his eyes and his armour jangling like rusty buckets, while Clare lurked by the door. He cast about frantically, looking for the inmate: Clare leaped onto his back and locked her legs and arms around him, her force bearing him to the ground. \u2018What the---!?\u2019 he blurted out as he scuffled with the curvy demon on top of him. Squeezing tightly, she could feel his armour crumpling. She felt his thrashings beneath her losing their vivacity as he dwindled away. She felt herself filling up the robe more and more, her spine and her legs, first one then the other, cracked as she became taller. Soon Clare was left alone in the cell among a pile of rusty, hollow armour. Clare, smiling, stood up, holding the hem of the robe, she grinned at her slim pale ankles revealed beneath the robe. Admiring her chest, she appreciatively hefted her boobs. \u2018Sorry tin-man, I\u2019ve got bigger things to be getting onto!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare crept out of her cell on her long legs, producing the tinkling keys to lock it behind her. Slinking down the hall, Clare exited the prison by the heavy wooden door, which creaked loudly. The guard on the door looked up briefly, but, seeing the blue and gold robe that had gone in returning out, returned  assiduously to his duty of sleeping on a stool in the corner - it was all she could muster to avoid using the recumbent pixie to bolster her size: she was already starting to get greedy with it. Passing through another door, she exited to the courtyard. The night was hot and black, she seemed to float like a wraith to the gates and moved towards the halls of the main palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the castle slept under the blanket of darkness, Clare drifted down its halls and corridors following signs and searching, for she did not know the precise location, for the magical and alchemical quarter. The Mage/Alchemist\u2019s quarter of the palace, which held both the library and the vaults, was like a labyrinth - legend held that there were spiral staircases leading into nowhere and rooms with no doors, with catacombs extending beneath the quarter like a fungus. Rumours often mentioned, half in jest, that there lost tribes of research-students lost in its tunnels and catacombs. To Clare the halls and cloisters seemed like a spider\u2019s web, obeying very little rhyme or reason - mostly because of the inside seeming to disobey a fairly basic rule of architecture by being bigger than the outside. In all, this quarter of the palace represented one of the largest repositories of magic known to pixies. Clare licked her lips and let her hunger guide her onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of wandering the cold halls, and by now she could no longer feel her feet for the cold, Clare came to a huge, black door, wrought elaborately with dark iron. Her green eyes seemed to glow like fires in the dark and she padded the door, feeling for a lock. Once her long and slender fingers had brushed it, she fumbled in the recesses of the robe for the keys, trying each one until the mechanism clicked. Clare fidgeted impatiently as the various catches of the door undid themselves and she hurriedly pushed the door once they had stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare found what she had been looking for - the vault. Clare\u2019s eyes were bright and wide with delight; the hall was remarkably well lit, not least because each potion seemed to glow from its place on the shelf. Clare could see in the otherworldly light each bottle and flask and the little symbols which they bore on the front. This a red, round one: <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/fire.png\" alt=\"*Fire*\" title=\"Fire\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> ; a tall and skinny blue one : <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/waterdrop.png\" alt=\"*Waterdrop*\" title=\"Waterdrop\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> .

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wantonly and with an impetuous toss of her golden head, Clare uncorked a bottle, seemingly at random and without affording the bottle\u2019s label a glance, put the glass neck to her lips and began to drink; this drinking became, by degrees, more avid, swallowing more and more as she acquired a taste for it. Clare adopted deeper and bigger gulps, the liquid ballooning her cheeks outwards, in an effort to drain the bottle of its contents as fast as possible, for even as Clare gulped down one potion her thoughts were becoming increasingly occupied by the array of others before her. Tilting back her head, Clare drained the last of the bottle; letting the bottle fall to the floor with a tinkle, she wiped from her chin a trickle of red liquid and, without much in the way of hesitation, grabbed another, idling on the desk by her side, and pulled out the stopper; brought the glass rim to her lips and began to drink once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her head tilted backwards, Clare\u2019s eyes focused on the blue liquid sloshing around in the glass bulb and she watched the volume slowly diminish with each gulp she took; the fingers of her free hand drummed impatiently on her thigh. Finishing this bottle, Clare gasped for air and smacked her lips, running her tongue along her lips to lick up the blue liquid left there, and looking around. Clare set the bottle down on the table and strode over to the bookcase and quickly grabbed the first bottle, a square one filled with greenish liquid, and removed the cork with her teeth. Clare spat the cork out indelicately and swigged from the bottle, in the manner of a hip-flask, briefly contemplating the spicy flavour of the contents before starting to drain the bottle. The only sound Clare could hear was the sound of herself swallowing over and over. By the time, and it wasn\u2019t long at all, Clare had guzzled this particular potion, her wandering hand had seized another, faintly purple and tall. A purple puff escaped from this flask as she worked the cork free, and tossed it across the room, and floated upwards; Clare sniffed the drink and quickly drank. It was creamy, silken and tasted like lavender, she thought as she drank; in fact, Clare enjoyed this potion so much that she gulped it down greedily in a matter of seconds. When she plucked the glass from her lips she let out a satisfied sound and, soon afterwards a belch. Wiping a trickle of the liquid from her mouth, which she licked from the back if her long hand, she tossed the bottle over her shoulder and giggled at the tinkle, returning to the shelf with greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare knew, even as she sucked down the contents of an inky blue and spherical bottle, which actually could have been ink for all that it mattered to Clare, that what she was doing was an interesting combination of really quite stupid and overwhelmingly reckless: just because the mixture of those two random potions had succeeded in causing her to grow giant, there was nothing precisely that would indicate mixing loads of others would elicit the desired effect, but Clare had a hunch and, apart from being tall; very pretty and, as it turned out, a sore loser, Clare was really very intelligent when it came down to it. Her reasons were twofold: firstly, the Alchemists guild generally warded caution when mixing potions of different sorts because it tended to result in unpredictable and often violent magical reactions, as likely to catapult someone back in time as turn you into a strawberry, but it was this that Clare was hoping for, recalling that Nel had managed to inflate herself to colossal size using raw, unrefined, magical gas, and she assumed that an violent magical reaction taking place in her stomach would be enough to explode her gigantic again. Secondly, seeing the kind of power that Cassandra could wield and the ever-stubborn Nel\u2019s insistence on spoiling her good time, Clare thought some of the effects of the potions might give her the edge over them, whether this caused her to grow hydra-like snakes for hair or to become made of ice she did not care a whit: she just wanted something to give her an edge over those two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour potions later, when she had cleared a whole shelf, Clare burped again. Frowning, she inspected herself and found nothing. Stamping her foot, she grabbed another bottle and then another from the higher shelf, where the flasks were bigger; dustier and more sturdy-looking. Her gulping became furiously exaggerated about the lack of effect the cluster of potions had on her. Tilting her head right back and opening her mouth as wide as she could, she practically poured the two flasks down her throat. Flinging the the bottles down angrily, Clare fumed for a few moments. She uncorked a large, dusky blue bottle and looked for a moment at the little raincloud that formed above the bottle, complete with minute drizzle and little sparks of lightning. Clare opened her mouth and gulped down the little thundercloud before hastily and noisily guzzling the potion. She was so sloppy that it ran down her chin and splashed on her chest and, although it was a large bottle, she soon drained the liquid contents entirely. Dropping the bottle, which actually did not break, she belch deeply and, without pausing to wipe away the streaks and traces of the cloudy potion from her face, proceeded to neck a fat, orange bottle with likewise grace and immediately afterwards she drank a fiery red potion in moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a woman possessed, Clare poured another two potions down her throat. When she could not open a particularly dark and dusty bottle, she flew into a further rage and broke it off at the neck and poured the liquid into her mouth. Before long Clare had cleared the second shelf, but she was still impatient with herself. Clare could feel, underneath her stolen, magister\u2019s garments, her stomach gurgling. Placing a hand on her stomach, she could feel it was swollen and distended, like she was pregnant, she thought. Thought she felt so full, still nothing had happened; Clare\u2019s eye twitched in the way it did when she didn\u2019t get her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare\u2019s heart was beating hard when, from behind her, she heard a feminine voice: \u2018Uhh can I help you?\u2019 Clare turned round, an icy blue potion in her hands and still dripping from her lips and chin, and saw a young pixie standing another shelf, having come in by the door that lead from the towers. Clare swallowed heavily and tried to think of something to say. The girl asked again: \u2018Soooo, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 Clare saw, emerging from the door, several royal battle-mages. Clare licked her lips and gave and \u2018Ummmm, night cap?\u2019 The guards were working their way towards her, through the apparatus; papers and desks. Clare\u2019s stomach burbled again: \u2018Offt,\u2019 Clare put up a finger and belched loudly, \u2018hold on guys...\u2019 The guards still clanked their way across the room. Clare's stomach felt like it was swelling, feeling like she was going to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with frantic haste that Clare, feeling like her was ripe and ready to burst, swigged the rest of the potion she held in her hand and dropped it. The guards shouted at her to stop, but Clare, paying no heed, and without thinking much, hurled herself against the shelves, shaking the whole case and sending the potions down up her. Some smashed about her, splashing her feet and drenching her, sending up waves and plumes of colour, while some others burst on her head and soaked her thoroughly, knocking her to the ground. The guards halted as Clare was obscured by a cloud of sea-green smoke. When, after some time, the dust had settled, they saw the drenched Clare coughing and standing in midst of a veritable lake of colours. As they approached with spears ready, the glass crunching underfoot, one tentatively ventured: \u2018Miss?\u2019 and when this roused no response: \u2018You alright miss?\u2019 Clare straightened up, her frame seeming to tremble, and she seemed awfully tall for a pixie they thought.  Turning on her heel in the rainbow puddles, Clare rounded on the guards, grinning, with her big eyes glowing sea-green, seeming to fill her sockets, in the vault\u2019s half-light, potions of various kinds and colours dripped from her tawny hair. The drenched robes she wore clung tightly to an immense and wobbling chest, which, to the guards, seemed to be growing larger and tighter before their eyes: \u2018Never better...\u2019 lilted Clare as she grinned...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The guards watched the potion-drenched pixie with the glowing, sea-green eyes, slack-jawed, as she hand her hands clasped behind her back and grinned innocently, her head inclined downwards slightly, while thrusting out her chest, which bobbed and wobbled monstrously. Her dripping form no longer seemed to tremble and they chalked the impression up to a trompe l'oeil. The guards exchanged glances to and fro, with a faint clanking of armour; one guard was volunteered and pushed forward by the others. He shot a desperate and pleading look back at his comrades who nervously examined the walls; ceiling or their shoulder-pads. The guard turned back to Clare and gulped. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out except a kind of gurgling: a few of the guards covered their eyes and shook their heads. Across the room, the alchemist\u2019s apprentice was tentatively working her way forward. Clare cocked her head to one side, amused. As the guard sought for words, there came a burbling sound, like a cauldron was boiling somewhere. He ventured a sentence with \u2018Miss--uh--I have to ask...that\u2019, but trailed off and his, and his companions\u2019, eyes widened as the pixie\u2019s chest seemed to be growing, swelling up with that strange burbling sound; gradually the wet fabric of her robe became tighter and tighter, with her nipples clearly discernible beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words caught in the guard throat again as those monstrous breasts grew bigger, the burbling becoming louder and deeper, expanding towards him. Clare smiled and feigned ignorance, \u2018What\u2019s the matter, little guy?\u2019 The guard coughed and looked down at his feet and mumbled something, the others were watching nervously, while all the while Clare\u2019s boobs grew larger and fuller; it was a wonder she did not fall over now. The guard continued to murmur at his boots and the cobbles, his cheeks flushed;  he could feel the heat radiating from her huge breasts close to him, the burbling sound of their growing seemed to be in his ear. \u2018I can\u2019t hear youuu\u2019 Clare trilled, turning her eyes towards upwards. The guard lifted his helmeted head, with renewed vigor and resolve, \u2018I said -\u2019  His speech was stifled by the advancing wall of flesh, which had swelled to the extent that it buried his face. Because of the size and softness of her boobs, his head seemed to dimple the round  surface and as they continued to grow for a moment her flesh curved round the soldier like rising dough. The guards whose view of the scene was not swallowed by Clare\u2019s boobs exchanged glances again, by some miracle Clare had not burst out of the robes, but She had stretched it as tight as a second skin and it seemed to struggle to contain Clare\u2019s immense and mounting boobs. Clare blinked her brilliant, green eyes and breathed deeply, causing her monster bust to swell enough to push the guard embedded therein backwards, where he landed on his rump, before he was hoisted up by his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare giggled impishly, her chest jiggling like sea-buoys; she wobbled them a little to get a feel for their weight. The young alchemist push her way past the guards, and accosted the giant-bosomed pixie, her blue-hemmed robes, plainly too big for her, slipping over her hand as she pointed her finger angrily. She was young and small, but furious:\u2018WHAT did you think you were doing!? Do you have any idea, any notion, how dangerous what you\u2019ve done is!?\u2019 Clare\u2019s giggling calmed a little, but continued as she put a hand on each breast. The young girl became more frustrated by the lack of behind taken seriously; she put her hand on her hips, or the place in her robes where her hips ought to have been, and fumed: \u2018Listen! There\u2019s no telling what will happen to you: you could turn yourself into a troll; you might freeze solid or you could - I don\u2019t know - just die!\u2019. Clare bit her lips, but her glowing, green eyes still trembled with laughter; her hands had left her monster breasts and now rested on her stomach, which was groaning. The girl fumed: \u2018Quite apart from all the damage and the waste of banked potions, who would do something something so stupid!? For what? A grotesquely large bosom?\u2019, with this she deliver a sharp slap to one of Clare\u2019s huge breasts, causing her boobs to wobble. Clare began to snigger again at this; the girl continued, undeterred: \u2018Like this, so glutted with volatile magic liquid , and so many different types you idiot, you are very dangerous to both yourself and others; you might go around turning people into ladybirds or farting out thunderclouds, Gods only know what you will do!\u2019 Clare\u2019s giggling was interrupted when belched as if in response. Clare\u2019s stomach rumbled loudly and her figure seemed tremble slightly; the alchemist\u2019s apprentice furrowed her brow under her hood and she looked into Clare\u2019s sea-green eyes, boiling with magic, which were wide and bright and her smile was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the smile cracked across her face again in a wide grin. Softly she began to giggle again, as if to herself, but gradually this became louder, becoming more like genuine laughter, her monstrous breasts beginning to heave up and down more and more. The guards shifted nervously and looked to the young alchemist, who shrugged and said: \u2018Bonkers, totally bonkers\u2019. Clare deepened to a laugh, seeming almost forced and deliberate rather than girlish sniggering. \u2018Look here,\u2019 she said, pointing her robe again, \u2018this isn\u2019t funny, you better just go with these gentlemen, or they\u2019ll have to drag you out of here\u2026.kicking...and...\u2019 here she trailed off and her voice quietened, \u2018...screaming\u2019. Shrrrriipp. Her finger, which she had thrust sharply and squarely into the squashiness of Clare\u2019s heaving gigantic breasts, slowly travelled upwards; her eyes, angrily fixed on Clare\u2019s face, gradually softened in expression and followed Clare upwards, her mouth falling partly open. A low, but growing rumbling could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl stepped back from Clare and the guards did so too, as Clare\u2019s shadow, cast by the torches in their brackets, spread smoothly over them, punctuated by occasional abrupt spurts. Looking down it was possible to see Clare\u2019s bare feet lengthening on the flags; the foot of the robes hiked further and further up Clare\u2019s elongating calves. The guards who had attempted to flank Clare halted and backed up from her violently growing ass, which swelled rapidly up like a rising moon, soon waxing the material of the back of the robe almost as taught as her breasts had done the front. Clare\u2019s eyes were as bright as ever, seeming to illuminate the higher gloom above the flickering of the torches as they rose and lit up Clare\u2019s growing smile. Shrrriiippp The alchemist\u2019s apprentice looked in disbelief as Clare voiced an \u2018Ooo la la\u2019, looking down and grinning with the air of satisfaction, when the robefront finally split from the battle to contain her growing breasts, revealing, as the fissure gradually widened, an immense chasm of cleavage. Clare view of the other pixies was now, more or less, occluded by her monstrous chest. Not as long as one would like intervened between this sundering of her robefront and the her Clare\u2019s huge buttocks bursting the back of her robe, where it had hitched up and tightened about her widening rear and hipline. Clare grunted and heaved a breath and seized the edges of the rip in the cloth, through which her breasts were already beginning to stuff themselves, before teared it wider and asunder, so that her boobs, already appearing massive when compressed and stuffed into the robe,  gushed free, practically exploding outwards, seeming now to be gigantic as they bounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her head edged closer to the vaulted ceiling with each spurt, Clare began to laugh, deep and loud, bearing only the tatters of the robe as rings around her arms and waist. Clare\u2019s laughter caused her grotesquely huge bosom to wobble and bounce more and became deeper and louder as time passed, trembling slightly from spurt to spurt, from the transitions from size to an even larger size. Clare\u2019s back arched against the curve of the room as her head and shoulders reached the curved vault, but continued to go upwards. Clare\u2019s legs lifted and attempted to spread, almost straddling the room; the trembling of Clare\u2019s body as she grew effected slight, but intensifying, tremors through the flagstones and caused the tables and bottles to judder. The alchemist\u2019s apprentice back up against the shelves on the opposite side of the room; she could see, looking up, Clare\u2019s huge, sea-green eyes in the the gloom of the ceiling arch, which illuminated her face and hair and made them discernable by a faint and ghostly glow, and her immense and voluptuous form towering up, into the darkness, against the curve of the ceiling, still becoming taller and larger. Clare\u2019s laughter became more gleeful when, hunching over increasingly against the curve of the ceiling as she grew bigger, she could finally see the pixies below, among the desks and shelves, over the immensity of her bust. \u2018DA-HAHAHA\u2019. Watching the darkness of the vaulted ceiling, all the onlookers could see were those green eyes creep their way along the curve of the ceiling, attended by Clare\u2019s knees and legs bending more and more, as she grew and the deep and louder laughter booming down on them like a rainstorm, added to by the continued rumblings of growing bigger: \u2018DO-HOHOHOHO!\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the gloom above Clare thundered: \u2018I\u2019M SORRY, I COULDN\u2019T HEAR YOU; WHAT WAS THAT YOU WERE SAYING!?\u2019 before chiming an \u2018OOOOH!\u2019 as she experienced another spurt and began laughing again. Clare\u2019s arms, pressed to opposite walls, were bending at the elbows; her legs bent crookedly as she straddled the room and still Clare showed no signs of stopping: it was only so long, if she continued to grow like this, that the Vault could accommodate her. Bumping against the shelves again, the young alchemist caught a bottle before it fell. She looked at the shuddering bottles and then up at the still growing Clare...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare, her back extending up the whole curvature of the Vault and her broadening shoulders pressing up against the ceiling, continued to send down her deep and booming laughter like the clang of cathedral bells. She had now grown far enough up into the darkness of the vaulted ceiling that those viewing her from below could only distinguish her pale, marmoreal skin; the tawny curtain of her hair or the split, carmine bivalve of her mouth by the vague penumbra created by the absinthe-coloured phosphorescence of her eyes, which smouldered in the gloom. The Vault had begun to tremble and the air felt faintly sticky, like it might before lightning-storms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaking from the astonishment that had set in, one among the royal mages fired a bolt of magic into the soft wall of the giant pixie\u2019s thigh. But this seemed to ricochet off her inflated flesh, as if magnetised, describing an arc into a pile of glassware elsewhere in the Vault. Another bolt of livid magic soared towards the giant pixie\u2019s bulging bosom where it seemed only to fizzle out and burst. In frustration the captain, a towering amazon of a pixie, aimed and leveled a bolt up at the growing pixie\u2019s darkened face and let fly. Clare, seeing the bluish streak of magic making towards her, eased her laughter enough to let her open her mouth and, with remarkable deftness, catch the bolt in her mouth with a gulp. Clare\u2019s laughing stopped, licking her lips, before a momentary pause that was soon broken by an unladylike belch, which rumbled both her frame and the foundations of the vault, that was plainly, thought the young alchemist, the result of the violent magical reactions taking place inside the growing pixie, a theory only supported by the little storm cloud that blew out from the giant pixie\u2019s mouth as her belly rumbled and which rained down onto the vault floor, with little sparks of lightning. Worse still, far from the intended outcome, the burp seemed to buoy the giant pixie that little bit larger so that by the time her disgorge had ended the Vault had begun to crack and chips of masonry had begun to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young alchemist looked at the scene with a mixture of horror and, much as she would hate to admit it, interest, and, stirring strangely in her mind, the odd twinges of titillation. What was taking place in the Vault and inside the growing pixie was actually quite remarkable and from a purely alchemical point of view. What she found most astonishing was how the growing pixie metabolised the various unpredictable reactions taking place inside her, which realistically could, at any moment, overwhelm her with their fissuring energies and threaten to burst her colossal body apart. In the dark of the vault the tracery of veins in her colossal bosom seemed to glow occasionally sea-green, lending her monstrous chest the fleeting impression of translucence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe consumption of those gallons of distilled magic had caused her body to soak up magic like a sponge or, at the same time, to simply repel or negate it as it metabolised the unstable concoction in her belly; at this point the was forced to duck slightly as another spell bounced off the colossal pixie and scorched the wall behind her. It seemed that, at least for the moment, the growing pixie was next to invincible, that spells and magic at best did not graze her and at worst made her bigger. Her comparative immunity to magic was extraordinary, the way she nonchalantly, with pursed lips or an amused smile, brushed off whatever the guards could throw at her. The young alchemist felt a cold prickle on her skin and she realised that the giant pixie was, the bigger and stronger she became, and by now she had crouched down altogether in the Vault, the more she communicated to the air of the Vault an atmosphere of unstable magic that was sticky and static and easily confused with the heat of her huge body. The tawny-haired giant\u2019s wanton guzzling had now transformed her into a towering, unstable caryatid that, because of the brewing alchemical reactions in her stomach, engendered the very air around her with their instability and unpredictability. Although the growing pixie was at the mercy of these volatile energies inside her, of which she was likely fully aware and yet slightly maddened by them at the same time, it was possible, thought the young alchemist, that this was only the beginning of the transformation that would be brought to bear on her by the caprices of her well of ingested magic. Whatever the magics she had consumed, after most of the swamp of reactants had dispersed themselves into her bloodstream and body, would likely coalesce and crystallise, concentrating in the huge pool of her stomach, at some later time and wreak further changes on the giant pixie\u2019s body. Right now, the young alchemist thought, the tawny girl was metamorphing not unlike a silkworm, which, between emergence from the egg and entrance to the cocoon, the last, and most radical, metamorphosis, will gorge itself on mulberry leaves and grow and grow, eating and growing until it has increased its weight by over ten thousand times. Somewhere in the mire of confused and unstable magic inside the giant pixie\u2019s body, beneath the outward appearances of extreme growth, something inside her was beginning to grow and well up and change: so that, as the tawny-haired pixie was becoming bigger and stronger and her magics were becoming stronger and more unpredictable, one got the sense she was becoming something more. Judging the the still crumbling ceiling and the rumbles of the tawny giant\u2019s body as she picked up and crunched on a wooden cabinet of potions and elixirs, her process of gorging and growing was far from done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist\u2019s apprentice clutched at a torch bracket as the expanding girl sat, bringing her huge buttocks down on the cold stone flags with a boom; her knees now scraping the lower gloom of the ceiling and her head still ploughing its way into the vaulted ceiling. It was as if she wanted to prolong the experience of filling up the Vault as long as she could, the sensation of consuming, greedily, more and more space with her body; eking out the fear of her mounting flesh in the inhabitants; letting her excitement at her imminent eclosion from the Vault well up in her heart and stomach and brim over. Slowing, while regarding her billowing self, she began her deep, sonorous laughing again, but amplified again by her having swelled. Just as she began to contemplate what might become of the giant pixie, or rather what she might become, or what she was becoming, the alchemist girl saw a guard, who was bravely contending with the ballooning, squashed roundness of the tawny pixie\u2019s left buttock, suddenly burst in a shower of sea-green sparks. Craning to see, she could at first make out nothing, but soon saw, scuttling about under a helmet, a fat, little chicken. She realised with a quiver of horror that the giant pixie had begun to affect the air and background magic around her to such an extent that those her proximity in could be affected by them, whatever she happened to be giving off. As she finished this thought another guard was rendered into a cloud of bubbles. As the other guards back away and began to filter out of the room, the alchemist\u2019s apprentice saw this as an opportune time to make her exit. She slipped through the service door, rather than the main door, which the growing colossus had all but occluded by now with her monster buttocks, or the back door, which was the only option remaining for the royal guards. As she pulled the heavy, black wooden door shut, acutely aware of the tremors being sent through all the vault by that voluptuous behemoth and her continuing swelling, her last glimpse of the fast-being-swallowed scene was of a monstrous, wobbling crag of breast-flesh, like a bulbous and inverted loveheart, and of huge, brilliant sea-green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare, still kind of rapturous and euphoric, realised that it would not be long before she filled up the Vault. She had enjoyed the little pangs of magic and the jags from the guards\u2019 magic and weapons; still sort of fogged up with the sensation of growing, and the lust for more, she had not really properly registered the \u2018attack\u2019. She did not really mind; she found it rather cute. Even she did not know how powerful she had become until then; the fact she now felt increasingly, as she grew bigger and stronger, like a goddess was something she had hitherto only suspected. But now, as her shoulders broadened and her neck and head cricked against the spider-webbed ceiling; her ever-swelling bosom made in still more difficult to breath and her still growing limbs made it harder to move, she saw the little mages and guards retreating. She smiled wickedly and boomed out - OH DEAR, YOU WOULDN\u2019T LEAVE LITTLE ME HERE BY MYSELF WOULD YOU? With this she reached out through the now crumbling and falling masonry and caught up two guards in one hand, like toy-soldiers. She brought them up to her sea-green eyes and was amazed how the could be seen by the glow from her eyes. To her astonishment, even as she held him, one mage was reduced, in a puff of sparks, to a cloud of butterflies; Clare blinked and giggled even as her head started to crack through above. DON\u2019T WORRY, Clare squeezed the toy-mage and parted her wettened lips suggestively, I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT OF \u2018HELP\u2019 TO GET THROUGH THIS. She put him to her lips with two fingers, kissed his toylike form and, with all the grace and joy of eating an over ripe strawberry, sucked him into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly moments later, Clare grew through the roof of the Vault; her still-swelling body, coiled up inside tight as a djinn inside, shook the plates and specks of masonry from her as she emerged upwards into the frosty morning light. Her great tawny head rose and swayed through the mists as she rose to stand silhouetted in the pale sky; her immense high bosom, with clay-piped nipples, was soon wet from the mist.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The castle\u2019s groundskeeper was strolling in the balmy air, under the humid flowers of the trees overhanging the path. There seemed, at least to him, to be something oppressive in the air of the garden, something strange and sticky about it, rather than simply the cloying smell of the pollen. As evening bells came from the palace cathedral, he was regarding the dark castle when he became conscious of a trembling in the ground. The stones of the path seemed to jitter faintly by his boots. Frowning, he squinted in the gloom of the garden, up through the branches of the trees, at the roof of the palace vaults, which seemed to heave. His jaw dropped as masonry of the roof crumbled and, from the plumes of dust, there rose something huge. At first it seemed like a great quantity of boiled milk billowing up in a colossal balloon or egg before bursting upwards, but, as he ran closer, down the garden path, until his view was no longer obscured by the veil of the trees, for an instant the form seemed more like a huge tower or lighthouse, the smooth and off-white as ivory, whose coiled spiral staircases and floors were rising up from the Vault. But no sooner had this impression lodged than the tower twisted, now seeming less like a violent and grand chemical reaction or architectural structure, but instead, in the way it seemed to twist and unfurl, more organic, at one moment like a colossal, for the thing was still rising, beanstalk, the next like a pillar of cloud, perhaps the most enduring of his impressions was, rather, like an immense column of candlewax plied by a flame, twisting and expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way beyond the fringe of the trees, he beheld the form risen from the vault, and now towering over the palatial gardens, casting a huge shadow that stretched beyond the walls, as the shadowy body, though it seemed hard to believe,of a colossal pixie. Looking up, he could not see, in the evening haze, the pixie\u2019s face which was curtained by shadows and immense coils of tawny hair. He could, however, see her eyes glowing sea-green. Her wings, beforehand cramped and pinioned by the confines of the vault, now unfolded and stretched out and up behind the colossal pixie. The gardener watched, dumbstruck, as the colossal pixie stretched her up long arms into the sky like the pinnacles of the castle out of which she had grown and tilted the tawny magnificence of her head, bits of masonry still falling from her body. The air seemed to tingle about him. A bird, crossing the sky after being disturbed by the pixie\u2019s eruption, collided with the tangle of hair and fell to earth as a potted plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the colossal pixie brought up a giant leg to step out from the vault, the gardener saw the great thickness of her thighs, but ran. As he ran across the lawn, he  glanced back, seeing the trunks of the colossal pixie\u2019s legs rising and planting as she strode towards the walls of the grounds, towering over all before her. He was thrown forward by the shock of her foot coming down on the lawn. Scrambling to his feet, he ran for the  trees, his hands aching from the fall, and, as he ran, he caught, out of the corner of his eye, a glance at an tree crumpling and splintering beneath another such foot. Reaching the trees, the gardener looked up and saw above him the huge gusset of the giant pixie as she straddled forwards, her foot landing some way off in the copse of trees. He stood panting in horror as he heard the colossal pixie made her way from the palatial gardens, casting her shadow on the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\nLater the same evening, in the pixie town that lay in the valley down from the Palace grounds, the townspeople were conscious of a thundering coming from the forest. Nina Skyborn, a flowergirl, skirted around a puddle when a tremor sent ripples through the water lying on the cobbles. She looked up from the cobbled streets and saw a cloud of bats, roused from among the trees, cross above the rooftops of the town. Nina and her basket of flowers were sent sprawling on the wet cobblestones by another quake, much closer than before. As she lay in the street, she was conscious of the orange light of the evening darkening as the shadow of something passed over her. Twisting to look up, Nina saw the form of something huge, almost too large and close to properly distinguish, bearing down on the town\u2019s library. Within moments the monster had torn the slated roof from the library. Nina scooped up her basket and as many bruised flowers as she could before fleeing. Looking back, she saw the colossus seeming to cram handfuls of splintered bookcases and spellbooks into its mouth. As Nina fled she was conscious of a strange rumbling that seemed to bubble and spread from the monster, through the ground beneath Nina\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\nSome miles off, John Husker, a farmer whose livelihood was the cultivation of root vegetables, turnips or carrots, in magically rich soil, causing said vegetables to swell to enormous size, and his wife were shaken awake in the night by the booms of what they thought was thunder. The thunderous sound was so strong it shook the foundations of their farmhouse. Edith sat up after a particularly violent boom. From outside they heard a tremendous crunching, which culminated in what sounded like a belch. When John ventured outside to investigate he was surprised, to say the least, that there was neither wind, nor rain, and, looking up, he saw a clear blanket of stars. However, he was shock to see that his crops had been uprooted, a job which ordinarily too a team of men, and had disappeared altogether. As John approached the smashed fence he looked about him and realised that he had entered into the bowl of a oblong crater, so freshly made that water from the soil was only now beginning to pool therein. John, still horrified by the loss of his crop, but not quite able to process it, thought, in the darkness, the shallow, long crater resembled a footprint. From behind the barn there came another thunder-like eruption, followed soon after by the gurgling, bubbling sound. He turned to see the shadow of something ballooning up behind his barn, rising higher into the night sky. The moonlight threw the monster\u2019s shadow further and further across the ground. John flung himself flat in the soft mud of the creature\u2019s footprint as the green-eyed colossus straddled his barn and strode forward, one enormous foot dragging and crashing through the barn itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\nFor miles around you could see the lights from the Nightglow mines high up on the mountain, as the toiled through the night, when the magic-rich ore inside would glow blue. The workers were traumatised, when, around midnight, the mouth of the mine was suddenly blocked and illuminated by something eerie green. No sooner had this disappeared than what appeared to be a huge, white wyrm thrust itself down the passage: first grabbing a laden orecart and dragging it into the night, where the miners could hear grinding and crunching noises, before plunging back in again, thick and round, and snatching a miner, then another, then a clump of ore, another mine cart, a chunk of the wall - all of the dragged back into the mountain air. As the huge serpent thrust in again and seized sizeable chunk of ore, it paused. Old Hans then realised that the white dragon raiding the mine was, unbelievably, an arm, the arm of, presumably, some even larger creature! Suddenly a rumbling began that shook the mine and the snowy flesh of this huge arm began to swell, to grow longer, down the tunnel, after the fleeing miners and to expanding, filling up the space in the mine, shaking the struts and buttresses. Old Hans pressed against the wall and prayed for the nightmare to end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\nIn the early hours of the morning, Dan Fothergill rose early and rowed out in his little shallop onto the glassy surface of the Mala lake, home to rare catfish, unique for having swum in those magic-soaked waters and sifted its magical mud and had therefore attained not only unusual size compared to that of the lake, but, it was, said that eating these catfish granted wishes.These fish fetched a fairly generous price at market. Mist hung over the lake and the woods and all Dan could see was the amber lantern dangling from the end of his boat. He had thought he heard thunder before setting off, but assumed now that it had come from somewhere in the valley over the mountain. Dan was more tired than usual for having had several unsuccessful trips this week. He lazily watched his float bob in the milky waters for some time, he did not know how long, until he became conscious of something rather strange. As he sat angling his little boat had been born gentle backwards, drawn along as if by a current. He did not understand why; no wind stirred the lake or the mist swirling about him. What trees he could see seemed to be climbing upwards. A warm, and oddly strong, breeze dispersed some of the mist and Dan was appalled to realise that, in fact, the water level was sinking! He could actually see several to the lake\u2019s catfish breaching from suddenly shallower waters! Dan turned to see, as he was drawn along, the shadow of the head of some colossal beast looming from the mist, its head inclined to the lake\u2019s waters to slake its gargantuan thirst. Dan grabbed his oars and rowed furiously against the draw of the leviathan\u2019s mouth. For some minutes he struggled against it before, its thirst apparently slaked, and the lake reduced to a meer puddle with great bloated catfish leaping in the dregs, the leviathan raised its head. Dan sat in his immobilised boat and watched as the creature rose up on two giant legs, brushing trees aside as it did so. Its breath no longer blew the mists away and, as it towered up, there came from amidst the mists swallowing up the form of the colossus, a crackling, gurgling, rumbling, and throbbing sound, like thunder brewing and growing in the clouds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun seeped over the crags of the mountains and gushed down into the valley, lighting up the morning mists. The Imperial Guards looked down onto the valley where, only the night before, a young pixie, who had burst from the Palace vaults, had unleashed herself on the unsuspecting, sleepy residents of the valley. The guards had just come from inspecting one of the magic-ore mines across these mountains where this oversized pixie was supposed to have ransacked and plundered the place. They had interviewed one old miner, a dwarf, who shook so violently he could scarcely form coherent sentences, as if his jittering shook apart his sentences. His account, broken though it was, and even though he could only see an eye, an arm, or a huge pair of lips, put her at anywhere between a fifty and a hundred feet tall. This was weird, thought the Captain, as she breathed the cold mountain air. An account from the town at the foot of the Palace can\u2019t have had this girl at much between ten and twenty foot tall. But another account, this time from a farm some way out of the village, said the pixie had been large enough to have straddled his barn and strewn it across the farmyard when its foot went through it. The barn, according to the captain, must have been maybe 8 feet in height. And, as a guardsman had pointed out, you could see where this girl had climbed the mountainside from the dislodged boulders and scree, and whatever she had raked from the mine shaft that had, so they were led to believe, not made it into her gaping mouth. He was correct in observing this and in the opinion that she must have been some size to scale that rockface. There had been no sign of the giant pixie since she had crossed the mountain range, nothing had, rather, made its way over yet. For the Captain was convinced the girl was still in the Valleys somewhere, but, in the early hours of the morning, a dense fog, the likes of which had scarcely been seen, had rolled in and settled in the valleys, into which the budding giantess slipped and was lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some hours they traversed the jagged spine of the mountains searching for the girl, but to no avail. On the ridges of the one Valley the took a rest, for the mist seemed to have become more widespread and thicker, seeming to curl its way up the mountainside.The Captain bit into a grape as she ran her fingers over the unfurled map of the Valleys. She judged, from the escarpment, just visible over the sea of fog, projecting upwards like a claw, that they must have crossed over towards the Frir Valley, a region of vast, misty, wetlands and swamps, below the slopes of the mountains. It was inhabited mostly by strange elemental waterlife, such as bog nymphs, mandrakes, or frog-people. The only really civilised race to establish footholds there were Goblins, living in little Potemkin industrial villages out on the marshes. The Captain was less than keen to venture down into the mires to look for her fugitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed, during which the Captain leaned against a stone, and watched the way the distant cascade fell from the sunlit uplands down into the mists of the valley. Suddenly, there came a rumbling through the ground, like a quake, and a sound like thunder. The guards were shaken from their feet and one had to beat his wings furiously to recover from falling off the precipice. The Captain threw out her hand and pulled him back with a jerk. Scarcely had this quake faded then another came and another. It felt as if the earth itself were breathing, in long and deep drones, the Captain half expected to see the twin pinnacles of the of mountainsides heaving up and down like great, craggy breasts. Instead, the mountains only shook with the quaking, which seemed to emanate from somewhere in the divide of the Valley. The Captain teetered towards the brink, pebbles being shaken off about her, and looked intently. Through perhaps a slight thinning of the veil of mist she could make out the faintest, shadowy forms. Take an eyeglass from her satchel, she steadied herself and looked towards a spot in the mist, then another, then another, trying to locate as best she could where the quaking was coming from. Fixing on a spot, she adjusted the focus, Here, through the round lens, she saw that with the rumble of every quake the mist seemed to stir, to fold in on itself and then, after the rumbling had faded, to bluster and billow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain watched the spot of mist, near where the waterfall plummeted down, intently for some time. Then, as if emerging from a dream, the mists thinned and she could distinguish, though only faintly, an immense pair of red lips. The Captain lowered her eyeglass and stood for a moment. With a finger she faintly traced what she thought to be the contours of the girl down the huge tract of obscured valley, along the romantic chasm. \u201cBoys\u201d, she said, \u201cI think we found our girl\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant pixie snored, whether from the wind, from their gradual dispersing along the valley, or from her swallowing up the mists as she slept, she emerged gradually from the shifting mists like some enormous ocean steamer or castle by the sea. Her breath blew across the valley, drawing in the sea of fog, and then chasing them down towards the mouth of the valley. It soon became apparent, as the fugitive girl's shadowy form emerged from the fog, that the Captain\u2019s tracing of her outline, softly sleeping propped out but the fringe of the mountains, like some enormous porcelain doll, had been a conservative one. The girl's body was so large that the Captain and her fellow guardsman could not distinguish all of her at once, she had become so large that as she lay draped over the landscape her body was abbreviated by clouds of mist. Instead, they could see the dark forms of her outline and limbs occasionally emerging from gaps in the mist. For it transpired that the girl lay recumbent, her body rolling up the mountainside, the waterfall breaking upon her shoulder, her arm lying embedded in the thick forests that covered the mountainsides. Her monstrous hipline and buttocks swallowed up the wide wedge of the valley, where it funneled into the mountains, and was visibly bulging from pressing up against the mountainside. The Captain could not distinguish one leg as it stretch away into the mouth of the valley, but one of her splayed legs travelled up and lay hooked over the mountainside. They must have, thought the Captain, wandered past her leg in the mist, which was frankly astonishing for now, following the giant pixie's leg up over the outcrop, she could see its dark form towering up above them like a cliffside. Most astounding of all, as became clear was how tremendous the girl\u2019s bust had become. Though the girl\u2019s body was engorged, from her tree-studded arms to her mountain-crushing buttocks, her chest had grown monstrously huge. As the sleeping form giant pixie slowly became clear they could see them, for they maybe would have merited a valley of their own, swollen up into huge domes, swelling out from her sleeping body. Though she could not properly take stock of the sheer scale of the girl stretched out across the crease of the valley, the Captain wondered how the girl would be able to stand up. They heaved and fell as she breathed, trembling and wobbling in the fog, like vast iceflows or lakes of milk. Crowning each huge breasts was colossal nipple, starting erect from the mists, like twin pinnacles of jasper amongst the roiling fog. Contrary to what the Captain had traced in the air, the shadowy form of the girl, their fugitive, filled the valley. In contrast to the accounts provided from the pixie kingdoms, which put the girl at an undoubtedly formidable size, the the murky outline of her body suggested that since entering the swampy landscape and descending into the sea of fog in the basin of the Frir Valley the fugitive had only grown and grown and grown, becoming larger and more voluptuous, until she had reached a size utterly unthinkable for a pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun filtered down into the valley, through the mists, the giant pixie\u2019s body crackled with lights from the fields of dew covering her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun slowly spread across Clare\u2019s body she ceased to snore and, breathing deeply, began to stir awake. Clare, her eyes still closed, was still surfacing from sleep as she slowly stretched herself out; she her enormous bones cracking, or perhaps it was the jagged rocks she could feel pressing against her. As the reality of her size slowly split from her sleeping mind, she groaned. She loved to feel the landscape beneath her. She kept her eyes closed and curled her arm around the mountainside and probed with hand along the mountainside forest, feeling the firs ripple through her fingers like a carpet. With her right foot, for the left foot was nicely hooked over some piece of mountain and she liked the cold, she delicately probed beyond her. She groaned again, letting it rumble through her and the landscape she had draped herself over. Still not opening her eyes, Clare brought up a hand to rub and scratch her breast; while her body felt stiff from lying where she had thrown herself, after a night in which she had done almost nothing but grow and grow and grow, crooked in a valley, her breasts were tender, swollen and pained. She rubbed them a bit and groaned from her growth hangover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare opened her eyes slowly, the green of her eyes lighting up the mists. She looked at the vast tracts of herself unfolding down into the valley; she looked down along her stomach at the dense forest of hair between her legs, at her hips and huge thighs which seeked to yawn hungrily down the valley. Clare ran a hand along her stomach and looked at the droplets of dew hanging from her fingers. Slowly Clare closed her eyes again and groaned again. Still slightly asleep, something began to boil inside Clare. She skated her hand down along her torso again, running her fingers up and over the ruby peak of her nipple. Down towards her abdomen. She walked her fingers through the forest of her pubic hair. Reaching between her thighs, her hand splayed like a gigantic white spider, raking through the forest below and plunged inside herself. The sensation was a violent one. Clare\u2019s spine arched as she heaved upwards; her free hand clutched at the clumps of forest and mountainside as if in desperation, uprooting great tufts of forest, before rubbing and kneading her breasts, the tickling and scratching of the firs delighted her, before grabbing at her buttocks and digging in her nails, as she started to buck her hips, she didn\u2019t know what to do with it. The sound sent back to her from the encircling mountains of her buttocks slamming off the ground beneath them only managed to arouse her that bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare felt a quickening, like molten rock running through her. It seemed to be swelling her up, but she couldn\u2019t be growing more; she was already so big; her breasts were already so gigantic; if she grew again, the valley would scarcely be able to contain her.With her free hand, Clare clutched at one of her breasts and brought it up to her mouth. Clare licked her huge nipple, before wrapping her lips around it and sucking. Clare\u2019s eyes started open again as tasted something sweet in her mouth. She removed her nipple from her mouth, a long bridge of sticky honeyed saliva stretching between her plump, wet lips and the ruby peak, tinged with sea green.  But she couldn\u2019t stop. She hooked her other leg over a crag on the other side of the valley. The feeling was turning almost to pain and coalescing in her breasts. She looked at them, rising up from her chest, quivering in the fog. With every thrust into herself, every jerk of her hips, Clare could feel pangs from them, sore and tender, the pain seemed to be building, like snowcapped volcanoes. Her chest ached with pleasure; she was sure they were becoming bigger, throbbing larger as she came closer to maximum arousal. Clare\u2019s eye twitched from the strain. Curling her arm up beneath her titanic bust, Clare drew it up to her face in and chasm of cleavage. She could see nothing else of herself, of her colossal body stretching down the valley, except the snowy mountain of her bosom before her. She kissed her rubbery white flesh. As Clare squeezed herself, she almost squealed at the little geysers of, what she could only assume, was milk, infused, no doubt, with all the magic she\u2019d glutted herself on during the night, which was now coursing through her body in floods. She could see, running beneath the squidlike flesh of her breast, the vast network of veins running, beginning to flush deeper and deeper green. Clare mind was fogged by a tempest of pleasure and pain, but, even through this, she knew this, whatever was happening as she came closer and closer, was some huge and violent latent reaction to her having gorged herself on magic. Groaning from the mounting pain and fit to burst, Clare bit her lip; her eye twitched uncontrollably. She couldn\u2019t contain herself anymore; it was too much. Clare\u2019s spine arched so violently that it cracked like sheet lightning, her head crashing back into the mountainside, as she gasped a thunderous: \u201cFUCK, I\u2019m \u2014 OOOOOOOOOH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole Frir Valley quaked with the force of Clare\u2019s climax. From the mountain ridges, clutching to a rock as the mountain range shook, the Captain looked on at the monstrous girl\u2019s body having up into the sky, outlined in the billowing mist...</span></div></div>",

Far from releasing the pressure she had felt in her body, Clare\u2019s climax appeared to have excited something dormant in her body, perhaps the vast lake of magic swimming in her gut. Clare felt it mounting inside her, a raw sensation within her body. Her body convulsed and throbbed with every beat of her heart, with the quickened stream of magic pumping through her veins. Clare could not understand, could not comprehend, the feeling running through her body at this moment. Growing had, until now, been an airy, tingling feeling; it made her feel almost numb to blow up in size. At first she felt as though this increasing feeling, pent up within her body, was the beginnings of an earth-shattering growth spurt, but as the sensation continued to well up inside, so unbearable her nails dug into the earth and her toes were cramped from curling, Clare became less sure of this. This feeling, in contrast to her usual growth spurts, verged upon both ecstatic and excruciating. Moving through her body like molten metal, Clare felt this mostly as a kind of agonising pleasure. Her body cried out for release or, or so it felt to Clare as she clutched at on enormous and tender breast, it would surely rip itself apart. The sensation seemed to flow through her, with the beating of her heart, from her bulwark hips and ass, from her yawning nether regions, from almost everywhere, and seemed to be welling in her breasts. As much to her distress as to her elation, as she clutched her chest, Clare felt she could see her veins, saturated the sea-green of raw magic, starting from her skin. And, to her shock, as she attempted to knead out from her breasts some of the pain and tenderness, the white expanse of her chest lurched larger. Now Clare, perhaps in a bid to lessen the pain, threw her arms out, so that she lay cruciform across the Valley, her hands crunching into the mountainside as she grasped it. Using the mountains about her, and resisting the waves of pain and pleasure threatening to contort her body in ecstasy, Clare attempted to rise to stand, all the while watching the shuddering edifice of her chest and her engorged nipples, which seemed like twin pinnacles of jasper and seemed to foam in the mists about them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a long time before the peals of the giant pixie\u2019s cry had faded from the mountain ranges, which played catch, back and forth, with the thunderous \u201cOH!\u201d. Having endured the seismic shocks from, first, the giant pixie\u2019s excitement and, second, and altogether, more like an earthquake, her calamitous orgasm, the Captain and her guardsmen clambered to their feet. The Captain readjusted her helmet, which had become skewed when the world shook about them. As the rumbling faded, the Captain steadied herself with her lance and looked at the tremendous pixie laid out amongst the sea of fog. Through the layers of fine, shifting mist, the Captain, who thought the event was now over, could see and hear, from the crunching of the mountains, the gargantuan girl shifting. As a veil of mist passed over, temporarily obscuring the girl from their view, there came, from the Valley, a deep and sonorous \u201cNnnghhh!\u201d The Captain listened, unable to see, to the sounds of the titanic pixie, which sounded oddly, though, because of her size, it was so booming and deep that she could not be sure, like sounds of discomfort, or even of pain. The Captain thought the air felt faintly sticky but she was more attentive to the peculiar burbling noise steadily growing in the atmosphere, like muted thunder heard in the clouds out over the sea. The Captain thought should could define an immense and guttural \u201cFUUUUU-Nnnghhh!\u201d booming from in the mists. /the burbling came again, this time louder. The Captain strained for more amidst the burbling and soon identified fragments of the girl\u2019s long, drawn-out, and quaking murmurs, which came between great pants like that of the bellows of industrial factories, pants which were slowly intensifying almost to growls, as \u201cNghhh\u2026.hnnng...I\u2014m-nnn\u2026.ugggghh\u2026.nnnnghhh-ugh!\u201d; \u201cHngh-Getti\u2014nnnghhh...Too-Ughhhngh.\u201d and \u201cUghhh! Can\u2014nnnnghhh\u2014t...Stop\u2026.G\u2014G\u2014Grow\u2014oh\u2014Oh\u2014OH!\u201d. The rest was disturbed by thunderous moans and by the violent resurgences of the rubbery, burbling sound. Suddenly, from among the milky mists, came the titaness\u2019 arm which clasped the mountainside and, soon after, visible across the sea of fog, they saw the other arm reach forth from the roiling fog, her body still submerged beneath the fog, and gasp at the forested mountainside, she finger digging into the rock. From below there came another moan of apparent pain, another rumbling, and, as the happened, the guards saw, emerging up from surface of the fog, like islands rising from the briny deeps or the irritated carbuncle of a volcano forcing its way up from the planet\u2019s mantle, fit to burst but still growing higher, the summit of the titanic pixies bosom, swelling larger, more and more emerging from the swirling mist, huge, plump, and round. After the briefest of pauses there came another groan of  \u201cUghhhrrrrrrrrh-nnnghuh!\u201d from the submerged girl beneath the mists and this was accompanied by the sudden and unmistakable swelling of her breasts upwards and outwards, so that they loomed up out of the mists like the domes of some eastern temple. The Captain stepped back a few paces and shot a few glances at her guardsmen who must have been a combination of horrified and aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith monumental effort, the strain of which shook the mountainsides, the giant pixie bore her body up, attempting to stand. As they watched the colossal girl rise up through the sea of fog, they were conscious of her shadow spreading farther across the Valley and the slopes, blotting out the pale morning sun. Still more distressing was that, even as the colossal pixie struggled upright and to balance upon legs which saw her easily straddle the wedge of the Valley, the ground beneath her must be all but lost to her sight by now, eclipsed by her engorged bosom. And, indeed, as the Captain and the guards shielded their eyes to look skywards at the swollen titan, they saw the girl\u2019s astonished and pain-wracked face being lost behind her ever-growing bust, which seemed only to be growing bigger and bigger, like a thundercloud brewing or a pair of small moons pitching towards the earth. They saw the giantess wrapped her arms around her bosom and clasp her hands into her flesh, for they were, by now, no longer able to reach around the mighty circumference of her bust, and attempt to draw or hem them in, to squash them back. As she did so, the Captain could distinguish the sound of sloshing, like one had stepped on a hot-water bottle in the dark, but which, amplified by the pixie\u2019s tremendous size had added to it the plangency of the tide lapping against the rocks. But, as much to the giantess\u2019 astonishment as to the Captain or her guards, even as she attempted to control and constrict expansion of her chest, the giant pixie\u2019s fingers, bigger than tree trunks, were splayed and forced apart as mounds of white flesh, rising like soft dough, bulged up from between them! Her chest had, by the stage, began to become so large, even in comparison to her gigantic body, that they started to weigh her down, causing her to crook her huge body more and more over the lush Valley below. If the girl had remained on her back, the Captain thought, as the girl groaned thunderously from the strain, she would have, by now, have been swallowed and, maybe. smothered by the weight of herself, swelling and piling up on top of her. That, the Captain thought, would have simplified things, for there was no telling what was about to happen, save that it could not be good. The Captain caught a glimpse of the girl\u2019s face as she tried to steer her enormous, bloated body, as it suddenly lit up, her eyes and mouth open wide with a mixture of fright and pleasure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clare tried to move, her huge chest hanging beneath her, she was conscious of a cold sensation in her nipples, which meant, she assumed, for she had lost sight on them minutes ago, that her breasts were grazing the damp forest tops at her feet. With a tremendous wrench and snap of her back, Clare used all her might, which was considerable, and could, perhaps, have let her pulverise a mountain, to straighten up, bearing up her gargantuan chest from the ground. She succeeded. But as she did so, leaning back, she felt something. The strain of holding them aloft tightened her chest. Clare gasped as she felt it beginning; this was the relief! Clare grunted and exhaled in a growling gasp. Concentrating on the sensation, somewhere between sexual release and the throbs of pain felt after stubbing your toe, Clare gritted her teeth and breathed boudly, her monument of breastflesh  heaving up and down like snowcapped mountains buckling from cataclysmic movements in the earth\u2019s mantle. At last Clare yelled: \u201cFu---, I\u2019M GONNA BLO-<br>\r\nOHHHHH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her breasts erupted two enormous torrents of milky liquid, which was tinged with forget-me-not blue, falling in two great cascades down into the Valley. It exploded out of her chest with such force that Clare thought it would tear her giant body apart. As she saw her monstrous bosom deflating, Clare could see the milk jetting forth from each swollen nipple in two great rivers, which, in turn, sprayed showers of milk from them. Clare saw the morning light glance one of these falling curtains and light it up with a rainbow, which shimmered there like oil. Moments later, Clare stood, knees together sheepishly, her cheeks tinged with apple-blossom, her bosom reduced to its former plump and succulent size, looking around at the Valley and the dripping forests and mountain slopes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare looked down at the valley below her, where the morning sun illuminated the surface of great lakes of milk, still lying in pools amongst the trees and the rocks, like puddles lay in the street after a rain shower had passed. Clare, from her enormous height, watched as the gleaming pools, which seemed, in the soft light cast upon them, to spark and crackle with sea-green, gradually dispersed themselves, spreading out in rivulets, like veins or some liquid nervous system, or simply seeping into the ground, drunk up by the thirsty roots and vegetation. Clare shaded her eyes; she could see, beyond the mouth of the valley itself, the rivers of milk snaking through the swamps and the forests; she must have, she thought, expressed such a torrent that she had all but flooded the whole basin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.zastavki.com/pictures/originals/2014/Cities_Old_street_after_the_rain_058342_.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.zastavki.com/pictures/origina...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare glanced from the miniature world at her feet to her vastly diminished chest and found no surprise, ultimately, in having flooded the valley; her chest had managed to grow to almost the same size as the rest of her body before the pressure had been relieved. Clare turned her attentions back to the drenched landscape before her. She smiled to see the glitter of the trees in the rays of light passing through the clouds, dusted with milk like morning dew. Clare slowly passed her hand through one of the columns of sunlight that came down from a breaks in the clouds; in a way she was thrilled by this and felt a flutter in her chest at the possibility of absentmindedly brushing through towers of sunlight and, furthermore, given additional cause for elation by the fact that she was now almost on the same scale as these rays of sun. Clare cast her gaze up and down the length of the beam of sunlight and her own body and could not help but smile at their comparable sizes; that she, whom only hours ago had been scarcely larger than a small shrub, could now be measured only using the weather and landscapes. Clare could not help but let for a irruptive giggle of laughter at her own size compared to the column of sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aprilemillo.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/sun-breaks-through-cloud.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://aprilemillo.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Clare looked up at the parting of the grey clouds and tentatively reached up towards them, imagining that she could feel the tips of her fingers brush the soft canopy. It gave her chills to think that she could be considered as a form of natural disaster, like a tornado or an earthquake. Clare lowered her immense arm and looked at the curtain of golden light falling from the clouds and wondered how long it would be before her head was breaking upwards through the clouds, until she towered over the rays of light falling on the landscape, until landforms and weather systems could only be relied upon to describe her body parts, her calves, thighs, or chest. Clare found that, having become so glutted with magic and milk that she felt bloated and tender; her explosive release had served to even out the pressure pent up inside her and now she found herself rejuvenated and almost energetic by comparison. Now that the violent storm of magic in her belly had subsided, and its effects passed, at least for now, Clare found herself finally able to enjoy her newfound stature and the power it brought with it. Even now though, as he stretched and bent the great pillar of her body skywards, she felt, somewhere in the pit of her stomach, a twinge, as if she had dislodged something inside her belly. She suspected she knew this feeling though, the familiar quivering of the insatiable lust for magic that had brought her to this point. Though it was not so powerful right now, Clare knew that this feeling would only intensify as time wore on and that her massive body would begin to demand more and more strongly that she satisfy its need and hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare looked about her, at the sodden landscape, and patted her stomach. It did not worry her as much as it would another, lesser, person that her thirst for magic might be unquenchable, that her body needed magic and was now dependent on it. She wondered what would happen if she didn\u2019t consume magic. Would she shrink? Would she become more unstable? Would her hunger drive her mad? Clare\u2019s growing awareness of her dependence on magic, therefore, worried her only a little for this was compounded by an inward thrill and curiosity to simply see what the fate held in store for her and her body. A shiver ran through Clare\u2019s body when she thought of the ethereal fire in her gut, constantly burning, like some huge blast furnace in the heart of a volcanic mountain, endlessly requiring stoking and fueling, greedily consuming materials and smouldering eternally, to keep it burning and sending molten slag rushing through the flumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was roused from her musings by a faint rumbling beneath her toes. Clare, perplexed and somewhat bemused, patted her body; she did not feel the usually tremors shaking through her body that betrayed one of her immense growth spurts. But, no, as she paused, her immense hands laid across her stomach, she was sure that the rumblings were not coming from her body and that she was not due another explosion of growth. But still the rumbling continued and, if anything, intensified and grew. Clare could see the mountains beginning to judder from the quaking. Clare thought for an instant that her activities, such as stomping around the landscape, the seismic force her growth spurts exerted or the various other acts of passion she had just engaged in, had triggered and actual earthquake. But again, Clare was not sure that was right. Clare looked at the ripples being sent through the pools of milk still left on the landscape, and watched as they drained away, and soaked into the ground. Clare looked for a while at the spot where the milk had soaked away, as if into a cake, for some time before, as the quaking intensified, it hit her. Clare bit her lip, her eyes wide, and thought: \u201cUh oh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was suddenly conscious of the sea of trees at her feet sprouting up about her, growing taller and taller, their trunks thickening and their branches lengthening, made a louder and louder creaking and cracking as the grew taller, as if they were bending in high winds. Clare lurched backwards in colossal, booming footsteps, her arms flailing like the sails of some gigantic windmill, as a cluster of trees sprouted beneath her foot. Clare looked, with wild eyes, as another tree began to grow, and another. Some trees were almost half Clare\u2019s height by now. Clare received a fright and started when she felt something, like a cold brush, grazing and tickling the cheeks of her buttocks and realise, when she turned around, that the top of one conifer was growing up behind her. As Clare moved as best she could to avoid all the sprouting trees, she examined the ground between them and saw the great roots thickening and churning up the ground, bursting out, in some cases, with their sheer girth and coiling up or winding their way up the mountainsides. She saw also the grasses and flowers between the roots proliferating and exploding into veritable jungles, grow, like the trees, taller and taller, swelling up like a great green, geyser. Clare wrapped her hand around a nearby tree and her eyes widened as it thickened and swelled in her hand until her fingers no longer met each other and, before long, could no long wrap around the trunk. She laughed at feeling the creaking and cracking as the tree grew and thickened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.150.parks.ca.gov/pages/150/images/p0068712giantmajesty.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.150.parks.ca.gov/pages/150/im...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare shaded her eyes and looked out over the sea of growing trees and saw the landscape seeming to ripple and undulate, like the surface of the sea, as the plants and trees sprouted ever higher. Clare gasped as she saw the landscape heaving and growing before her eyes, marvelling that her milk, infused with all her volatile magics, had caused a chain reaction of gigantic and spontaneous growth. Although she kept having to dance from spot to spot to avoid being speared by the still growing trees below, it thrilled Clare that she had the power to change the ecosystem around her. She was, Clare thought, like a goddess of life and creation, towering over all creation. But, she thought, she was not born, like the gods who dwelt somewhere in the clouds, she had been created, a manmade, or rather womanmade, goddess\u2014 move over Mother Nature! And now, Clare smiled, dodging a growing oak that was thrusting upwards and poking into the tender flesh of her inner thigh, she had given her gift to the world: the gift of giant growth. The tallest of the trees were now at Clare\u2019s elegant and massive shoulders and still growing, still shaking the ground violently. Clare continued to dream of her new role as the Goddess of Size, the Goddess of Big and of Small. Some gods and goddesses presuded over love, the marshes or cobblers, but she, Clare, was now to preside over size, conferring on things and people her gifts and blessings. Clare strolled along, running her massive hands through the treetops, as if through a field of wheat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later the rumbling of the trees and plants had died away and Clare found herself among a newly grown forest of giant trees, many of which were a head or two higher than her. So, she thought, I am still a giant even in my new forest. The interlocking branches of the trees in the canopy shield the Valley from the sunlight and dappled the ground with spots of warm, yellow light. The smell of the trees exhilarated her and she could still hear the faintest crackings and tremblings from the trees about her. Clare stuck her finger in a patch of sap on the trunk of one of the titanic trees and rubbed it between her thumb and forefinger, smelling it delicately. Clare smiled and wondered what she ought to do, ought to do with her gifts and her newly created Arcadia... </span></div></div>",

Once the valley had stretched out, enclosed by a chain of jagged, dark mountain peaks, whose spindled spires and blades of rock gave the impression sometimes of a collection of giant murex shells arranged across the skyline, and filled by a sea of fog. These mists, for which the region was partly named (Frir being a linguistic corruption of the name given it by its inhabitants, which, if the early pixie explorers are to believed, means \u201cThe fog-sea\u201d), veiled the valley for its length and breadth, obscuring its environs from those standing in the mountains above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for this reason that relatively little was known about the valley or its inhabitants, save for the accounts of a select few explorers. The gnomish mountain explorer and historian Cecil Fizzbottom wrote, in the diary he kept travelling in these regions, of the Frir valley that:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><br>\r\nThis valley lies far north of the Lowland kingdoms of the Pixies, to the east of the Dwarven Highland kingdoms, and is enclosed by mountains as jagged as they are tall, whose pinnacles resemble the mouth of some great creature. Scarcely anything is visible from the mountains above for their lingers in the valley a perennial fog, which obscures the innermost environs. By all accounts, the valley is densely wooded with sprawling quagmire across almost its entirety. The valley is only feasibly accessible at it\u2019s northern border, where it tapers to a scar of marshland and willow trees and where the fog thins slightly. Even then, the descent is sheer and, as far as I can tell, all but unscalable on a return.... </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA later account of the valley, by the eminent, dwarven natural historian and cartographer Lord Gimsteinn was made following an expedition into the Valley lasting eleven months, descending the northern mountains described by Fizzbottom and exploring the Valley for another way out, eventually discovering a narrow gorge, all but invisible in the mist, on the south-eastern limits, which led, eventually to the dales and foothills to the southern dwarven kingdoms. Amongst his descriptions of the valley interior Gimsteinn\u2019s journals contain several accounts of the flora and fauna of the valley. A general passage, early into the expedition, reads: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><br>\r\nThis valley is just fascinating. The wood goes on for miles and miles! The trees are all of a sort and are tall and dark, so tall in fact that they form a canopy. Between this blasted fog and the trees it\u2019s real dark down here on the ground\u2026. We have seen only some wildlife apart from insects, the usual swampy bugs like dragonflies, moths, beetles and spiders and such, but of kinds I have never seen. Large cats had had to be seen off with axes and shields and we tried to catch a large, flocculent and iridescent rabbit, but it vanished. I caught sight of a dryad yesterday, but she quickly disappeared, and what I thought were water nymphs by a rotting pool, but they were bedraggled and sour green, and quickly gone into the stinking mud. Buri claims he heard a fire drake or salamander somewhere in the swamp, but I haven\u2019t seen anything of it. A few nights ago we camped by a clearing, which, come night, turned out to play home to a number of mandrakes! I have never seen these kinds though, or so many different kinds near each other! Needless to say, we had to scarper once they woke up! In the morning we will make our way further south.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of these accounts, very little was known about the Frir valley except what has been related, a complete map of the valley does not exist, and likely, if the native inhabitants of large, blood-sucking and biting insects, bad-tempered nymphs and dryads, savage mandragoras and bloodthirsty animals have anything to do with it, never will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n*<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Now, however,</b></i> since Clare, newly transformed into a veritable goddess on earth, had made her way over those jagged heights, the any travellers to the valley would be met, suddenly, with gigantic trees, which towered high up into the sky, up above the cloudy range of the mountains, their canopy casting the landscape into greenish gloom. Looking down from the peaks, one now saw a vast and tangled expanse of roots, thick as the boulevards of a city, knotted and contorted in a dense labyrinth of passages and walkways. The valley\u2019s constant fog now wound itself in and around the roots of these trees and sank well down into the valley. From on high, one felt they could discern, far down in the dark below, a greenish twilight, throbbing and glowing. Standing on the edge of this colossal forest, one was struck by the silence of it all, save for the creaking of the trees like minor quakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one could really have anticipated the events as they transpired: that Clare would become quite so hungry for size, that she would grow quite so much, that the magic would have quite such a radical effect on her metabolism and body, and that she could have such an extreme effect of her environment! In fact, Clare had not been seen since the transformation of the valley, her huge, bosomy figure being blocked out by the climbing trunks around her. It was thought, or so the scouts reported, that, as the trunks continued to grow to their now gigantic height, that Clare had headed deeper into the valley. They were sure, however, that she was still in there, a creature of her stature was not to be missed elsewhere in the land. But nobody had ventured into the labyrinth of roots, trunks and fog since and no-one had heard a whisper from the titanic pixie deep within... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until months later\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments passed by, during which Clare, standing enormous amongst a forest of newly-grown, towering trees, reflected on the whirlwind of thoughts and sensations associated with her situation now passing through her mind. To think that perhaps only a day ago (she had tended to lose track of time since) Clare had been confined to a dank and dreary cell by that little Empress, but was now enjoying the most incredible sense of freedom and expansiveness conferred on her by her newfound stature! What a lark it all was! Who would have thought that growing several-hundred feet would be so liberating! Clare smiled and breathed deeply, taking in the sweet, cool scent of the trees about her. Clare laid a long-fingered hand on the trunk of one of the trees, looking up to the branches fanning out above even her head, marvelling at their height. It was amazing to think, also, that her body had done this to the landscape, that all this potential had been stocked up inside her, like a mountain reservoir, and had been unleashed all of a sudden! Thinking on it, Clare\u2019s heart almost skipped a beat to wonder about what, if she could so transform an entire landscape, her body was capable of? Perhaps, Clare reasoned, a more accurate question was: what WASN\u2019T she capable of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments more, thoughts crossed Clare\u2019s mind, imagining herself striding across landscapes, straddling mountain ranges like meadow stiles, and reforming them as she saw fit. Clare imagined herself, lying on her side, one long arm resting upon her brow, the other propping up her huge body by her elbow and cradling one gigantic breast in her palm, and, with graceful ease, expressing a fine rain of turquoise milk down upon the parched and stony fields of some small town, like some colossal watering-can, and watching on as the ground rumbled and trembled before huge stalks of corn burst up from the ground, spindling taller and taller; vines of tomatoes erupted larger and larger, like boulders and turnips and carrots heaved the ground as they swelled up below the soil. Clare thought also, in a benevolent mood, of giving her \u201cgift\u201d to livestock, of making a herd of cows the size of elephants, of making a goat into more of a giraffe or even of a chicken the size of a barn! She wildly pictured an enormous goose as big as a church nesting in a town square. Imagine the eggs! World hunger eat your heart out! But why stop there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Clare mused, she could even confer her \u201cblessing\u201d on people if she so wished. If, say, a little gnome was having trouble with a big, bad ogre, Clare reasoned, it would be remiss of her not to give her a little \u201cboost\u201d; maybe an ogre would think twice about tangling with a gnome the size of a cliff-side. Clare amused herself as she thought: Girls, big bust a must? Have a couple of storeys too! Schlong not long enough boys? How about I add a few yards! Perhaps, Clare thought, upon reflection, she should only bestow \u201cthis\u201d (here she hefted her huge bosom) on only her fellow pixies? Seemed like the best idea; make every pixie an amazon! Hmm, but where to stop? Bigger than a human for sure. No more wire cages or glass tanks for those pixies! Of course, the girls would be the biggest, Clare thought matter of factly, it wouldn\u2019t make sense otherwise. Come to think of it, she\u2019d probably make a few, her favourites, just a tad bigger, just a smidge. Maybe she ought to reward them? A little pang hit Clare\u2019s heart as she imagined a busty and broad-hipped pixie, standing at almost twenty feet tall, but scarcely a thimble to Clare, standing on tiptoes to sup from her gigantic nipple; Clare felt herself becoming a little flushed as she imagined that little pixie greedily gulping down mouthful after sweet mouthful of her milk, and watching that little amazon start to swell up and grow right there in her hands, growing until Clare had to cradle her in her arms and practically prise the girl from her breast with gasp, for fear she might grow too large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare breathed deeply, steadying herself against the trees. Of course, she continued to think, she\u2019d have to make sure that this \u201clittle blessing\u201d didn\u2019t find its way to the wrong people. It worried Clare a little, as much as anything could worry someone her size, that she hadn\u2019t been altogether in control of the little \u201coutpouring\u201d that had transformed the valley. It worried Clare to think that another such accident could have some less than ideal results. Clare\u2019s skin crawled a bit as she imagined beetles the size of tanks rampaging down city streets, wasps like small aircraft hovering over rooftops, spiders like threshing machines scaling glass buildings. Clare reflected that she wouldn\u2019t overly like to gush all over a forest only to accidentally turn a harmless little woodland newt into a dragon-sized menace. Furthermore, come to think of it, mountain giants, trolls and dragons, didn\u2019t really need to be much bigger. Might be nice to get pounded on a mountain range though. No that\u2019s idiotic. It concerned Clare even further that she might accidentally erupt all over some people who might be less than pleased with her at the moment. Massive and powerful though she was, probably bottom of Clare\u2019s list of desires was to have Nel or the Empress, or one of their friends, grow big enough to challenge her; Clare could not help but picture herself standing before the Empress who was now a whole torso taller than her and, much to her chagrin, upon turning to escape, finding before her, rising upwards for miles, the creamy, warm edifice of the most enormous and gigantic bosom Clare could imagine, rising before Clare, filling the landscape in all directions, as a truly gargantuan Nel lay outstretched like a cat across the surface of the planet. No. Not ideal. Will have to find a bra to cover these monsters soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare began to stroll slowly through the trees, still thinking, her huge hips grazing the bark as she went. Yes. The only thing she could do to stop that happening would be to grow only some followers. Maybe grow herself a little army. Just to make sure neither Nel or anyone else pulled any strokes on their new Queen- no, Goddess! Because, really, Clare mused, that\u2019s what she\u2019d become, really there was no other way of describing it; it was just a statement of bald fact. Yes, grow some servants just a bit bigger than the rest, just to make sure. The Empress has her honour guards; no reason a Goddess shouldn\u2019t have some too. Of course, she\u2019d do all the rest too, all the lovely stuff she hoped for, maybe just to see if she could. Maybe she\u2019d even \u201cadjust\u201d all the pixies\u2019 sizes, but not Nel and the Empress, better that they remained \u201cungrown.\u201d But that\u2019s a thought, isn\u2019t it, Clare mused, her own army of amazons, even giants! She could evangelise the world with a resource like that at her disposal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare\u2019s musings were interrupted as she worked her way through the maze of trees and undergrowth with some difficulty by the most terrible gurgling and growling from her stomach. Ughh, starving; must be all that growing! It occurred to Clare that hadn\u2019t eaten all that much since she\u2019d started her growing. Sure she\u2019d gulped down a bunch of ore and a magic lake or two, and had probably swallowed a few bystanders in the process, but that was only so much fuel for a growing girl! It hadn\u2019t really occurred to her until now how she might best sustain a body like this and her stomach involuntarily churned at the thought of sweet sugar rolls and butter, fresh from the oven, now only a granule of dust to her. But whar had reminded her of this. All the while she\u2019d been in the forest she\u2019d been catching hints of a smell, sweet and cool, from somewhere. Sniffing about her Clare realised that all along it had been the trees that she\u2019d been smelling. Approach the nearest one she hunted about for the source. Upon inspection she found the smell on her fingers too; it had been the sap. Ah, that\u2019s it. Being well-disposed to drinking dew-drops and cups of flower nectar, like all pixies, Clare dabbed a sticky patch on a nearby tree and gave her finger a suck, mulling over the taste. Her countenance brightened for the sticky, greenish sap was simply delicious! Should bottle this! Licking her finger again, Clare dabbed at the patch again and stuck her fingers in her mouth. Her stomach gurgled again as Clare abandoned all pretenses and licked the patch. Smacking her lips Clare sought a more practical solution and, seeing no other, decided to see what this new body could do and, gritting her teeth, she struck the trunk a thunderous blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Clare howled in pain, quite a sound at her size. Apparently these trees were harder than they looked, even for her. Sucking her fist, huge, green eyes watering, Clare looked about her. Her stomach was rumbling awfully as she hunter between the trees. At last her efforts turned up, from amidst the massive toadstools on the ground, a rock, easily the size of a house, but which Clare held comfortable as a tool. Clare briefly flirted with the idea of nibbling on a mushroom, for, according to a human story she\u2019d once heard, they could, apart from making great houses for pixies, confer on the eater the ability to change size, shrinking down or growing up and up! Clare decided against this, figuring all she\u2019d get was poisoned. Such was her hunger that moments later Clare had opened up the side of a nearby tree and, discarding her rock, dipped her hand into the sap welling up and dripping from the wound. Minutes passed as Clare ate the sap, like a bear sticking its paw into a beehive, extracting honey. As Clare ate greedily though she became conscious that she wasn\u2019t feeling her best, feeling sickly and dizzy. Did she eat too much too quickly or was it just too sugary. Fingers still in her mouth, Clare stepped back from the tree trunk, the world starting to spin slightly about her giant head. Almost overcome by dizziness and stomach cramps, Clare nearly collapsed back against another tree, where she leaned, her eyes cast upwards to the woozy canopy above. Indeed, as the moments passed by, and Clare\u2019s began to flush, it seemed like the wavering canopy was drawing closer, pressing down on Clare from above. Fighting the urge not to vomit from dizziness Clare tried to fix her gaze on the trees before her, but found her vision swimming up and down as she were afloat at sea. Clare shut her eyes for a moment, trying to be sick from the sap, but was perturbed by the most awful abrasive, chafing feeling between her shoulderblades and, as time wore on, between her buttocks. Opening her eyes, Clare unstuck her rear from the trunk of the tree. Still dizzy, Clare rubbed the red skin about her cheeks. So big back there I\u2019m wrapping round the bloody thing. Clare shut her eyes again, trying to gather herself; this was perhaps not how she\u2019d envisaged life as a goddess, at best tripping her but in a giant forest with a sore butt or at worst poisoned and slowly expiring. Clare opened her eyes and looked at her hands and down at her giant chest; the seemed to be throbbing and undulating. Yup, hallucinating\u2026brilliant. What probably went some way to clearing Clare\u2019s head, though, was, as she inspected her long, tapering hands, her huge, that her blonde head was suddenly struck from above with a thud. At first Clare, as she clamped her hand to her head and let out a yelp, thought something had fallen on her. Looking up, she had to swipe a tangle of twigs from her eyes. Clare stepped back as much as she dared for her dizziness and so the branch that had hit her continue to slowly fall past her head and shoulders. In her addled state of mind it took Clare a little longer than was proper to realise that yes, she was feeling sick and that, yes, it wasn\u2019t impossible that she was hallucinating, but it was also certainly true as well, without a shadow of a doubt, that she was growing! No sooner had Clare noticed her slowly expanding body than her growing eased off, although her stomach pain and wooziness only abated slightly. Clare, still groggy, could feel the offending branch from earlier lightly grazing the underside of her right breast. Steadying herself against a tree, which creaked a touch ominously with her increased size, Clare closed her eyes again for a moment, still not quite over her nausea. Obviously the sap had made her grow again. But why? Clare reasoned that the sap must be suffused with raw magic after she\u2019d gushed a fair torrent of her magic-laden milk over the valley; they\u2019d just sponged it all up. And now it\u2019d made her grow again! Resting her head against the trunk of a tree, Clare was a little conflicted; she felt terrible after that growth spurt, but her hunger was a little satiated and, well, she was bigger and bustier than ever! There was a pause during which Clare, head pressed against the trunk, could only hear the forest murmurs and the creaking of the trunks and branches. The sweet smell caught her attention again, wafting up from the trees like a vapor or a mist. And while she leaned there she found herself thinking of her new role in this world, as she had done shortly before, as remaking things as she saw proper, as, for want of a better word, a real goddess. And she found herself thinking of her vision of herself lying contentedly upon her side before her subjects, some mere humans grateful for her bounty and others tall, womanly pixies, all dwelling in the shadow of her mountainous breast in complete happiness. But, another vision clouded her addled mind and happy thoughts, that vision of a gargantuan Nel, looming over Clare and stretching further than the horizon, her prone body curved catlike around the planet; what was a mountain compared to a moon!? What if Nel should grow and grow and GROW!? No, Clare thought, head still swimming from the sap, she was indeed becoming a goddess, that was certain, but for what she wanted to achieve, to realise the potential welling up inside her, she\u2019d have to get much, much bigger...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare was still swooning among the trees from the heady effects of the magic-laden sap, which seemed to linger in her veins and her brain. Holding her stomach, which continued to burble like muted thunder, Clare brooded following her sap-induced growth spurts. It niggled at Clare that, gigantic though she was, both Nel and the Empress could cause her any worry! That they could make her feel insecure about her size and her power. It was ridiculous, thought Clare, for she had grown so much that Nel and the Empress were no more than motes to her, like flecks of pollen before her huge, green eyes. And yet, just as a tiny speck of pollen can be enough to bring on a fit of hay fever or a single spore is enough to bring about infection, the tiny bodies of Nel and the Empress made Clare begin to worry, for none knew as well as she how tiny things can suddenly blow up. For Clare knew that her escape from the dungeon and her subsequent expansions, from tall pixie to giantess and, from there, to voluptuous goddess, could not have escaped the notice of the Empress and her friend and that they must have been, while Clare had made her way across the landscape, growing bigger along the way, industriously seeking a way to foil her, whether this involved, as it were, deflating her or, maybe worse, inflating themselves Clare could not know. Indeed, as she stood amongst those towering trees, it occurred to Clare that at her immense size Nel and the Empress could carry out plans to stop her right under her nose and she\u2019d be too big to notice until it was too late! It was very inconvenient being so large, thought Clare, although it was only natural that some might resent the rise of a new goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare foresaw herself sprawled out across a mountain range, a huge hand resting in the cool waters of a nearby lake, and dreaming contentedly. But, all of sudden, Clare noticed a cloud of birds rising from the treetops of a nearby woodland and soon glimpsed the towering form of the Empress making her way towards Clare through the woods! Clare roused herself, lifting her head from her hand; she cocked an eyebrow to behold the Empress, thousands of feet of toned, honey-coloured muscle and scarlet hair, with huge, brassy breasts bouncing with each footstep, and a thicket of red hair crowning the Empress\u2019s mighty, powerful hips and haunches! Rising, Clare sat upright atop the mountains like a throne, her huge hands resting on far-distant peaks, and smiled at the Empress who seemed to Clare, as she drew closer, like a child wading through the grass, quiety confident. But, all of a sudden, Clare\u2019s smirk dimmed as the Empress, as she strode towards Clare with her jaw clenched, suddenly ballooned in size, again and again, doubling and redoubling her height, until she loomed over Clare and the mountain range, casting her shadow before her. So startled was Clare that she stumbled backwards over the blue mountains as she rose to her feet. Clare craned to neck upwards as the darkening form of the Empress loomed over her, coming closer all the while. Even as Clare backed away from the Empress, though, Clare heard, from the inky clouds mounting behind her, the most terrific rumble of thunder, long, sticky and drawn out like stretching rubber. Clare turned from the giant Empress and was confronted by a gigantic, black chasm in the air before her. Clare\u2019s eyes followed the seam of the chasm up and up and up, towering up beyond the dark clouds and, Clare could discern that on either side there rose great crags of faintly blue rock, smooth as the inside of an oyster shell. Clare reeled backwards as the chasm seemed to gape and yawn before her, as if opening to swallow her; Clare was conscious also of the thunder from above again and the smooth rock walls seeming to shift. A blast of wind came down from on high, parting the clouds above Clare. Clare lifted her eyes upwards, while the Empress stomped ever closer, and to her horror saw, through the ring of parted clouds, Nel\u2019s gargantuan face peering down over the gigantic bulwark of her bosom. Clare broke put into a cold sweat, stuck between a rock and a soft place, or maybe between the devil and the big, blue pixie! The Empress now was upon Clare (gosh she too was enormous, by now) and reached down to snatch Clare from her feet, lifting her up through the clouds, smiling wickedly down at the huge Clare held between her fingers. Clare struggled in the Empress\u2019s grasp, but even as she did so the Empress advanced on Nel and her endless plain of chest-flesh, while the titanic Nel laughed like a volcano and held her tremendous mammaries tight. Clare could see the vast abyss of cleavage yawn before her, as if in eagerness Nel had expanded larger again, ready to swallow her up! But, no, Clare thought to herself, in the midst of her daydream, she was the one in charge! It was her that had been transformed into a goddess, not them! She had more magic in on finger than any of them! And accordingly, as these thought flowed through Clare\u2019s mind, the scene still there in her mind\u2019s eye dissolved into one where Nel and the Empress had indeed grown gigantic, but they no longer held a doll-like Clare, ready to plunge her into a chasm of vast and sweaty cleavage, but instead both lay pressed to the landscape, as if under a fallen tree-trunk, under the immense weight of Clare\u2019s buttocks, which rose up from the earth like pale moon pressed into the soft mantle of the planet, smooth, warm and huge! A hand larger than some countries grasped appreciatively the flesh of one monumental cheek, while Clare, sitting on a whole continent as if it were a tuffet, craned over her shoulder to appreciate her rivals pressed underneath her! Clare heaved an immense sigh of satisfaction at the thought and wondered if she might, if she were just to get a little bit bigger, if she take a bite from the moon floating above her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her stomach, Clare pursed her lips as she thought all this over, the smell of the sap rising from the trees. Waking from her sap-fueled day-dream, Clare set her jaw, and grasped the trunk of a nearby tree. Sweat broke out across Clare\u2019s brow and her magic-fueled body and her face flushed as she exerted herself and muscles she did not even know she had. A tremendous groaning became a thunderous cracking which accompanied Clare\u2019s managing to bend and break the upper portion of the tree, snapping off the treetop and letting it tumble to the forest floor. Clare stood panting from the force of her exertion, hands on her thighs, looking down at the splintered trunk, which was now gathering dewdrops and puddles of sap as green as malachite, swelling up from the wood like an underground spring.  As the sap welled up Clare stooped, the glow from the sap lighting her huge cheeks while her enormous breasts brushed the branches below. Clare dipped her long fingers into the glowing pool, drawing up a long, sticky strand, as when a spoon is lifted from a pot of honey, and placed them in her mouth. Again and again Clare dipped in her hands to scoop up the magic-laden sap, her huge form hunched over the broken trunk like a bear breaking into a hive, gorging on the comb and the honey alike. As she did so Clare found her lips and chin becoming impossibly sticky with sap and her body became increasingly adorned with patches of sap as it dripped from her fingers or was off on her bulging hips. When Clare found her finger tacking across wood, she cast about, wiping her mouth as best she could, and set herself to felling another tree, for each tree was glutted with sap, far more than one might expect! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for what seemed like hours; from on high, on perhaps the tallest mountain in the land, one could probably only hear the cacophonous crashing of trunks like skyscrapers falling, and maybe, through shifts and thinning of the mists, a great clearing in the otherwise unbroken throng of the trees. Perhaps, also, one could have caught sight of the dark and massive figure sending the trees crashing to the ground. At all events, after some time had passed, the groaning of the falling timber was replaced by a new, animal groaning and the heavy crashing of the trunks was replaced by another, duller thumping. After gorging herself time and time again on the magic sap, Clare could now be seen making her way through the gigantic forest she had created with some difficulty, squeezing herself between the trunks, and walking with a ponderous, waddling gait, her stomach bloated and distended, filled to bursting with sap. Rubbing her stomach as she edged between two trees, Clare could not stifle a sudden belch, which rang out through the canopy. Clare groaned and clutched at her back as she wander on. Within a few minutes, Clare had reached a glade of sorts, into which sunlight was falling, showing the vapours rising from the forest floor. Laying herself down against the gnarled root of a huge tree, Clare regarded herself and the great dome of her hugely swollen stomach, running her hands across it affectionately, as if she were carrying a child inside her. Clare groaned with pain but smiled to think of the veritable green sea of magic sap, like jellied frog-spawn now swilling around and fermenting inside of her. Clare could almost see the new life stirring inside her and swimming in that green sea, as in a snowglobe: monster-breasted nymphs, dryads with hips like town walls, and mermaids as big as whales. Clare could not help but laugh a little at the thought of the new world she might soon create for herself, of what she would soon become! Soon Clare felt a trembling in her stomach, a rippling starting to pass through her; she could feel her stomach and the sap quivering; grinding herself into the forest floor, Clare panted as she clutched at her stomach and a nearby trunk and began a resounding groan, feeling the quickening inside her,  as if now ready to heave a new world from herself, ready to become what she may...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Nel had just awoken from a fitful night\u2019s sleep. In the days since Clare had effected her escape from the palace dungeons, outgrown the alchemical vault and proceeded to wreak havoc on the outlying areas, and, by all accounts delivered to the Empress, managing to grow more and more, the Empress had moved to a chalet owned by the crown in the hills, for her own safety should Clare return to the palace, and she had insisted that Nel be allowed to accompany her. Despite reservations from the captain of the captain of the Empress\u2019 Honour Guard (What if Nel should suddenly grow immense also!?), Nel had accompanied the entourage. Joining them also were the court Archmage and Grand Sorceress, though in a mostly advisory capacity. The chalet was set some miles from the palace grounds, far back on the sloping green hills that bordered the royal lands of the pixies, amongst tall and dark coniferous woodlands, generally known to exist, but its location not commonly known. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNel awoke in her room on the west side of the chalet; she and the Empress for matters of etiquette slept in separate rooms, though Nel partly suspected that Captain Alexandra, a mighty pixie in her own right, who might easily have overpowered Clare prior to her tremendous growth spurt, was suspicious of Nel\u2019s motive in laying with the Empress, perhaps having terrible vision of Nel sudden erupting in size and pounding the Empress flat, who, even in spite of Nel\u2019s recent growth, was a towering pixie in her own right. Of course, the problem was that neither Kassandra nor Alexandra or Nel were big enough to handle Clare! All the same, it did irk Nel a little to see the suspicious look Alexandra would shoot her, from under her dragonhide helmet, if she were to see Nel readjusting her overtight dress, as if Nel\u2019s chest might suddenly explode and engulf them all like and avalanche. Nel stretched, the covers slipping from her breasts, bundling up around her hips. Still groggy, Nel scratched a breast and could not help but smirk a little at her newfound bustiness and rose to begin her morning, nearly knocking her head on the posters of the bed as she did so. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Empress had spent the morning in council with the Alexandra, the archmage and the grand sorceress and Nel was left to her own devices. Wandering among the meadows, Nel enjoyed greatly the fresh breeze coming from down the valley, rippling across the grasses and bobbing the heads of the mountain roses. Nel walked from the chalet, though she had been warned, sternly, not wander too far, and, enjoying the early sunshine so much, she sat down in a sunny spot, upon a mossy rock, doing her best to tuck her dress under her. Nel sat there in silence, lost in thought. She had been sick with anxiety since Clare\u2019s escape, preying on her dreams at night and her thoughts during the day. For even though the others felt gravely about the situation, Nel knew Clare better, from before her hunger for magic had started to drive her, and knew that Clare had a mean streak when she was crossed and was wont, in such a situation, to go to wild extremes in her attempts to get even. Nel recalled a time when they were at school, that Clare had been made out to be a fool by their potion instructor for some reason. Clare\u2019s response had been to obsessively study for months, until she knew outside and in the topic on which she had been mocked and more! So much so that she had got the better of the instructor in class, exposing him, so she thought, as the fool he was. It was around that time, Nel recalled that Clare\u2019s puberty had really kicked in and during this time she rocketed upwards, eventually becoming tallest in the year by head and shoulders, so that she positively towered over the instructor when he attempted to upbraid her for her insolence. It was probably around this time, reflected Nel, that Clare had learned to associate superior size with superiority. Nel played with stalk of grass and shuffled her bum on the rock; she had a funny feeling that she too had grown since arriving at the chalet, maybe all that fatty milk from the upland cows. That was perhaps the source of Nel\u2019s constant worry, the knowledge that Clare might go to silly lengths to square the circle with the Empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel was looking back towards the chalet when a large flock of birds flew overhead and Nel was conscious of an almost imperceptible rumbling, perhaps it was only in her ears. Nel could see the  guards exchanging glances though and  she definitely felt a kind of trembling in the air.  The wind had picked up and was soughing in the trees. Soon Nel could feel a rumbling in the ground. Looking down, Nel could see the little pebbles jittering, ever so slightly, by her feet. There had, Nel recalled been reports from outlying territories of increased seismic activity, but not, so far as she knew, in these vales. But as time went by, the rumbling soon intensified. Nel could see that it had attracted the attentions of those indoors for she could see the gleam of Alexandra striding from the doorway of the chalet. Nel steadied herself against the trunk of a tall conifer as the rumbling began to grow into a shaking. Nel could see Alexandra dispatching a guard to quickly ascend the slopes of the mountain, to the small; ornate watchtower concealed there. Nel watching the small figure nimbly glide up the slope, weaving in and out of the rocks, when the shaking grew again. It comforted Nel little to reason that the rumbling, whatever it was, was near unbroken and, therefore, could not be the thunderous footfalls of an approaching Clare. But this did not solve the mystery of the quake, for even as Nel thought this the shaking seemed to redouble and Nel had to cling to the tree to keep from falling. As the quaking continued, Nel followed as best she could, the guardsman\u2019s ascent. She watched him reach the top and disappear into the thicket of gorse at the top. For several agonising moments Nel waited, seeing that Alexandra and the guards did so also. Nel realised soon that she had been holding her breath and gasped abruptly. Momentarily, Nel saw the guardsman bolt from the thicket, descending the slopes like lightning, making towards the chalet. Nel continued to look about her, seeing a few rocks now tumbling down the slope before, before she could see Alexandra wildly and frantically gesticulating towards her, seeming to beckon her back to the chalet; Nel had not seen the captain so discomposed as this. Nel started across the meadow as the thundering of the ground became greater still, so much so that as she crossed again through the long grasses Nel was bowled from her feet as the thundering and quaking grew still more severe. Only mildly bruised, Nel wondered, her vision juddering with the landscape, if the world were not splitting asunder and half expected to see the ground opening up before her. She rose unsteadily to a half-stooped position and made her way towards the chalet, where, she could see, Alexandra was making ready the carriages for the Empress and her guests, who were confusedly standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut Nel\u2019s eyes were drawn the range of the hills, where Alexandra was suddenly pointing and yelling with renewed fury. From above the rim of the hills Nel could see a shadowy outline rising above the morning mists clinging to the thicket of gorse, vast and black, as if a volcano were thrusting up from the valley beyond. Nel could see the arc of this shadow spanning, as it rose, the entire chain of the hills, turning honey-white as the morning sun fell upon it in patches, like some enormous white sunrise, or the moon rising over the horizon. The moon-like dome continued to rise over the hill-line, rumbling like thunder, become pearly and glittering as the mists settled up its vast rondure. Nel could see, along the distant chain of the mountains, another such form looming. It slowly dawned on Nel as it had already on the others what she was seeing, for it seemed so impossibly large that it was an impediment to her realisation, that is until she saw, looming through the fine, golden mists rising from the wet earth, a vast crag or excrescence of ruby affixed to the vast rondure of that swelling honey-globe, projecting outwards, proudly like the spire of a cathedral or the summit of a mountain. But as the great dome rose thunderingly, so too did the reddish crag, taking on definition through the mist, seeming now more like a pyramid, but again, as its contours softened, more like a levelled hilltop or a slag-heap. Like the light of day, realisation immediately forced its way into Nel\u2019s brain: a nipple\u2026 And as Nel realised this the scene rising before her coalesced; she realised the huge, honey-coloured domes could only be a monstrous pair of breasts, ploughing across the landscape! And, indeed, these could belong to only one person, confirmed maybe unnecessarily by the dimly visible mole on the vast expanse of expanding flesh, like a small crater on the face of the moon, and that person, though perhaps she needed a more appropriate term now, was Clare\u2026 Nel realised that Alexandra\u2019s fear was that this expansion was far from over and that those monstrous mammaries, slipping over dales and valleys as they grew would swell over the rim over the mountains, as the sea breaks through a seawall, and engulf them all! Nel scrabbled to her feet as the titanic breast looming over the valley surged above her. Appearing now, over the rim of that gargantuan breasts, half-concealed by white cloud, was the terrible and radiant blonde head. Nel reached the waiting carriage and cast a look back again as she made to enter at the goddess-like visage of her friend, her immense green eyes lighting up the clouds veiling her face. Whatever Clare had done this time, however far she\u2019d gone, she was now truly gigantic and, as she continued to grow, her body sprawling across the landscape, there was no telling what else she was in the midst of becoming...</span></div></div>",

The Empress, the Archmage and the Grand Sorceress had already bundled into the carriage, making for quite a squeeze, and, as she reached it, Nel glanced back, as she clasped the doorframe and had put her foot on the step to hoist herself in, looking up at the gigantic dome of creamy flesh towering up above the mountains, growing ever rounder and more full as the moments passed, while the vast reddish discs of Clare\u2019s aereola widened and stretched across its surface like the spot on Jupiter or the sanguine iris of some colossal eye, and in its midst Clare\u2019s nipple grew and lengthened as if it were a volcano tumescing up from the earth\u2019s mantle, positively engorged with magma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/images/content/jupiter-earth-320.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/images/cont...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel mounted the carriage and urgently attempted to squeeze uncomfortably into the already packed seating. Nel cursed under her breath; she was certain she had grown since last she had been in this carriage. She was internally quite proud of herself for managing to fit with so little hassle and un such a rush, but, then again, was basically oblivious to the Archmage and Grand Sorceress\u2019 panicked shuffling to the corners of the bench to avoid being swallowed by Nel imposing rear, where they now sat uncomfortably cramped. The carriage rocked as Alexandra mounted the front alongside another the chalet\u2019s retainer. Nel heard him gasp to the Captain, \u201cYe Gods, Ma\u2019am, she\u2019s gigantic!\u201d Alexandra angrily muttered something in response that was drowned out by the now incessant rumbling, a deafening rubbery sound like elastic thunder. Nel felt the carriage beginning to move off, towed by the eagles down the path to the chalet. Nel attempted to crane her neck back to see the scene unfolding, but could only manage a tessellated glimpse through the latticed window at the mountainsides and the swelling monument of snowy breast-flesh rising above. Nel returned her attentions to the carriage. She saw the Empress looking grave as the carriage trundled on and Nel wondered what was running through Kassandra\u2019s mind at this moment. Nel more than expected that the others, much like herself, were anxious that they were in very real danger of being crushed to death in this valley, swallowed up like motes of pollen in a field beneath Clare\u2019s body. But preying on the Empress\u2019 mind must have been the worrying thought that, even supposing they were not crushed, that they did escape, how could they ever stop a creature like Clare? To whom huge dragons were like bothersome flies about her person? Vast lakes dwindled into puddles before her now and great chains of jagged mountains seemed like little more than filigree on the hem of a green quilt or like a string of blue-grey stones laying across her colossal bosom. Indeed, this thought weighed heavily on Nel at this moment, as the carriage gathered speed, preparing to take to the skies. And, moreover, as the carriage struggled into the air with a succession of clattering bumps, the one fear, that is, the fear that they might be crushed, started to be allayed, the other fear continued grow and grow in Nel\u2019s mind, while above the mountains so too did Clare\u2019s monstrous breasts and, beyond her view, the rest of Clare\u2019s titanic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/wp-content/uploads/mountain-names.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/wp-co...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage gained height, the occupants clung on as it was rocked by bouts of turbulence, always the case with the wind funneling down from the mountains, but perhaps exacerbated by Clare\u2019s breathing in the distance. As the climbed higher and higher, Nel could now see more comfortably from the window. They were just drawing level with the tops of the hills when there came a tremendous booming and the most apocalyptic crunching. All eyes were drawn to the windows of the carriage with this. Nel quickly supposed, as was soon confirmed, that Clare\u2019s gargantuan bustline had at last reached the mountains, colliding with a massive shock, such as the force of growth pumping through her body, and was now pushing up against the mountainside as she continued to grow bigger! As Nel leant forward, the better to see, displaying her own chasm of cleavage to the seats opposite, she could see, as they were now level with the mountaintops, Clare\u2019s immense chest pressing up against the peaks, which were, for the moment, seeming to hold back the bosomy tide so that, as Clare continued to expand, the seemed to bulge up behind the natural barrier larger and larger, piling up like huge mounting clouds. But as time passed, so Clare grew ever larger and her breasts ever more voluminous and Nel could see huge, rubbery bulk of Clare\u2019s breasts, as the cracking seemed to worsen, start to bulge over of the mountain ridge, swelling through passes between the peaks. Nel could see the jagged teeth of the highest peaks stabbing into the heedless bulwark of growing flesh much as a knitting-needle rests on the surface of a balloon and could not help but hope that Clare might suddenly deflate herself or burst and send herself scudding into the distance. But no such luck, and Nel could tell, as anyone could, that Clare\u2019s breasts were growing ever larger, ploughing to the landscape as their owner lengthed across it. Nel felt now that if she looked up into the sky she could not possibly make out the extent of Clare, instead, all she could do was stare, as the carriage rose above the mountains, uncomprehendingly at the vast, white wave of tit-flesh now overwhelming the mountains as the orb of boiling milk overcomes the lip of a saucepan. Nel braced herself for the moment when the wall would give way, explosively sending Clare\u2019s gargantuan chest flooding into the valley, engulfing it in soft, creamy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did not come. Nel opened her eyes. She looked again, as the climbed, and fancied that the terrible rumbling and crumbling was dying down. As a few moments wore by, no-one seemed to breathe, some of them doubtless anticipating Clare was about to undergo a growth spurt the likes of which could not comfortably be imagined! But nothing, save for the creaking and cracking of the landscape as Clare heaved each one of her breaths. All those in the flying carriage exchanged glances; it looked like, at least for the moment, Clare\u2019s growth had abated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of growing receded; Clare opened her massive green eyes, looking down through layers of cloud at the vast gorge of cleavage proceeding from her and the gigantic, fat globes it divided, bundled up against some mountain range, which dug into her chest not unpleasantly, and smiled. Almost involuntarily pressing her hips down upon whatever part of the landscape she lay on Clare let out a long and satisfied groan. \u201cJust. look. what. I\u2019ve... become!\u201d Clare breathed in voice so thunderous and deep that it could almost not be heard. Rolling onto her side, moving slowly as if stiff from her growth spurt, Clare lay outstretched on the landscape, her head resting upon one hand and surveyed herself and the landscape around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar to the south, a town on the brink of the magical forest that edged the pixie kingdom, made famous by logging wood of the most immaculate, wondrous grain, cowered in their homes and inside the mills at the huge pair of feet now lying by their town, their soles furrowed like some endless field in the sky, with curled toes big enough to squash them all. Beyond them gigantic, round thighs stretched north towards the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town whose library Clare had ransacked early in her mad pursuit of magic to devour, now pointed to the not-too-distant sky in horror to see looming over their quiet little town the monstrous peach-shaped form of an ass so unthinkably large that some wonder if the moon had not fallen to earth! The shadow cast by those giant cheeks loomed over the town, which would less than a berry to those buttocks, and some of them, amateur doomsayers, wondered if they weren't one bout of indigestion away from being blown from the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far north, a Dwarven thane, glancing through his telescope towards the pixie lands, where there had been talk of some disturbance at luncheon, discerned, one the clouds had shifted the most jaw-dropping sight he ever did see. Such was the violence of the shock that he did not comprehend at first. Dropping the telescope, he could still see them, though it was many frozen miles distant, blue and hazy: boobs. Gargantuan and plump, bulging and ripe, tiered atop one another and pouring down onto the land below in an immense love-heart, spreading out under their own weight like stacked buns. Indeed, the nipples seemed to glare at him through the clouds upon those huge, snowy mounds like cherries lodged in thick cream gushing from Paradise! He resolved to stop drinking shortly after\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop this all, this goddess\u2019 frame, sat Clare\u2019s immense, golden head, like a temple of the air, gleaming and magnificent in the sunlight as she hair streamed down beside her. Of course, Clare was far too big now to have noticed even the chalet, let alone the winged carriage bearing Nel and the Empress. Looking at Clare outstretched on the green landscape as they flew from her and gained height, Nel could not help but imagine Clare as some immense and fat grub or caterpillar upon a leaf. Even as she did so, Nel felt a little lurch in her stomach, for what did caterpillars do but eat and grow, eat and grow more! That is until they transformed into a final form. Looking at Clare now, Nel could not help but wonder if Clare was not still unhappy with this form, immense though it was, and if she still did not hunger for more! Casting a glance at Kassandra\u2019s pale and grave face across the carriage, Nel could tell that the Empress was thinking the same...</span></div></div>",

Clare closed her eyes and smiled, breathing in deeply, hearing only the winds blowing through her hair and the groaning creak of the landscape beneath her as she reclined. She smiled blithely, as if thinking warmly of childhood happinesses. Relinquishing her moist breast, Clare ran her hand slowly up and down the prodigious slopes of her hips and waist, as if polishing the sides of some ancient, marmoreal urn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wordsworth.org.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GreekUrn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://wordsworth.org.uk/blog/wp-content...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes again Clare soaked in the view about her. As the morning wore on, the mists were rising from the plains all about Clare as she lay there, basking in the fresh sunlight passing in long fingers from the far-distant mountains. Clare idly eyed the great patches of sunlight on her skin, before slowly dropping her gaze to appreciate the shade she cast on the landscape behind her. Owing to her size, the sun had not at this moment reached all of the valley, leaving the little woodlands, fields and house in damp and musky gloom beneath the gigantic, clefted edifice of Clare\u2019s backside. Clare relished this side for a moment and continued to take pleasure in the reverberations and echoes her body made as it moved even slightly upon the plains. Gazing down the length of herself, Clare appreciatively regarded the sprawling, humid jungle cinched between her mountainous thighs. Still contentedly smiling, Clare turned her gaze to those far-distant peaks; she loved the idea that she could be seen for miles around and that she could survey all this. She tried to imagine what it must look like to a wanderer in those mountains, to look out over the sea of clouds in the valleys and see her reposing amongst the gold and pale-blue mists, both enormous and voluptuous, a terrestrial goddess outstretched like a marble mountain range of smooth or gigantic marble! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artble.com/imgs/3/f/4/534414/wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.artble.com/imgs/3/f/4/534414...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the wet from the clouds, but the thought of this gave Clare gooseflesh, which broke out over her arms like dunes and stiffened her huge nipples into mountain peaks. Clare was seized by a longing to see herself, to take stock of herself entirely. But where? She was so huge now that she could only really hope to find a mirror in the surface of the sea! Again, this thought thrilled Clare, just thinking of how she might drink mountain lakes dry and could probably even wade across the sea as if it were a lily-pond, the waves lapping about her hips, and sit upon the islands of an archipelago like they were cushioned stools! Clare kneaded a giant breast as she wondered if, what with all this power, she could drink the seas dry? Still dreamily kneading, Clare continued to muse, looking down, past the slope of her chest, at the mountain range that had cradled her growing boobs, and wondered if she could, if she wanted to, sweep it from the earth with her hand? Withdrawing her glance, Clare eyed her monstrous chest for just a moment, marvelling at the network of bluish veins across them, like many-channelled rivers and tributaries that, as they pumped magic-enriched blood though her, fructified the fertile delta of her areolas and nipples. Certainly, she had only been playing when her chest had strained against those mountains, just wanting to watch herself piling up. There was no longer any doubt in Clare\u2019s mind of whether she could pulverise those mountains, or whether she could now crush those towns in her shadow, or elsewhere in the valley, through which she may have passed but had now completely outgrown, with one huge breast or one giant butt cheek, mashing them like strawberries beneath herself. On top of this, visions came to Clare of herself licking up whole forests with her tongue, of herself drinking in whole expanses of cloud or herself sucking the magma from the spout of a volcano, as if to suck the earth hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts came to Clare, of herself and her own massiveness, she was becoming increasingly aroused and, as blood started to flush in patches, in her high cheeks and in her chest, the casual kneading of her breast became more vigorous and concerted. Still rubbing her breast, Clare\u2019s other hand made its way down her body, passing over the vast, white plains of her belly and the foothill of her abdomen, making for the dense jungle beyond. The colour was rising high in Clare\u2019s face as she started to roll lazily onto her back, heedless of anything beneath her, splaying her immense legs wide so that they spanned clear of the valley. Clare lay there, closing her eyes again, letting fantasy take hold. Day-dreams came flowing of herself rising over the rim of the horizon, her huge eyes and nose seeming to span the sky, as she examined the world like an orange before her, so gigantic that she could squash planets between her breasts! She foresaw herself swallowing whole stars, snuffing out their fiery glow with only a mild burp as an afterthought. Her fantasies grew more carnal as she imagined herself clutching the earth in a wide embrace, her cheek to the landscape, gasping in ecstasy, as some gigantic lover thundered down upon her backside from above, having hand-plucked this strapping lad from a nearby mountain village (even less than a gnat between her fingernails) and bid him drink her sweet milk from the peak of her mountainous nipple. Still in the throes of this fantasy, Clare imagined seeing the tiny speck atop her nipple beginning to swell as this young lad tasted her milk and soon she could see the little figure kneeling atop her erect nipple, stooping to drink further. Clare bit her lip as she imagined the figure slipping from her nipple, grown too large already to remain perched there, but clinging there and continuing to suckle; Clare marvelled at the doll-like figure clutching her nipple and clocked, with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension, the already sizeable growth of the lad\u2019s member. Atop her breast Clare felt the lad getting heavier, hunching over her aching nipple, and could now see definition in the figure, muscles rippling across his arms and back, sandy-blonde hair tousled with sweat, a member seeming to bob and inflate. Grown big enough on rich milk that Clare\u2019s enormous breast was yielding beneath him, the lad was forced for to quit her nipple or risk falling from that mountainous body, Clare imagined him making his way uneasily across plushy bulk of her breast, unsteady and wobbling as if crossing fields of deep snow or a boggy hillside, before losing his balance somewhat and falling to on all fours. Clare felt another internal thrill as she imagined him steadying himself on the bulging hill of her other breast, poised between her gigantic mounds, but all the while growing still bigger. Clare groaned a little as she imagined gazing longingly at the lad as he crawled up her chest towards her, seemingly swelling larger with desire, the great organ between his legs seeming to inflate underneath him like a dirigible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://authorjasongriswold.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/wpid-wp-1436727620396.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://authorjasongriswold.files.wordpr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her huge, red lips, buoyed up by Clare\u2019s gigantic chest, the growing lad kissed Clare passionately. Clare chewed her lip, fancying she could feel that rugged, bristled face scratching wetly against her plump mouth. Clare imagined herself returning that kiss, watching the young lad, kissing with his eyes closed, seeming to erupt with hills of muscle across his shoulders and arms. Clare imagined tearing the lad away from her lips with one huge hand, while she still could for he was becoming so large, and Clare felt a pang in her loins as the lad\u2019s monstrous appendage rebounded and seemed to throb even larger! Lustily Clare teased with herself as she imagined lowering the growing young man between her legs, disappearing behind her mountainous boobs, where she could feel him seize handfuls of her bush for purchase upon her, like the victim of a shipwreck clinging to a broken mast. Clare probed eagerly the immense folds of herself as she imagined feeling that glorious pressure, growing pushing inside of her, seeming to drive deeper with every thrust, beginning to feel tighter. It wasn\u2019t long before Clare\u2019s pleasuring became more vigorous as she could almost feel those strong hands clasping at her waist and then her hips, and as the thrusts became more huge and powerful she could feel them fleeting placed atop her rippling breasts and then bracing her huge legs apart. Clare imagined opening her eyes to see those huge arms plant themselves firmly by her head; looking up at the colossus she\u2019d grown for herself straining and panting on top of her, Clare wrapped her legs around his form, as huge as her now, and clung to that hulking form, rocking her gigantic hips back and forth as he bore into her! Before long she had thrust him back and mounted her, driving her enormous body down and down again on that mighty pillar of flesh between his legs. Bucking in pleasure she imagined swivelling and raising her tremendous cheeks, while he rose, like a slumbering titan, and pulled her huge hips towards him, each thrust seeming to grow more powerful than the last. Clare bit down hard on her lip to imagine the thundering of their bodies upon each other and the reverberations of the landscape under such colossal love-making! Clare, outstretched on the plains, by now delving deep inside herself, felt something trembling and quickening in her gut. Clare gasped tremendously....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As her day-dreams continued, Clare lay outstretched on the landscape, her colossal, upturned breasts pancaking under their own weight into vast, steaming plateaus of soft flesh. Heedless of the disturbances to her guts apparently taking place, Clare bit down up the plump, scarlet cliff of her lower lip as she pleasured herself, for a moment enjoying the dewy impression of her breasts sloshing back and forth like a milky sea wracked by a gale with the rocking of her hips, as she was lost more in the fantasy of that titan of sweating granite driving down into her voluptuous body. Clare\u2019s stomach let out a complaint that seemed to fill the valley, but she took no notice. Clare barrelled over and lay, cheek to the grassy plains, as if embracing the earth, her giant breasts baled up beneath her and her mighty buttocks reaching skywards, her free arm stretching beneath her length to find and plunge into the alpine cavern of her sex. Clare could not help but gasp at the feeling of crushing out her lust, all her giant lust, upon the landscape as she imagined the man mountain she\u2019d helped create, firmly clasping her moonlike buttocks, or maybe laying a palm upon her spine, the better to bore down into her like a collapsing mountain range, again and and again, grunting like an earthquake, seeming to send ripples through her entire body! While she was still crumpled in lust on the landscape, Clare\u2019s stomach groaned again unpleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Clare was, as she fantasised, in fact, conscious of waves seeming to pass through her body, like waves of cold sweat. And as she felt like was nearing the cloudy heights of pleasure, Clare was suddenly aware of a growing pressure in her abdomen, as if, for she was still in the midst of her fantasy, the giant young man, and his monstrous member, were swelling inside of her! At first Clare delighted in this feeling, imagining craning back, bleary-eyed to see that tower of muscle, a sheepish look on his rugged young face, ballooning upwards, all the while feeling his manhood snaking up inside of her, engorging and thickening, until it started to fill and stretch the capacity of even Clare, her!? She was the biggest woman on the planet! But the pressure in her continued to build, Clare, thrilled but almost fearful. imagined the tireless growth of that thing inside her, imagined, gritting her teeth, the curious sense of pleasure and pain at being filled like that and imagined even the young giant\u2019s face clouding with concern at his gargantuan member. Clare wondered what would happen first, would he grow too large for her and simple pop free? Would his growing manhood split her in two? Or would he, at long last, cum into her, expanding her goddess\u2019 body to even more unthinkable dimensions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing. Clare\u2019s eyes opened and her brow furrowed. Far from achieving a release, the pressure building within her seemed to suddenly started to decline! Clare\u2019s stomach groaned again, like a stifled yawn. Clare frustratedly kept trying to pleasure herself, but she seemed to be achieving nothing! Clare was conscious of a spreading sensation passing through her, like a wave, another of these cold, pleasant waves, as if a fine mist was slowly diffusing through her. Puzzled, her fantasy altogether gone, Clare lay, cheek to the ground, palms by her side, buttocks upturned, feeling like an imbecile for all her grandeur. The not-unpleasant sensation passed up the length of her and the seemed to fade. But Clare began to become conscious of a growing tenderness on her breasts, still pinned beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time wore slowly by, Clare felt this tenderness growing more and more pronounced. This soon became so intolerable that Clare, wincing, had to lift herself up, upon her hands and knees, for lying upon her breasts had started to become painful. There, Clare looed over the land below, but, even so, this tenderness seemed to be getting worse! Concerned, her huge brow furrowed, Clare inquisitively reached a hand down, the rest of her body balancing, and explored her breast-flesh. Clare was aware, almost as soon as she laid her spread hand upon the pendulous expanse of her breast and felt the skin sliding beneath her fingers, that her breasts were growing again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar from the usual greedy joy and glee with which Clare met sudden growth spurts, this new burgeoning of her breasts was a source of unrivalled dread for the gigantic pixie. It was not because the huge, tawny pixie did not welcome her ever-growing voluptuousness, but that Clare did not like the thought of her body growing out of her control, in this she was thinking specifically of the last time her boobs had started to grow like this, on their own, greedily expanding as if they were no longer a part of her, and she had gushed herself over the Frir valley. The effects had been...quite dramatic. Clare did not much like the idea of her body suddenly expelling torrents of unstable, and hugely powerful, magic, which she\u2019d started to regard as her God-given gift, and which she jealously wanted to keep confined to her immense body. It should be her right to use the magic she\u2019d consumed and digested, not leaked and dribbled here and there. There was no telling what kind of anarchy might ensue from that. Clare had troubling visions of all manner of giants roaming the landscape, unwittingly suffused with the power inside her by her carelessness: enormous geese sheltering mountains under their plumage, sheep as large as clouds rolling across the landscape, sea-turtles like whole countries moving across the waters, hilllside towns in the shade of the udders of some huge cow, gigantic toads flicking aircraft from the sky with their tongues, monstrous caterpillars chewing their way through whole forests at a time. And this was to say nothing of what might become of the people; the wildlife was bad enough, but Clare shuddered to think of gnomes bestowed with such gianthood, their plushy bodies stomping across the hillside giggling, with boobies bigger than their heads; or of those little goblin bitches, each one cackling at a booty so big a whole harbour could barely fit it! Or of jealously looking on at the huge forms of happy couples thunderously rutting on the mountainsides!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her nipples beginning to brush the valley floor, Clare lowered her huge body onto her back, with care not to accidentally clout her breasts in any way. Clare looked with concern at her breasts growing before, more tender than ever; she could see the tracery of greenish veins beneath the skin, like a network of canals, and knew that if she was prevent squandering her power on the landscape around that she would need to do something soon. Clare thought frantically of something that might abate her growing bosom, even trying to will herself smaller, but, after tightly shutting her eyes and imagining her breasts deflating, opening her eyes she was horrified to see that they had grown even more, like two gigantic balls of dough rising before her eyes! It was no use, Clare thought, as her breasts began to reach that painfully familiar size, a size so large that they weighed down heavily upon their owner, she was growing unstoppably and even the mountain breeze passing over the peaks of her erect nipples was a source of a peculiarly pleasurable pain. Clare could see, or felt she could see, moisture beginning to bead atop her nipple; the pressure was great now that it felt once more she was going to burst; Clare foresaw her breasts volcanoing milk into the sky, sending down sticky, seagreen rain upon the landscape for miles around. Clare\u2019s face was a mask of pleasure and fear as she felt it, she was about to burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a final act of desperation, Clare seized her left breast and, bringing her mouth up, forced the bulging mass of her breast down and her engorged nipple into her open mouth. A split second later Clare\u2019s nipple exploded, sending a jet of milk out so forcefully that it ballooned her cheeks and she struggled force down gulp after gulp, cheekful after cheekful; no sooner had she swallowed down the sweet, tingling milk than Clare felt her cheeks already starting to puff out and strain to contain the stream; Clare\u2019s eyes were wide with a kind of panic and her legs thrashed in vain as drank and drank; Clare could scarcely appreciate the warm current milk flowing down her throat and into her belly, which was also beginning to show signs of bloating. Clare\u2019s glance sideways at her other breast, which, though her relieving the pressure from other other had prevented it from bursting, still seemed threateningly engorged and was even more starting to trickle, as a geyser might before spouting. Feeling one stream abating, Clare squeezed at her left breast, swallowing the milk sprayed into her mouth with rapidity, and popped her lips from her teat with a gasp before diligently turning to the other. As she guzzled from the other breast Clare could feel her stomach bloating and distending in an effort to contain all this milk. For some time Clare swapped from nipple to nipple, gulping down lakes of milk, in an effort to drain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust went she thought she was about to pop, Clare\u2019s breast stopped gushing. Clare gasped and breathed heavily, like a submerged swimmer who has just come to the surface and, panting, fell back with a boom upon the landscape, her tawny hair spread out like a field of barley. Clare breathed a sigh of relief and let a hand fall on her swollen stomach, protruding out from her body like a dome. Clare belched richly and at length and sighed\u2026 draping an arm across her brow Clare relaxed and thought and now had the time to wonder if, by drinking the milk she had threatened inadvertently unleash on the landscape, she hadn\u2019t made for herself a turn of events somehow much worse and much, much bigger than all the hilllock-sized boobies, lagoon-smothering booties and leviathan dongs she had worried about creating combined...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Perhaps a several hours had passed since Clare had first loomed over the valleys and the carriage containing Nel and the Imperial party, having climbed high into the air above the valley, had passed over the peaks to the north, towards the mountain range of needle-like pinnacles some miles distant. And yet, even from this aerie vantage, standing the edge of a precipice and looking out over the landscape, Nel could see Clare in all her immensity. Nel hugged herself in the cold wind, teeth chattering. To Nel, Clare\u2019s body swelled up from behind the mountains, emerging from the banks of cloud as though her enormous breasts, shoulders and towering knees were a still more massive range of snow-covered mountains, dwarfing the mere foothills beneath their pristine, white glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ak8.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/19378498/thumb/1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://ak8.picdn.net/shutterstock/video...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were engaged in discussion by the carriage. But Nel did not want to talk. Instead she could not help but gaze on Clare as the snow drifted by. Some time had passed and Clare, Nel could tell, now lay outstretched on the misty landscape, as if she lay in a bath of milk, her breasts, face and legs emerging from the mists like islands. As Nel watched there came echoing over the mountaintops the rumbling and quaking moans, as if the earth itself were in the throws of passion. Even miles off, Nel could feel the tremors of Clare undulations upon the landscape. The others were briefly distracted but soon returned to counsel, while the footmen attended to the startled eagles. Nel\u2019s thoughts turned back to Clare; she was already so titanic, how could she have become such a monster? Nel felt a chill pass through her that was not so much from the cold as from the thought that Clare would eventually grow more than she had already. Nel foresaw, as if from high that naked and voluptuous giant, Clare\u2019s body lengthening across the green blanket beneath her, her huge arms stretched out above her head. Clare\u2019s legs coursed over the landscape, her body seeming to arch itself as her growing form adjusted to the curvature of the earth. Nel imagined Clare swelling and swelling in this fashion, growing and growing, waxing more and more voluptuous, her body swallowing everything in its path, so that Clare lay spread out not on a valley but on an entire continent. Nel shuddered to imagine Clare lying there, rubbing one monstrous breast with a sleepy, satisfied look on her face, like a continent of white flesh, on whose huge neck the Great Wall of China might lie like the most delicate and fine silver necklace, while her hair fanned out and floating on the ocean like the Sargasso Sea, whole countries were darkened beneath her buttocks and lazily letting one leg dangled down across the face of the planet like the boot of Italy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/antarctica_map.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/antarc...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause they were not watching, the others could not appreciate what Nel could. As minute after minute passed of Clare\u2019s passions, Nel was astonished to hear Clare suddenly stop. Just then, a cloud drifted across Nel\u2019s view and briefly obscured Clare from her view. The silence was palpable to Nel and she listened apprehensively. From somewhere beyond in the whitish void before her, Nel heard Clare cry out, almost in fear. As the cloud cleared, Nel was as horrified as the giant pixie herself to see Clare\u2019s gigantic breasts starting to balloon and rise up from the mists. Nel\u2019s jaw dropped as she watched those massive domes of flesh grow larger and larger. Nel could see Clare\u2019s huge red lips crest from the mist to gasp, like some giant whale, as her bosom engorged on top of her. For some moments all that happened was that Clare\u2019s breasts continued to grow more gargantuan. Just when Nel was wondering if her breasts might crush her, she saw Clare\u2019s huge head reign suddenly from the mists and with it her her huge hands leap up to grasp her breast. Nel was shocked to see the huge Clare begin to suck upon her monstrously huge breast! Een at this distance Nel could intermittently see the ballooning of Clare\u2019s cheeks as milk rushed into her mouth and was forced down her throat. Nel saw, as this scene unfolded Clare gradually deflate her gigantic breasts, one after another. But Nel was surprised to see, as Clare did so, that another mound slowly buoyed itself up from the mists, that of Clare\u2019s huge belly, becoming more and more distended as it filled with milk! When Clare finally ceased suckling, she let her head fall back with relief, and Nel could see Clare\u2019s huge hands clutching her swollen belly. From far off, there came a rumbling belch that shook the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo thunderous and sudden was this that the Imperial party broke from their conversation to look out onto the sea of clouds and the bloated goddess seeming to float on its surface. Gazing on Clare rubbing her swollen stomach, Nel could not help but be beset by the fears and anxious imaginings of moments before. Confronted with further evidence of Clare\u2019s ever increasing hunger, Nel\u2019s imagination could not help but suddenly magnify her thoughts of Clare outstretched on the face of the earth, again and again, tenfold over; Nel imagined Clare\u2019s breasts hovering in the night sky like huge and luminous pale moons as she grew so large she could no longer fit on the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sleepnews.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FullMoon.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://sleepnews.info/wp-content/uploads...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nel shuddered to think of Clare\u2019s chest slowly pitching towards and looming over cities, rumbling as they came closer, as she embraced the blue globe before her. She could not help but imagine Clare\u2019s hunger driving her to lean in and take a bite from the planet, leaving behind an huge wound like a crater in the surface of the planet. People flocked screaming through the streets as the Goddess whose face filled the horizon crunched the landscape to crumbs. Indeed, Nel saw Clare at this size, greedily clinging to the rondure of the earth, inclining her neck to take huge bites, as some kind of gigantic wasp or hornet boring its way into a ripe peach, an impression not diminished by Clare exaggerated and extraordinarily waspish figure, greedily ripping off and chewing the pulp of planets and passing it down her gullet. And Nel pictured the sudden and pronounced shudders that would pass through Clare as she was visited again and again by spurts of growth, sending her huge form curving more and more around the planet until the whole planet was locked between her huge arms and immense, enfolding thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01941/helen-yemm-2_1941530b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/arch...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel quailed a little at this; it was to easy to imagine Clare\u2019s lust and greed driving her to this eventuality, hungrily feeding her body and hastening her metamorphosis into...into\u2026.who knew what? Nel feared if Clare got to be that big that she would never stop, perhaps could not stop. Nel\u2019s thoughts once again blew Clare up, as if blowing up a photograph in a developing room. Nel could now see Clare\u2019s enormous, voluptuous body drifting through the solar system, as a young girl wanders through an orchard, carelessly and effortlessly plucking the coloured orbs of the planets from their orbit and biting into one after another like juicy apples with cataclysmic crunches! She imagined Clare\u2019s lunar cheeks flushed rosy with heat as she wormed her tongue into the planets she held in her hand to scoop out their molten hearts before crunching the hollow shell between her immense molars. And as if in responding to her fears for the future, Nel\u2019s heart sank to see Clare\u2019s swollen body start to tremble and, as it did so, start to spread across the landscape more, rising from the mists as if levitating. Nel\u2019s jaw fell open; Clare was somehow making herself bigger on her own magic alone! Nel had a fleeting glimpse of a Clare of wholly galactic proportions, her expression delighted at the way the stars lay across her nose and cheeks like freckles, while she licked up entire solar systems like sherbert dust and inhaled nebulas like smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg/982px-Pillars_of_creation_2014_HST_WFC3-UVIS_full-res_denoised.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel and the other onlookers watch from their mountain vantage as Clare continued to swell, billowing upwards and outwards. Within moments they could see Clare\u2019s enormous form start to pour over the rim if the distant mountains like an avalanche, flowing over and down into the valley where they had been only hours before. The group stood on the mountain precipice and looked on Clare\u2019s immense body rumbling and expanding in the distance as she grew ever larger as if staring down into an abyssal depth from great heights, aghast and full of despair. Gazing upon her now, it was impossible to deny Clare\u2019s power and the growing threat she posed not just to Nel and the Imperial entourage for reasons of haughty revenge, but to the whole world, maybe even to distant worlds! There also seemed to be no denying by now that Clare had succeeded in transforming herself, utterly, into so much more than an overly big pixie, into a veritable goddess! And it was also undeniable that as time passed Clare was only becoming more powerful, that, contrary to their initial hopes, her magic showed no signs of diminishing or tapering off and nor did her growth, and pushing closer and closer to becoming unstoppable. And, as if in admission of these facts and what lay before them all, and the uncertainty of the future should Clare continue like this, to grow ever more immense and her power to grow with he , not one of them spoke for some time...</span></div></div>",

The entire royal party sat gloomily, scarcely able to touch the food and drink provided for them, thinking only of the ever-growing threat that was Clare. By now the harsh reality had dawned on each of them, and, indeed, also on many denizens of the lands around, and had time to fester that Clare was now, quite literally, the biggest threat to the world that could be imagined. And, moreover, without some kind of plan to stop her, and her relentless growth, their fate would be sealed. Not one of them, not even Nel, was absolutely sure what Clare would or could do with her newfound power, but all of them could be certain that it would be disastrous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the fire was dying down to embers and the party was no further towards a concrete plan to stop Clare. Instead they would quickly devolve into bickering, such as when the Archmage\u2019s apprentice, a shy young lad whose main duty seemed to be to carry scroll, offered the suggestion that perhaps they might try some kind of decoction to shrink the gargantuan pixie and the Captain of the Imperial Guard had flown into a frustrated rage, yelling that it was precisely Clare\u2019s having slugged a vault-worth of potions that had lead them to this point. The young lad received a cuff of admonishment about his ears from the Archmage, to remind him to think before he spoke. Several plans were mooted, discussed and inevitably dismissed. Alexandra and the Grand Sorceress favoured tackling the problem in as aggressive a manner as possible. But raising a vast army to defeat Clare was ruled a fool\u2019s errand because it would likely, even if they were able to call for help from the mountain giants and sleeping dragons, end in failure and would constitute only a nuisance, or, worse, an amusing game of toy soldier for Clare.

Inclining her neck a little, Nel could not help but feel that she\u2019d grown again. Looking into the glowing coals of the fireplace for a moment, Nel cleared her throat. <br>\r\n\u2015 What if, she began, hesitating at first, \u2015 what if we give Clare exactly what she wants? <br>\r\nThe gathered listeners were decidedly nonplussed by this suggestion, even the Empress looked at Nel with a concerned face. The Grand Sorceress was the first to speak.<br>\r\n\u2015Are you suggesting that we surrender then!? Just accept our new lives in whatever world your friend might choose to make for herself!? \u2015No, not at all...what I am suggesting is this\u2026<br>\r\n Nel paused for a moment to run through her plan to herself, while the assembly waited on tenterhooks.<br>\r\n\u2015Yes, how about we try to give Clare too much of a good thing, until she can\u2019t handle it any more?<br>\r\nSeeing their faces still confused, Nel elaborated.<br>\r\n\u2015 Look, by now we know that, whatever Clare did to herself, magic in whatever form has catalysed Clare\u2019s growth and we also know that Clare seems intent on finding more sources of magic to make herself even more powerful, yes?<br>\r\nNods of understanding.<br>\r\n \u2015 But we also know that this has made Clare\u2019s body hugely unstable, right? Well, how about we trick Clare into consuming so much magic that her body becomes unstable? If I am right, if we can pump her full of enough magic and saturate her, it might just expel all the magic from Clare\u2019s body.<br>\r\nNel looked to the Empress, whose red hair seemed to smolder by the light of the fire.<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause before the Empress spoke.<br>\r\n\u2015But Nel, even if this could work, where would we find enough magic to do such a thing?<br>\r\n\u2015Your Highness, if we could call upon our kingdom and the neighbouring kingdoms to scour for any source of magic\u2026<br>\r\nGrand Sorceress again was quick to speak.<br>\r\n\u2015But surely your friend Clare is, by now, much too large to notice any such measly little sources of magic as we can offer up?<br>\r\n\u2015My thought was that we could cluster them together so that they would attract her attention, Grand Sorceress.<br>\r\nThe Empress spoke again, kind yet sceptical.<br>\r\n\u2015Even so Nel, I just cannot foresee such a quantity of magic as could do anything other than exaggerate our problems.<br>\r\nNel struggled to think, somewhat crestfallen.<br>\r\n\u2015Then, then\u2026<br>\r\nAt this the Archmage, who all the while had been gazing into the fire, smoking a long pipe and stroke his beard in what they had assumed was an attempt to look thoughtful, spoke up.<br>\r\n\u2015You know, your Highness...were there not, in more wasteful times, dwarven mines in the northern mountains that were digging deep into the planet for raw magic?<br>\r\nNel\u2019s eyes lit up as she looked to the Empress who appeared to think for a moment.<br>\r\n\u2015Well, yes, yes, I believe there were...but they were abandoned years ago.<br>\r\n\u2015Is it not conceivable then, Empress, that we might, uhmm, open them up again? Access to the a geyser of the planet\u2019s raw magic would surely, in theory, provide us with enough magic to carry out this young lady\u2019s plan, no?<br>\r\nNel was quick to accommodate these new facts and hastily added:<br>\r\n\u2015Yes! And, we could use the sources we amassed to lure Clare north towards the mines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress sat with her brows knitted for some time, pondering what to do. Nel stood, anxiously awaiting the Empress\u2019 decision. To Nel, the plan would work as she planned, she had only to rely on Clare\u2019s greed to drive it. Nel did not envy Kassandra her position; Empresses (pixie rulers were invariably women) of the past had had to contend with the threat of monsters before, dragons, ogres and the like, but never before had the threat been on such a scale as Clare, who was no longer solely a threat to the pixies but a threat to the entire land! Perhaps even the world. Nel could not help but feel pangs of guilt when she thought that it was her own desire to be bigger and her fooling around with potions that had lead them to this point; it was she that had originally blown up Clare and she had to put this all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the Empress spoke.<br>\r\n\u2015Alexandra\u2026<br>\r\n\u2015Yes, your Highness.<br>\r\n\u2015start sending word to the kingdoms to gather all the sources of magic that they can possibly find...<br>\r\nRising, the Empress strode from the room<br>\r\n\u2015...we have much work to do.</span></div></div>",

Clare lay alongside the city in all her immensity, lazily engaged in toying with one of these spires with the tip of her index finger, encircling the entire ornate mass of buildings with her body, curled up thick and voluptuous as though she were some gigantic cat. The citizens could only quake and cower to behold Clare, whose breasts alone dwarfed the city, steeply rising up from city limits in an graceful bulge into mighty edifices of flesh, seeming to groan and shift as if the city had been built in the lee of two colossal glaciers. All the while Clare\u2019s immense face hovered above the city, her huge red lips and seagreen eyes hovered above them, hazy like the moon seen during daylight hours, but ever so close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days since her last growth spurt, Clare had subjugated all the cities, townships and kingdoms she could, toying with each in turn for her own amusement. Indeed, the process had proved relatively easy for Clare, for she was, as both she and the citizens of these domains had eventually come to grasp, virtually invulnerable to all attempts to repulse her: volleys of magic seeming to evaporate on the surface of her skin like tiny sparks, projectiles hurled at her from catapults and ballistas  mounted on the ramparts simply rebounded or crumpled and armies advancing on her were brushed aside like layers of dust, or, in unfortunate cases, obliterated by the alternating impacts of either Clare\u2019s gigantic arse or colossal bosom. And though it seemed like Clare\u2019s growth spurts were at long last at an end (though it was apparent that she had continued to thicken for some time afterwards), it certainly seemed as though her last explosion of growth had been more than enough to push Clare towards being something very near to a terrestrial goddess. What Clare had been unprepared for, though, was the comparative boredom that would accompany this; although Clare\u2019s powers were by now utterly immense, once she had subjugated any kingdom or city, she was faced with a strangely restricted range of options for her amusement that did not consisted of completely wiping districts from the face of the earth. Clare found herself, as she peered with difficulty at the thronging citizens who looked no more substantial than mites to her, missing the times when she was merely fifty foot tall and could appreciate the widespread panic she engendered as people fleed from her and the satisfying squash of those trodden underfoot as though she were treading on toadstools, or even of being five hundred foot tall ( a size that now seemed diminutive to her) when she could feel every building popping like gooseberries under her fleshy posterior as it was mashed into the ground. Clare heaved a gigantic sigh that sent vaporous gusts travelling through the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks had also passed since the night when Nel and the others had devised their plan, during which they had gone about setting it in motion, preparing their trap for Clare, and now it was ready to spring. Nel and the Empress were stood atop a stone watchtower, perched on the mountainsides overlooking the valley in which lay the city alongside which Clare was currently nestled. Their nerves were wracked by anticipation as they looked on Clare and the city. Presently, there arrived a messenger from the Grand Sorceress, who was currently stationed at another of these waypoints further to the north. They were ready. The Empress shot Nel a glance; her face was pale and her lips thin as she nodded to her honour guards. In response her guards lowered the small drawbridge of the tower, flung wide its barricaded windows and opened up the hatch in its rooftop, to reveal the trove of magic objects amassed within: urns, books, candles, amulets, bracelets, shoes, wands, hats, rings, goblets, staffs and anything they could lay their hands on that contained any trace of magic. Individually, none of these could attract Clare\u2019s notice, but together... Nel stood on the crenelated battlements, the wind at her back, and looked out on the valley and the gargantuan form of Clare and waited. It took almost an hour, but eventually she could see, through the spyglass, Clare\u2019s gaze change from one of drowsy boredom to the countenance of a child who, having spent hours playing amongst the flowerbeds of her family\u2019s garden smells, floating between the branches, the spicy and warm smell of her mother\u2019s baking. Nel saw Clare stir and sit up and could hear the rumbling as she did so; as Nel watched Clare seem to sniff at the air, the Empress laid her hand on Nel\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWe should retreat to the next waypoint Nel.\u201d As they descended the tower and the carriage climbed once more into the air, they heard something like far-distant thunder and Nel could see her gigantic friend sat up her heels in the valley, a flash of greed beginning to be rekindled in her green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare slowly canted forwards across the valley, her gigantic breasts swinging beneath her, sniffing all the while; even at her colossal size she had detected, wafting on the breeze, that peculiar tang that she had come to associate with sources of raw magic. Crawling, Clare followed that faint trace across the valley (an irrelevantly small distance for her now); she could already feel the anticipatory burbling in her stomach. It was an unfortunate consequence of her enormous size that Clare could no longer smell smaller sources of magic and as she had grown larger and larger so too had it become harder for her to discern the fuel for her growth; Clare had reconciled herself to this size as long as she thought that she had scoured the lands clean of substantial sources of raw magic, but now, with the barest hint of another source reaching her, there awoke in her the desire to devour and grow. Reaching the mountains, Clare brought her huge eye up to the lone tower, which appeared to her like little more than a thimble. Clare sniffed at the tower with something like care, before, as her eyes brightened, reached up and plucking the entire masonry from the mountaintop, between her index and medial fingers. Without much ceremony, Clare popped the tower into her cavernous mouth, chewing the insubstantial morsel with much relish as if it were a small raspberry candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was still absentmindedly chewing and sucking the tower between her teeth and cheek, when she caught a whiff of something on the wind blowing down from the north, further into the mountains. With an almost mechanical motion, Clare heaved herself up again and moved northwards, her giant nipples grazing the frosted peaks as she passed over the crags and valleys in the way one moves tentatively over the coastal rocks and rockpools of the seashore. It took Clare much more searching to find this source of raw magic: a small horde of things that she could not tell apart and were, to her, a single mass secreted in the attic spaces of a burned out mansion on the outskirts of a mountain village thickly bordered by conifers. As soon as she\u2019d located the mansion, Clare dispatched it with a lick of her tongue. But not sooner had Clare crunched down her tongueful of woodwork, magic and trees, then there was that weird tang in the air once more. What was this? Clare mused to herself as she followed the smells that made even her gigantic nose prickle. Was it now the case that she was so large that her nose was like some enormous radar for raw magic, capable of picking up even small traces, or was it that her body was so starved for magic that she was becoming super receptive to it? It did, nevertheless, strike her as strange that these little troves should have escaped her notice before now. Moreover, it was odd the way these troves were always in locations remote from any populace yet more or less easily discernible even to someone who was thousands of feet tall: on a precipice near the mouth of a mountain cave; in a sort of cairn atop a burial mound; on lining the ramparts of a ruined castle; packing the courtyard of a recessed monastery; in a forest clearing. \u2018Upon reaching another one of these troves glinting and lumped together on the ice of a mountain lake that Clare\u2019s suspicions were truly sparked and, after grabbing the magical objects and yards of lake ice, she scoured the landscape in vain for any evidence of the hoarders. But it was no use; she was simply too huge. Whomsoever had amassed these piles, they had done so long beforehand, and without her notice, but seemingly specifically to bring her northwards. Clare could not help but blast her stupidity in following this trail of crumbs, for crumbs they were and would certainly make no difference to her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Clare spotted the glimmer something on an escarpment nearby the mountain lake. Clare leaned in to examine the green object: from what she could see it was a crude statue, little more than a figurine to her, of a woman, a pixie, standing with arms and wings outflung, its massive chest jutting outwards from the torso...her? Close inspection made clear that the statue had been hastily carved from a lump of raw magic ore, but from where? Clare picked up the statue and was scrutinising it when she saw, chalked into the edifice behind it, in letters so tall that even she could read them: FEED. GROW. GODDESS. So she was really a goddess now? She had become some kind of deity to some, devoted followers who would have her become even more powerful? Clare could not help but grin with glee as she popped the statue into her cheek. The mountains rang with her throaty laughter. Clare smilingly rose to her feet, towering up over the mountain peaks and valleys, but as she did so her mouth dropped open and she near spat out the statuette when saw what lay in a basin to the north and to which her followers had lead her, throbbing with seagreen light.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Clare\u2019s eyes, at a distance of some miles northwards, she beheld a familiar greenish glow emanating from a crater or deep basin, that seemed almost to bleed upwards into the darkened sky in streams and tapers of turquoise light. Clare\u2019s mouth could not help but water as the smell stimulated her nostrils, blown down from the north on chill winds: raw magic, a great, open well of it. Such a well, thought Clare as she rose to her feet, must run miles deep into the planet! Clare strode across the northern plains as her stomach once again seemed to lurch into activity in anticipation of finally being satiated. She marvelled that such a well of raw magic had escaped her notice until now. It had been quite an oversight on her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clare began to make her way across the featureless steppe between them and the crater, and as her calamitous footfalls grew steadily more distant, a small band of creatures emerged from a cave in the peak that Clare had observed as scarcely more than a hairline crack. This band, among whom was the cloaked and hooded Alexandra, rapidly moved towards a pyre concealed from Clare in the northern lee of the mountain peak. As a moments activity, the bonfire was lit, sending the signal to the north. Alexandra looked out from the snowy mountaintop as those colossal buttocks swayed their way northwards to the muted groaning and resonating thunderclaps of Clare\u2019s feet, seeming in unison to be the clanging of some gigantic bell. She prayed that Nel and the Empress knew what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare could see, as she neared the crater, that lustrous pool of light, evidence of mining communities on the steppe, small flimsy houses bunched together, now windswept and seemingly empty, for Clare was used to seeing whole cities swarming to escape her while these towns stayed motionless. Deciding that to spend time inspecting these would be a waste, Clare strode over them like pebbles in her path. Lining the edge of the crater, Clare fancied she could see the tiny lines of scaffolding cross-crossing the crater\u2019s rim, illuminated by the lurid green glow from within. Clare supposed, as she began to loom over the scene, that she could see shadows flitting about in the glow, no more substantial to her than the black sparks and motes that float through the humours of one's eyeball. Indeed, as she approached and the crater began to be swallowed up by the shadow she cast, and she could not help but feel her great size to be an impediment to discerning any signs of life in and around the crater. Who in the world had done this? Done this, for her? If this had, as she suspected, been the work of a group devoted to her, to worshipping her, The Cult of Clare, then it felt disappointing to not be able to see those responsible for delivering her this offering. Not able to thank them properly. Clare stood above the crater in all her voluptuous glory, she thought a while, as though pondering what lay before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon receiving the signal from the mountains that Clare was approaching the crater, the parties under command of the Empress and the Grand Sorceress had immediately begun preparations to decamp from the crater\u2019s rim, where the workforce of hired miners had spent the last few weeks sedulously excavating and blasting open the mine, till the raw magic had began to gush up and well from the planet\u2019s interior. Once retreated to a distance judged safe, they crouched, concealed by outcrops and by the giant\u2019s spreading shadow, and waited. In the gathering gloom, they could, when they lifted their eyes up the entire length of Clare\u2019s colossal, almost luminous body to her face, see a gigantic red smile split across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground thundered and trembled as Clare knelt down with all her weight upon the landscape. Planting her hands heavily on either side of the crater, Clare leaned herself forward, her gargantuan breasts ploughing over the lower slopes, pulverising bare trees and ramshackle huts as they dragged across the land. The landscape rumbled and shook again as Clare, on all fours. lowered her lips to the crater, wrapping them around the crater, the rim and the pool contained therein. The ground began to quake for miles around, rattling the tiny houses and shook snows from the summits of the mountains, as Clare began to drink raw magic straight from the planet, drawing up huge mouthfuls and then gulping them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome way off, Nel and her party crouched hidden in a dusty building near the crater\u2019s slopes. Looking up at Clare\u2019s enormous countenance, luminous like the moon, Nel watched Clare\u2019s huge lips clamped around the crater\u2019s rim contracting and squeezing as though some gigantic red serpent had coiled about the crater. \u201cThat\u2019s it\u201d, Nel muttered to herself, \u201cdrink it all up like a good girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the north of the crater, the Archmage and the excavation team were forced to seek refuge in the cellars of the mining town lest they be blown away. Such was Clare\u2019s size and the strain of her exertion that her nostrils blasted tunnels of galeforce wind down the slopes of the crater and scouring across the immediate landscape. Descending into the cellar, his beard blown into an unruly tumbleweed, he wondered to what scene he might eventually emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose escorting the Empress sheltered precariously underneath Clare, meanwhile. The Empress studied the vast, milky canopy of Clare\u2019s body spread out above them with stony features. The Empress could see every mouthful of magic as it passed into the gigantic pixie\u2019s belly, dully glowing lumps that moved slowly down her gullet before disappearing into Clare\u2019s stomach. As Clare gulped down more and more, the Empress could see Clare\u2019s belly growing taught and bloated, distending more and more with the sheer volume of magic Clare was now ingesting. Indeed, as Clare\u2019s stomach continued to engorge it was acquiring that same luminosity that the Empress could discern in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, yet they seemed like hours to the onlookers. The dramatic quaking of the landscape and the thunderous moans of gustatory pleasure continued. Clare seemed like some gargantuan blood-sucking insect, vampirically draining the planet of rich, green blood and gradually becoming swollen and distended. But, just when the gigantic pixie seemed like she could gorge herself forever, there came a new rumbling in the sky. At first it seemed like thunder brewing in the clouds and but after a few moments it acquired the cacophonous groaning of trees being felled in the woods. Clare\u2019s eyes, closed in concentration as she suck up raw magic, snapped open in alarm as she felt a strange quivering in her guts, as though her belly were not with lakefulls of raw magic, but a mass of wriggling tadpoles. GRRRRRRRRRKKKKK. Clare lifted her lips from the crater, great gobs of seagreen magic dripping from her chin, and clutched her grotesquely swollen stomach in pain as it groaned thunderously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the onlookers, Nel, the Empress, The Sorceress, Alexandra and everyone for miles around, saw the cataclysm unfold. The seagreen glow coalesced in Clare\u2019s belly was seen to slowly disperse itself through her body, lighting up her veins as it did so, turning them into rivers of livid green. Passing along Clare\u2019s flanks, the glow spread in a web across her obelisk-like thighs, down her legs and calves to her feet, and across the vast expanse of her gigantic buttocks, while, simultaneously, it spread just as rapidly across her arms and shoulders, to her huge and flushed cheeks and to the colossal teardropped swell of her breasts, where they fanned out into a veritable delta of tributaries. GRRRRRRRK! As this progressed Clare could only groan in pain as here stomach heaved and sloshed violently, while giant droplets of green-hued sweat formed on her brow, her throat, breaking out on her massive chest and running down the small of her back between the humid chasm of her gargantuan butt-cheeks. Clare\u2019s body felt strange, like nothing she\u2019d felt before; her vision seemed to swim before her, zooming in and out of focus. To the startled onlookers Clare\u2019s body seemed to be trying to expand and contract all at once, its contours, fissuring with green light, seeming to have become indistinct, fluctuating and flickering as it did so. Clare gritted her teeth, sweat gluing her hair to her jawline, as she suppressed a scream. NNNNGGGGHHH--GRRRK! As her body flickered more violently, seeming in less than a second to lurch bigger before abruptly shrinking, realisation came to Clare. She had been tricked! Tricked, and now she felt like she was on the point of exploding. This was impossible! How could this have  happened!? With THIS body!? A Goddess like HER!? A feeling began to wash over Clare that felt as though her veins were rupturing, as though she were gradually being pulled asunder from inside. And as this feeling mounted, Clare lifted her huge head, cheeks streaked with sweat and tears, and screamed: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MEEEEE!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this outburst Clare\u2019s enormous and voluptuous body was lost from anyone\u2019s sight as there erupted a cataclysm of seagreen light that blasted over the landscape for miles around\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare having lurched back unto her haunches and dangerously bloated with magic was at the apex of being torn apart by the very magical essence she had glutted herself on. Tear-soaked and screaming, Clare cried up at the heavens as her body violently shuddered, growing and shrinking as her body illuminated further and further before she felt her veins burn with energy and her body reached critical mass. Growing blindingly bright, the enormous pixie vanished behind a screen of blinding seawater green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Clare thought this was it, that it was all over. Everything came to a stop. Everything froze all around her. The snow tumbling from the mountains, the birds taking flight from the howls of her screams, even the clouds overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything froze, except Clare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hurt. Everything hurt, like inside her very veins there existed a thousand suns, all burning at once, on the cusp of a supernova each. She burned, feeling the green-hued sweat and tears sizzle upon her body as it felt like it was burning from a sunburn contained within. Clare's body still ebbed, distorting doubly under her vision as her eyes dazzled and unfocused. Her head pounded as a good portion of the energy within was creeping through her bodystream into her brain. She seethed, palm to forehead as she squatted in the ravine, on the edge of the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare felt like she was going to die. Felt like she should have died, right then and there. But instead she lived. She didn't want to die, but this moment was painfully hellish to endure. Still, she did exactly that. Spreading her legs as she squatted, stepping slightly and twisting away from the crater, her bloated and distended belly forcing her legs apart and making the simple act of turning around painful. She still held her head, her elbow nudging her swollen, inflamed breasts as she did so. They jostled and jiggled against her as she burned with discomforting pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not... like... this...\" She seethed, hissing between clenched teeth as she forced herself to contain the explosive energy within. Feeling like a living bomb about to go off, she swallowed back her own detonation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the pain began to subside. She swallowed again, feeling her whole body convulse. All her exploding nerves slowly easing back the burning pain. She panted, gasping for deep breaths as her body cooled. The magical swirling coalescence within slowly being tamed by her willpower alone. She forced herself to inhale, to swallow back the explosive energy about to burst forth, to own it, to control it. The cracks in her body, inside her very veins it felt like, slowly repaired themselves, growing stronger and sturdier as she forced herself, in this dying moment to tame her wild magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a herculean task. It was impossible. But she cheated. This whole moment frozen in time, was cheating. Somehow, in her last breath she had tapped into the critical surplus of magic within and managed a spell, a single magical spell borne from sheer willpower and a desperation to live. She expended some of the bounty she had just consumed. For some reason, the magical statuette of herself flashed before her mind. The imagined Cult of Clare feeding her desire to live. And a burning desire to not allow those that had conspired, tricked her into this situation to win, to get the last laugh. All this has accumulated into this last ditch effort to stay alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare's body, still distorting uncontrollably, slowly ceased its distorting contortions. The magic within her slowly rebuilt her body, better, more durable than her original frailty. It would not allow this vulnerability to be exploited again. But this spell, like Clare, wasn't perfect. There were consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare's body grew. She grew taller. And then her ass fattened. Feeling it as it happened, Clare cast an eye over her shoulder and watched as her bum, already perfectly proportioned in her eyes already, suddenly fatten with surplus. She gasped with pleasure as her butt grew against the ground, filling the ravine and spreading over the crater. She twerked involuntarily, like she was attempting to seduce a lover, her enormous bum teasing the crater of raw magic. She felt her exposed nethers loom over the crater's rim, feeling terribly indecent in this frozen moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs felt heavier, thicker, as she maintained her squat and feeling the magic lava in her veins slowly cool. Her arms felt sturdier, stronger too as she flexed them. Not muscular at all, but thick with a pleasant womanly way. Clare, hissed next, involuntarily as she felt her already massive mams swell even moreso. She gaped in surprise as her overblown tits blew up even bigger. Terribly rotund and swollen already, they bulged outwards excessively. She cooed and bit her lip as she bundled them up with her arms, feeling their enormous heft and heavenly swell puff and wobble sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe especially liked this, she wasn't even sure why. She'd never dreamed of being this proportionately busty, but somehow reaching this size filled her with pride. It felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pivoted slightly, dipping low to show off to nobody in particular only to feel her distended tummy brush against her thighs. She reeled back at the sensation. Where had that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully unaware of how much she had gorged her tummy until now, she felt it's hefty size weigh upon her middle as her body tamed the unruly, violently unstable molecules of her body and restore her to a sense of normalcy. That tummy shouldn't be here, that belly had to go. She couldn't see it, but she could feel it and it simply couldn't stay. It was ruining her \"perfect\" figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched it, feeling swollen and pregnant as she squatted over the rim of the crater of magic, her fat ass nearly taking up the entire rift in the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide as she felt something sudden...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For minutes after the world rang. The landscape surrounding the crater quaked and was engulfed by a blinding green light that obliterated one\u2019s sight entirely. Nel found herself fumbling sightlessly to steady herself, but finally crouching by what felt like a large, broad stone to save herself being shaken from her feet entirely. About her, though she could not see anything, Nel could just about hear above the rumbling the cries and shouts of the others as they sought stability on the quaking ground. Nel\u2019s panic rose in her throat as wondered if the ground beneath them might split asunder, so violent was the quaking about them. Gradually, after what seemed like an eternity to endure, the rumbling began to subside, the quaking dying down and leaving behind a sound like muted thunder. It was still some time, though, before the green light cleared though. Nel, leaning against the rock, squinted about her as the scene slowly distilled itself: shadowy forms of figures and buildings looming out of air as green as deep water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat struck Nel as she stood there, casting about in the dispersing mists, was the silence. Where previously the landscape had been full of the sounds of Clare\u2019s gigantic body, her rumblings and thunderous groanings, there was only the sound of the wind and the cries of some marsh-bird in the distance. The mists were receding now, lifting from the crater and retreating to the edges of the plains, where they bundled into greenish reefs out there in the morning gloom. Nel saw her companions emerging from the places where they had sought cover and could see the Empresses\u2019 carriage already on the wing from the mountains and fast-approaching. What Nel, could be certain of though, now that the light had faded and the quaking stopped, was that Clare had seemed to have disappeared from the scene altogether\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for the parties to reconvene at the crater\u2019s foot, the Archmage\u2019s group being the last to arrive. Nor did it take long for them to reconnoitre the edges of the crater for any trace of Clare; scouting over the gigantic impressions Clare left on the landscape, they could discover no sign of her. Nel and the others, on learning this, took the time to reflect. Their plan had been a success it seemed, although they could not tell what had happened to Clare after they had overloaded her body. Had she been shrunk by the violent expulsion magic? If she had been shrunk, it must have been to some miniscule size, so small in fact that the pixies could not easily find her as they scoured the grasses and rocks. It was perhaps the case, as the Grand Sorceress ventured, that Clare really had been evaporated altogether, blasted into nothingness but the power of the raw magic she had so greedily gulped down. It was quickly ruled out that Clare had turned invisible because of the complete absence of the thunderous sounds of her body. It seemed plausible that Clare had been transformed into something completely different. It was not so long ago really that the amount of volatile magic Clare gave off from her in a kind of static discharge was such that her mere presence would see things spontaneously change form: trees popping into candycanes, birds turned into falling pots of flowers, lilyponds changed into gelatine or carthorses suddenly becoming a cloud of balloons! It therefore didn\u2019t seem impossible that Clare might have been transfigured from her gargantuan size into a little dandelion on the steppe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked of how to begin preparations for departure, the Empress peeled away from the group, wandering as if lost in thought. Nel followed Kassandra along the small path, quickly catching up to her, lightly touching her on the arm. They walked some way uphill together in relative silence. After a while, the Empress paused and turned to look at the rim of the distant hills, girded with mist, over which the light of a new day was beginning to break in marmalade fingers. The Empress, without turning her rosy cheeks, sighed.<br>\r\n\u2015It seems that the problems with your friend are at an end, Nel.<br>\r\n\u2015Yes, it does...your majesty.<br>\r\n\u2015I did not want it to end quite like this, you know? I entertained the hope that we would shrink her...but it would seem\u2026<br>\r\n\u2015I know Empress...but we had to do something...she had to be stopped; we couldn\u2019t let her continue to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in silence for a while, watching the first flickers of dawn; a breeze blowing gently through their hair. A few moments passed before Nel, shooting a glance at Kassandra ventured a thought.<br>\r\n\u2015I suppose...this will soon mean it is goodbye....for us...your majesty.<br>\r\nSmilingly the Empress turned, looking up into Nel\u2019s face. Nel blushed to look down at the auburn nest of gold-circleted curls over the heft of her considerable chest. <br>\r\n\u2015You\u2019ve grown Nel...It\u2019s funny, we were so caught up with Clare that I didn\u2019t notice you creeping up.<br>\r\nNel flushed redder as the Empress loosely trailed a finger along the curve of Nel\u2019s breast.<br>\r\n\u2015You know, Nel, this needn\u2019t be the end of our...acquaintance. If you were amenable...you might remain at the castle, as an advisor perhaps?<br>\r\nNel smiled in response, but said nothing; the Empress leaned in, standing on her tip-toes. Nel inclined her neck, she could feel the warm puff of the Empresses\u2019 breath and she could feel the warm morning sun falling on her shoulders as it came over the teeth of the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in that instant before their lips met, the sunlight suddenly disappeared, casting the basin into the gloom of night once again. The Empress and Nel cast around in bewilderment at the sudden darkening of the landscape. They clung to each other as a tremendous quaking rocked the world about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2015What on earth!?<br>\r\nNel looked out towards the black mountains, seeing only the starless dark of the sky and the reefs of mist lying at the edges of the plain. As Nel looked on, while Empress called to those downhill of them, she saw a ribbon of green northern light split across the sky, a wondrous aurora wavering, crackling and broadening, a light so bright that it lit up the whole scene once more, and it seemed to Nel as if she and the others had suddenly been plunged fathoms deep in seawater and were standing on the seabed, amongst kelp and weed. Nel shielded her eyes as she looked on; the aurora was growing in brightness and size, waxing upwards across the sky, arcing across the whole of the horizon like a marine rainbow; about the ribbons and stripes of green Nel could see what looked like showers of sparks, crackling like lightning or rain. As the initial flare of the aurora died down though, bathing the landscape in an eerie green glow, Nel could distinguish something else amongst the lights: a vast black hole in the sky itself, as though someone had burned a perfectly hole in the midst of the panorama of green light. The landscape was again convulsed by the cataclysmic shaking and Nel was shaken from her feet, sliding down the embankment, landing crumpled on a tuft of shrubbery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was still spinning for Nel as the whole horizon swam with the seagreen aurora, and at its centre that huge black circle. The light seem to be streaming upwards, full of green veins and shafts that resembled a colossal glacier of green ice. As she struggled to avoid losing consciousness, a pang of liquid fear coursed through Nel\u2019s body: the hole in the sky...was a pupil; the crackling green light of the aurora...was an iris...and the thing filling the horizon, the whole of the sky, could only be Clare\u2019s gargantuan green eye...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare tensed, pushing with her arms against the ground. Her arms felt weird. Heavy like she had just spent hours working out, but also feeling an electric tingle. She could feel the skin of her arms breathe, as if she had just woken from a lovely, relaxing massage complete with a very liberal application of body lotion. Mint body lotion. Clare's entire body felt like this, growing aware of varying parts of it as she stirred awake and began to move. At first everything felt asleep and numb, but as more of her body was forced to move she felt a cool sensation rush across and to every inch of every part of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!\" Clare sharply hissed. Feeling one particularly pleasurable and cool sensation run down the crack of her ass and tease her loins. As if coaxing on a chemical high from some kind of drug, her senses felt heightened and simultaneously dulled. She soon realized that her body had broken out in a sweat, droplets teasing her body all over. One ran along her rib cage, one fell from her elbow, another wobbled along the arch of her foot, and further still several gathered at the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt amazing. Basking in the sensations, she clamped her eyes shut as all these raw sensations seemed to gather between her legs. Her privates seemed to take the longest for her to grow aware of, but the sensation mounted the furthest. Clare could hardly think of anything else, she indeed felt enormously, monstrously horny. She took one hand and reached for her thighs when suddenly she felt something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest trembled as a cool chill spread across her breasts, concentrating about her nipples as they grew erect with her arousal. Clare's eyes snapped wide again and her free hand returned to the earth to push away from the ground. She had to see. She <i>had</i> to be sure. She <i>had</i> to be <i>certain!</i> She sat up on her knees, her hands leaving the earth to grope at her chest. And stopped short. She inhaled, her eyes straining wide to gaze down at the spectacle before her. She had never been this busty. This enormous before. Her nipples felt big enough to fill the palms of her hands, erect crowns upon two pale sacks of plump titflesh. Wider than her shoulders and projecting out nearly the length of her arms, her breasts were truly monstrous indeed. Clare felt a tingle course up and down her spine, reaching as far down as to curl her toes. She realized something. The difference. These were not breasts engorged by magic growth or magic milk, these were all her. If she were to suffer yet another milky growth spurt, they would undoubtedly swell even further. The mere thought of that made her weak in the knees, and she began to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming herself down, she snaked an arm under her pendulous breasts and up the chasm between them, gathering up one boob as she tried to calm her breaths. Her eyes widened again as she suddenly grew aware of her ass resting against the backs of her heels. She released her boob back to the whims of gravity, the large boob knocking against its sister in a series of fleshy quakes as her free hand seized at her ass. A truly glutted badonkadonk, it jutted behind her in a shelf and swelled from her hips in a truly mesmerizing heart shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare convulsed involuntarily as a shudder of pleasure rocked her body. She felt huge. She felt immense. She felt so terribly turned on. Surely, no one would mind or dare oppose her if she took a moment to pleasure herself! She reached once more between her thighs, slipping two fingers into her most sensitive of places, only to freeze with yet another realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there on her knees, hand at her loins, golden locks of hair matted against one side of her face, drenched in sweat. Every inch of her body felt brand new. The massive, damaging, destructive, miraculous transformation she had undergone had damaged and then repaired nearly every part of her body, and the sensation of new flesh restored and reawakened had caused everything to become hypersensitive. She reached her free hand up to grab a fistful of her hair and hold it up above her head, letting the cool sensation of her exposed neck heighten the already erotic experience as she played with herself with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pleasure was prematurely paused, however as a final revelation came upon her. She gazed about saw unfamiliar surroundings. She saw clouds she had never seen before, she saw the atmosphere in ways she had never seen before, and she felt if she stood to her full height... that she would be out amidst the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this brought her attention back to the present. She recollected her recent experiences with the mountain ranges, the hunt for magic, and the crater she had slurped from. She recollected the imagined Cult of Clare, her would-be worshippers whom she had found no trace of. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recoiled back down to Earth like a frisky, feverish cat, down on all fours and pancaking her massive breasts against the continent. She peered down at the familiar landscape transformed into something new. Like gazing down upon her home like a first time passenger aboard some airline, she studied the land from a new perspective, looking for something familiar. Spying the surroundings she recalled, she searched the land with an intense gaze, like one might search for a lost contact. And finally, after a little while, she found it. The crater where her last, most explosive transformation had occurred. The sun at her back as her colossal shadow blanketed her former kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar sensation of energy coursed through her body, much ignored as she intently searched the crater and surrounding area in the shadow of her own body, illuminated oddly well from the magic crackling within her eyes. She remained hugging the planet on all fours, perched atop it like a woman perched atop an inflated medicine ball. Her frantic search for answers, challenged by the slowly growing empty sensation in her stomach. Clare's engorged nipples brushing along the ground as her immense breasts wobbled to and fro with every simple motion of her immensely colossal body. She was painfully aware of the crack of her ass as her butt rivaled her breasts in its journey to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare pinched her eyes shut and bit her body lip. Her body's current state turning her on too much and distracting herself from her pursuits. She needed to be sated. Either in answers, in hunger, or in sex. Clare didn't much have a preference in as to what, merely that one of those three things occurred relatively soon. She reached out and groped at a boob, squeezing the huge orb playfully as she let out an animal-like moan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the various sources of magic the titanic pixie had consumed to get so gargantuan in size, and most undoubtedly power thanks to said size, Clare Cloudlight had no idea what the vast pool of magic residing within her was building up to. Her recent climax had far from abated the feeling of excruciating pleasure. No, if anything, instead of granting her the relief she sought so she could go back to lounging within the misty valley in peace until she decided just what to do with her enormous self... it made it worse. Was this but a prelude for a massive, earth-shattering growth spurt? She was so huge already, yet ultimately she figured herself so massive it mattered little if this valley wouldn't be able to hold her if she got any bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes wore on with her trying to grant herself some relief, on the plus side, the feeling was no longer purely coalescing in her mountainous breasts. But on the other hand, it was now spreading throughout her body. Clare clenched her teeth tightly, her hands crushing whatever parts of the mountains she gripped into powder as she tried to brace herself, beginning to feel as though perhaps this was going to tear her body apart. Would there be anything left? Would her consciousness and power be left bereft of a physical form? If not and she were to die, would Nel Nightfall grieve for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolemnly through the fog of pain and pleasure, Clare recognized it was very unlikely <i>anyone</i> would mourn her death. While she knew not of the Captain and her guardsmen having tracked her here to try and capture her, only to realize their task was far more monumental than they had prepared for, she suspected her magical growth binge over the last day would have many wanting her dead. While the idea of consuming Nel and Kassandra, current queen of the pixies, (though Clare could probably take that title easily now) had been appealing during her imprisonment, now virtually all of her earlier anger had burnt out, and she was glad she hadn't. She was even starting to regret her growth binge and those she probably devoured in it... if just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the intense maelstrom of sensation coursing through her and intensifying with every moment talking, but Clare... loved her friend Nel in ways she would have never dared voice when she was her original 1'7\" size. She saw the way her little blue haired friend looked at Kevin, a fellow pixie from their village. She was also aware of Nel's crush on their queen, which seemed to further complicate these feelings. Between them, how was the now-titanic blonde supposed to compete when most of what she's done had likely driven a wedge in the friendship they already had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Clare had an epiphany of sorts. She remembered Kassandra's ancient magical chant that revived that guard she accidentally ate, which meant she might be able to revive most of the pixies she may have eaten! Of course, it had been several hours since, and finding their individual magical essences within her own would be like trying to find a pixie-scale needle in a human-scale haystack, but surely all this tremendous power would also compensate for her lacking the queen's talent with the spell. And maybe this would relieve some of this sensation that felt as though it would tear her apart as well... The blonde resolved to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, Clare was able to reconstitute, little by little, the magical energies that once belonged to her fellow pixies, if she could still even be considered that. The royal alchemist's essence, however, had long since been lost, too thoroughly broken down and assimilated to piece together again. Perhaps for the best, though Clare momentarily pondered if he had been planning this coup that went awry alone, or if he'd been urged by another working in the shadows who would use her as a puppet. Regardless, Clare was also aware that those she was about to revive would not be safe near her, so she would need to work quickly to send them away, preferably somewhere they could use to easily leave Frir Valley and return to their homes. Her voice thundered and echoed through the valley as she recited the ancient incantations, hoping nothing went wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless balls of electric blue energy dispersed from the giantess' fingertip, gradually coalescing into the tiny, familiar shapes of humanoids upon a recently formed plateau. The Captain, named Athenia, watched with awe as this went on, until she had to shield her eyes from a brilliant flash. She heard a barely audible thunk as the revived, and very much naked, pixies were teleported just above her position, where they summarily fell in a collapsed heap of arms, legs, and wings. Immediately, she ordered her guardsmen to tend to them until they had sufficient time to recuperate, gather their bearings, and fly back home on their own... though the latter may have been merely wishful thinking. Not unlike capturing this monstrous pixie girl, much to Athenia's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare slumped further into the valley from her exertion. She had just revived several pixies, separating their magical essence from the vast pool of her own, and teleported them all to a group she'd only now become aware of. She doubted even Queen Kassandra could do this much with all the magic she and Nel had absorbed earlier without killing herself in the attempt. Interestingly, the amount of magic she spent in all of this seemed... negligible, like a humble drop in a mighty ocean. She supposed it made sense; after all, the bigger the pixie, the more magic they have; and with her fingers alone bigger than tree trunks, to say nothing of the rest of her, it was little wonder that she didn't feel drained in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the exertion had also further excited the reaction to all the magic her body still hadn't processed yet. Clare could feel it coming now, and she doubted anything in this world could stop what was about to happen any more than one could stop the passing of the seasons. With the last reserves of her willpower, the titanic pixie urged the group she still didn't know were here to hunt her, \"Leave... this valley... while you still can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brilliant glow of green from the giantess' eyes piercing the thinning veil of fog in the morning sun was more than enough to convince the now much more numerous group to heed her urge with haste. Those that had been consumed by her during her glut, including one that had met that fate and had served to assist the girl in outgrowing the vault where she had begun her binge, were far from eager to relive that, regardless if her body would reabsorb their magical essence in its current state or not. Athenia was reluctant to abandon the chase, but she also had a duty to her men and to the folk revived by this monstrous pixie, and understood she was far too vast to handle without significant reinforcements from the palace, if not the entire pixie kingdom, so she gave the order to fall back for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole valley rumbled from its largest occupant's body's own trembling, the reaction between all the various different forms of magic she devoured almost upon her. She mused for a moment of how her name would go down in history. Perhaps as the pixie who became a new goddess? Or a precautionary tale of the girl who stupidly devoured enough magic to swell to unthinkable size, only for it to be her undoing in the end? Whatever may happen to her, Clare welcomed the reaction with open arms, awaiting what it would lead to, even if that should lead to oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthenia and the others watched from a hopefully safe distance as they awaited what happened next, the captain silently hoping for the girl to either be completely destroyed by it, or somehow be made more manageable to bring her in again to be held accountable for all this madness. She dared not think of whatever else may happen, quashing scenarios of her having to report ill news back to their queen of their former captive having become even more dangerous from her mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The magical reaction within the titanic Clare's body at last took hold. The rumbling of her body as a result of this was louder than any thunderstorm, even without the valley practically amplifying it, and Athenia and those with her chose to fall back even further in the hope of avoiding whatever would come next. The titanic pixie's leg stretching off in the distance still was not an encouraging sign, nor was the sound of solid mountain rock cracking and crumbling... The captain could swear that Clare Cloudlight's leg was stretching even longer, even as her gargantuan knee appeared to bend upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just about really did swear when she realized that was <i>exactly</i> what was happening, and it was happening <i>fast</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare, to her surprise and amusement, found herself witnessing the results of the latent magical reaction. She was having an earth-shaking growth spurt, which if she were to guess, would be far greater than the ones before it. However, as the gigantic growing pixie noted, the feeling of this spurt was much different than the previous ones. Before, growing had always felt light, airy, even tingly. The tawny haired giantess could say that growing felt almost numbing, a bit like the feeling just after hitting your funny bone on something, only all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this growth felt more... invigorating, and Clare could feel virtually everything going on in her body! She could sense, within her swelling frame, changes in every fiber of her very being, seemingly incorporating some useful traits once granted to her by the unstable concoction of raw magic swimming in her stomach. Spells and magic would be ineffective against her increasingly colossal hide, and could potentially be reflected back at their caster. Or she could consume the magic for sustenance, at this point she being so immense even Kassandra's best spell coupled with the magic she had drawn out from her and Nel would not make her grow to any noticeable degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore interestingly, the instability and unpredictability the titanic pixie broadcast into the air was fading, meaning something like a bird getting too close wouldn't be transfigured into, say, a flower pot to fall to the ground. As well, her bodily functions were becoming flexible. Like she needn't worry about hunger unless she wanted to eat, and, amusingly, she could produce as much milk as she damn well pleased, and imbue it with certain magical properties if she so desired. A relative drop could grant Nel enough magic to start a chain reaction to become her equal, while also preventing the blue-haired pixie from getting out of control if she were to thirst for more magic milk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of this was odd, yet strangely enticing, to the blonde, now over a mile in size and increasingly having difficulty fitting in the valley. Mountains crumbled and forests uprooted by the acre before her, all just from the force of her relentless expansion alone. The realization of the destruction she caused so effortlessly sent a shudder of pleasure down the monstrous pixie's spine. She loved the idea of this testament of her size and power, though she'd likely think of how to undo the damage afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthenia and her company's hiding spot was soon reduced to rubble from the growing pixie's unstoppable advance, causing them to fall. Yet before they could open their wings and take flight, the group lands on something hard... something that was decidedly not rock. \"Where are we?\" the captain asks, in a way that was almost demanding a to-the-point answer. Said answer was quick to make itself known as she and her guardsmen found themselves being spread further and further apart from each other. \"Scratch that...\" The group was on top of one of Clare's fingernails, her hand having smashed through their hiding spot in just the simple act of trying to push off the ground to stand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for them, Clare's senses had been increasing dramatically as another change to her body, as though to aid her in communicating with the rest of the world. As she lifted her ever-increasing mass into the sky, momentarily delighted to literally have her head in the clouds, and taking this time to at last stretch her enormous wings which had been partially cramped from her prone position on the floor of the valley, she felt something on her nail. Very carefully, the giantess lifted her hand and squint at her nail, able to make out, with alarmingly clear detail, that group she had urged to leave. It slowly dawned on her that she was so vast there was no plausible way for them to have escaped Frir Valley in time, as deep in it as they were. \"Damn... I'm pretty fucking huge!\" she mused, her voice loud, yet not deafeningly so. It also dawned on her that she recognized the tallest pixie in the group. \"Wait a second...\" Clare struggled for a moment, even as she continued to grow ever larger and feel more alive, \"You're Athenia, the captain of the Royal Guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Athenia confirmed, staring unflinchingly into the growing, glowing, sea green eye as best she could. She would not admit her terror outwardly, though her body betrayed her despite her best efforts. Still, none of them had been turned into random things, so she felt that perhaps there was a chance they could defeat the giant pixie. Dealing with the massive, magic-laden body would be another matter entirely, and one she believed best considered when they got to it, but not before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, it took little time for Clare to discern that Athenia and her guardsmen had come to bring her in, perhaps hoping they could apprehend her before she gorged herself on too much magic. The captain was brave, the tawny, still growing titan gave her that, but knew she could do nothing to her. She briefly pondered messing with Athenia, but she also felt that she had put those she had revived through enough, and had at least a little respect for the captain. \"You came to try and recapture or destroy me, right? Well, I believe you can do neither at this point.\" she states, \"Oh, don't worry, I've no intention of harming anyone. For now, you may as well get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthenia didn't wish to believe it, but as the clouds appeared to be left below Clare's chin, with more and more of her immense, pale cleavage being exposed by the second, she had to consider that they were indeed way out of their league. The captain had no idea at first why she was now somehow able to comprehend more of the growing pixie's body, but soon suspected that Clare herself was helping her make out more of her body. The group felt a sudden dip as Clare decided to take a seat on her gargantuan ass with an earth-shattering boom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, Kassandra and Nel felt a violent tremor rip through the palace, the likes of which hadn't been seen in ages. The two pixies embraced each other out of instinctual fright, and, perhaps, something more, until the tremor subsided. Hurriedly, they let go of one another as palace officials stumbling to their feet began to take notice, yet not dare question it. Both feared what the tremor entailed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare closed her eyes, humming as she concentrated on the feeling the still ongoing growth spurt gave her. She could feel every inch of new bone she gained, every once of flesh added to her mass. If the queen hadn't granted Nel a taste of what real growth felt like, as opposed to inflating oneself on magic gas like a balloon, she thought, she would grant her that feeling herself. Soon, she felt it subside, and with a content sigh, she opened her eyes, which glowed a brilliant sea green. Once again, her head was poking above the highest clouds, and she got the impression her previous size was dwarfed by her ankle alone. This sent another shiver of pleasure down her spine, and hurricane-force winds from the slight, uncontrolled flutter of her wings. She mused she'd have to keep that in check as she lightly sprung to her feet, magically shielding the valley from further damage so she could harmlessly feel the landscape beneath her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon standing to her full height, the tawny giantess couldn't help but giggle. At this point, she could restore most of the magical things she devoured, and in a way that would be pleasurable for her. Thinking upon it, she loosed a relatively small stream of her milk, which far from merely falling upon the ground below her feet, which surprisingly she could actually see, split and raced off towards the places she had ransacked for sources of magic, seemingly of its own accord. \"Now that's just showing off...\" Athenia grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it also serves to return the magic I devoured. I don't really need it anymore.\" Clare replied to her would-be captor, smiling, \"The real show is how you guys are still able to breathe up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The milk was imbued with the magic and will reform into the stuff I ate last night. Anyway, I think I should make myself more presentable to Queen Kassandra...\" Clare informed, before magically fashioning a pair of panties and a bra for herself, which felt so wonderfully soft on her skin. She topped it off with a magnificent iridescent dress that left little of her voluptuous curves to the imagination... despite her needing to aid others in seeing her in full now, not that she minded. \"Much better! Well then, let's head back to the palace! It should only take me, what, ten steps at most to get there!\" she beamed with a cheerful laugh as she begun her first steps, repairing the valley to its former glory shortly after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From around the construction site busily repairing the palace walls where Claire first emerged, workers saw what seemed to be a torrent of white liquid rushing towards them. It looked like... milk, but it sure didn't behave like any they knew of, what with it appearing to not touch the ground and dodging buildings in its path as though alive. Terrified, they darted out of the way as fast as their limbs could carry them. To their shock, as it flowed into the remains of the magical vault, it broke up into various colored fluids, which then created or reformed individual bottles and containers for the various magical potions that had once been stored within. \"What... what did we just witness?\" one of the workers asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch occurred in other places, including the ruined library having its magical tomes restored and neatly ordered... before promptly falling to the ground without shelves to rest on, and the lake' magical waters returning. The ore from the mines, on the other hand, stopped shy of entering the mine, instead piling neatly next to its entrance, ready to be loaded and carried off to be processed into a more readily workable form. Indeed, the pixie kingdom was dumbstruck by all of this. At first, many pixies cheered or breathed a sigh of relief in the belief that the danger of Clare Cloudlight was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a tremor rumbled through the land, followed by another, and another after that. The town with the library fell into shadow. Its citizens gasped as they looked up as far as their necks would allow, some even falling to their backs, finding Clare staring down upon them and the library in particular, so vast that she blotted out the sun, her bare toes alone dwarfing nearby trees. Somehow, they could comprehend her smiling face, as well as her free hand giving a friendly wave, unaware that she was assisting them. Just as they feared for their lives, she resumed her journey with another earth-shaking step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kassandra could see from the window the utterly massive 16 mile pixie fast approaching the palace despite the tawny haired giantess' very leisurely pace. \"My queen... w-what should we do?\" a guardsman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the gates to the palace and raise the magical barriers. See to it that Clare Cloudlight does not get through. I fear she may be after me, and her friend Nel Nightfall.\" Kassandra answers, maintaining her calm despite her own fears threatening to destroy the facade. Her people needed her calm and level-headed, and her panicking would not be beneficial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardsman bowed, and departed to deliver his queen's command. The pixie city palace was well equipped in its fortifications to discourage even a dragon from wanting to waste its time in trying to breach through. It hardly took more than a few minutes for the massive gates to close, one by one, followed by layer after layer of shimmering barrier to be erected. \"My queen...\" Nel whispered next to her worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know not what Clare's intentions are, Nel, but I too wonder what she's up to out there. If her goal was to destroy us, surely she would be making haste for the palace rather than taking her time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthenia watched helplessly as Clare examined the city before moving on. The captain of the royal guard disliked feeling helpless, and her current position atop Clare's vast fingernail felt like it mocked her. Thankfully, the tawny titan had teleported those she had revived down to the town before she left, so Athenia didn't have to worry about them any longer. \"You do know that the palace and surrounding city are renowned for their defenses, right?\" she asked, \"And how do you intend to do anything meaningful at your scale? You're too damn big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, at this size, I could fit my home village on my nipple easily,\" Clare paused in her answer as the thought sent a shiver of pleasure down her spine, needing just a moment to keep her wings from fluttering and potentially causing disastrous effects, \"but it won't really be an issue, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic blonde took another couple of steps, stopping at the border of the pixie city that served as the capital of their kingdom. She could feel the powerful magic of the barriers near her toes, the outermost layer generously stretching almost to her ankle and giving her another pleasure-filled shiver over just how massive she was. She crouched down as low as she could, granting the city a view of the biggest breasts this world had ever known through the top of her iridescent dress in the process, and said, \"Don't even try it, boys. If you attack me with your spells, I'll be forced to reflect them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne brave guard fired a blast anyway, which traveled towards Clare, only to turn mere inches from the skin of her big toe and fly right back at him and knock him onto his butt. She sighed, then proceeded to tap the barrier. It flickered, before it and the layers beneath it cracked and shattered, dissolving in a shower of sparkles, much to the shock and horror of everyone else. Never in the city's history had its defenses fallen, and the notion of them falling so rapidly, up to this point, had been unthinkable! Then, with a heavy sigh, Clare... vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Athenia's vision cleared, she found herself on the ground, facing a far less gigantic Clare. Automatically, the guardsmen took the opportunity to attempt to apprehend the blonde, only to be frozen in place before they could take a step. \"I still have all the magic of my 16 mile size. Now, come Athenia. I've an appointment with the queen, and I'd like your company.\" Clare declared, calmly walking off towards the palace, flying over each gate when she came to it. Seeing little choice, Athenia followed the now 10 foot blonde as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, the Royal Guard would approach the reduced giant pixie, weapons raised. Though she loathed to do so, Athenia ordered, \"As your captain, I order you all to stand down!\" Immediately, they lowered their weapons, unwilling to question their amazonian (by pixie standards) captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare smiled as she bent down and gave an all too familiar guard a light pat on the helmet. \"I'm sorry about the other day... I'd be willing to do almost anything to make it up to you later, if you'd like...\" she apologized sincerely, hoping she wouldn't have to explain why she was only showing remorse for her actions now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra and Nel had seen how quickly the defenses crumbled, and while the latter was panicking, the former retained her calm. The throne room's door bulged for a moment, then unlocked of its own accord to allow Clare to crawl in, followed by Athenia. \"Good afternoon, Miss Cloudlight. I have received reports throughout the kingdom about you since your escape from the dungeons.\" Kassandra addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we've gotten off on the wrong foot, but I'm not the monster you think I am. I've revived nearly everyone I ate last night, and returned the magic to its proper place. The previous royal alchemist wanted me as a puppet ruler, though someone talked him into it. It may have been to prepare the kingdom to fall to this stranger while the alchemist tried to replicate the results from Nel and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you returned everything, Clare... why are you still so huge?\" Nel asked, making her presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was unstable magic, so it changed me.\" Clare answered, \"Wait... Nel? Oh my gosh, Nel! Look at you! You've grown! I didn't know if Queen Kassandra would give you a proper taste of growth, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, why do you care? You can flaunt being stupidly huge all you want, and clearly even the city's defenses are no match for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare sighed. It was now or never, even if Nel was already committed to their queen. \"Nellie... I know I've done almost nothing but drive our friendship apart, but... I... I love you.\" she admitted, cheeks burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKassandra studied Clare, and said, \"Clare, if you inform me of who set you free and why, I will pardon you for your past crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare turned her gaze to the queen and nodded, proceeding to tell everything she knew and had done. Both Kassandra and Nel were shocked to learn the royal alchemist had attempted to stage a coup, only for it to backfire when she totally absorbed him, but even more shocked to learn someone else may have pulled his strings with the prospect of creating a new goddess. \"In that sense,\" she concluded, \"he succeeded. I've ensured the kind of reactions Nel and I experienced won't happen again, but this other party is an unknown. They may try to attack our kingdom, so I'd recommend we be prepared to defend our realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Clare Cloudlight, you are hereby pardoned for your past transgressions. As our new goddess, I personally look forward to working alongside you, though I must wonder for how long you're able to remain at this scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as needed, my queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you both may call me Kassandra. We are all equal here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel mulled things over in her mind. Her heart couldn't deny she loved Clare back, but it also refused to let go of Kassandra. They were both breathtaking in their beauty, and have shown her kindness. \"I'm sorry, but... I can't choose between you...\" she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare and Kassandra's eyes met before resting upon the blue haired pixie who meant so much to them. \"Oh, Nel... I don't believe that will be a problem. I have no qualms with the three of us being mates if that is what your heart desires.\" Kassandra informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that as well, Nellie. It'll be awkward, at first, but we can get used to it.\" Clare said with a warm smile. Today was turning out far better than she expected, and she hoped to repay both Nel and Kassandra for giving her another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Athenia, still standing silently by the door... She wasn't quite sure what to think.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A day passed since Clare \"stormed\" the palace, and much of the pixie world was still uneasy. The palace clearly still stood, but no word had been given yet regarding the fate of their beloved queen. Some younger, more imaginative pixies tried to sell anyone who would listen on the idea that Clare and Kassandra battled it out with terrifying displays of magic. A duel between the royal bloodline, which had always been steeped in magic, especially expressed in the females, and Claire's stolen gains. The endings varied wildly, but one thing was certain: the entire kingdom waited with bated breath to learn whether she'd been banished for good, or they were now in her gigantic, iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kassandra and Nel awoke on warm, soft, creamy beds, both of which slowly rose and fell in unison. Silky white fabric, softer than anything Kassandra had ever known before, kept them both snugly tucked in well over their heads, which rested on pink pillows attached to the creamy surroundings. Feeling a little mischievous, Nel gave the pink pillow a gentle rub, causing it to rise and harden as she played with it until their blanket was removed, grinning cheekily at what greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they weren't really beds at all, but rather Clare's enormous breasts, her bra providing her mates with a cover, and Nel had been playing with the nipple she'd used as a pillow. \"Oh, alright, Nellie. Kassandra, our beloved blue haired <i>imp</i> of a mate wants us to get up.\" she said, smiling, winking a sea green eye at Nel. As much as she loved the feeling of the landscape beneath her, she was glad to have a nice, plush mattress to sleep on. And her mates snuggled upon her breasts had been an arousing suggestion she was glad Nel made. Perhaps they'd all take turns now and then, with Clare remembering to render them all invulnerable to prevent overnight misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she, now? It has only been a single night, and already I fear we may be spoiling her!\" Kassandra chuckled lightly, though in truth she had been considering doing the same. It was in their nature to be at least a little impish, and Kassandra was no exception when her duties as queen didn't require her to resist it. Unfortunately for all three, the fun their hearts desired would have to wait. By now, some of the more ridiculous rumors of what transpired between herself and Clare were starting to enter the palace walls, and even most of the palace officials knew not of what actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, revealing everything at once may be taken the wrong way, and she hadn't revealed to anyone that she and Nel were an item yet, so perhaps it'd be best to withhold what needn't be known for now. Regardless, the redhead fluttered off of Clare's breast, landing on the ground gracefully, before swelling back to her previous size with a moan. She was sorely tempted to keep growing, just as she was to enjoy her mates for breakfast, but her duties called. She, with great effort and Nel's aid, squeezed herself into a dress, and then left the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose we both need to get ready. Life in the palace is nothing like our old life.\" Nel stated, looking for a suitable dress. She was welcome to Kassandra's wardrobe, seeing as how she had been granted her previous 2'8\" size, but so many of them looked too regal on her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for starters, you're no longer whining about being so small. Now you're one of the biggest pixies around!\" Clare nodded, \"Here, I'll give you something that's a little more... you.\" She concentrated, and began to form a dress for Nel in a similar style to her own. When finished, its blood red fabric hugged Nel's body nicely, and was very soft on her skin. It would not do for the dress to blemish her creamy flesh in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... This is definitely more my style!\" Nel beamed, her wings fluttering in happiness. She also marveled at the black boots appearing on her legs, featuring red trim at the top, before settling to the ground and leaving the bedroom to join Kassandra for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare left the room herself shortly after, making sure to rearrange everything back to the way it was before, if slightly messy. The blonde made herself invisible to anyone she passed in the halls, considering she didn't want to be seen until she was properly introduced, and then slipped outside. She tried to fly, but fell back down on her ass almost immediately. \"Ouch! I guess a 10 foot pixie's just too heavy to fly...\" she grumbled. Still, she needed release after last night, and so gave both of her mates the ability to mentally contact her when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of, and Kassandra bidding her a safe trip, Clare teleported herself to a familiar location: Frir Valley. It was here that her transformation into a goddess, for lack of a better term, had completed, so she felt something of a connection to its borders. She took a few minutes to marvel at its beauty at her 10 foot size, and then returned to her titanic 16 mile height, shielding the valley from harm while she was at it. As much as she wanted to have taken it slowly and feel it happen, she had no time for that. This was her opportunity for release...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Clare was resting happily with a mountain buried between her legs, the entire valley flooded with her milk, when Nel mentally contacted her, letting her know to get ready. The tawny giantess willed her mess to clean itself as she stood once more, her iridescent dress returning to cover her within moments, and then confined herself to 10 feet once again. \"I needed that...\" she sighed, just before teleporting back to the palace. It's fortunate that the palace was as vast as it was, since otherwise the blonde wouldn't be able to stand upright at this size, and would have to settle for something even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the throne room, Kassandra had assembled the palace officials for a meeting. A few moments into it, a small figure burst into the room, clearly out of breath, earning her looks of disdain from the gathered officials. \"I'm sorry I'm late! I-\" she began, only to trip on her own too large robes, falling upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're interrupting an important meeting, girl. State your business, and then begone.\" one of the officials informed coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace, Edmund. I've recently appointed Marina as royal alchemist, so you will treat her with respect.\" Kassandra reprimanded. Once Marina had been seated, Kassandra moved on to business. \"As you all can clearly see, I'm unharmed from the incident yesterday. We'll be making an announcement later today, but first, I'd like to introduce you all to my new aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened, and Nel walked into the room excitedly. \"Pardon, my queen, but isn't that the pixie who arrived here in shackles a few days ago?\" the grand sorceress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's me. My name's Nel Nightfall, and the queen deemed me worthy of being rewarded her old size for the rest of my days.\" Nel answered, coming to a halt beside her mate, \"It's an honor to be in her service, considering my humble origins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina could see the look Nel and Kassandra shared with one another for the brief moment it was there. She had her suspicions, but kept quiet. \"Now, I know this may come as a shock to some, but we have a new goddess in our midst whom I look forward to working alongside.\" Kassandra continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the doors opened. This time, Clare entered through them, straightening up to her full current size shortly after. Nearly everyone in the room gasped in shock and disbelief. \"Everyone thinks I, Clare Cloudlight, came here yesterday to overthrow our queen. In truth, I returned, transformed by the very unstable magics I foolishly consumed in a fit of madness, to pledge my services to her. It's my hope that I can build your trust in me as we all strive for the hope of a bright future, and protect our realm.\" she informed, kneeling down to show her respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is what the palace is to announce later?\" Marina asked, doing her best not to collapse under the stress she was in just by being at this meeting, by far the smallest and least impressive pixie here despite being the previous royal alchemist's oldest and most talented apprentice. She hated that she didn't even fit in the smallest robes they had. She had been a little taller than Nel originally, but lacked her blessed curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and with that said, this meeting is adjourned.\" Kassandra replied, \"However, I'd like for you to stay behind for a few moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened, Marina remained seated as the others filed out, leaving her alone with Kassandra, Nel, and Clare. \"I-is this because I was late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have my first task for all three of you, and this seemed to be a good time to give it to you rather than needlessly summon you later.\" Kassandra smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have heard that Nel and I grew to tremendous heights a couple days ago, which required the queen's intervention. This was sparked by a combination of an apparent shrinking potion and a growth potion meant to serve as an antidote.\" Clare explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that makes no sense. The effects should have canceled each other out before either of you could consume any unrefined magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I want to know what that potion was, and if possible, where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll look into it, but I need a sample of that potion so I can try to match it with what's in our records.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's where Nel and Clare come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, my queen? Perhaps one of us should stay as a precaution...\" Clare asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain, Clare, though I appreciate your concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, i-if it isn't too much to ask... I really hate tripping on my robes all the time, so could I be grown at least enough to properly fit in these things?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning following Clare\u2019s escape, Nel awoke in the Empress\u2019 quarters. Her eyes were still blurry with sleep as lay on her back and gazed at the gold and white rococo ceiling. She stretched out under the covers before remembering the evening before. She lifted the blue sheets to look down at her swollen body stretched out before her. Nel closed her eyes and heaved a sigh, smelling Kassandra on the pillows about her, and thought back on the night. Nel, now swelled to the size of, perhaps, a small human, for once in her life felt big and satisfied. She rolled over, but the Empress had already risen and there was no sign of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel rose, only naturally bumping her head on the bedframe, and crossed the room to one of the tall windows, still foggy with the heat of the room, and looked out at the mist on the Palace lawns. Nel, absentmindedly stroked the blue curtains with her cheek and looked at the golden curtain rail at her eyelevel and smiled. Nel picked her way across the room and gingerly inspected on of the huge wardrobes, so large, in fact, that they seemed to hold up the room. Having found a dress which more or less covered by body, Nel slipped from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallways were eerily quiet and unpopulated as Nel wandered down them barefooted, like a spectre. At the end of one such hall, Nel heard voices coming from a set of double doors that lay ajar. She recognised the voice of the Empress, and slowly nudged the doors open. The Empress was sat with several others at a large table, including: the Grand Sorceress; the Imperial Arch-mage; the Imperial General; a young Alchemist Nel did not recognise, and the seven or so Imperial judges. The Empress cast her eye over Nel, but continued talking, unphased. The Sorceress and Arch-mage raised their eyebrows at the tall, fleshy pixie inching her way into the room, her head grazing the doorframe. Nel crossed the room and sat, as best she could, beside the young Alchemist, who budged aside to accommodate Nel\u2019s hips and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress was reading aloud from a pile of letters. At first Nel found the sense of the conversation difficult to follow. The Empress read only from the pile of letters, several of which, when Nel entered, were already read. Nel furrowed her brow as she listen to the reports of some immense \u201ccreature\u201d attacking locations in the shadow of the castle; the Palace had been inundated with letters pleading for help. This particular letter concerned an attack made by this monster on the magic ore mines on the slopes of the nearby mountain range. As the Empress read on through the letters, in her low and sonorous voice, several phrases jumped out at Nel, repeating themselves and building her impression of the creature: \u201c\u2026the mineshaft was lit by an eerie green glow\u201d; \u201c\u2026the eye of some colossus\u201d; \u201creached into the mine with an arm like a sea-serpent\u201d; \u201cgrabbed my men, mine carts, and clumps of the mine itself\u201d; \u201cterrible crunching and thunderous booms of laughter\u201d; \u201cAll of a sudden, seemed to grow\u201d; \u201csome huge monster that seemed to glow like phosphorous in the night\u201d; \u201cdrank a lake\u201d; \u201c\u2026towered up into the clouds\u201d; \u201c\u2026sounded, at first, like thunder; \u201chuge glowing eyes\u201d; \u201cthe air, as it strode across the treetops, seemed to crackle about me\u201d; \u201cBecame bigger and bigger\u201d; \u201c\u2026craters left behind\u201d; \u201cgreat golden head\u2026\u201d; \u201cunstoppable\u201d; \u201ctoo big\u2026\u201d; \u201ccontinued to consume\u2026\u201d; \u201cblue streams of magic across its skin\u201d; \u201cgrotesquely swollen\u201d; \u201cabomination\u201d; \u201c\u2026transforming\u201d. The Empress finished the last letter, which closed with the line: \u201cMy Empress, how can we stop such a thing?\u201d The Empress set down the letter and repeated the last lines in a low voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore ever the Empress had reached the last letter, Nel had clustered the impressions into a composite and realised that the colossal monster attacking the outlying regions must, in fact, be Clare! Though she, at that moment, did not know how Clare had grown again, Nel did know that having a giant Clare on loose, again, could spell only trouble for everyone involved. But it sounded, at least to Nel, like Clare had completely lost it, as she\u2019d been driven mad the bigger she became, or maybe that she was crazed by the desire to be bigger? It was a worrying thought that a magic-maddened Clare was trampling across the landscape; who knew what she might be capable of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress laid aside the final letter; there was brief silence. The Empress breathed before saying: \u201cIt would seem our little captive, Miss Cloudlight, has become a not-so-little fugitive\u201d The Grand Sorceress nodded and the Archmage made an affirmative sound. The Empress, a picture of calmness, laid her hands on the table and said: \u201cI fully admit to you that I am not certain how to deal with a\u2026problem of this magnitude. The girl has, from what I can gather, according to our friend here,\u201d she gestured at the young alchemist, \u201cingested a great number of Alchemical substances for our vault, which triggered a series of violent magical reactions, and, needless to say, resulted in her rather exaggerated change of scale.\u201d The Empress gestured to the letters: \u201cWorse yet, if these accounts are to be believed, Miss Cloudlight, having outgrown the Vault, has gone on to seek and consume other such magical sources, only intensifying the severity of her case. Not only has Clare Cloudlight grown colossal, she is becoming bigger. I fear that if we do not act soon Miss Cloudlight will be unstoppable.\u201d <br>\r\nThe Grand Sorceress was the first to speak, saying \u201cIt seems, as well, that this young pixie has disappeared altogether; she has not been sighted since the early morning; one would have thought she was difficult to miss.\u201d She waved a hand, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to assume that she has gone off in pursuit of more sources of magic?\u201d The Empress nodded gravely. The Arch-mage spoke up now, asking \u201cI am still unclear on her motivation in this? And how did she manage this?\u201d The Empress shrugged, looking quickly at Nel, \u201cRevenge\u2026most probably\u2026on myself\u201d The Empress seated herself before adding, \u201cAs for how, I believe our young friend can enlighten you\u201d, gesturing at the young Alchemist seated beside Nel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Alchemist opened a great ledger before her, usually in the possession of the Grand Apothecary, and flicked through the pages until she found her place. \u201cThis\u201d, she began, \u201cis the Grand Apothecary\u2019s diary; I managed to retrieve it from his quarters after the incident last night\u2026seeing as he is now somewhat \u2018indisposed\u2019\u201d. \u201cA few days ago\u201d, she went on, \u201cthe Grand Apothecary seems to have learned of an instance in the nearby woods of two female pixies becoming veritable giantesses through ingestion of unrefined magic.\u201d She paused. \u201cHis entries become fixated on the idea of how best to research and exploit this, making reference continually to \u2018the possibilities.\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Alchemist continued to talk: \u201cHis entries are accompanied by sketches and vague notes in ink and with a shaky hand. The sketches seem to be preliminary and to accompany his thoughts, including one of a \u2018normal\u2019 female pixie set alongside a human being but followed by one where the sizes of these figures is equal, perhaps the pixie is a fraction taller, and this is followed by another still where the pixie is portrayed as quite radically larger than the human figure; another sketch shows a female pixie towering up from serrated lines which can only stand for the treetops, while another, overleaf, show a female pixie with the hastily drawn outlines of a town at her ankles, it cannot be said if it is a pixie town or a human town because the scale has not been given.\u201d The young girl reflected: \u201cIt seems, at least partly, that he saw the chance to adjust the world, as he saw it, for the better \u2013 to make pixies big, bigger than humans, or, if need be, even bigger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl resumed: \u201cThe entry for yesterday seems very excited to learn of the arrival of at least one of these pixies in the castle and seems very keen to make her acquaintance, for reasons that the last entry makes clear. His intention seems to have been to illicit Miss Cloudlight\u2019s help in staging a coup on your Highness and the Palace. He seems to have planned to use the Vault to make Miss Cloudlight just big enough to take the Palace by storm and overthrow your Highness as Empress; it would seem, however, that Miss Cloudlight had bigger plans for herself in all this. She was obviously more dangerous than he expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing briefly, the young pixie added: \u201cI must say though, I do not think the growth-coup was entirely of his devising \u2013 he seemed, instead, to be driven by an alchemical curiosity to experiment with her body, to see a pixie swell and grow to those proportions, to measure her, to understand how she grew, to chart her rise, moment by moment, until she was taller than trees, to, if possible, recreate it. Writing shortly before he released Miss Cloudlight, acting, so he writes, on the advice of another, whom is not named, the Grand Apothecary wrote, with zeal and hubris: \u2018Wish me luck, for I go now to create a new kind of creature, who will shake the very foundations of the world!\u2019 The young Alchemist closed the book and looked at the Empress, who was sitting with her head over her fingers, and eyebrow raised. \u201cIt seems to me\u201d, said the Archmage after a while \u201clike our Grand Apothecary had rather grand designs on the Empire\u2026to create a new Empress it seems.\u201d \u201cI think, rather,\u201d added the Grand Sorceress, \u201cthat the intention, muddled and mad though it was, was to create\u2026a new Goddess\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd,\u201d broke in the Empress, somewhat rattled, \u201cregardless of motivation, in doing so he has succeeded only in unleashing on the Empire, and the rest of the world an increasingly magic-hungry titan whose only thoughts are to destroy, to eat, to grow and to let nothing stop her!\u201d The table was silent as Kassandra cast her eyes about: \u201cso, I ask you, friends,\u201d she said softly \u201cwhat are we to do to stop Clare Cloudlight?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours later, as the day was drawing to a close, Nel stood with a crowd of others, gathered at the Empress\u2019 request, by a cortege of carriages, drawn by harnessed birds. Nel noticed that this time the carriages were drawn by elegant geese and some, such as the much larger vessel, almost a kind of boat, into which Kassandra was stepping, by snowy owls, for their journey, so she was told, would take them up into the frost-covered mountains in the reaches far to the North. Nel boarded a carriage, which tilted awfully as she put her weight on the steps, with only the Grand Sorceress and the young Alchemist, both of whom sat side by side and Nel had one cushioned side of the carriage to herself, for her huge thighs and hips swallowed up the space and she had considerable difficulty squeezing herself into the carriage in the first place. Nel, her head and neck crooked against the carriage roof, looked sheepishly and apologetically at the two passengers opposite her. Before long the carriages all moved off and soon ascended into the evening air; Nel\u2019s carriage, pulled by two owls, pulling a little extra weight, made a laboured climb into the sky, but eventually rose to join the others in a procession across the reddening sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel twisted herself to look out of the latticed window of the carriage, out at the castle and its walls and grounds receding into the twilight. The sight of the castle at such a height, which more like a toy or a postcard of some fairytale castle, reminded Nel of the time when, only a few days before, she had actually stood at just such an immense height, towering over the landscape, and looked down, through clouds girdling her hips, at the miniature buildings at her toes, seeming more like ornate and fragile growths of mushroom and toadstools, sprung up from the forest floor, than the buildings that she, Clare and other creatures called their homes. But, she thought, she might be misremembering, maybe she was not actually so tall as she remembered, and maybe she seemed larger in retrospect than she actually was, owing to that peculiar way one amplifies features in the theatre of our memory, so that a young pixie of a modest fifty foot in height suddenly ballooned until she was a truly monstrous five hundred foot tall. For it all seemed so long ago, even though it was not very long ago at all, and now seemed almost like a dream to Nel and she would probably have doubted its occurrence altogether, so close was it to her happiest dreams, if she were not now cramped in the side of a roomy royal carriage with two other pixies who occupied nothing like the same space and in pursuit of a positively gigantic Clare. The sun was now setting behind the hills and the forests, which stippled the hillsides they were passing over, sank slowly into a deeper and deeper blue. Nel looked out at the forests, lost in thought, and, but for the wisps of cloud passing before her eyes and across the landscape, she could have sworn that the forests seemed like expanses of sphagnum moss and that she could easily walk across them, feeling her feet sink into the cushiony ground, as on a quiet night As the lights came on in the forest cottages and villages this impression dispersed and was replaced, as the carriages climbed higher, by the feeling that the hillsides, and the forests, broken up by the lattice, were a massive blue and purplish honeycomb, and, as she traced a finger absentmindedly on the pane, it was all Nel could do to prevent herself reaching out and plucking a great and dripping piece of this comb from the landscape, leaving the hillside bleeding, and, heedless of the gouts sticky honey dripping on her chest, biting into it with her lush and parted lips. Nel, lost in thought, found her mouth watering and she awkwardly shifted her hips in the closeness of her carriage seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel scratched her left hip, which had pressed into the wooden arm of the booth as she looked out of the window, and turned back to the interior of the carriage, at the two other passengers, the Grand Sorceress and the young Alchemist, both whom had also been admiring the landscape, but were, perhaps, not lost in the same sort of revelries as Nel. The Grand Sorceress was tall, but not so tall as Nel or Kassandra, and elegant as a swan, with a kind of effortless grace, with a touch of frost, in her demeanour, she was of perhaps the Empress\u2019 age and her shoulder-length, chestnut hair was tied up in a knot, with tresses lying softly about her face. Nel found herself curiously subdued around the Grand Sorceress and looked away shyly when the Sorceress\u2019 eye caught Nel\u2019s admiring the the gold coronet, socketed with the large, smooth lozenges of several sapphires, the Sorceress wore, which also framed and lent greater definition to her face. The little Alchemist, whom Nel had never seen before until today, was still in her oversized robes, with her cowl still drawn up over her head, shading her eyes, but Nel could still distinguish her small features, her delicate, slightly upturned nose, and her pretty little mouth, which she pursed to a corner of her face as she looked out of the right-hand window. The day had ended without any of them saying a word until Nel, once the landscape below was basically swallowed up by the inky gloom, asked where it was they were headed. The little Alchemist, whose name, Nel soon learned, was Marina, only shrugged and said that all she had been told was Northwards, to the mountains beyond the kingdom. The Grand Sorceress, seeing that neither of her travelling companions knew, said, in a drawling and lugubrious voice, which Nel though made her seem only more impressive somehow, that they were heading Northwards because Nel\u2019s acquaintance, by which she meant the giant Clare, was last seen heading North. \u201cThere are\u201d, said the Sorceress, \u201cin the icebound mountain ranges, where there are often storms raging, vast natural deposits of magic ore.\u201d The Sorceress made a gesture with her long-fingered hand. \u201cWhat goes sometimes unmentioned is that beneath these mountains and ice flows there runs a current of raw magic, for the veins and deposits mined by ourselves, dwarves, goblins and other peoples have to form out of the condensation and cystallisation of this ebb and flow.\u201d Here the Marina mentioned that she can remember reading something about this, while Nel listened attentively. \u201cOf course\u201d, went on the Sorceress, \u201cthis is not normally accessible or noticeable, save in the deepest caves or mines, or where it escapes from the planet through natural vents or wells, looking like jets of flame or like huge, sea green pools or lakes\u2014 ordinarily.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u201d, and here the Grand Sorceress permitted herself a little laugh in her throat, as she rocked a little from the movement of the carriage in the air, \u201cI suppose none of us is an ever-growing behemoth\u201d. The Grand Sorceress paused and eyed Nel for a moment. Nel asked the Sorceress if she thought Clare had headed North in search of this new source of raw magic. The Sorceress thought a moment before saying: \u201cI do not think so, but must admit that it is an unhappy coincidence and, even if it is unknown to your friend, it surely will not remain so for long\u201d, here the Sorceress straightened her back against the carriage seat, \u201c\u2014hence our journey.\u201d Marina could not help expressing the fear that, should Clare happen upon one of these wells or vents, or, just as likely, break open a mountainside as she made her way, and, as she was wont to do, gorge herself, like some massive vampire bat, there was no telling how large or how powerful she might become. Nel could not help but imagine Clare gigantic body, rivers of sea green running from the corners of her mouth, slaking her thirst on the gushing mountainside, growing as she did so until her reared buttocks blotted out the sun and imagined Clare, belly distended, rolling over and collapsing back onto the landscape, gasping in abject euphoria as she grew more and more. \u201cI believe\u201d, said the Grand Sorceress, \u201cthat this is exactly Her Majesty\u2019s concern in all this; for, you are right, should your friend\u201d, here she nodded at Nel in the gloom,\u201ddo this, she would likely become more or less unstoppable\u2014 that is, assuming she is not already so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer body is dangerously unstable\u201d added Marina, \u201cmagic just bounces off her; she even affects her environment around her; without even doing anything.\u201d Marina added that it was truly scary to see Clare\u2019s hunger drive her and she wondered if the potent magics Clare had ingested in the Alchemy Vaults had not in some way clouded a lot of her judgement and reasoning. \u201cI was there\u201d, went on Marina, suddenly a bit more animated, her eyes lighting up beneath her cowl, \u201cwhen she guzzled all those mixtures; I thought, with the amount she ingested, that she was going to explode or rip asunder from the magic, but no,\u201d Marina made a ballooning gesture accompanied by an excited laugh, \u201cshe just started to grow and grow and grow!\u201d Calming down, Marina added meekly \u201cI mean, with a body so bloated with magic, there\u2019s no telling what she could do or what she\u2019ll become.\u201d Nel remained curious. The carriage rocked and Nel hit her head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking\u201d, said Nel, rubbing her head, \u201chow does Her Majesty plan to fight or control Clare? It will take a lot to stop Clare getting what Clare wants; she was stubborn even when she was yo\u2014our size, always kind of wanting her own way, and gaining these \u2018few\u2019 extra feet and tonnes seems only to have made her worse!\u201d The Sorceress smiled at Nel and appeared to think for a little while before answering, with a wave of her hand: \u201cOh, I wouldn't worry yourself about that; I am lead to believe that Her Majesty has some plan in place, some grand design, I am not aware of the specifics, but I am in no doubt your large friend (Clare was it?) will soon meet her match.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel and Marina exchanged glances across the carriage as they travelled on through the clouded night sky...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was not long before Nel drifted off to sleep in the rocking carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel did know how long she was asleep before she was awoken suddenly by the yells of the carriage drivers and the lurching of the carriage, which knocked her head against the upper side of the carriage. As Nel awoke with a start she saw Marina holding tight to the arm of her seat, while the Sorceress was standing up, her head and upper body through the latticed portal that separated the driver\u2019s section from theirs, in an exchange in raised voices, which Nel could not make out because of the roar of the winds outside. Nel braced herself against the sides of the carriage, her arm span letting her place a palm in each side. She attempted to crane her neck to look outside. Nel saw, through the latticed windows, almost nothing but a sea of blue clouds, churning violently, here and there, into purple. Nel saw flashes of lightning somewhere in the clouds, and not long after this there came a blinding flash and the carriage was shaken horribly by a cataclysmic boom of thunder from somewhere above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the thunder faded, paring down into muted booms from far-off, and just as Nel\u2019s eyes were recovering from the bright flash of the lightning, the Sorceress, apparently unphased, slowly withdrew from the driver\u2019s portal and sat back down, calmly readjusting her robes and bangles. She caught Nel and Marina\u2019s inquisitive and expectant eyes and, looping a curl of hair behind her left ear, said that these peaks were known and named for their near-constant storms, but that they usually clustered around the utmost pinnacles, so this particular storm was unexpected. \u201cI would speculate\u201d, added the Sorceress nodding at Nel, \u201cthat your \u2018little friend\u2019s\u2019 passing through these crags and peaks has whipped up the clouds and displaced them to the foothills\u2014 or I may be mistaken; it is just a thought.\u201d Nel felt a little quiver in the pit of her stomach at the mention of Clare\u2019s name again, perhaps because it impressed on her a sense of just how large Clare had become. For, Nel realised, Clare had, in some way, and despite the incoming reports from the vales and forests of her wake of destruction, remained in her head at almost two foot tall, bigger than Nel, bigger than the average pixie, as a matter of habit, built up over years of friendship. But now Nel, who was used to looking up at Clare, and had, in the past week, been equal heights and even taller than Clare, at times, had had to adjust that image of Clare to account for all that had happened in the past day or so. And, indeed, Nel had barely had the time to adjust to her own larger body, let alone accommodate thoughts of Clare\u2019s hips and thighs at such an enormous size that she would have to squeeze and shimmy her way through these mountain passes or that lightning strikes might seem to her no more than cinders falling upon her colossal bosom. For a fleeting instant, out among the roiling blue clouds and illuminated by flashes of lightning, Nel thought she glimpsed, silhouetted like the sharp crags and spine of the mountains, the great globular cheeks of Clare\u2019s buttocks passing like the shadow of the moon. But, of course, it was only her imagination. Nel supposed that to some extent she had not totally accepted Clare\u2019s sudden change in stature, having been asleep for most of it, and, in a way, had not really viewed the monstrous creature heading North as Clare at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel\u2019s musing were interrupted by a horrible crashing and snapping sound, followed, moments later the carriage violently lurching to one side and yells from outside. Nel\u2019s head banged against the roof again, dazing her awfully, while Marina, who was sat opposite, was flung forward suddenly and, much to both their embarrassment, landed abruptly on Nel, her face planted between Nel\u2019s breasts, landing with a sort of flump sound. Nel, surprised and still dazed, extricated the young Alchemist sheepishly. Words were not exchanged, however, for at that moment another crash came and next thing any of the knew the carriage was sent barrelling through the night sky and storm clouds, throwing all inside the carriage into utter confusion. Nel was dimly conscious of the driver\u2019s cursing and another flash of lightning, before the carriage spun again and, before she could react, she was knocked unconscious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was unconscious Nel found herself in the midst of some strange dreams. For a while she dreamt that she was in a castle by the sea, the masonry green with age. For a while she sat with Clare in a massive vaulted room, at a table laid for dinner, groaning with food and drink, yet the room, and the castle were deserted. Nel tried to engage Clare in conversation, but Clare shushed her and smiled blithely. As Nel dreamt Clare reached forward and plucked a large fruit from the table, like a fat peach. Still smiling Clare sank her teeth into the fruit, the juice running down her mouth. Nel remembered that after Clare chewed and swallowed her body quivered for a moment before plumping up in size a fraction. Clare only smiled at Nel, not wiping the pulp from her mouth, and offered Nel a bite. As she did so the tawny pixie plumped up in height again. Nel got up from the stone chair as it happened again and, as Clare rose from her own chair wearing a concerned look, it happened again. Nel quickled back away and turned to flee. Nel could here Clare\u2019s voice echoing: \u201cWhere you going Nellie?\u201dAs she left the hall she looked back to see Clare, whose face seemed confused and hurt, blow up again. As Nel fled through a doorway she suddenly passed between a taller Clare\u2019s legs. \u201cHey, Nellie\u201d. As Nel fluttered up a staircase lined with large stone statues all of a sudden one crumbled as an even larger Clare shook herself off. Nel quickly reached the top of the stairs and flitted down a corridor, turning at the end to see a much larger Clare filling the hallway, like an enormous cat. Clare giggled: \u201cHaha, Boo!\u201d Nel turned on her heels and shot back down the corridor to the louden calls of \u201cNellie!\u201d Nel reached a door and, closing it behind her, breathed deeply until Clare\u2019s voice died away. Nel climbed the stairs before her until she was standing at the top of a turret, gazing out at the vastness of the sea, which seemed, in her dream, to have no limit and just rolled on and on. Nel remembered, after she awoke, that she could look down and see the lower spires of the castle, the long stone bridge reaching to the mainland and the sheet drop down to the foaming waves and skerries below. But before long Nel felt the castle and the ground shaking as there rose, eclipsing Nel\u2019s view of the sea, Clare\u2019s colossal, tawny head; it alone was bigger than the castle in which Nel stood. Nel could only stand, light blotted out, as Clare\u2019s gigantic green eye peered into the castle, which was no more than a grape to her. Nel fled inside the castle, down a flight of spiral stairs, as Clare\u2019s head rose higher and higher and the foundations and masonry of the castle began to tremble and then to shake, crumbling about Nel. Nel arrive in the castle courtyard and looked up at the trunk of Clare\u2019s neck and up at the underside of her jaw, up over the battlements and ramparts, and saw the slope of her shoulders and collar bones beginning to hove into view. Nel remembered, at the end of this dream, seeing the ground, the sheet of stone bricks, beginning to bulge and warp beneath her feet. She panicked as she saw, beyond the stone gates, the masonry of the bridge crumbling as there swelled up from beneath something huge and milk-white, like an enormous boiled egg. Nel started awake as she saw the cobbles erupting beneath her, leaping up to reveal creamy flesh bulging up from below, and the courtyard splitting as there opened up a great chasm, rending the castle asunder. Nel tried to fly, but found herself transfixed by the abyss yawning below her feet. The last thing she retained, as Clare\u2019s gigantic breasts swelled up, swallowing the castle, was Clare\u2019s booming laughter from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nel awoke, she came to in the carriage, which appeared to be lying on its side and had snow spilling in. There was no sign of the Sorceress, the driver or the little Alchemist. Nel lay there for a moment, before slowly getting up and promptly hit her head off the other wall, now the roof. Cursing loudly, Nel forced open the door against which she had just hit her head, deciding that to try and squeeze through the driver\u2019s window would be an exercise in futility, for not even her chest would make it through. Nel emerged into the nighttime mountainside, blinking her long-lashed eyes as the flakes of snow drifted by. There was no sign of the driver or the birds, to Nel\u2019s dismay. She called ought, but found her voice whipped away by the gusts. Nel sighed and shivered when she heard something bumping and scraping from beneath the carriage. Nel leaned forward and peered over the edge of the carriage. She saw, emerging from the underneath the carriage, a pointy-hatted figure dragging a huge trunk. Nel recognised it soon, through the drifting snow, as Marina the little Alchemist, shorn, apparently, of her hooded robes and now garbed in the apparel brought with them, more appropriate the the mountain climes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel hauled herself from the carriage, her hips only becoming stuck for a moment, and fluttered down beside the girl below, who started, but quickly collected herself. She remained shy and withdrawn though as Nel asked her if she\u2019d seen the others. When the answer was negative, Nel, who was quickly beginning to freeze in her thin, tightly-drawn dress, began to search the trunk for suitable clothes. Marina cast around them as Nel did this, rather than have to make eye-contact with Nel\u2019s chest and her nipples poking out beneath the fabric like thimbles. Marina looked up at the jagged pinnacles of the mountains, and at the snow blowing past, it seemed like the storm was liable to get worse...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of them, the young alchemist Marina, coated and hatted, and Nel, still in the red dress she had worn from the Palace, stood on the snowy slopes for a while, both of them wondering what their next move should be. Presently, Nel rooted in the trunk for warmer clothes, while Marina thought. Once Nel was dressed in clothing more suitable to the mountain climes, the pair of them set off up the narrow and winding path, leaving behind them the wrecked carriage. Nel took the opportunity, despite the snow, to occasionally take in the scenery, for she had never been so far North as this and had only ever glimpses these mountains from far away, like arrowheads lining the sky. Nel was in awe at the spiralling pinnacles of the mountain peaks about them, think and jagged like spearheads or the spires of gigantic temples long ago buried. It struck Nel, as they climbed higher, that the peaks, each in themselves, resembles massive, grey conch shells in the way their conical edifices bore jagged horns and spikes of rock, jutting out at extreme angles to the rockface.  <br>\r\nAs they walked, there was no sign of the Grand Sorceress, the driver or any of the others. Marina thought that they may have been blown onto a neighbouring peak. The path Nel and Marina followed wound like a thread up one of these peaks and they were luckily sheltered from the gusts that would surely have picked either of them up and thrown them from the mountainside. Marina walked ahead carefully and Nel, who hitherto had not really had a chance to notice the young alchemist, noted her dainty feet in her high-boots and the way she almost sprung forward on her little heels with a click. Nel had to admitted she had not, in the gloom of the carriage, previously been able to see Marina clearly, swaddled in the robe as she\u2019d been, but now, walking before Nel in her britches, long coat and large hat, which she clamped down over her brow and ears with a hand, she saw the girl\u2019s her skinny legs, her slight hips, her small chest like a dove\u2019s. The young Alchemist seemed to Nel so fragile in comparison to the rugged and icy slopes they were ascending. And it was not until later, when Marina turned to indicate to Nel a cave some way off and a gust caught her hat, blowing it back from her face, that Nel even caught site of the girl\u2019s features. Through the blur of powdery snow Nel noticed the delicate heart-shaped face, the skin almost as pale as the snow whirling about them, the bow-shaped mouth underneath the arrowhead nose. Nel could not, at such a remove, make out the colour of the girl\u2019s gloomy and melancholy eyes however, which seemed to hover undecidedly grey and violet. The girl\u2019s hair however, a few strands of which whipped across her face, was a dark greenish colour, verging on turquoise art its lightest. The girl reminded her of herself in a way, although Nel had never been so slight or, for that matter, so small. Nel found herself wondering, as she climbed, how Marina felt about all this business involving pixies growing to many times their original height. Her composite assembled, Nel felt like she knew her companion a bit better than she had done down on the mountain slopes, although that could not really be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was half an hour before they reached the mouth of the cave. Scarcely had they entered and walked some way into the cave, away from the howling snows outside, than the entirely mountainside quaked, knocking both Marina and Nel from their feet. By the time either of them gathered their wits they were in darkness; the quake had sent snow and ice down from the peaks, covering the entrance; they were stuck. Nel heard Marina\u2019s voice from somewhere in the darkness: \u201cOh\u2026still, I\u2019d rather be stuck in here than frostbitten out there.\u201d Nel stood up and said: \u201cBut what about the others?\u201d She heard rummaging from nearby and though she could distinguish the young alchemist rooting in the bag she had taken with her from the carriage. \u201cNot a lot we can do\u201d came Marina\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat was that\u201d, said Nel, casting around the cave, but seeing nothing but darkness, \u201can earthquake?\u201d Marina\u2019s voice was somewhat muffled, as if she was disappearing into the bag: \u201cHmmm\u2026.I\u2019m not really so sure.\u201d Nel sought the young alchemist in the blackness, but appeared to have lost her: \u201cWhat do you think it was?\u201d Marina\u2019s voice was clear again and Nel managed to guess where she was again: \u201cI\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t a quake\u2026I just think that it\u2019s far more likely to have been your friend making her way among the peaks.\u201d \u201cYou think?...Well, Clare needs to watch where she\u2019s going\u201d, Nel muttered, \u201cthe giant klutz.\u201d<br>\r\n Nel waited for some time while Marina rooted; at one point there was a splashing sound and a caustic, oily smell. \u201cYou\u2019re not near me are you?\u201d came Marina\u2019s voice finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d said Nel. There was a brief pause before Nel heard a tinkle of glass and suddenly a plume of bluish fire erupted in the darkness. Nel jumped, startled. Marina laughed and held up the torch she\u2019d lit. \u201cWitchfire\u201d she said simply and, gesturing with her head, indicated that they should proceed further into the cave. As they explored they talked quietly; Marina said that many of these tunnels were created by miners, but were based on boring done by the ancient frost dragons which had lived in these peaks, but were now thought to be extinct; they were, however, seldom entirely uninhabited. It transpired that Marina was from the North, from a small village at the foot of these ranges, and had only left in order to study Alchemy in the pixie heartlands. The Gosburgs, for that was Marina\u2019s family, were, so Nel was told, actually quite an aristocratic family, her father was a Baron. Nel expressed some surprise at this: \u201cSo you\u2019re an heiress?\u201d Marina laughed a bitter laugh: \u201cNo exactly, my older brother and sister will likely inherit our estate and the house.\u201d Marina did however express some regret at having left this life behind: \u201cI just thought that maybe becoming a respected alchemist under the Empress might get the people of my hometown to take me seriously\u201d, Marina appeared to scrutinise a stalactite, \u201cno-one takes me that seriously; they all treat me like I am a child.\u201d Nel coughed and changed the subject, asking what Marina\u2019s thoughts were on the whole situation that had lead them here. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not stranger to giants...there are frost giants living in these mountains, but usually they sleep.\u201d \u201cBut from what people say\u201d, Nel chimed in, \u201cClare\u2019s not just giant, she\u2019s enormous!\u201d Marina coughed this time, \u201cBut anyway, despite her recklessness, your friend is a kind of walking alchemical miracle. And that\u2019s, in its own scary way, kind of fascinating.\u201d \u201cOf course\u201d, Marina went on dreamily, \u201cwondrous and terrifying though she is, she probably needs to be stopped.\u201d Nel thought for a moment, imagining briefly Clare\u2019s monstrous hips and buttocks squeezing between the mountains. \u201cHow does the Empress plan to stop Clare?\u201d asked Nel presently. Marina shrugged in the half-light \u201cI\u2019m not certain really; all I know is that I was brought along because I know these mountains well enough and that there are massive pockets of magical rock and magic in these mountains, which are almost porous, and sit like a thick crust upon vast wells, vents and oceans on sea-green magic.\u201d Marina waggled the torch, \u201cYou can see it leaking out sometimes on the slopes, it hardens into crystals quickly though. That\u2019s why there are mines and tunnels all over these mountains, to extract the magic imbued ores and rocks. It was the only industry really for towns in the North.\u201d They walked on for a bit, \u201cI have to say, though,\u201d said Marina, \u201cI did think a lot of these mines were exhausted and what magic was reachable to be mostly depleted. I\u2019ve only seem magic in its raw state a few times and not recently\u2026not that it\u2019s much use like that\u2026only dangerous.\u201d Nel decided not to mention that she too had grown from ingesting raw, volatile magic like Clare. \u201cDo you think,\u201d ventured Nel, \u201cthat Clare is after the magic in the mountains?\u201d Marina thought for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t see how she\u2019d know to look for it here; as I say, a lot of the mines are abandoned now. I think Empress thinks Clare is looking for magic though, or at the very least wants to stop her before she discovers any more by accident\u2026I admit it\u2019s a bad coincidence that your friend headed North. Maybe she can smell it?\u201d Nel shuddered a little at the mental image of Clare feasting on a mountaintop like an ice-cream cone, her tongue licking up a plume of frosty sea-green. They walked on for perhaps an hour, in comparative silence. Suddenly, Nel, even as she thought of the sea-green glow of Clare\u2019s eyes, thought she imagined a glow from a crack in the tunnel wall. Nel halted and Marina, who had been examining the glossy rock walls, ran straight into Nel\u2019s cushiony ass and fell backwards. Nel, oblivious, inspected it and tried to see though, but could see nothing but the dim green glow. \u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d fumed Marina. Nel apologised and beckoned her closer: \u201cLook, what\u2019s this?\u201d Marina got up and came over, her interest piqued. \u201cHmmm, looks like\u2026\u201d began Marina, before Nel chipped in: \u201cI bet you can squeeze through this gap.\u201d Marina gave Nel a look up and down. \u201cGo on,\u201d Nel said, \u201cyou\u2019re smaller than me\u201d, managing to conceal her pleasure at being able to say that sentence. Marina gave Nel the torch and slipped into the crack. It was some time before Nel heard from her on the other side of the wall. After an eternity\u2019s wait, Nel heard Marina say: \u201cWell I\u2019ll be \u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel could not contain her curiosity any longer and lay down on the ground, attempting to squeeze through the gap at the crack\u2019s bottom. She wormed her way through as Marina said from the other side: \u201cThis is unbelievable\u2026\u201d Nel\u2019s head, arms, shoulders and, with great strain, her chest made it through the crack and the rest of her body was coming too when her hips wedged, with a sound like someone trying to tie a balloon. Nel looked back frustration, but quickly returned her gaze to room she had only partly entered.  The room was some kind of cavern, only Nel could not, at least from her prone position, see the ceiling of the cavern, the walls just stretching up into impenetrable gloom. The walls in themselves were something to behold; they were glossy, as if worn smooth, like blobs of glass in the tides, and stretched up like sheets of dark emerald from below. The cavern was, unlike the tunnel adjoining, lit by a kind of eerie green glow and Nel fancied she saw wisps of turquoise vapour floating upwards. Marina, whom Nel now saw was standing at the lip of what appeared to be a ledge, was illuminated by the sea-green glow, her pale cheeks lit up as she peered over the edge in wonderment. Nel snapped out of her reverie and tried to free herself. Grunting, she placed her hands at either side of her and tried to pull herself loose. Marina, too, dragged herself away from the edge and tried to tug Nel free. There elapsed a spell of time when both girls considered Nel to be drastically stuck and there was even talk of Marina leaving Nel wedged there and attempting either to find a way around to pull Nel back or to find someone or something else to help extricate Nel. As it happened, the girls decided to give it one more go and between them, with a herculean effort, succeeded in dislodging Nel from the crack in the wall, sending both girls tumbling to the floor, Nel landing on top of Marina as they did so. Nel whined and rubbed her butt-cheeks, before hearing the frantic and muffled cries from beneath her chest. Nel quickly scrambled to her feet, letting Marina sit up, panting. Nel, embarrassed, apologised and while the girl caught her breath Nel walked to the edge to look down. <br>\r\nGazing down from the ledge Nel saw great streamers of sea-green light rising up from the deep, deep below them. At the bottom of this shaft or charm Nel fancied, for the green was almost too intense to see through, she saw a pool of something, almost like turquoise lava. The streams of green vapour and tapers of light seemed to emanate from down there, rising up, past their ledge, and drifting upwards to the invisible ceiling. Most curious of all this, Nel thought, was the way the light below seemed to pulse and flow, like a heartbeat or a breath. Nel turned to back to Marina who was approaching again: \u201cI take it this is\u2014\u201c, she began, before Marina finished, \u201cYes\u2026magic\u201d. Marina laughed a little and dragged her hand through the air, leaving behind it little sparks. \u201cWow,\u201d said Nel, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this!\u201d Marina peered over the edge again and said: \u201cNeither have I! I knew there were vents in these mountains, but nothing like this! It looks like it goes down to well below the mountain.\u201d Marina pointed towards where there seemed to be a bottom and a most intense sea-green light. Nel looked with her and said: \u201cHow did no-one ever find this?\u201d Marina\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement as she replied: \u201cThis chasm has to have been opened recently, maybe with the recent\u2026\u201dsize-mic\u201d activity in the mountains.\u201d Nel furrowed her brow, \u201cSo what exactly have we found here?\u201d Marina hesitated a moment: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this shaft reaches down to the stream of raw magic flowing beneath the planet\u2019s crust; there are some places where it is not so deep and these mountains are known to be one of them\u2026but as far as I know no-one\u2019s ever found a shaft that lead down to the source below.\u201d Marina could see Nel looking inquisitive. \u201cUsually\u201d, Marina explained, \u201cthe magic worms its way up through cracks and small fissures and builds up in pockets later becoming crystals and other times it seeps into rocks and becomes deposited as ore veins, this is usually how we find raw magic in nature, and it is this that was mined.\u201d Marina looked down again with a thrilled look on her face: \u201cWhat this looks like is a chasm opened up that leads down to a river or lake of raw, volatile magic, in other words, the very lifeblood of these mountains, and, indeed, the planet.\u201d Nel\u2019s eyes were wide by now and she joined Marina in looking down again at the sliver of moving turquoise below. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Marina gazing at the streamers of vapour in the cavern about them, like seeing the Northern Lights spread across the night sky. Nel agreed; it was. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d asked Nel absentmindedly. \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d said Marina, \u201cI suppose we keep looking for a way out of here, and when we don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d Nel looked inquisitive again: \u201cWhat for?\u201d Marina shrugged: \u201cI suppose I don\u2019t want our discovery being exploited. Places like this should be left alone, for our own safety. This is a fragile beauty, but also a dangerous one.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d Nel said, \u201cmaybe it might help us against Clare? Maybe the Empress needs to know in case Clare discovers this? She\u2019s suck it dry, just like any mining. Or maybe we could use it to lure Clare to us? Like trap?\u201d Marina didn\u2019t respond for a while. \u201cI just want to make some notes\u201d said Marina, walking back towards the crack through which they\u2019d entered the shaft. Nel strolled to the back of the ledge and sat down against the glossy wall, it had the feel of melted glass, and she sat there absorbed in contemplation of the rising lights before her. She did not think the Empress or the pixies would damage or exploit the well here, but she saw Marina\u2019s point and maybe it was her naivety that made her think that the heart of the mountains would be used for good alone. Indeed, Clare was a good example of how magic could be used for one\u2019s own selfish needs and gains. As she walked Marina perch herself on the lip with her notebook and begin writing, Nel daydreamed of Clare snapping the peak from this mountain and reaching in with her arm, withdrawing her hand, sticky with sea-green ooze like a bear with honey, and greedily wrapping her lips around her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, when Nel was lost in thought and Marina was lost in her notetaking, that another quake hit the mountain. Nel\u2019s world juddered violently and she was thrown sideways. Marina, the edge, was in more imminent danger as she attempted to scrabble back from the precipice. Marina tried to gather her balance but was sent tumbling backwards. Nel tried to lunge and grab the girl\u2019s outstretched hand, but was too far away and could only watch, her world shuddering, as Marina fell backwards and over the edge, tumbling into the sea-green abyss below\u2026 Once the quake had faded, Nel scrambled to her feet and rushed to the brink, gazing down into the green abyss again, but could see nothing for the rising lights. Nel felt something under her left knee and, glancing down, realised it was Marina's notebook, now all that remained of the young alchemist...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a while, Nel knelt by the edge of the mountain abyss, Marina\u2019s notebook in her hand, and looked down in the green chasm, but saw only the throbbing of the mysterious light and the flowing of the magic-magma far below. Withdrawing from the ledge, Nel sat and thought for some time. Holding Marina\u2019s notebook between her long fingers. She had not known the little alchemist long, but had become fond of her in that short time. Nel had, in her first minutes of looking down into that bright green abyss, hoped that Marina had snagged on a spar and been saved from the stream of volatile magic below and would, at any moment, flit up from the green river. When this faded and it became clear that the young pixie had not been so lucky and had almost definitely plummeted down into the turquoise artery of the mountain and Nel found herself hoping that maybe Marina was not lost and that, not unlike Clare, exposure to raw magic would not kill her, but instead amplify her, making her stronger and bigger\u2014 perhaps not ideal, Nel reflected, but at least Marina would not be dead. But although Nel had looked and waited for some time nothing stirred at the bottom of the abyss, save only the lazy, magma flow of the magic stream. Nel was now slowly letting the reality of her situation sink in; for she was now lost and alone in the mountain ranges of the North, with no way of knowing where her companions might be. Moreover, the only person Nel had ever considered a close friend was Clare, excepting, perhaps, Kevin, who was now blown up into a positively gargantuan monster of a pixie, whose body shook whole mountains, and was, to all intents and purposes, a fugitive\u2014 albeit a giant one. Nel, all of a sudden, felt very small and very alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long time passed by during which Nel listened to the sound of magic river beneath her. It sounded like the far-off sea, of the lazy waves falling on the sand, as it came up the shaft of the mountain. Nel remembered the time when she and Clare had visited the seaside, many miles from their hometown. The journey had taken a week by carriage and each of them had been glad to finally relax in the coastal town of Rockholme, a small pixie town nestled amongst the crags of seashore. Nel remember a warm evening when they both lay on the brink of the esplanade, a kind of boardwalk that fanned out from the rock-face over the sea below, and basked in the warmth of the setting sun. Nel remembered that all of a sudden Clare had sat up and tapped Nel\u2019s shoulder, pointing out into the golden water of the bay, where a small fishing vessel had been slowly towing across the water. Nel had sat up in time to see a whale breaching from the surface of the water, alongside the boat, seeming huge by comparison. Neither of them had ever seen a whale before and Nel remembered, with an ironic smile, how Clare had wondered out loud how anything could be so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during Nel\u2019s seaside remembrances that she suddenly became conscious of a low rumbling in the chamber, beneath the surflike sound of the flowing magic. Nel pricked up her ears and listened for a moment. It sounded almost like water boiling in a kettle. As Nel continued to listen she was conscious of the slightest of vibrations passing from the ground and into her buttocks. About her, too, she could see several of the smooth, glossy pebbles jittering on the stone floor of the cavern. Nel looked about her, wonder what was happening. The rumbling and the bubbling sound were growing now and Nel heard, echoing around the walls of the chamber, a susurration, as though wind were passing through the branches of trees. Nel scrabbled to her feet as the rumbling intensified, wobbling a touch as she rose. Nel thought at first that this was Clare passing by the mountain slopes again, clipping the peaks with the shimmying of her gigantic hips, grazing the crags with great teardrops of her colossal chest, or even stubbing her toe against the mountain as she stepped over the ranges, for in truth Nel had no idea how big Clare was by now and found the few scraps of detail she did know difficult to imagine in relation to the surroundings or assemble into any kind of scale; Clare might still be wading through these valleys and peaks with the pinnacles at chest or hip height, still periodically becoming wedged, but equally she could also be so very large that the long chain of these mountain ranges could function as an appropriate method of measuring the chasm of Clare\u2019s cleavage or the crack between her buttocks. But, as the rumbling again grew louder and the shaking of the chasm floor intensified still, Nel realised that the source of this was not outwith the mountain, but instead was coming below, from somewhere down in the heart of the mountain, from the depths. Nel turned to see that the quality of the air had changed; it seemed more laden with sea-green light and almost so close as to feel treacly, a sensation she found reinforced when she saw her arm leave a trail of bluish sparks behind it as she steadied herself against the quaking. Nel now panicked as she judged the quaking to be the result of some eruption of the raw magic stream below, welling up violently. Nel feared that she would be drowned or dissolved by the swelling torrent, but feared also that she would be unable to squeeze back through the the crevice she had wiggled through earlier. It was as Nel was contemplating forcing herself through this crack that she heard the susurration echo up the chasm again, followed by brittle creaks and cracks, as if the shaft and chamber were breathing through lungs long ago turned to glossy rock. Something twigged in Nel\u2019s head, for it really DID sound like breathing. As best she could, still being rocked by the rumbling of the cavern, Nel carefully approached the lip of the edge, kneeling to steady herself and looked down into the green of the abyss again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel quickly lurched back from the precipice as there swelled up from below something huge and blackish in colour. Nel\u2019s eyes widened as, rising up slowly but inexorably over the rim of the ledge, there came the dark-haired crown of a head, the dark-green tresses soaked, shiny and slippery, like a thicket of huge briars after rain, about which there seemed to flit blue-green sparks amidst a haze of magic clouds. As the head crept further up the cavern, Nel saw the dark green locks slicked to a huge and marmoreal heart-shaped face jawline, streaked with sea-green water, with a long, elegant nose and huge eyes held shut. Nel\u2019s mouth dropped open as she soon found herself gazing the underside of the jaw and it rose up on an immense, swanlike neck, which too only gaze way to huge shoulders that stretched the whole breadth of the shaft. Nel knew what was coming next. The rumbling was dying away as there hoved into view, rising up over the lip of the ledge like a moon, a colossal pair of breasts, squashed, undoubtedly uncomfortably and painfully, against the smooth emerald wall of the chasm, buoying them up and making them seem more gigantic than they already were, which now, having more room to work with, spilled over the lip like, it seemed to Nel, a slowly unfolding avalanche...but halted, swelling only with each huge and strained breath their owner took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several tense moments still until Marina, for Nel had long before realised it was she, stopped growing, and the rumbling ceased as she did. Nel got to her feet and looked up at the giant head of shoulders of the new Marina, wedged in the chasm and wet from the stream below. Plainly feeling herself no longer expanding in all directions, Marina now opened her eyes and looked down in shock at herself. Casting about her, Marina tried to move, but her arms were pinned down the chasm, and she inadvertently hit her head against her wall behind her. Slightly dazed, Marina ran her gaze down along the wet expanse of her breast, startled by their drastic increase in size, and settled on the figure of Nel. Marina has shocked by how small Nel now seemed! Marina\u2019s lips parts and her newly enhanced voice echoed around the glossy, emerald walls of the chasm: \u201cOH! Hello again!\u201d...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In shock the young alchemist, Mara, watched the bottle in her hand. Someone had to stop the growing pixie, but the guards just stood there, powerless. Even the mighty Athenia, officer and guard hero, just backed away from the growing behemoth. Mara was pleased to see the grim resolve in Athenia's gaze. Since her childhood she had admired Athenia and always hoped to be like her one day. But her body didn't cope. Even after her puberty she stayed delicate and petite, with quick and brilliant mind, grace and a beautiful face, but to small and weak to prevail in combat and to fullfil the guard's recruitment requirements. Being helpless in front of Athenia's eyes shamed Mara. Those other guards were incompetent, Athenia would need comrades she could rely on. She would be such a fighter and friend, if her body hadn't failed her. Sad she stared at her gracile hands, clamping the large potion, they were so small, even compared to other pixies of her age. She felt the fabric of her robes on her skin. Her clothes were far to large, despite the fact she took the smallest size from the quartermaster, despite the fact she was one of the oldest apprentices. The baggy blue clothes hid her features without problems, she was glad about it, deeming herself to be unattractive because of her small figure. Mara never believed her fellow apprentices, who told her she was beautiful with her shaped and long (in relation to her size) legs, the angelic face, the long red hair, her flat tummy, showing defined abs. Her elegant pixie wings shimmered in a deep green, the same color like her eyes. Mara never appreciated her own beauty...  She hated the fact she has never gained muscle and her breasts never developed past a small A-Cup. \"Like a little boy!\", she used to think, when she looked at her own chest. Unlike her idol Athenia, who was large, busty and muscular, without losing grace or feminine looks in all those years. Secretly she envied the over-grown and ongrowing Potion-Theft. Mara has always fantasized about growing titanic, that the gods would compensate her for her years as tiny pixie, by making her enormous. All would look up at her, no one would make fun of her size -or her paleness. Her skin was always white like alabaster. Other pixies always joked you could see that Mara is an alchemist, because her skin was obviously untouched by the sun. Sometimes Mara wished this quip to be true, but she was spending hours in the sun in her spare time, but her skin stayed pale and white.<br>\r\nThe noise of cracking glass tore her out of her thoughts. Athenia had suddenly started to move, fast she moved between the shelves and the large pixie, using her lance to send potions flying and occasionally to push against Clare's expanding flesh - ignoring the moans and laughter of the blonde behemoth, who was filling more and more of the vault. Athenia's predatory grace allowed her to keep out of the gooey puddles and colourful clouds, while the other guards just stared. Mara instantly knew what Athenia was doing. \"Idiots! Help her, fast!\", she screamed, but the guards ignored her. Couldn't they see, that Athenia was denying Clare further \"fuel\" for her growth. Mara threw the potion away and scrambled forward. Finally she would get a chance to help her childhood-hero. Eagerly she started to empty shelves, sending potions flying, forgetting her own warnings. Seeing Athenia and this beautiful blond-behemoth was invigorating. Two dreams come true the same time. Maybe she could help stopping the giantess, maybe Athenia would acknowledge her, befriend with her. She climbed a shelf, to reach the higher boards. During her climb she caught a glimpse of the blonde leviathan\u2019s massive, jiggling bust. She caught herself not just being euphoric, she also was aroused. She realized it, when she stared at Athenia, admiring the heroine's body, whose beauty could not concealed by her plate. \"I wish, I could be like one of them!\", she whispered, when a thunderous moan shook the whole vault. Clare grew again. Crouching -the only position possible for her at that size -, she braced her shoulders against the ceiling. Helpless the guards watched the giant, nude woman tearing the place apart. Their expressions made Clare laugh even more.<br>\r\n\"THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PLACE TO STAND RIGHT NOW!\", she boomed.<br>\r\nShe knocked on the ceiling, with her right fist. \"GET OUT OF THE WAY! COMING THROUGH!\"<br>\r\nWith all her strength, Clare pushed against the ceiling. It started to crumble against her enormous, unrelenting pressure. Suddenly, the ceiling buckled and large cracks appeared in the stone. Suddenly an orgasmic moan escaped Clare\u2019s mouth, she slipped and flattened several shelves beneath her expanding butt. Mara gasped how enormous the blonde pixie was becoming. Even sitting her head and shoulders kept to pressure the ceiling, even in Clare\u2019s bended position. Her massive breasts hovered over them threateningly. Clare lifted her legs and pushed her feet against the wall next to the entrance, using the back wall of the cell to brace herself. Giggling she toyed the wall with her toes - Nothing. She applied more force. With a deep crumbling noise her feet left deep imprints in the wall. Suddenly, the stone simply gave way, and Clare\u2019s gigantic legs drilled two giant holes into the wall. The shelf Mara was climbing collapsed and Mara dropped on the inner side of Clare\u2019s left thigh. Clare\u2019s skin was hot, and covered with liquid - gooey like maple syrup. Dazzled Mara observed that Clare was stroking herself with her free hand, the blonde pixie\u2019s juices splashing, flowing thickly down her giant-trunk-like legs. Mara was drenched in Clare\u2019s juices. The blonde behemoths distinctive perfume surrounded Mara, the only smell in her universe. Suddenly overwhelmed by fear Mara buried her face in her hands and covered on Clare\u2019s body.  Shivering and whimpering she cursed herself, but how could she defeat such an opponent? She was just a young apprentice\u2026 a small and frail one. Her whole world was shaking, through the soaked fabric of her robes she felt Clare\u2019s silken skin rubbing against her, while the blonde pixie grew even more massive every second. Every shudder of Clare\u2019s body was a powerful earthquake for Mara. Without warning her world turned upside down, when Clare came. An orgasm like a force of nature threw Mara from the rapidly expanding pixie. She heard stones shatter, walls collapse and glass splinter. Instinctively she knew what was happening, the vault was no longer able to contain the massive, growing Clare. Mara hit the ground hard, she tried to scream but another hard impact forced the air from her lungs. Groaning she opened her eyes, unable to see through a veil of vivid colours, formed by vapours and mists in front of her face. She heard Athenia scream, she saw an unbelievable big foot in front of her, his position hinting that Clare was finally standing. And while she was admiring the blonde pixies foot, asking herself how something so tall and intimidating could be so perfectly beautiful and delicate the same time. And with this thought she lost consciousness  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara awoke, expecting to feel pain, but instead her body just was numb. She clearly had taken a blow to the head, because she felt vertigo and her vision kept blurring. Slowly she tried to figure out where she was and what had happened. Something heavy on her back forestalled movement, she was stuck. However that wasn\u2019t the worst part. She was nearly drowning in rainbow-coloured Ocean of goo, which was surrounding her. Occasionally debris protruded out of the thick liquid, like isles in many sizes. \u2018Isles\u2019 \u2013 made of splintered wood, smashed stones, ravaged tomes and destroyed alchemistic apertures and thousands of shards of glass, which shimmered vividly like small gemstones.  Mara was lucky that her face rested on an old tome. This position was uncomfortable for her neck, but had kept her mouth above the liquid. Scattered memories of the fight against the giant pixie filled her head. Now she saw the broken pillars and obliterated walls. Her mouth formed a silent \u2018o\u2019 when she realized why the shards were glistening \u2013 daylight \u2013 the warm light of the sun filled the chamber. Sadly Mara closed her vivid green eyes again. Now she knew where she was and what the scene of destruction in front of her eyes meant.  Obviously she was laying somewhere in the alchemistic chamber, presumably over one of the drain grills, worked into cavities on the ground for security purposes. The vast \u2018Goo-Ocean\u2019 was undeniable proof that it was not working as intended, maybe the rubble blocked too much of the drains. However that wouldn\u2019t explain the tremendous amount of goo, after all the blonde behemoth had absorbed the lion\u2019s share of the stored potions and elixirs during her growth-rampage. As a consequence Mara concluded that somehow other magical liquids \u2013 in vast amounts \u2013 had been dispatched to this area. Taking into account that gentle, warm sunlight flooded a room, which was supposed without windows and five stories below the ground level that left only one conclusion: The mysterious blonde stranger\u2019s growth had destroyed the ancient vault of magic. In her numbed state Mara was almost unable to comprehend her own conclusion. The vault had always been impenetrable and indomitable, even during the  crown wars in ancient times, when pixies unleashed vilest magic against each other in the castle and the vault it barely get a scratch. Powerful seals and protection spells, stones bought from the humans centuries ago, when masonry had been one of their finest arts \u2013 it had all been naught, when the perfect body of the blonde behemoth smashed through the ceilings and walls, pulverizing beams and stones effortlessly. In her mind\u2019s eye Mara pictured the blonde\u2019s sumptuous bosom breaching through the main ceiling, rubble sliding from the sides of this massive teardrop-shaped orbs. Avalanches of heavy stone and metal pearling down the white, silken flesh like raindrops, merely tickling the giant pixies on her ongoing ascend. Clare\u2019s sinuous hips cave in the side walls, damaging vast the silos for magical liquids, located behind the thick side-walls \u2013 which explained the mass of goo on the ground-floor. With a mighty step, the behemoth climbed through the hole she had created herself. Unfolding her shimmering wings she is striking a pose that proudly presented her tremendous, beautiful body in all his glorious nakedness. She is looking down on the torn vault, smiling, before she turns around and leaves with thundering footsteps, which shook the whole castle.<br>\r\n \u201cThe vault obliterated\u2026 By one overgrown pixie\u201d, Mara thought bitterly. Although she had to admit she had never seen a better looking overgrown pixie, a perfect beauty, somehow getting even more beautiful the larger and more powerful she becomes. Her thoughts trailed, had she ever seen such a beauty\u2026 Of course she had \u2013 Athenia! The name tore through the veil, which was clouding her thoughts. Athenia was here somewhere, maybe buried under piles of rubble. In the same moment she realized she still was unable to feel her body and clamped to the ground. Helpless her red lips formed a scream for aid, asking if someone was there, or alive. Shocked she realized she had lost her voice, no sound left her lips. With growing fear she tried to move, but found herself still unable to do so. Slowly she felt her consciousness fade again. Blackness encased her thoughts and she passed out again.<br>\r\nA smile, innocent and joyful, brightened Mara\u2019s angelic sleeping face, when her body reacted to sensations, her mind was unable to register at the moment. With fluttering eyelids she awoke. This time it felt different. Vivid, emerald green eyes scanned the room. Shocked she realized that most of the strange goo has vanished. Mara still lay in a steep puddle, but she was able to see the ground again in the most parts of her field of view. In a second she noticed that the strange numbness was gone and replaced by something entirely different. A warm and gentle tingling slowly emanated through her whole body. Starting from\u2026 from her womanhood she realized surprised and a bit coy, reaching out in her extremities. It felt indescribable good. Intensifying more and more sent a shiver of pleasure down Mara\u2019s spine. The warmth reached her fingertips and toes, slowly it engulfed every part of her. Even Mara\u2019s skin was overcome by it and seemingly radiated heat. Despite this fact the sensation seemed to pile up in her body, like a boiler without security valve, unable to vent the steam, it felt great. Slow but steady the gentle warm energy transformed into pleasure, until Mara thought she would burst. She couldn\u2019t help but moaning the whole time. Nearly overwhelmed by pure lust and pressure she noticed that the feeling now was most intense in her chest and breasts.  Through the delirium haze of pleasure ecstasy confusion struck Mara, her breasts felt so different. Soft pressures squeezed them, actually they felt like soft, warm pillows, on which the rest of her torso rested. Actually it felt like they were slow and gently lifting the rest of her torso. Careful she moved her head, to see her own chest and the moans of lust gave way to a gasp of surprise. Not only her breasts felt different, they had changed \u2026 A Lot. No one would ever believe her that she was used to be flat-chested when he saw the pair of wondrous orbs, which were making a slow-motion escape from their wool prison. Even pressed to the ground and hidden in her wool robe her breasts had changed from small and almost inexistent to an awe-inspiring, voluptuous bust. For some reason her formerly wide robe didn\u2019t seem quite as loose as she remembered and her breasts were straining against the snug upper section. But not only were her breasts swelling larger, her whole body was affected. As Mara watched herself, she could swear it was getting tighter, as if an invisible hand were pulling it taut against her chest. Even stranger, it looked as if her sleeves were rolling up her arms all by themselves. Every place she was able to see now contained increasingly more of Mara than she expected. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly the robe was starting to ride up from her ankles to the mid of her shins; her collar was stretching wider. There was no doubt, she was growing. Almost incidental she discovered why she had been unable to move. Cosmic luck had saved her. After somehow she had not only survived falling from the rising giantess, but also the following destruction of the room. Her former frail body was stuck in a sort of \u2018cave-in\u2019 of the massive wooden shelves. A large shelf had tumbled and buried her and the only reason it hadn\u2019t squashed her, were the large remains of another toppled shelf next to her left knee. The angle between them had been like a cave, splinters of rock and shards of glass glistening on the upper shelf spoke from its \u2018duty\u2019 as her shield, while the ceiling collapsed. While the \u2018cave-in\u2019 was rather wide, it wasn\u2019t very high, so she was wandering that she didn\u2019t feel the pressure of the large wooden frame on her back.<br>\r\nBut even this rare fortune wasn\u2019t able to distract her from her still changing body for long. It soon becomes clear Mara\u2019s growth wasn\u2019t stopping. Apart from just getting curvier, she could feel herself becoming stronger with each and every inch she gained. Under the scratchy wool-layers of the robe, her silk underwear and her velvet-like, alabaster skin she felt her muscles harden and getting stronger. Unseen by her eyes, every part of her statuesque frame seemed fitter, more athletic. Mara\u2019s body was slowly being covered by a thick, sexy skeen of muscle, which added a whole new layer of beauty to her already stunning \u2013 every second becoming even more perfect - appearance.   Clearly, her whole body was getting bigger - Her shoulders were wider, her arms longer, her legs... The neckline of her robe was spreading wider, straining the laces near chest and throat, revealing more and more of the snow-white flesh of her bustline. Her breasts were definitely growing even faster than the rest of her body. Soaking wet from the goo and discoloured her robe fought a hopeless struggle against her expanding body. The seams along her hips and thighs bulged, a tiny tear had appeared along the seams under her armpits, while the first lace was torn by the swelling of her breasts. Mara started to hear the sound of tearing fabric. As she continued to expand, her outfit was ripped to shreds around her. Moaning she experienced a low grade orgasm by just looking at her uncovered body. Her growth had lifted the shelf considerable by now and still she felt no weight. \u201cI\u2019m unbelievable strong!\u201d, she thought. One handed she pushed the shelf away, barely noticing the shattering noises when it hit the remains of another shelf in some distance. In a kneeling position she inspected her still growing body, almost getting off by the sight. Her assumptions had been true. Nothing remained of her former flat-chest. Two large, sinuous orbs dominated her chest. To inspect her belly and legs she actually had to gently push them back and aside. Speaking in old proportions, she had turned from an A-Cup to an I-Cup. \u201cWho cares?\u201d, she asked herself. They were freaking enormous, and felt indescribable good against Mara\u2019s chest. It was awhile before she realized that that she wasn\u2019t just pushing them back to gain a look on the lower part of her body. Instead she was rubbing, squeezing, stroking, while she knelt there, whimpering with pleasure, wondering how long I could do this without finally losing it, before she saw the rest of the changes. Marvelling at her own stomach, when she pushed them aside a bit, she felt unbelievable happy. She hadn't even dared to dream that her abs could be quite so well-defined. Her arms and legs looked stronger too. Another growth spurt hit her, but this time it felt different. Mara\u2019s growth gained speed, even knelling her head had already surpassed the top shelves of the few still standing shelves. Two hours ago the old, wooden storage racks had dwarfed her, her red-haired head just able to brush along the lowest racks. Everything, absolutely everything in the room seemed to be steadily becoming smaller. Experiencing the strongest orgasm in her whole life, Mara\u2019s vision almost blurred from the haze of ecstasy. By now Mara\u2019s muscles were starting to show even more serious definition. Her arms were plumping, her legs becoming thicker and more powerful. The last bit of paunch on her stomach had evaporated, replaced by the lines and contours of a perfect six-pack. Slowly her shoulders grew wider, while her whole torso gained an even more pronounced V-shape. Her breasts seemed no longer to grow faster than the rest of her, but appeared even larger, because of her defined, swelling pectorals. Biceps and triceps bulged out, gaining size and strength even beyond their majestic size. Despite this and the bulk of her new stature, there was still a softness to her \u2013 a sensual femininity that he knew no amount of size or strength could ever erase \u2013 Her mass hadn\u2019t overshadowed her. female grace and beauty. Like a fiery wave her long, straight red hair cascaded down her defined back, gently covering the appendage of her green wings, its tips nearly touching her perfect butt. Staggering she rose, almost stumbling. Mara grinned, looking at her tree trunk like legs. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been hilarious.\u201d she mused \u201cBeing too weak to stand up with legs like these!\u201d <br>\r\nGently she caressed the upper side of her mighty right thigh, enjoying the feeling of the combination of the velvet softness of her skin and the rock-hard muscle below. Mara\u2019s beautiful legs were still her best feature, and now even longer by proportion. All the while she could feel her rub against the floor as they expanded, ploughing through the debris surrounding them without effort. Abs, arms, chest...Mara drew her fingers over anything and everything they could reach, while she stared at me through glazed eyes, watching the world shrink around her, as her head rose into the first hole in the ceiling that Clare had made. As she continued to get taller, her head rose to the level of the second-floor ceiling. Mara\u2019s eyes were rising to peer over the pitiful remains of the labs of the fourth sub-level. Only few remains attested they ever existed. Most of the rooms was gone and vanished in the mighty chasm Clare\u2019s ascension had created, the complete mid-section had ceased to exist. At the rim of the mid \u2018crater\u2019 bisected rooms and destroyed beams acted as silent witnesses of the unstoppable power of Clare\u2019s growth. Luckily the vast vault wasn\u2019t only deep, but also wide. Despite the tremendous blow to his superstructure, it hasn\u2019t completely collapsed.<br>\r\nLike the shadow of cloud, concealing the sun on a warm, summer day, a question broke through the fog of pleasure in Mara\u2019s mind. She was enormous, one of her daydreams come true, but she had no problem to fit in the hole Clare had created. <br>\r\n\u201cHow incredibly massive she had become?\u201d the \u2018new\u2019 giantess asked herself. By all pixie standards Mara was enormous and still growing. From a delicate, small but athletic young woman with an adorable face, she had turned into a gigantic, heavily muscled embodiment of female sex-appeal. Two minutes ago she had surpassed the height of Clare the last time she had seen her before she had been knocked out. She was definitely more ripped than Clare had been, but the blonde\u2019s protruding bust at this height had been considerably larger than even Mara\u2019s new more-than-ample bosom. Not and easy feat, considering the size of Mara\u2019s full breasts, crowned by their soft pink nubs \u2013 slightly pointing upwards. Unbelievably Mara felt even more aroused, when she thought of Clare\u2019s curvy but thin and elegant body, the sinuous swing of her hips, the endless long and shaped legs and the titanic, teardrop-shaped orbs on her chest, even too large for Clare\u2019s gargantuan frame, guaranteeing every observer to see the blonde\u2019s boobs from every angle, even when he was standing behind her. Well, not to close behind her, otherwise her immense size would block the whole field of view. If Mara was a giantess, Clare was something even bigger. Despite all the wonderful changes she wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge the blonde, Mara realized. Methodically, as far as this was possible with a pleasure shaken body and ecstasy fogged mind she tried to assess the whole situation. The large hole in the roof suggested that Clare had actually climbed out of the vault, which meant she was at least three stories taller\u2026 at least! Perhaps she would reach the same heights? Another spurt hit her, moaning she forget about her dark thoughts. <br>\r\nHer waist rose over the remains of the floor of the former fourth sub-level, but to her disappointment she felt the process ebbing. Continuously the red-heads growth slowed, until it finally stopped. Still shivering she just stood there in the middle of the room, breathing and listening. Occasionally wreckage was falling from the destroyed ceilings and walls, nosily sliding to the ground. Shifting her weight resulted in grinding noises, her soles and new weight crushing everything beneath her feet, grinding stones to rock floor and smashing wood to fine saw dust.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow, I\u2019m really glad that no other pix\u2026!\u201d Mara broke off. \u201cAthenia! The guards! The alchemists!\u201d, she gasped in terror. All at once she was starting to worry about the \u2013additional - damage she was causing below. Warily she knelt and started to search the rubble and debris for bodies. In secret she mostly thought about finding Athenia. After all, the heroine had single-handily fought the giant blonde pixie in close combat, or at least tried to fight her. To her great delight after minutes of carefully searching through the rubble with her fingertips, she found Athenia and no other bodies. Between some shelf-remains lay the bruised body of the heroine buried on the ground. Almost not daring to breath, Mara removed the wreckage. Gently, eager not to hurt the pixie she lifted her up, placed her on her right palm and watched her closely. Undoubtedly Athenia had been hit hard. The former splendid and proud plate-mail was dented and scratched, lacking nearly all of the artful ornaments Mara had seen on so many pictures.  Eventually the pixie-heroine most have lost her crested helmet after Mara had passed out. Athenia\u2019s noble face was exposed, her long light blond hair was loose and flowing down her back, with the exception of some long strands, which almost playfully covered her left eye and cheek. Over the right eye brow Athenia had received a cut, her red lips were open and her eyes closed. To Mara\u2019s relief she could see the breast plate slowly heaving in regular intervals, showing that she was still breathing. Tenderly Mara placed the tip of her left index finger below Athenia\u2019s left wrist, which was exposed because somehow Athenia had lost her left bracer. She felt the smaller pixies warm skin and was sure she also felt a slow but steady heartbeat. <br>\r\n\u201cThank the goddess!\u201d she gasped. Now realizing that she actually had hold her breath.<br>\r\n\u201cStand down, monster!\u201d a harsh voice barked. Irritated by the sudden interruption Mara blinked and searched for the source. To her surprise she was surrounded by several grim looking guard, who had formed a four \u2013rowed circle around her. The worries for Athenia really had distracted her, if she hadn\u2019t heard that many pixies coming.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you are here!\u201d, she beamed.<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that, monster!\u201d was the harsh reply of the guard captain, which made her smile fade instantly. \u201cThis kingdom is tired of you dark-magic dabbling, oversized freaks!\u201d In perfect unison the guards threadingly rose their weapons. <br>\r\n\u201cFor the second time in just a few days you brought destruction to our city. Your accomplice not only killed the queen\u2019s alchemist and destroyed this vault in her escape\u2026 No she even dared to speak threats against our beloved queen and her new advisor Nel in public, before she ran off and threatened to grow even bigger and to return and obliterate the whole city, if anyone dares and tires to stop her!\u201d<br>\r\nStunned Mara listened. Her daydream-come-true was turning into a nightmare. How could they think, that she was working with the other pixie? Her master the alchemist\u2026 was dead? Sadness took hold of her heart.<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d she whispered, slowly lifting her left hand in an appeasing gesture. \u201cThis is an misapprehension! I\u2019m a victim of the blonde, too!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLiar!\u201d was the shouted reply. Mara saw their weapons starting to glow.  (In proportion) Tiny goosebumps breaking out along the edges of her breasts, a dead-certain sign for the upcoming use and building up of strong magic, she had always been sensitive for this.<br>\r\n\u201cYour unlawful and self-righteous use of tainted magic had even affected the queen and her advisor. Infecting them with your pestilence growth and each of them nearly doubled in size.  Both were shocked when maidens found them in this compromising state in the throne room. Fortunately they didn\u2019t become freaks like you and villainess Clare! So by her order, the royal guard is here to restore order and eliminate all threats to the kingdom!\u201d<br>\r\nWith an arrogant swing of his weapon he looked up to Mara.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we are free to choose the methods to achieve this goal!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d, this time she boomed at the top of her lungs. Some guards covered back, hit by the volume of her voice. Two of them actually lost their nerves and struck her toes. It didn\u2019t even sting and Mara knew their weapons. Completely forged from moon-steel, an almost unbreakable metal their edges were sharpened to the point, they could cut even through stone. Creating Moon-steel was expensive and complex. During her time as apprentice Mara had been honoured by being allowed to watch the alchemists assisting the royal forges in this progress. Yet they had been unable to penetrate her skin.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t attack me! I have Athenia here with me, and she is hurt! You could harm her, she needs help!\u201d, carefully Mara was bevelling her right hand, so the guards could Athenia, without dropping her.<br>\r\nThrough the face-slit of the captains helm she saw a nasty grin. His blatant malign reply hit her like an wrecking-ball. \u201cSo men, you all see: The gargantuan monsters\u2019 accomplice killed the beloved heroine of our kingdom, while her vile mistress brought havoc upon us!\u201d Theatrical he lifted his arms \u201cAre we going to accept this?\u201d As expected an angry roar, dismissive and defiant, uttered from many throats answered him. His smirk grew even wider.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd even if she is still alive! Most of us never liked this overachieving bitch!\u201d<br>\r\nResolutely his right hand formed a fist. With the deep rumbling noise of a thunderstorm the guards began to attack. Crackling and hissing brightly glowing spells were fired at Mara. Some of them even painfully sting, when they hit. Stabbing and hacking the guards advanced.<br>\r\nReacting with the speed of light Mara cradled Athenia protectively against her bosom. Unwilling to accept this madness Mara saw only one possible course of action: Withdrawal. Unfolding her mighty wings she hissed: \u201cYou made a mistake!\u201d Every flap of her beautiful wings created turbulences, which threw taunting guards to the ground. Still not daring to kill someone, Mara sincerely hoped they got at least some nasty bruises. With enormous speed she took off and left the remains of the vault. Taking short glimpses at Clare\u2019s trail of destruction she quickly fled from the city. Searching for shelter somewhere else was her main priority now. In her hand the semi-conscious Athenia smiled. Mara\u2019s body was hot and fragrant, and even in this state between awakening and unconsciousness she was struck by how wonderful it was. Not knowing that a beautiful behemoth's body was  surrounding her.</span></div></div>",

She had grown since the house, but very gradually; nothing like the surges in size Claire was enjoying. Inside they waited in darkness, silent, feeling Claire's calamitous footfalls thunder outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel breathed a loud sigh. Kevin was itching to ask the obvious question. Nel looked quizically at him. \"Uhhh yeah...well...uhhh...yeah... how exactly is Claire quite so...big!?\" Nel blushed and looked away. \"We...uhh..well there were some potions...ehh and got a little carried...and maybe one of us might have had a \"bad\" reaction to them... and, well yeah, long story short - Claire's got pretty big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND she's only getting bigger!\" yelped Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes Kevin, I had noticed...\" snapped Nel. A loud giggle echoed across the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel had lit a candle and was looking around; Kevin followed her musing. \"Y'know, I reckon I saw Claire grow after eating and drinking...and yeah, when she ate the town-guard she grew again. It must be food or magic that triggers it - remember that everything has traces of magic and she gulped down a hell of a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\" Nel said, abscent-mindedly inspecting ornaments \"she didn't eat anything at first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe there was something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can think of, she did seem to be \"enjoying\" herself though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's it?\" said Kevin \"Pleasure or satisfaction or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel turned around. \"Wellllll... what exactly do you propose to do about this, mister I'm-so-clever.\" She put her hands on her hips and cocked them to one side. \"You want to go out there and tell her to stop enjoying herself, huh?\" \"Hey, Hey Claire!\" she mocked \"You're too big and I, Kevin, can tell you exactly why! So, just stope eating everything and getting all horny and maybe you'll shrink on down!\" She gestured outside \"Be my guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was slightly intimidated by this rant from bigger Nel; he only came up to her bouncing angry bosom - he flushed hotly. Nel leant forward, tilting her head slightly. \"Well? Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kevin was looking expectant. Nel was about the crack wise when her stomach rumbled. She put her hands on her stomach and belched. There came a loud Grrrk from her stomach, she was feeling pretty strange. She could feel her insides bubbling, perhaps it was just indigestion; she had eaten those biscuits pretty damn quickly.Nel was feeling flushed; she fanned herself with one of her hands. Sweat beaded across her body; her breathing was coming hard and deep now. Kevin could see her body's outline through her tight-fitting dress as it became seeped in her  sweat. Her ample bosom -<i> boy she'd been doing some growing</i>- heaved and fell, her nipples thimbling, against ruby red fabric. Panting now, Nel looked desperately at Kevin, who returned a shocked countenance. Sweat-drenched now. The dress clung and stuck to Nel's form in carnal embrace. The size and heat of that body thought Kevin. The undulating curves of her hips. The majesty of those creamy thighs. Nel's stomach gave another groan and Nel appeared to stifle another belch, the force of which puffed up her cheeks. The sound of faint stretching rubber came as Nel slowly began to grow in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's body raged against the material that clung to it. Her hips flared and her thighs bulged, rebelling against the confining hem of the dress. Her legs lengthened, propelling her upwards. Her burgeoning bust, swollen and ripe against the dress, began to eclipse Kevin from view as their own grew. Nel bumped her head on the ceiling and had to incline her neck, then shoulders and the back more and more to accommodate her size....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel's growth tapered off; she winced as her body stretched a last inch, almost to prove it could. She stood, doubled over, legs splayed out awkwardly and panted heavily; her sweet breath washed over Kevin in waves, heady and vaporous and overpowering, like an autumnal peach orchard. Her breath mingled confusedly with the musky smell of her body, perspiration-slicked and sporting her tortured garments like a second skin. He noted that Nel's hair had dampened from sweat. She was plainly already too large for her dress, it could scarcely mask the beveling of her hips or thighs, the swell of her bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked at Kevin in astonishment, the colour still high in her face. \"Woah...\" she piped and shifted her weight slightly. \"Woah...\" acknowledged Kevin. \"What now?\" He hazarded. Nel looked around her as best she could, distracted somewhat, she passed her tongue over her lips absentmindedly.\"Nel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she snapped back to attention, hitting her head of a hanging light fixture. <br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\nNel brightened and beamed, her green eyes flashing and almost luminous with impish glee in the half-light of the cellar. \"I could go for a bite\" her teeth snapped on \"bite\", \"to eat\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach made a noise. \"As you said Kev\" she said lazily and stretching herself as best she could, \"I'm a growing girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kevin was on food duty running and flitting from place to place trying to source to stoke the furnace in his friends stomach. Nel for her part ate with relish, gulping down anything passed to her, whole if she could manage it, while occasionally experimenting with different positions of her body in anticipation of her next growth spurt; finding sitting with her legs apart against the opposing wall preferable to lying on her front, which constricted her breasts. <i>Just you wait Clairey-babe!</i> she thought, whilst happily munching. Nel's positioning meant Kevin had to circumvent her huge limbs, like they were the roots of some alabaster tree, pulsing with hot life. At one point he flitted up to Nel's face, she being to engrossed in chewing to pluck his findings from him. Part of him loved the view from her lap, where he had once or twice deposited gatherings and sneaked a peek at the underside of her breasts, a balcony of soft flesh that partially obscured her lovely face. The view from above was similarly pleasing. A deep chasm of cleavage rose and fell before him, still dewed with drops of sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and didn't even seem to focus her eyes on him. She gulped. He sheepishly offered her more. Nel opened her maw wide and Kevin dropped it inside. She swallowed it whole. \"I'd be careful if I were you!\" she giggled \"I might just gobble you up by \"accident!\" Kevin blanched as he realised that, strictly speaking, Nel was actually very big at all. To him, yes, she must be fully three times his size! But she would get bigger. He thought hard about that voluptuous form stretching itself skyward, towering; her bust ballooning to blot out the sun with its vastness, that all beneath her gargantuan tread might live in its shadow. The chasm widening and deepening, the clefts on either side swelling like mountains, that it might swallow planets. A pair of hips so titanic they could enfold continents in their carnal embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" groaned Nel \"I feel so full and bloated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" offered Kevin, lost in his speculations. Moments later, Kevin was abruptly awakening by a faint tremor and a familiar loud Grrrk. He could FEEL her stomach rumble. \"Oh!\" exclaimed Nel, hands on stomach, beginning to flush again. Kevin waited, trying to contain his suspense - he was doing this to help bring down Claire, remember that. Then came the breathing, deep and laboured, and the associated heft of flesh. Nel maneuvered herself, clinging to the wall and the stairs to the above house. Kevin ducked a leg that sought greater purchase on the far wall. Nel's eyes fluttered and rolled back into her head slightly. Her hips seemed to buck of their own volition, her great back arching, slamming to earth once more, cracking little spider webs into the floor around Nel's backside's girth. Her lips parted with soft groan or moan and Nel was off again. Her dress was doomed now! It shredded like tissue. The growth seemed more violent this time, wracking her body with sudden starts and stops, pulsing like a heart-beat. Maybe they'd fed her too much? Was that a bad thing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand splintered the railing to which she clung. Her legs bent more and more drastically. She shuddered bigger. \" K...Kev...nngh...you might wanna get upstai....airrrs.\" Her body puffed a fraction larger as she inhaled. Kevin realised that although the basement was surprisingly accommodating and spacious, Nel would soon have expanded to fill it. He darted under a leg, the gap slowly being closed by advancing thigh and calve. He hurried up the stairs, watching Nel grow bigger, only to collide with her knuckle. Dazed a little from impact he flew over and nipped out the door. He moved through to the kitchen, directly above the cellar he judged. He could hear each breath Nel drew, knowing all the while she grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSon the floor bulged and buckled beneath his feet. It heaved and groaned, just like the growing pixie underneath. Kevin braced himself for the eruption. But, abruptly it ceased. Kevin looked around confused, he'd seen a hand pulverise a banister, hips that could crack stone. Surely a head and carriage thatr belonged to such a being would make light work of a ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The things\" came Nel's booming voice from below, muffled through  the floor. \"are really well made...\" Kevin heard a thump elsewhere in the house which presumed was her hand indicating the ceiling. \"Hang on.\" Now the floor cracked and splintered as her huge, beautiful head burst its way through, she winced at the strain and effort. Once some of the dust had settled and she spat bits of splintered wood as large as Kevin's forearm across the room, she remarked. \"Yeah, I <i>thought</i> I was big enough!\" Kevin could only stand agog. \"What?\" she smiled. The creaked and groaned, rising. Kevin looked down tactically. \"Yeah\" boomed Nel \"the ladies are feeling a bit cramped down there...\" she flicked her hair \"...and they can't wait to bust out!\" The creaked as if in affirmation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile Kevin tried words, Nel continued, \"Y'know I'm actually a little- haha well there's nothing l\"ittle\" about me now - disappointed. I wanted to be a whole lot bigger!\" She belched. \"Maybe I just need to keep on eating...or...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw a tongue pass over teeth behind her ruby lips. \"C'mere Kev\" she purred as best she could at three or four times the size of the average pixie. Captivated, Kevin approached her lovely head, butterflies in his stomach. The aroma of berries and musky sweat radiated from her hair, long lustrous blue coils that framed her huge ivory face. Her mouth quivered. Kevin reached out and placed his arms about her immense cheeks. Her mouth opened; a colossal tongue unfurled, coating Kevin in warm and slick saliva. She licked again and again, from crotch to head: the force of this nearly lifting him from the floor. Her sopping abrasive tongue tore his clothing slightly. Her tongue flopped this way and that about his body soaking him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her lips closed about his head and torso - was she going to eat him!? Kevin was perhaps right to think, the thought did briefly float into Nel's lust-clouded mind. Quickly, she circulated his body with her oversized tongue and sucked hard, the pressure of her french kiss lifting him from the ground. She relinquished him with a smack. The panting Kevin shook his head and looked at her in astonishment. She bit her lip. \"Sorry Kevin...It's easy to get carried away.\" Her eyelids drooped a fraction. \"You just tasted so good\" She broke off and moaned, he could hear her adjust her hips and thighs downstairs; the floor groaned ominously from the leviathan bosom lurking beneath. \"But now...I've got a different sort of...appetite...\" He swore he could see her eyes flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin knew he had two choices...</span></div></div>",

She attempted to move her head to see where he had rushed, but her movement was too restricted by the floor. Nel smacked her lips and ran her tongue across them. She shifted under the floor boards as best she could, breathing deeply. Her mouth watered slightly at the creaking that ran throughout the floor as her newly ballooned chest swelled from below. She heard the violent knocking of the cellar door against the wall and raised an inquisitive eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin hastily entered the cellar; his zeal somewhat attenuated when he saw the hulking alabaster flesh couched in the gloom. The air was hot and cloying and smelt musky and faintly perfumed. Kevin steadied himself against the wall; it was slick with condensation. Her wiped his hand on the back of his shorts and breathed deeply. Nel's body took up so much space; she'd grown so big! Not as big as Clare, she'd got really big! Still getting bigger, with time. As he inched forward, Nel shifted herself and her was compelled to leap backwards as the colossal melons of her buttocks crushed fleshily against the wall. Kevin nearly slipped on the slick stone stairs; he noted that the splintered balustrade had become embedded in her soft flesh. Nel waggled her huge butt again in discomfort. She had grown too large to manoeuvre hers arms sufficient to reach her plump cheeks.  Kevin approached carefully and plucked a shard as long and thick as his arm from the soft white skin. Nel rocked her giant ass again, lifting herself and grinding into the floor. The shudder shook Kevin and he slipped on the stairs and fell forward, pressing into the round wall of warm flesh. The came a muffled 'Oh' from Nel upstairs that Kevin could feel resonating in her stomach. Kevin pushed the ivory flesh, his palms sinking easily into Nel's softness. He eased off and the skin sprung back elastic and rubbery. He retreated and with a rushed manner, pulled off his boots, hoping awkwardly from one foot to the other. He threw he boots to the side. Kevin half fluttered and half jumped atop the immense cheek. He climbed to his feet and stood upon the squashy hill. Her skin was tense and bouncy beneath his feet, like a trampoline. Upstairs, Nel giggled. Nel's flesh was slippery and Kevin had to cautious; he could easily slide into the cleft of her butt, where he could easily be squashed by her immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin clutched at the splintered balustrade and pulled. Soon he had managed to remove the wood from her backside. The last piece resisted and the recoil nearly saw him lose his footing. She squealed mutedly from through the floor. Throwing the piece of wood aside, he contemplated the greatness of his situation. Nel was, all of a sudden, so very huge and kept getting bigger and bigger. He inspected her vast rear end from on top of it. He could feel her heartbeat through the soles of his feet. He felt a creeping in his shorts. He hugged himself to the small of Nel's back and shimmied around the shelf of her unctuous hipline. She had long ago grown too large for her lovely red dress. The air was hot and steamy, he found his breathing laboured. In the dark he could see a gorse  of bluish hair where huge thighs like tree trunks met. He navigated Nel's thundering limbs with care. 'Hehe, that tickles!' Kevin picked his way along her round, thick, thigh. The musky smell was strong as it dripped from her overarching arm. It felt like she was getting hotter. As he balanced he gawked at her voluminous chest. She was developing so much bigger as she gained height. Nel's chest swelled impossibly large to Kevin's eyes as his colossal friend breathed. A large drop of sweat bucketed from her arm into his face. He reeled, disoriented, and slipped down the curve of her thigh. He landed hard, but scrabbled wildly and sprung to her feet. He slicked his hair back and tried to act like it had been deliberate. From this new perspective, it looked to him as if Nel had grown larger, looming larger than life. He watched, mouth slightly agape, as her titanic breasts swelled and inflated; he felt a similar rising in his shorts. He gingerly fiddled with a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel had felt Kevin scrabbling down below, and thankfully he'd solved that dreadful itch in her buttocks! She wobbled her cheeks again, it still somewhat smarted, twisting her mouth in discomfort. She felt incredibly hot, she could feel the odd droplets of sweat beading on her body. Kevin could have opened a window on something: she was sweltering! She panted briefly with her tongue lolling from her mouth and the creaks and cracks from the floor increased in rapidity. She had not felt Kevin for a while. She raised her eyebrows, 'You okay down there little guy?' she chimed in her lovely bell-like voice. No reply. Nel worriedly turned her eyes down and attempted to see into the cellar, but to no avail. She hoped she hadn't squashed him. 'Ke-!' her speech haltered abruptly as she felt it and gasped sharply. Her huge mouth gaped. It started ticklish but slowly gained intensity. Nel caught her breath and moaned from her throat. She gulped down air so deeply that a floorboard popped and cracked. Her eyelids drooped lazily and she bit into her lip, she was beginning to sweat more. Nel lick her lips and grunted an 'Oh' repeatedly. Involuntarily, her hips bucked and rocked in motion, she could feel the stones loosened by her crushing weight. Nel breathed and another floorboard popped. She clenched her teeth and piped a high-pitched whine. She thudded her buttocks into the floor below and the shelves upstairs shook; she did not care a jot! Again and again. 'Oh!' Before her fog of desire she could see another floorboard crack; she could see the blimplike white bulge of herself beneath the floor. She gasped and grunted again. She could see the floor visibly warp as she breathed; it bulged and undulated. Nel's eyes widened. 'Shhh- Ke-Ugghhh' Nel broke off; another two floorboards splintered. The spreading heat was returning. 'Hnnnnnghhh' she felt her stomach grrrk. She was overcome, she couldn't help herself. Nel felt herself rising, Kevin would have to help himself. Soon, with a terrible twisting and cracking of wood, Nel's breasts were breaking through the floor like white whales surfacing even as her lovely blue head headed for the ceiling. The hole that her head had made was widening and widening as her chest and torso burgeoned and thickening. She was blowing up! She wrenched her lengthening arm through the floor and stretched it down the corridor, flexing it as it grew longer and thicker. Nel tried to contain herself; she bit her lower lip; her eyes rolled back in her head; her body rumbled and the house shook and shuddered. Nel uttered a note like a opera singer as she swelled. Her colossal hind-quarters ballooned to exceed the cellar. Her head rose quickly through the ceiling as she went up and up. Exceeding capacity, her breasts filled where her head had previously been.  Nel strained and her arm burst from the western house wall. Nel's hips became stuck and the force of their increasing mass detached the house from its foundations. Her flesh billowed outwards from beneath, huge and creamy. The rest of her body was plainly too large for the building now; Nel must be large even for a human now! The walls warped and bulged as her titanic bosom grew more pronounced , tit-flesh could be seen spilling for broken window panes. Nel's arms protruded comically from the walls. Breaking point had come and her boobs burst from the house in an explosion of breast and splintered wood. When Nel's little spurt came to a halt it left a large naked, and incredibly voluptuous, Nel among the ruins of the house; the top of the house remained stuck to her head like a weird helmet. Nel brought up her huge hands and attempted to pull off the house. After some difficulty, it was removed. She was shocked by what she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel reached up to remove the roofing from her head, where it come become wedged as she surged in size. Nel\u2019s heart, still beating hard from the sensation of growing taller and becoming thicker, throbbed in anticipation. She was excited by what she might see of the pixie village and herself, imagining herself looming over the delicately slated rooftops, with her fat hips wedged in between the houses and her breath gently pulling in the thin plumes of smoke from the chimney stacks, like the wind across a field of rippling wheat. As she planted her hands on either side of the upper story of the house which she had outgrown, Nel dwelt on the still lingering sensation of growing, mingled, in no small part, with the orgasmic pleasure of feeling Kevin between her thighs. Nel, her eyes closed, tugged at the structure stuck on her head, but it was stuck, such was the speed with which, and extent to which, she had grown! Nel thought she could see through the fine and tiny lattice of a window in the attic, or perhaps it was a bedroom, with her left eye, welled up massive and green inside the roofspace, and she blinked a few times to try and make sense of the the blurred and splintered images she could see through this small pane like a great, bloated cyclops. Nel tugged again at the roofing while she imagined herself sitting in the rubble of the house, her legs stretching out in front of her, proceeding for some way down the street and her heart almost skipped a beat as she fancied she already felt the dimpled cobbled streets beneath her thighs and calves. Nel, becoming impatient, yanked again at the structure covering her head. Her last growth spurt, her biggest to date, had left her inwardly thrilled and she could not wait to see how big and voluptuous she had become! The memory of her body pumping up, of her chest bulging outwards cartoonishly, her legs seeming further and further away, of her head suddenly clipping the ceiling, before feeling her shoulders and back, arching ever more, running along that same ceiling, of her arms lengthening from sight as the round flesh of her arm swelled to fill a hallway, or the unforgettable feeling of her buttocks billowing beneath her, seeming to buoy her up and up! Oh, the sensation of feeling one\u2019s cheeks bloating up like that, underneath you, positively eating up the space they had to contain them, and all the while your head climbing higher while they undulate beneath you; it was a small wonder that Nel\u2019s hips and butt cheeks had blown out the foundations of the house, sending her legs flopping out into the street, before ever her long arms had erupted or her shoulders, torso or bosom burst forth from the house. And, as she pulled at the house, wincing at the splinters of timber pricking her neck and face, but smiling at the bits of masonry tumbling onto, and bouncing off her shoulders and, no doubt, monstrous breasts, Nel could not help but wish, though she must have known she could not be THAT large, to see herself sitting amongst a cluster of houses, each no more than a thimble to her, and nor could she help but indulge fantasies of growing again, until her chest and buttocks hung above the world like the Moon! Nel gritted her teeth and pulled again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel wrenched the roof from her head in a profusion of wild blue hair. For a moment, holding the roofing between her hands in her lap, Nel blinked rapidly as her eyes adjusted to the evening light and her cheeks apple pink from exertion. As the scene about her emerged from the cataclysm of light engulfing it, Nel looked about her. \u201cAha!\u201d Nel tossed the remains of the house across the rooftops in glee. She saw herself easily head and shoulders above the houses. Saw her legs filling up the cobbled street and, running a hand down her side, found her hips squashed between the neighbouring houses, which brought a smile to her lips. Nel must be fully ten times her previous size! She was huge! Nel looked at herself, up and down, and guessed she must be at least, at least, twice the size of the average human, an amazonian figure of a pixie, perhaps somewhere between ten and fifteen feet. Looking at herself now, Nel was left in no doubt in her own mind that she was in the upper limit of that estimate, and, although this was maybe only wishy thinking, she wondered if she were not, in fact, larger. Only a flicker of disappointment crossed Nel\u2019s mind and dampened her apparent elation at her size, although, it must be said, one was left wondering if Nel would have been satisfied with any size. Nel felt something tickling her right inner thigh and, clasping and parting the bulge of her breasts, looked down to see a dripping and exhausted Kevin propped against the round wall of her thigh, having, apparently extracted himself from underneath her newly grown haunches. Kevin, glistening even in the shade cast by Nel, looked up at Nel\u2019s face, but could not see her shrouded face for the immense balcony of sweaty flesh wobbling above. \u201cWhy hello there!\u201d, chimed Nel, peering down a Kevin between her legs, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t squash you...well, didn\u2019t squash you much!\u201d she added with a coy wink. Kevin managed to pant a \u201cyeah\u201d as he put his hands on his knees and breathed deeply. Nel looked down at Kevin and grinned: \u201cHey there little man! Alright down there?\u201d Kevin, still breathing heavily, did his best to nod. Nel, oblivious, for she was not the one to have a friend growing on top of her, looked at herself again with an air of a connoisseur and went on: \u201cWow! You really know what you\u2019re doing down there!\u201c Nel hefted her plump bosom and waggled her hips. Kevin stumbled a bit and leaned back against the plushy warmth of Nel\u2019s thigh, a grin on his face such as one might find on the face of an architect who, having spent many sleepless nights planning and overseeing construction, finally sees his design brought to fruition. Nel lowered her voice to a husky tone, raising an eyebrow, and breathed \u201cWhat do you say, big boy, are you ready for round two?\u201d Kevin\u2019s grin waned. Nel laughed, \u201cI\u2019m only kidding Kev, you have no sense of humour!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was around the same time as this that Nel, who was somewhat absorb in comparing herself \u2014to her friend, became conscious of a chill spreading across her back. Nel saw a long dark shadow spreading across the cobbled streets and across the rooftops, like a darkening thundercloud. Kevin\u2019s eyes were wide with panic and Nel\u2019s heart sank and did not need to turn around to know what it was: it was Clare. Nel had, in the midst of her fantasies about growing, become so carried away she had, at least for a moment, forgotten about Clare! Nel did her best to swivel in the gap between the houses to look up at Clare. To her dismay, Nel found herself looking up and up and up at Clare and Nel wondered if the tawny-haired pixie had not, in the time that herself and Kevin had hidden in the house, grown even larger! For Clare still seemed enormous compared to Nel, standing over her like some massive tower. Nel, sitting in Clare\u2019s shadow, wedged between two houses, looked up at Clare, whose face was obscured by her height and her gigantic bustline, and breathed: \u201cOh, sh\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above Nel and Kevin, Clare laughed, a thunderous booming laugh: \u201cIs THAT you Nellie!?\u201d The laugh shook the ground and Clare slowly inclined her towering frame, her huge chest hanging and wobbling threateningly over the rooftops and Nel\u2019s head, bringing her head down towards Nel. Nel could feel Clare\u2019s breath like a hot, sweet smelling wind flowing over her. Nel wriggled a bit in her predicament, trying to unstick her hips, but swivelled around again to look into Clare\u2019s vast green eyes. \u201cHmmm\u201d boomed Clare, almost in an air of disappointment, \u201cyou aren\u2019t exactly very big, are you Nellie?\u201d At this Nel fumed, although compared to Clare at this point it was undeniable. \u201cI was kind of hoping\u201d continued the titanic Clare as she descended to her knees, making to lie down on her front, heedless of anything beneath her, \u201cthat you might be a bit bigger next time I saw you! I need a playmate...\u201d Nel panicked as, for an instant, she thought Clare might carelessly squash her and Kevin underneath her monstrous chest as she lay down. \u201cEveryone\u2019s running away from me, you see\u201d, Clare went on, \u201capparently I\u2019m too rough!\u201d \u201cBut, I\u2019m just\u201d, boomed Clare and she paused as she lay down on her front, upon the gigantic cushion of her bosom, which seemed the throb warmly behind Nel, \u201c a BIG kid really!\u201d Nel waggled her hips again and shot a look at Kevin who slipped under her leg and began trying to tug her free. \u201cI must say I was hoping you\u2019d be a bit bigger than this though!\u201d, thundered Clare, seemingly unaware of Nel\u2019s efforts, \u201cI was sort of hoping for, I don\u2019t know, a Clarezilla versus Mega Nel! Or maybe Boobzilla versus Assasaurus... a clash of the Tit-ans!\u201d The massive Clare shrieked with laughter, her mammoth chest rapidly swelling and falling from her laughing. In fact, such was the extent of this undulation, that Clare\u2019s chest collided with Nel unwittingly, unsticking her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Clare was still distracted by how funny she found herself, Nel, thinking quickly, scooped up Kevin from where he lay a bit dazed and, glancing back beat her wings and took off, Kevin in hand, at an incredible speed, flying low over the buildings, her tits catching at chimney stack as she flew. Clare\u2019s laughter ceased and she wiped a tear from her eye as she sighed:\u201cBut don\u2019t worry Nellie, I\u2019m sure I can still have fun with\u2014HEY!\u201d Clare shrieked in frustration, her huge arm slamming in front of her, so long that it crashed down a couple of hundred yards from the airborne Nel and Kevin. But Clare\u2019s size became, or that moment, her disadvantage as she heaved her gigantic body up from the ground with a cataclysmic crunching, taking masonry and buildings with her! This gave Nel the chance to skim out over the rooftops: towards the woods!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she skimmed over the fields of reeds outlying the pixie village, Nel, Kevin clasped in one hand, cast a quick glance back to see Clare, seeming gigantic compared to the houses they were fast leaving behind, attempting and straining to heft the enormous bulk of herself upright; she was not used to her new body yet and Nel was thankful for it. Nel\u2019s last image of Clare, before she and Kevin reached the woods, was of her friend standing upright, silhouetted against the cloudy sky and bits of the village still falling from about her body. Nel reached the brink of the woods and landed, running swiftly, borne along by the beats of her wings, between the dark trunks... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel must have fled for hours through the trees, into the woods which stretched for who knew how far across the mountainsides. Kevin, who was clutched like doll between Nel\u2019s fingers and held to her warm and bobbing chest, in fact, began to feel quite ill from the motion. S it came to pass that Nel, deciding she had lost Clare, sat down on a mossy stone in a glade, Kevin standing on her knee. They must have presented a curious sight to woodlanders: Kevin, a smidgeon over a foot in height, and Nel, more pointedly, who was, let it be not forgotten, while dwarfed by Clare, was considerable in her size now and stood several heads taller than a human now, a stature more commensurate with a woodland bear or mountain troll than a pixie! Yet Nel\u2019s mood was low and she sat upon the rock with her cheeks in her hands. It had begun to rain and the droplets ran down Nel\u2019s nose and quivered on the end like icicles. Kevin, by contrast, was in rather high spirts, still buzzing from their getaway, notwithstanding his momentary lapse into motion sickness. \u201cI was like: \u201cNoooo!\u201d and you were like: Swish and Nyyyyeeerrm\u201d and Clare was like \u201cRaaaarrrrgghh!\u201d\u201d Kevin fluttered from one knee to the other. \u201cAnd when her arm came down! It was like: \u201cKaBOOM!\u201d\u201d, Kevin did a hurling motion with his own arm, \u201cbut you were like: \u201cNot today Bitchzilla annnd awaaay we go!\u201d\u201d Nel smiled in spite of her mood, \u201cThat\u2019s how it happened did it?\u201d Kevin put his hands on his hips, facing away, towards the trees: \u201cYup, just like that.\u201d He paused for a moment, apparently thinking. Nel eyes rested on the little man standing on her knee lazily. She sighed. Kevin shook his head and turned around, for a moment forgetting that Nel was not behind him proper and he was instead standing on her, and was a little taken aback at having accidentally gazed into the large chasm of her cleavage. He blushed a touch and looked up at Nel\u2019s rainstreaked face. Her hair was wet from the rain and looked, to him, perched on her knee, like the curtain of a willow tree. Nel blinked slowly, still low, and Kevin swiped a droplet away from her nose. Nel giggled in spite of herself. Kevin then asked \u201cWhat now then, Miss Nel?\u201d Nel, her face still in her hands, shrugged: \u201cDunno\u2026you tell me little man\u201d. Kevin walked up and down Nel\u2019s thigh as if it were the deck of a ship. \u201cIt goes without saying,\u201d he finally said, \u201cthat we can\u2019t just let Clare run amok.\u201d Nel sighed: \u201cI suppose not, no\u2026\u201d, Nel looked away for a moment, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see what we can do.\u201d Kevin\u2019s stopped pacing for a bit and then resumed: \u201cWell we have to do something, anything; what\u2019s go into her? She\u2019s out of control! Carrying on the way she is there\u2019s no telling what she\u2019ll do! Who she might hurt. Or\u2014\u201d. Kevin halted a second, \u201cHow big she\u2019ll get\u2026\u201d finished Nel. There was a moment wherein they both dwelt on the prospect. Kevin imagined Clare\u2019s mind, after she had ceased to have fun and explore her new size, would turn to taking over the pixie kingdom with her newfound stature, but, before long, would subjugate kingdom after kingdom, she would, most likely, threaten the world of man too, laying waste to their glass cities, until eventually, having grown and grown with each new conquest, enthroning herself on the mountains to the North, her colossal rear comfortably filling the mountainside, the clouds sitting about her head and shoulders like a mantle. Nel, whose imagination tended naturally towards a somewhat larger scale imagined Clare, in the event she was not stopped, growing and growing until she resembled more a continent than a pixie, one which would quake from time to time as it expanded more and more, until Clare could sit upon a continent as Nel sat upon this mossy rock, perhaps until Clare could hold the planet as no more than an apple in her hand. Both of them shuddered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d, said Kevin boldly and matter-of-factly, \u201cyou\u2019ll just have to get big too!\u201d Nel did not really react. \u201cFight fire with fire; It looks like our best option right now\u201d, Kevin went on, \u2018Clare won\u2019t be able to push around a pixie just as big as herself!\u201d Nel sighed again and looped a strand of hair behind her ear: \u201cI don\u2019t think I CAN get that big\u201d, she said gloomily, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like I have the same reaction as Clare to all that alchemy\u201d. Kevin laughed, \u201cYou got this big didn\u2019t you?\u201d Nel shrugged moodily, \u201cstill wasn\u2019t big enough was it?\u201d Nel looked at herself for a moment before adding: \u201cit might just be easier to try and make her smaller.\u201d \u201cMaybe whatever happened to the pair of you has just affected you differently? The results seem the same to me\u201d said Kevin as he touched Nel\u2019s forearm a moment (he would have shaken her gently in reassurance, but at her Amazonian stature it was out of the question). \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure the Empress and her court will try their own, maybe better, plans to stop Clare, but this is OUR best shot.\u201d Nel laughed a fraction as Kevin strode to the prow of Nel\u2019s knee again. \u201cBesides, whatever it is that makes Clare react this way to magic can\u2019t be the only way of making a lovely young pixie into a towering giant!\u201d Kevin was on something of a roll now and Nel smiled as he became more lively and animated as he spoke, even as the storm intensified above the woodland canopy. \u201cOkay, so Clare just grows and grows, so what? Nel, my girl, and we can\u2019t afford to stand around here and wait for Nature to talk its course and have her way with you, while even as we sit here Clare strides across the landscape getting taller and taller! We have to give you an edge.\u201d Kevin, with a wild and excited look in his eye, slicked back his hair: \u201cI say to hell with Nature then! If she won\u2019t give us a Nel big enough to stop Clare, then we\u2019ll just have to explore other options! We\u2019ll find unnatural means: the world of man and the world magic and the ancient secrets of the world must have something. Let\u2019s create our own options, by any means we can! Let\u2019s make you giant, Nel! No, huge!\u201d Kevin turned and caught her eye, there was a slightly crazed look in his eye: \u201cLet\u2019s make you\u2026.a monster!\u201d <br>\r\nAs Kevin said this there came, for above, a flash of lightning. As the thunder faded, the two pixies, one large and one small, looked at each other. It was another few moments before both Nel and Kevin erupted in laughter. It was some time before either of them could talk. Nel composed herself and said: \u201cWell, Doctor Kevinstein, if I\u2019m to be your monster\u2026make me big!\u201d Kevin admitted that he had not thought so far ahead as to say how they might actually go about making Nel into a giant: \u201cGood timing with this storm though\u201d he laughed. Nel agreed with a smile. They sat for some time in the rain in silence. \u201cI think we should get out of the rain; I am butt-naked in the woods and this rock is starting to freeze my ass solid\u201d said Nel looking up. Kevin nodded, looking away and rearranging his shorts. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something\u201d Kevin said. Turning he added, \u201cTo that end, and the end of finding something to help us, I suggest we head deeper into the woods, maybe there\u2019s a cave or something we can shelter in?\u201d Nel looked at the briars and the darkness of the woods and made a hesitant sound. Kevin laughed: \u201cWhat\u2019s a big girl like you got to be afraid of?\u201d Nel furrowed her brow: \u201cWell, apart from even bigger girls\u2026all sorts of things\u2026dragons\u2026evil trees\u2026grazing my boobs on spiky branches\u2026\u201d she said hefting her bosom with both hands. Kevin added that those two sounded like the same things. \u201cWell,\u201d said Kevin, \u201cif everything works out, you sure as hell won\u2019t be having to worry about spiky branches!\u201d Nel sighed and stood up, waggling her numb ass-cheeks, Kevin fluttered up as she did so, hovering at her hip height as he looked around. \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t matter which way we go now, just so long as you don\u2019t\u2014\u201c, Nel playfully grabbed him out of the air and walked into the deep, dark woods to the sound of his protests...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankly, Nel did not consider herself a lucky person. She always lost at games of chance and Nel\u2019s recent run of luck had been true to form. Perhaps most recent was the travesty that meant although Clare and herself had occupied, for the briefest of times, the same bottle of alchemical mixture it was somehow Clare who had grown the most! Nel had always wished to be bigger, maybe just to have the edge on Clare. But it was only Nel\u2019s luck that would have her grow big (bigger than a lot of pixies and then bigger than a lot of humans) but only at the cost of making Clare many, many times bigger than her!<br>\r\nAnd Nel\u2019s run of bad luck was continuing now for, some hours later, Nel and Kevin were still attempting to find shelter from the storm. Far from stumbling across any means to grow Nel, they had quickly become hopelessly lost in the tangle of trunks and soon the storm had worsened, so that the wind blew the rain through the canopy of leaves and made their going cold and uncomfortable. Manoeuvring the forest in the dark at Nel\u2019s size was not easy: she found head permanently becoming snagged on branches; sometimes unable to see her feet, she could not always see where she was treading or what she was stepping on; she had stumbled more than few times and knocked over small trees, meaning she had to then lift them from their path and, nightmare of nightmares, she had just been caught on the tit by a flailing briar. It gave Nel little joy, as she stood in that rain-sodden forest, to think that one day she might be able to crush this forest under her foot. Nel\u2019s exposed flesh was by now covered in gooseflesh and she shivered in the icy rain as they cast about for a direction to head. She drew a wet strand of hair from her eye and rubbed her boob as the thunder crashed above again. Kevin returned from thicket and fluttered up to Nel\u2019s ear and had to shout to be heard that there wasn\u2019t anything that way, save a deep ravine. Nel advance in another direction, swiping aside branches as she went. Lightning flashed above their heads again, through the thinned canopy above. They would have, thought Nel, been better off deeper in the woods, not skirting these mountainsides looking for a cave. Nel was tempted to turn back when she saw, by the light of another flash from on high, a break in the trees, a tract of mountainside clear of trees. Nel could see the trees on the other side and the mountain reaching high above them. She sought Kevin in the gloom and gestured to what looked like a cabin or a cottage in the midst of this clearing, surrounded by a little copse of trees. Kevin nodded and fluttered ahead. Nel, unable to fly from exhaustion and cold, peeled a large leaf from her butt-cheek, where it had stuck for a while, and trudged out from the trees, pushing aside a rotten trunk on her way as the lightning glowed again. Nel had never been afraid of lightning really. She used to love sitting at her open window, on nights not unlike this one, and watch, wide-eyed, as the white forks flashed across the sky. Nel thought of that glorious, pensive silence between the lightning and the rumble of the thunder. Nel could see Kevin ahead of her, just about, as she walked across the clearing. Nel felt sure that she could see lights on in the forest cottage, but her rain-soaked her was in her eyes again. She paused to wipe her hair back, standing up tall as she did so. Given the chances of such a thing happening, it must have been a weird sort of luck, or the worst kind of bad luck, that meant Nel, as she stood in the field, herself maybe as tall as a smallish tree, was suddenly struck by a jolt of lightning! Nel was only fleetingly aware of a blinding flash, a horrific crash, and a screaming sound before her world turned black\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world started to swim back into view for Nel, the woozy colours, greys, whites, inky blues and dim shapes slowly coalescing and began to resolve themselves, as if Nel were passing upwards through the fathoms of grey, marine light, beneath the surface and chopping waves of a storm-wracked sea. At first, it seemed as if she were looking up at a sheet of wet and rock, then at an expanse of marsh, but as Nel\u2019s wits returned to her and her vision grew better, she soon found that she was outstretched, supine on her back with her face to the sky above. Clouds were still mottling the sky, though the worst of the storm seemed to have passed. Spots of rain were still falling from the sky and landing on Nel\u2019s cheeks, and though she blinked, Nel could not bear to move. For not long after she had regained consciousness Nel was soon made conscious of the aching on her body, throbbing across all her limbs, down to the tips of her toes and her fingers. Nel groaned and closed her eyes, gritting her teeth as she suffered another wave of pain. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.femcafe.hu/sites/default/files/images/dramatic-clouds.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.femcafe.hu/sites/default/fil...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel\u2019s memory was still a little foggy; she remembered standing in the field near the woods, and dimly recalled  a sudden flash, but thereafter could remember nothing. It <i>felt</i> like she\u2019d been hit by an automobile, or perhaps a train, but she suspected that she had been struck by lightning. If so, was it any wonder that she was in such pain, indeed, there being no sign of Kevin, as far as she could tell, it was safe to assume that the force of the bolt had flung Nel some distance from the field, where she now lay bruised, singed and aching. Nel opened her eyes again and lay looking at the sky, a veil of misty cloud was passing by wherever she lay and raindrops pearled on her long eyelashes before she blinked them away. Nel used what little will she had to move her fingers, trying to feel about her as a lobster might probe the cavernous darkness of the seabed with long antennae. She could feel the damp grass about her, and feel it beneath her prostrated body Summoning what seemed like all her strength, Nel ran her hands lightly over the grass. As she did so, Nel\u2019s fingers found and felt a smooth lozenge, about the size of a domino. Still lying down, Nel ran her thumb across the flat oblong lozenge she\u2019d unearthed from the grass. Placing it down, Nel almost immediately found another such flat pebble among the grasses; running her hands still further abroad reveals another and another, some upturned and others lying ensconced in the earth. Reaching out and lifting her arm with some effort Nel could feel stiff ferns about her, bristly and wet with the rain.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://assets-production-webvanta-com.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000000/51/74/slider_detail/uploads/plant/1460135900-cd0e3de179999f291/44122178_m.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://assets-production-webvanta-com.s...</a><br>\r\n <br>\r\nGently Nel left her hand fall from the ferns and drew it back to her side, rippling across the smooth pebbles. As feeling returned to her body, Nel was becoming ever more conscious of discomfort around her buttocks, running in a line across her backside and nettling her as she lay there, as if she were lying upon the thorny tresses of some briar. Nel shifted where she lay, waggling her rump, but did not succeed in dislodging whatever she had landed on. Nel could hear something squeaking nearby, like the cry of a bird or mouse. With some difficulty, Nel planted her hands by her sides and, after a couple of abortive attempts, managed to heave herself upright, groaning rheumatically as she did so. Nel\u2019s head swam and, drawing her knees up, she rested her head on them, her vision bursting in patches of oily light as blood rushed to her head. Still feeling the rain falling on her naked shoulders, Nel raised her head and looked blearily about her. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nInitially Nel could not quite come to terms with what she saw about her where she had awoken, she fancied for a moment that she had been hurled skywards and landed in a neighbouring pixie settlement, but suddenly the reality broken in upon her like a parting of the clouds. She had landed in a churchyard, lined with trees and an adjoining cemetery of array stones, and a modest-looking church, its tapering steeple crested with a creaking weathervane. But what caught Nel\u2019s attention most, and what made her suddenly clutch her knees with surprise, was that the tombstones arranged in rows across the grass seemed like small, smooth pebbles, the conifers along the graveled paths, through which the misty rain drifted, looked like wet ferns growing alongside a mountain path and the church itself was like a large and well-made doll\u2019s house, with arrowhead windows and a thimble-sized bell hanging in the steeple tower; indeed, what suddenly dawned on Nel was that, though she did not know where she had been hurled by the lightning bolt that had struck her, or where, for that matter, where Kevin was, she had <i>grown</i>! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIndeed, such was the shock of this to her, that Nel suddenly found herself alert and casting about her, having released her legs, in spite of the dull aching throughout her body. Heedless of the rain gradually wetting her hair and skin, Nel gingerly ran her hands across the treetops once more. Before she lost consciousness during the storm, following the spurts she\u2019d undergone back in the pixie village, Nel had been much the same size as a rather tall human, which was certainly large enough for a pixie, and arguably to be considered exceptionally busty and curvy for any creature, but now Nel sat upon her haunches in the churchyard as veritable giantess to humans, her huge green eyes were practically level with the creaking weathervane and a person who might previously have been able to bury their face in her chest might now only be able to content themselves with planting a tentative kiss on Nel\u2019s ankle! Nel continued to look about her, inspecting the wet slates of the church roof, peering in at the windows as best she could to see any signs of life. \u201cHello? Anyone there?\u201d Nel asked, surprised by the loudness of her voice. All that Nel could discern through the fine drizzle at this moment though was a flock of sheep bleating in a nearby field, adorably small like balls of cotton with which Nel might powder her nose of stuff her ears. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nA prickling across her rear reminded Nel of the discomfort she has forgotten upon discovering her new size. Clutching the nearby roof, though conscious that her new strength and weight might break the beams, Nel rose to her feet. Again, not used to her size, and having been recumbent for so long, Nel was overcome by vertigo; for a dreadful moment, as her vision clouded and seemed to be waning, Nel though she might faint or tumble backwards and crush the church roof under what was unquestionably a rather prodigious rump! But momentarily, after her initial wobbliness, Nel composed herself. Having done so, Nel was able to turn her attention to that bothersome stinging. Twisting herself to regard as best she could the bulge of her buttocks, Nel could just about make out something plastered to her huge rear. Perhaps it was only the angle, but Nel felt that her ass was larger than before. Reaching back delicately Nel grasped what felt like a drawing pin pushed into her skin and pulled it from herself with a wince, feeling the other point of discomfort pang for a moment, resisting coming away, before one by one coming free from her giant cheeks one tack after another. Rubbing her smarting ass with one hand, Nel inspected with a mild annoyance the dangling stakes and wires of fencing she she had removed from herself, which must have lined her butt-cheeks like a spiraling staircase lined the trunk of a tree or cobbled tower. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fatstevewalks.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/fsb6301.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://fatstevewalks.files.wordpress.co...</a><br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer rear finally debarbed, Nel breathed out and looked around her, finally able to adjust to, and appreciate, her newfound scale. Indeed, it was marvelous! To see out over the fields as she now could, she felt she could see for miles were it not for the veils of rain passing over the landscape. Nel\u2019s chest practically swelled with the thrill that was gradually overcoming her. That was to talk only of her height, for Nel felt that her chest had ballooned also, a thought she attempted to verify with a quick heft of her breasts, filling her cupped hands as a pumpkin fills a pudding bowl, before letting the slap back wetly. Nel brushed a damp lock of hair from her eyes before placing her hands upon her hips, looking about biting her lip, still at a loss as to what to do. Should she stay put, out of sight, or search the area? People might not welcome a giantess strolling into their midst. Ought she to find Kevin? Would she even be able to see him at this size? Not easily unless he too had grown. Of course, he could not help but see her if he were nearby. But how, for that matter, had she grown as she did? These things didn\u2019t quite happen on their own, even Clare needed her allergic reaction to the mixed potions to make her grow so large. As she mused, there came the light rumble of thunder in the distance. Of course, thought Nel, it must have been the lightning! It could only be that. Apparently my body was able to eat up a big jolt from mother nature herself! I\u2019m not unscathed, thought Nel, looking at the few bruises formed on her creamy skin, but good God have I been juiced up! Nel wonder how she might stack up to Clare now? Probably not favourably, she concluded. It was hard to tell how big Clare had been, or exactly how big Nel herself was now. Big enough to incline herself as she thought and flick, lightly, the thimble-like church bell with her finger. Straightening up, Nel began to leave the churchyard, taking her first steps as a giantess, marvelling at the thunder of her footsteps, and just as much at the weight of herself, even muffled by the damp ground. Within moments, Nel was crossing the fields by the churchyard...</span></div></div>",

The tea-time bells were ringing in the clock-tower as the townspeople made their way home along the lanes. As these town-folk walked home under umbrellas and trudged along in their galoshes there could be heard a peal of thunder from the cavernous, purple clouds above. People thought little of this, save perhaps quickening their pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">thoom...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman was sitting at the window in her attic, where she liked to sit and watch the day draw to a close, enjoying the townsfolk plashing through puddles and watching the rain fall across the fields and the wood, looking out absentmindedly watching the rooftops and the little birds in the gutters as she waited for her husband to return; as she did so though her languorous eyes widened as she saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">thoom\u2026</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of one of the town\u2019s best tailors had just pulled to and locked the green door of his shop and begun the walk home, taking, as he usually did, the cobbled road that followed the town\u2019s walls, when, as he was musing thoughts about his grandkids, the sun suddenly faded and he looked up to see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">thoom\u2026</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman, in her back garden in the midst of hanging out her washing on the line, was conscious of a dark shadow spreading across her year, as if a cloud was passing over the sun, and looking around, over her garden wall, she dropped her basket of washing and could not help but scream at the sight of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">Thoom\u2026</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guardsman, standing and leaning against the wall, was vacantly looking out across the fields and in real danger of nodding off when, all of a sudden, there came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Thoom...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray cat, lounging in the sun cast on the town wall, jumped with fright and ran skittering across the battlements\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">THOOM!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the roof of the town hall a young man was at work replacing the slates that had been blown off in the gales of earlier in the month; as he worked to fix the last few slates in place before the day was done, he felt the slates jittering as he held them in place, and saw the spare slates he\u2019d brought with him clacking together; raising his head and shielding her eyes he looked out across the rooftops to see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">THOOM! Crunnnch!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk were shocked, some screaming, others fled, to see an enormous, blue-haired young woman approach and effortlessly straddle the walls, her huge leg gliding over and hooking over the town perimeter, a sheepish smile of the giant young lady\u2019s face, as if to apologise to the townsfolk for her awkwardness and the panic caused by her size. Indeed, her case was not helped by the crunching of stone between the young lady\u2019s massive, thick thighs. Awkwardly, this blue-haired giantess hauled her other leg over behind her, apologising as she took some of the masonry with her. The young lady must be, so the panicking people thought, contrary to her placating and booming cries of \u201cSTOP!\u201d, \u201cCOME BACK!\u201d and \u201cPLEASE...\u201d, some kind of voluptuous monster. This they judged by the great diaphanous wings splayed out from the giant young lady\u2019s massive shoulders, which scintillated brilliantly, in rainbow colours, with the fine rain that pearled across their glassy panes and veins during the afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk scurried away from the young giantess, who awkwardly pursued them in resounding, wet footfalls along the cobbled streets. As the giantess peered down at them while making her way through the streets on legs that seemed to dwarf the streetlights as one would wading through tall rushes, her blue hair, damp from the rain, fell about her face and across her eyes like the leaves of a night-blue willow tree. The town was rural, but of a respectable size; it had formed originally in the middle ages inside the protective star-shaped ring of the the now decaying walls, superfluous in this day and age, especially given the ease with which a giantess might ease herself into the town as if stepping into a hot bath. As a result the houses were of an old-fashioned sort and in places were tightly packed together, interlaced with many lanes and alleys, their steepled roofs almost at times seeming to touch those of the houses running parallel. Through this the intruding giantess tried her best to make her way. Trying to maneuver the huge trunks of her legs through the narrow streets and twisting her lissome yet massive torso so that her bulky thighs or buttocks did not gouge clumps from the masonry or tear off guttering as she went, the blue-haired giantess succeeded only in unbalancing herself and only prevented herself from toppling by clutching at a nearby chimney stack, which crumbled in her hands, and which swung the huge weight of unwieldy bosom into the facade, knocking out the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApologising profusely, Nel attempted to replace the chimney stack, which slid off almost immediately and smashed in a neighbouring lane. Nel winced; she swept back her hair and held it with her hands as she attempted to see the townsfolk about her feet, it was made difficult not only by her size but by the gleam of the sun on the wet streets. Nel sighed as she looked at the townsfolk rush in ripples through the puddles, and Nel could not help but feel like one of those tall wading birds that young pixies were sometimes warned about at school, standing amongst masses of thick-clumped reeds and looking down at minnows darting across the surface of an amber pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel could feel her voice, booming though it was, break a little as she pleaded with the townsfolk not to be afraid, that she only wanted to be fitted for some clothes, to have only a little something to eat and a warm, dry place to spend the night and that, though she had no money on her, she could help them about the town by way of payment. Before long, Nel had waded through that particularly narrow street, her huge backside repeatedly becoming wedged and having to be tugged free. Nel stood embarrassed and upset in the town square, rubbing her chafed cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streetlights were coming on as night fell and Nel still was casting about for townspeople he<br>\r\nhalf-heartedly; \u201cPLEASE!\u201d she boomed, then, conscious of her size, she lowered her voice as best she could \u201cI just need a little help\u2026\u201d. Seeing lights coming from a street and the shadows of people stretching tall, but not so tall as her, Nel advanced across the square in expectation. Her face sank however when she made out by the dots of lantern light the local constabulary, whom she more than expected were armed. Putting up her hands, Nel gingerly advanced on the crowd but was met with cries to \u201chalt\u201d and \u201cdesist\u201d from the figures. Nel tried to explain herself but was drowned out by the crowd forming behind the guards, yelling things like \u201cGet out of here monster!\u201d Nel could not help but back up as the crowd continued to surge forward, emboldened by the giantess\u2019 shy disposition despite her obvious stature. Nel could hear the sound of objects being hurled and it wasn\u2019t long before she felt on her left thigh the sharp pin-prick of something striking her and bouncing off. \u201cHEY!\u201d Nel yelped, drawing herself up protectively. As the crowd advanced the fusillade continued, cobbles and bottles striking her knees and shins and her hands as she clutched them over her huge, soft breasts. \u201cOWCH! STOP IT!\u201d she wailed as she retreated from the angry mob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Nel registered a blinding red flash from the crowd, presumably a flare or a firework, but which was quickly catapulted towards her face! Nel reeled just in time to save the thing hitting her eyes, but dazzling her and sending her stumbling backwards across the square. As she stumbled, Nel blundered into a street light, which burst in a bloom of glass. The sharp jolt from the streetlamp only made Nel, still blinded, lurch backwards (some members of the crowd, which was cheering and rushing forward, would later swear that they saw the giantess leap a foot in height as the shock passed through her.) As she floundered, Nel\u2019s foot caught on a metal bench, knocking her from her feet and send her crashing down, buttocks first, onto the post office. Let us just say that the townsfolk ought to be thankful that seconds later the power grid to the town went out, for as Nel\u2019s rump broke through the network of lighting and power lines in the roofspace of the Post Office, she was momentarily exposed to a huge surge of electricity, which, at the very instant the lights of the town went out, to blew Nel up by almost half her already giant size! The crowd was frozen as the young giantess\u2019 splayed legs suddenly seemed to rocket forth across the square! Others were stunned by the way her huge hips erupted almost instantaneously from the roof space, as if a charge of dynamite had been set off inside, sending splintered wood flying! Others were dumbstruck by the violent way in which the giantess\u2019 torso shot up with a rapid crackling, as if her spine were stretching and popping, and how her huge, pendulous breasts seemed to inflate like weather balloons. The suddenness of the events was enough to induce utter panic amongst the townsfolk, suddenly plunged into darkness. Groggily heaving herself from the Post Office, Nel rose to her new height, still not quite conscious of what had happened, and tottered for a moment wincing with pain. Hearing the screams and confusion around her, Nel let instinct drive her and, spreading her wings, took several booming strides before leaping, using her wings, though she could not manage to fly, to bear her in one graceful jump out of the town walls, where she landed with a resounding boom somewhere in the darkness and fled, in massive, clumsy stomps,  into the humid, black-blue darkness...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alighting somewhat bemused on a cobbled road, Nel bit her thumb as her mind moved over her predicament. Clare's tall. Really tall; like a tree. Can't be stopped by little me, no. Could, however, be stopped by big me! But, of course, the big greedy bitch guzzled it all. Typical. Nel cast her eyes around the road distractedly. Not a human road. Too small. The round coolness of the stones beneath her soles was pleasant and soothing; she curled her toes around one meditatively. She examined a weathered, and apparently scorched, signpost across from her by a few strides. Gn....v...a...bo...! Eh? Well that was helpful. She peered at the right hand side. ...B...r....Dr... Exasperated, Nel blew air from her cheeks. Who writes these things? Selecting a path at random, she stormed down the left hand path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings were tired from evading Clare which forced Nel to frustratedly walk. After some time at this, the soothing sensation of the cobbles wore to aches and to pains. Fecking road... The condition of the road seemed too to worsen, potholes and mud were semi-ubiquitous. The surroundings too had ceded to odd swampy shrubs and wild weeds. The terrain too was notably more high and rocky.   Must've walked clean out of the wood. She turned around and walked backwards briefly to look behind her. She flitted above the trees and tried to spot the forest or Clare. Nope. She then intermittently continued the journey, alternating between buzzing along and slowly walking along. Landing lightly on the road once more, Nel's foot trod in a puddle of god knows what; she withdrew her foot with a sucking sound. Her eye twitched a fraction. She picked her way to the roadside angrily. She impatiently rubbed off the muck onto the roadside grass as best she could. Fecking, Bog. Looking around, eyes narrowed, she was struck by the oddness of the place. Earthy smells permeated the air, haunted by wafts of boggy stink. Course there are plenty of places Pixies don't know. Not allowed, or just don't want to. Humans are blind though, never see anything. Hope there are no trolls.. A nearby bog made a peculiar noise. Fecking trolls. Such things were known to exist, but seldom encountered. Giants too; Dragons also. Bet Clare could give them a run for their money. No, Giants maybe, but Dragons. Huge. Huger than Clare. Nobody messes with you if you're a dragon. Apart from heroes. Stupid heroes. In stories. Of course, there's not much proof for dragons, keep to themselves more often than not. She had probably ventured in what those who were experts in this sort of thing would call: the wilds. Oh well, desperate times and all that.  Nel set her jaw indignantly and flitted onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, from behind Nel heard clattering. She landed and cast around. What the -! Lightning  quick and in a blink, a large white chicken hared round a bend in the road, clucking madly, pulling behind it a peculiar metal box on wheel. Atop the box sat a bearded little man, face blackened and raw, with a pair of goggle strapped over his head, which sported an odd little leatherlike helmet. The wagon careered wildly on two wheel as it scudded around the bend. Nel's eyes widened and she was forced to negotiated a leap from the wagon's path into a pool of slimy muck. She landed facedown; a bubble blew up to the scummy rim. Fecking Gnomes Nel's ears were reached almost instantly by a 'Whoa, Ignatius!' and more furious clucking, but the clacking of the wheels upon the road ceased. Nel lifted her head and spat. 'You okay!?' Came a high female voice. Too tired and stunned for sarcasm, Nel, blinded mud, extended a slippery arm and hand which was grasped by two sets of hands and Nel was hauled like a fish from the bog. Nel wiped the muck from her eyes with her hands and flicked them outwards; the muck slopped onto the road. 'Hold on there, miss' came the male gnome's for somewhere to Nel's right. She glared daggers at the girl who was grinning awkwardly and faintly stupidly at Nel. She was dressed like her counterpart, except beardless. She was in fact smaller than Nel, for Gnomes and Pixies were roughly the same height on average. Of course, I'm a little larger than normal. Nel noted the little curl of purple hair which protruded from under the girl's helmet. Her eyes were a little unsettling in their odd shade of pink. She's pretty...for a Gnome. Nel opened her mouth to speak and was slapped in the face by a torrent of water. A Cleaner, but wetter Nel glowered damply at the bearded gnome, who grinned proudly. 'Good as new!' he chirped in that squeaky tone of which all Gnomes seemed to be possessed. Nel continued to glare. 'Y'know what you are? You're a beard with an idiot attached... Nel shook herself, 'Cheers'. The little man beamed, 'Not often you see fairyfolk in on these roads' she commented. <br>\r\n'Pixie', Nel corrected. <br>\r\n'My apologies miss' he conceded, 'but might I ask what brings you out here?' <br>\r\n'Nothing really' Nel supplied evasively. <br>\r\n'Stop pestering her Giles!' cried the girl and booted him in the shin. He yelped and leaped away.<br>\r\nThe girl turned, hands on her hips, and grinned at Nel, who smirked back, her mood improved. <br>\r\nShe extended a gloved hand, 'Debby Higgs'.<br>\r\nNel took the hand awkwardly, 'Nel Nightfall'. Debby titled her head towards the Giles, who was smoothing his white beard. <br>\r\n'That's Mr Giles Fizzlewiggin'.<br>\r\n'The third' pipped the old gnome.<br>\r\n'The third' acquiesced Debby, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel glanced at the chicken-drawn cart, 'So where're you two off to?' she asked intrigued by the spectacle. Debby nodded along the path, 'To the Goblin town along the road, Boomtown.' Nel raised an eyebrow. Goblin were not unlike Gnomes, not blessed with any magic, but intellectually brilliant; tempered by natural curiosity and the spirit of adventure...also outright stupidity. By common repute among magical sorts, Goblins were best avoided; not actually evil, but: callous, materialistic, vain and stupid. Gnomes were at least cute in their crazy, zany, sort of way. Goblins could do wondrous things, but usually contented themselves craftily exploiting something or other and then blowing it up, mostly to see what happened. 'I know' chipped in Debby, 'they can be real bastards, but we couldn't do it without them.' The old man was seeing to the chicken.<br>\r\n'And what;s that, exactly?' quizzed Nel.<br>\r\n'Nothing too special just -' Began Debby.<br>\r\n'DRAGONS!' cried the little old man from the wagon.<br>\r\n'Yeah, that...' Debby finished.<br>\r\nNel was suitably impressed, 'Eh? What to do with Dragons?'<br>\r\n'Oh, all sorts really', Debby said airily, 'research on their magic properties, their flame, their variations and so on and so on. <br>\r\n'And why do that?' Nel pressed.<br>\r\n'Aha, can't go telling you that' Debby said in her almost childlike voice, 'top secret!' She tapped her nose unnecessarily. <br>\r\n'I really don't care that much...' returned Nel, looking down the road.<br>\r\n'Just tell the girl, Deborah!' shouted the old man, who appeared to have lodged himself in some sort of trunk or chest in the back of the wagon.<br>\r\n'Fine!' the girl shouted back. Turning back to Nel, she continued, 'Well, dragonbreath has allsorts of wicked and mad properties to begin with, but even more when you tinker with it!' The girl seemed genuinely excited by this topic. She hastily added, 'dragonblood does too! But that's not really sustainable or practical.'<br>\r\n'Unsustainable, yes unsustainable!' cried the old man from his box.<br>\r\n'Yeah exactly', rejoined Debby breathlessly, 'Can't go around killing dragons; there are so few! And...well...it's quite hard.' <br>\r\n'You could just wound them or something...' added Nel.<br>\r\n'Well, yeah that's what we did...but Dragons well...that's irrelevant', Debby broke off dismissively, ' a much better plan is to try and replicate these things from other sources.' She grinned 'We're currently working on a prototype for a dragonbreath powered engine.' She hopped in the air, 'Isn't it exciting!?'<br>\r\n'I genuinely don't see the point...' deflated Nel.<br>\r\n'Oh, well, the Goblins and the Gnomes and all their marvellous inventions and widgits are run on steam, which needs energy. Dragonbreath, because it's all magical and stuff, could run without energy.'<br>\r\n'Amazing' said Nel.<br>\r\n'I know, right!?' chirped Debby.<br>\r\n'No, I mean the things Goblins and Gnomes find interesting' returned Nel.<br>\r\nDebby continued unabated, 'Well, to be honest I think the Goblins are after money...dragons have big hordes of treasure and magical junk, you see...apart from the loads of inventions we'll be able to make and sell. Debby frowned briefly, 'But they're an alright bunch, really...just keep a grip on your purse, and if it seems like a good deal it probably isn't...'<br>\r\nNel interupted Debby by straightening up and stretching, 'Well this has been weird', and she moved to flit off. <br>\r\n'Wait!' cheeped Debby, 'Do you want a ride, Or...?'<br>\r\n'Not really, no...' Quipped Nel.<br>\r\nDebby walked a little ahead, 'I know what you fairie- Pixies! Are like with your 'secret ways'', here she bobbled her head a little, 'But if you're after anything, it wouldn't hurt to visit Boomtown, it's full or bazaars and workshops and all sorts. <br>\r\nNel glanced at the wagon, were the old man's head had become stuck in the chicken's mouth...</span></div></div>",

Debby positively cheeped with excitement and rushed to extricate the old gnome from the chicken's beak. Nel followed behind and adroitly fluttered into the back of the weird wagon. The old man, newly freed from the chicken, scrabbled his way up into the driver's seat again with reins in mouth. He pulled on his gloves and once again donned his goggles: with a stretching sound; a snap and a yelp. Debby hopped up beside him and looked around at Nel, grinning. Nel looked back and sat herself on a box of some sort. The cart tilted to the left; Debby cocked an eyebrow; 'Y'know, you're quite big for a pixie?' Nel, flashing a glare, ' -'Sayin' I'm fat?' <br>\r\n'No \u2013 no!' hastily peeped Debbie, turning around.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDespite the juddering of the wagon upon the road, Nel succeeded in dozing in the cloying, swampy, air.  She was lulled to sleep by the squashing and soggy sounds that came from below her; ignoring the twittering from the girl in the front...Nel was started awake by a violent jump. She cast about blearily and wildly. It had clouded over, sudden storms were frequent in the wet highlands, a gust was blowing and the sky dripped great droplets. She heard cries from the others; the cart was violently upset. The world whirled as Nel tumbled into a roadside ditch. She, though being disoriented, made out a guttural snarl and a gout of bluish flame streaked across her field of vision. She glimpsed a snap of the little man charging forward valiantly, wrench drawn, with a cry of 'Fizzlewiggin!' Nel heard Debbie screech a 'Leg it!' Nel righted herself and scrabbled into the shrubbery. Another snarl from behind her, she, without wasting a moment, fled into the heart of the woods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel, in her panic, quickly became lost in the mire. Alighting adroitly on a frond, she looked around; fog and bog everywhere. Can't see a damned thing! Arg! A fat frog sitting by he marsh edge 'bwarped'. Nel glared at the chubby amphibian, which rolled and plopped into the water. God this place reeks. A large dragonfly settled nearby. Through the murk and gloom, Nel heard a lilting sound. She followed the sound, which lead through the vines and trunks of swampy trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel continued in this fashion for some time. Just as she was preparing to give up, putting the musical chorus up to Will-o-the-wisps, she came across a glade in the impossible quagmire. In the clear stood a large willow tree, occasionally weeping leaves. Surrounding this sat a bog of considerable murk. And upon a large protruding root was sat a...Please no...The nymph ceased humming as she caught sight of Nel and waved excitedly; 'Cooeee!' Nel did not like nymphs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis distaste was a mixture of instinctive predisposition and personal caprice. Traditionally, most magical creatures of feminine persuasion harboured an inherent distrust and resentment of the nymphs, perhaps rooted in their tendency to spirit or lure away menfolk in moments of weakness, either unconsciously or for simple fun, in floods of passion. This was always in vain, for Nymphs, though of a much pleasing form and wildly passionate, were essentially quite different in genetic makeup to most creatures such as fairies, humans or pixies. No-one knew precisely the process by which the came about, but it was known that they comprised mostly of the fundamental elements which was reflected in their choice of abode (lakes, volcanoes, clouds etc...) The elementals were rather opposed to the Gods whom it fell to to create the other creatures, suspected to be older and much steeped in mystery. Consequentially, Nymphs loved their elements more than they could ever love anything of the flesh...which didn't necessarily prohibit naughtinesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's distate extended beyond this. Nymphs were often bodacious and excitable and this Nel found incredibly irksome, but, perhaps more so, often airily minded, or even simply stupid. Say something to them and you could hear your own voice echoing around in their head while they beamed down at you. And another thing, as if this was not enough, though Nel was small for a pixie, a pixie was rather small compared to a Nymph, who were oftenmost the size of a human child. This rendered the average Nymph, even though Nel had moderately increased in height, still three times her size. Characterised often by long flowing locks of hair to frame pale heart-shaped faces; impeccably styled tight and often revealing clothing; large dewy eyes and choir-like voices, each Nymph rounded this off, adding insult to injury, by often being buxom, bosomy and curvaceous. Nel didn't know anyone, even Clare-zilla!, who rivalled the waspish figure of the Nymphs, with their impossibly nipped in waists and look as if they were secreting ripe melons about their persons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bint was no exception. She sat balanced, gracefully, on a swampy root. Her thick and round thighs were crossed, squashed softly together. The Nymph coyly and effortlessly dangled a powder blue slipper from one foot; it was faintly translucent like water. Her large shapely legs were encased in a turquoise material of fishscales which glinted and shimmered in the dappled light. A short skirt of a similar fashion was tightly drawn across her rump and barely wrapped around her comely hips. The Nymph's hefty bosom pitched and bobbed what with her lively animation towards Nel, threatening to pop from from the diaphanous ribbon with affixed her ivory pumpkins tightly in place. At all times the Nymph bore a suggestion that her curves could shred out of her clothes from the strain: Nel could see the ribbon wax taught across the Nymph's chest as she hollared. The Nymph's large light eyes looked put from under the leaf of a soft bonnet-like hat, which crowned a profusion of inky blue locks, falling past her perch and hanging in the slow breeze. Her navy blue lips formed each successive cry perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel swore inwardly, and grudgingly acknowledged the bosomy water-sprite. The Nymph motioned Nel over to the root, with the flicking of a gloved hand. Lazy cow...But, Nel was lost and she acquiesced to the Nymph. As Nel flitted over, the Nymph idly twisted a curl of hair around a finger and waggled her feet. Nel alighted near the root, her fears were assuaged and the Nymph was indeed around three times her size.  The Nymph soon chimed in with, 'Hey there cutie-pie!' <br>\r\n'Hello...' muttered Nel.<br>\r\nThe Nymph giggled superfluously and grinned, 'What brings a sweetie like you all the ways out here?' <br>\r\nNel shrugged, 'Got lost...'<br>\r\n'Oh my, you poor little thing' simpered the Nymph sympathetically.<br>\r\nThe was an awkward silence. The Nymph looked around her for a moment, still swaying on the root. 'Well, I'm ever so thrilled you got lost!' she smiled. <br>\r\nNel looked back unamused, 'I'm not...'<br>\r\n'You're such a cutie' trickled the Nymph. <br>\r\n'Yeah...thanks'<br>\r\n'Sorry, but I'd better find the people I was with,' Nel glanced around her, 'how'd I get out of here then?' The Nymph bit her blue lip awkwardly, 'Well...if it ain't just the darndest thing, but I genuinely have no idea.' Nel sighed audibly. 'O, now don't be like that!' the Nymph chirped, 'Why'd you ever want to leave here anyways!?' Nel moved to speak and decided against it, the Nymph continued, 'Besides, we're gonna have all sorts of fun!' she cocked her head to one side, 'it's been ever so long since I've had a friend.' Nel sat down on a patch on moss and sighed again and gazed at the murky bogwater while the Nymph watched her keenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nymph soon broke the silence,'Well so long as you're stuck here with lil ol' me....' the Nymph dripped coyly, '... what's you're name?'<br>\r\n'Nel' Nel replied.<br>\r\n'What a lovely name!' this was followed by another silence.<br>\r\nGiving up waiting for a prompt, the Nymph continued 'Well my name's Lulabelle...or Bella...or Lulu...I don't mind!' She grinned again widely.<br>\r\nNel looked at Lulu, 'Doesn't your face ever get tired...what with all the smiling?'<br>\r\n'Whatchya mean silly?' Lulu beamed back.<br>\r\n'Nevermind' sighed Nel. Nymph's didn't really DO sarcasm, irony...and anything subtle. Lulu contented herself by rocking back and forth on her root, which creaked oddly under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed, made longer by the discussions about what's your favourite: fish, colour, type of water body, flower, bird continue ad infinitum. Nel interrupted a scintillating conversation about what Lulu like about baths with, 'What's up with this bog?' <br>\r\n'It's not right is it?' asked Lulu worriedly.<br>\r\n'Doesn't look it' Nel replied uncertainly, recoiling slightly as a large bubble of sludge ballooned from the quag. <br>\r\nLulu bit her lip in distress, 'Oh! It is those awful Goblins and their horrid city!' with tears beginning to form in her eyes she cried, 'They have polluted my lovely lil bog!'<br>\r\nNel quized further, in order to stop the Nymph from bawling, 'Why what have they done?'<br>\r\nPointing towards a metal barrel in the midst of the polluted swamp that surrounded the misty tree, Lulu whined, 'They come on down from those hills and dump all their horrible...stuff...in my lovely swamp. Now all my friends won't come near me! All the lil' critters have run off...' Her blue lips quivered. Nel wandered for closer inspection, 'I wouldn't touch it cutie pie...It is all nasty and poisonous.' Nel did feel some sympathy for the Nymph, they genuinely felt for the habitat to which they attached themselves. Nel sat down and waited while the Nymph sobbed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the glade came a snarl and a roar, accompanying a terrific thundering. Both Lulu and Nel watched the gloom. Indistinctly, they saw a small furry figure streak from the woods screaming and jabbering. Soon afterwards can a blurry pink fuzz. It must be those gnomes! Which means...From the trees burst and nightmarish creature of blue and dark green, huge, long and lizard-like. A gout of blue flame erupted from its jaws. Distracted from this, Nel heard a thick splash from the bog...Who fell in!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel's attention was quickly detracted from the bubbling swamp. The huge salamander crawled forward from the copse of trees, jaws slavering; molten blue spittle searing the moss and wet grass. Boiling steam snorted in jets from its nostrils. 'Run for it!' cried Debbie as she skittered past Nel. Thinking quickly, Nel zipped behind the willow tree. A snarl pierced the glade again. The black claws screeched against the rocks as it pursued the gnomes; Nel espied a wrench embedded in one of its huge teeth. As it stormed past its great tail collided with the tree. It splintered as if struck by lightning. It creak and cracked as it toppled slowly. Nel darted in earnest from its shadow as it slammed where she had been moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie's legs could only convey her so fast, her chest bounced rapidly as she sprinted. She readjusted her helmet which had slipped over her eyes. The salamander was gaining on her like a thundering storm. Its huge jaws gaped like hell, impending on the gnome girl, open to swallow. In the blink of an eye Nel tackled Debbie from its path as the cavernous maw snapped its jaws shut on thin air. The salamander thrashed in rage and rampaged into the trees, rolling frantically, having confused itself in its anger. Nel and Debbie rolled a distance off, and scrambled quickly to their feet. Debbie looked at Nel in appreciation, panting heavily; 'Thanks...' Nel averted her gaze; '...'s'nothing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir little moment was interrupted but a low growl. The salamander cracked its way through the undergrowth once more; another gout if fire was belched into the sky. Nel made to dart away from the raging dragon once more, but fell immediately. She scrabbled around and looked back frantically, her chest heaving her eyes identified the problem. Her leg was ensnared by a twisted root. She tugged, but it was wedged in tight. Debbie rose the the occasion and clutched Nel's knee and pulled as well. Nel winced and strained, this wouldn't have happened when she was just a fraction smaller. 'Come on, come on!' muttered Debbie through gritted teeth. Nel felt a hot wind on her back and in her hair. Nel did not need to bother turning around, she could even see the immense white jaws reflected in the gnome's wide eyes. Nel sighed inwardly, why did things like this insist on happening?...Out of the Giant Clare frying pan and into the Swamp Dragon fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel tried one last time to force the tree to relinquish her, but to no avail. She sighed again. This wouldn't be a problem if she was bigger; as big as Clare or bigger! She could pick up that little lizard by the tail, between finger and thumb, dangling and then flick him across the forest. If she was huge, then we'd see who pushed who around. Nel sighed again. 'I'd advise you run away now' she breathed to Debbie, who was transfixed with fear. <br>\r\n'N-n-no...' she peeped. Nel raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe pair prepared themselves, though Nel could not turn to see, as the Dragon crawled its way towards them, bearing down on them with molten spittle dripping from its jaws. The jaws gapped, the stench of ground-gas and bog water leaked from them. Nel closed her eyes... but nothing. The dragon had frozen and was casting around quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground trembled faintly and a rumbled. Debbie watched through her fingers as a pebble bounced a little and vibrated. Debbie, uncovering her face, looked around confused as well. The trembling became more severe, a groaning echoed through the ground. The bog water a while off churned and bubbled. The dragon sniffed the air tentatively, then snorted steam. The dragon turned its attention back to the gnome, advancing threatening. The swamp heaved, with an immense sucking and squelching. Nel was conscious of a shadow spreading across her. 'What's happening?' she cried blindly. The gnome's jaw dropped, dumbfounded. Nel twisted to try and see, but couldn't. Nel watched as the shadow stretched across the glade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Debbie watched a rather different show. From the sludge ascended a black willow tree of hair, running with slime. This was followed by a long, sharp ridge of a nose, sludge dripped from its elegant point. Debbie could not believe what she was experiencing as two huge hills of breast flesh rose from the swamp, ploughing into and upturning the soft banks as they increased in girth, before rising skywards. Bog water ran in sheets from the bosomy knolls. Increasingly a burbling, rubbery sound was making itself known, as if a water balloon were slowly swelling and swelling, becoming fatter and swollen. It bubbled and gurgled, became louder and louder like the squelching of a hot water bottle. Debbie stepped slowly backwards as the figure became taller and taller, the shadow stretched and occluded the length of the clearing with  darkness The dragon, apparently convinced of its own fearsome aura, remained oblivious \u2013 they could be surprisingly dim witted some times. Debbie's head inclined more and more, craning her neck to take stock of the bog colossus, which was continuing to become bigger and bigger. Past the jaws of the dragon, Debbie could see a pair of whale-like hips emerging from the murk, their volume flaring with a thick flesh gurgle to gigantic proportions. The dark wet figure loomed immense now, growing so swiftly that those hips where followed by bulging round thighs of such thickness, Debbie wondered as she watched them transpire from the waters and round out with a fat murmuring. Debbie gawked as tremendous hips expanded like a flesh canopy. The woman now almost eclipsed the sky with her stature. She stood knee deep in the swamp, but towered over the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon froze as from above thundered; 'OH MERCY!'  Lulu's voice shook the ground with volume. The dragon rounded, and cowered in the shadow of the thundering nymph. 'Oh no...'not again thought Nel, still unable to appreciate the size to which the Nymph had ballooned. 'LOOKS LIKE 'A'VE PUT ON A LITTLE WEIGHT!' boomed Lulu as she inspected herself. The dragon cowered like a frightened dog. 'MERCY! AH REALLY AM EVER SO BIG!' She bit her lip anxiously, eyes downcast to the scene below.  The Nymph's huge violet eyes caught the sight to the dragon. Her brow knitted. She put her hands on her hips and pouted. 'THINK YOU CAN PUSH LIL' GIRLS AROUND, HUH? Before the dragon could escape, she had pinched its tail between her huge, long, white thumb and finger. Debbie marvelled at the sheen of those immense blue fingernails. The salamander was lifted to the cloudy heights of Lulu's head. The dragon, the size of a large crocodile to a human, dangled and thrashed desperately in the Lulu's colossal grip. 'WELL,' she inspected herself again. 'AH'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE GROWIN'' she placed her free hand on her hip, and projected her huge bosom. 'AAAAND IT LOOKS LAHKE I AIN'T SO LITTLE ANYMORE!' she thundered in her silky, melody-like, voice. She bit her lip coyly and flashed her lilac eyes towards the specks of Nel and Debbie...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Nel and Debby craned their necks and cast their eyes upwards from the sucking mire and splintered wood at the huge and dripping nymph, outlined against gathering clouds, and the salamander lashing as it dangled from her fingers. Only minutes before, the salamander has seemed huge in comparison to the pixies and nymph in the clearing, but now it hung from looming nymph\u2019s hands like long, blue licorice or a chili pepper. In spite of her dislike for nymphs, and her reservations about having another giant girl running amok, for the nymph must be northwards of thirty, even fifty, foot tall, and not a jot less bodacious at that, Nel could not help heaving a sigh of relief at being snatched from danger, or, rather, having danger snatched from her way. Nel could not actually see the nymph\u2019s face any longer, obscured as it was by a heaving bosom, but Debby, from atop the toppled tree, could see the sharp features of Lulu\u2019s heart-shaped regarding the salamander with some unease, biting her plump, blue bottom lip. The raging lizard let out a gout of fire as it thrashed, causing Lulu to lurch backwards, holding the salamander at arm\u2019s length. The others on the ground could see the huge nymph casting about for somewhere to dispose of the salamander, as if for a waste-paper basket or other receptacle. Obviously, she found none. She could not dispose of the lizard in the nearby vicinity; it would only go after those little gnomes and pixie. Lulu seemed to stand for some time, pondering, a slight frown on her brow; Nel, as she was pulled free by Debby, could not help but enjoy a laugh to herself at the concentration the nymph apparently required. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut as the giant nymph pondered, there brewed a sound like thunder in the glade, a gurgling sound, which came not from the clouds about, but from the nymph\u2019s gut. A look of embarrassment crossed Lulu\u2019s blu-tinged cheeks as she clapped her free hand to her belly, \u201c\u2018Scuse me!\u201d, she boomed, \u201cbut I really am evah so famished!\u201d Just then, the nymph\u2019s face suddenly brightened. \u201cI know!\u201d Lulu chirped, seeming to straighten up. Nel and Debby exchanged confused glances. Planting her feet beside one another, Lulu dangled the furious salamander aloft, now thrashing above her head. As Nel and the little gnome watched, Lulu swept back her green-blue hair, and casually let her mouth fall open. Nel\u2019s mouth too opened, but hers in incredulity. The salamander, too, stopped its thrashing in shock and horror at the abyss opening below it. But this, as it happened, turned out to be a grave mistake, for the moment the salamander ceased its flailing was when Lulu, as a nymph ever a slave to her body, took her chance with lightning quickness. Nel was conscious of a flurry of activity and half-imagined Lulu\u2019s huge and plump blue lips slurping a long tail down wetly like spaghetti, she thought she heard Lulu\u2019s teeth snap shut, but what both Nel and Debby definitely heard was a loud and unctuous gulp. Only a slight moment passed before the swampy clearing was shaken by a satisfied and thunderous belch. \u201cPhew! \u2018Scuse me!\u201d Lulu boomed. As she said so, Lulu burped again; furrowing her brow in a look of concern and thumping her chest, \u201cOohh\u201d, she breathed, as another belch passed from her in mid-thought, \u201cspicy\u2026\u201d Lulu seemed almost to swallow the last word, fanning one huge hand, while, Nel imagined, though could not discern, her eyes were watering.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe danger now...gone, Nel approached, in frank disbelief. Debby already stood not far from the towering nymph on a grassy mound on the marshy ground. Nel mounted the mound and regarded the huge nymph, who, after the scene with the salamander was casting around the clearing for the grumpy, little pixie and adorable little gnomes. Nel put her finger in her mouth and whistled sharply. Hearing this, Lulu turned to look down at them, peering down at them, her hands on her knees, so her huge and blubbery breasts hung pendulously, like huge teardrops buoying up and down gently. \u201cWell hello again!\u201d beamed Lulu \u201cyou are even more adorably itty bitty now!\u201d Nel momentarily lost her train of thought, transfixed by something which she was convinced was a glinting shoal of tiny fish flitting across the bluish and faintly translucent globe of Lulu\u2019s right breast. For just a moment, Nel could not help but take in the fine network of faint, purplish veins unfolding in a lattice beneath the surface of those enormous boobs. Regaining herself, Nel resumed her air of haughty impatience with the nymph. \u201cWhat was that!?\u201d, said Nel, \u201cWhy did you even d\u2e3b\u201d \u201cSorry darling?\u201d boomed Lulu, interrupting, \u201cI can\u2019t hear little you.\u201d Lulu crouched down the better to hear Nel and the gnomes, her chin resting childishly on her hands as they were piled atop her knees, in great ignorance of how much she infuriated Nel. Nel cupped her hands and shouted now, \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking!?\u201d Lulu flushed again and boomed back \u201cI\u2019m sorry darlings! I was just ever so famished.\u201d Nel shouted back \u201cSo!? That was so bloody stupid of you! Why in the world didn\u2019t you just toss that thing!?\u201d  Lulu furrowed her brow again but did not respond this time. \u201cOi!\u201d Nel yelled, \u201cfrogspawn-for-brains, I said\u2e3b\u201d Nel found herself drowned out by the thunderous groaning of Lulu\u2019s stomach once more, of a tenor so violent and loud that it sounded like a furnace full of molten slag in the nymph\u2019s belly. As Nel went to continue, the rumbling could be heard to travel upwards, and as it did so the nymph\u2019s eyes widened and she straightened up, perched squatting on her haunches, before erupting as another therous belch. Nel, though interrupted, could not help but be thankful that the nymph had the good grace not to burp in their faces. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNel opened her mouth to speak again but Lulu, finished thumping her chest, suddenly let herself keel backwards, her monstrous buttocks slamming into the soft ground with a squelch deafening to Nel and Debby. Indeed, such was the suddenness of the nymph\u2019s impact that Debby fell herself and Nel almost pitched forward into the mud. \u201cHey!\u201d screamed Nel \u201cWatch it!\u201d \u201cOops!\u201d boomed Lulu putting her hand to her lips, \u201csorry littlies! Ahm just not so used to being just this big an\u2019 bouncy!\u201d \u201cAnd\u201d, went on the giant nymph, \u201cahm not sure that little ol\u2019 lizard\u2e3bUurrrp,\u201d her Lulu belched once more, \u201c\u2e3bagreed with little, big me!\u201d Debby clambered to her feet as Lulu said this, turning to see the nymph sitting in the clearing, legs splayed immodestly, seeming to yawn at Nel and herself as if they might devour them both. Debby casually averted her eyes, which Nel continued to fume. \u201cIt serves you right\u201d yelled Nel, matter of factly. \u201cThe better question is what\u2019re we to do with you!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLulu appeared to ponder the question. \u201cWell,\u201d she eventually boomed, \u201cI usually dry out in a couple a days.\u201d Nel was incredulous, \u201cSo this happens often!?\u201d, she shouted back. Lulu waggled her head, \u201cSometahmes...nevuh this big though!\u201d she added with some degree of pride cut with embarrassment as she drew herself up in her sitting position and indicated her huge and voluptuous body. \u201cWell,\u201d shouted Nel, ignoring Lulu\u2019s bosomy might, you\u2019ll never dry out in this weather, it looks like rain.\u201d Lulu grinned, \u201cYup!\u201d, she boomed childishly, \u201cwhen it starts pourin\u2019 I just start a swellin\u2019 an\u2019 swellin\u2019!\u201d Nel ignored this too and asked Debby how far to the nearest town. Debby replied that it was still an hour away, and while they could probably find shelter for Lulu, they no longer had their wagon. \u201cWell,\u201d said Nel, \u201cbig and bouncy there might just come in useful then; she could walk that easily.\u201d \u201cIndeed\u201d chimed Debby, nodding happily. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNel fluttered up to the huge nymph. \u201cRight, come on, we know where to go, we\u2019ll hitch a ride on you\u201d said Nel. But although the nymph\u2019s mercurial eyes converged on Nel hovering before her nose, Lulu seemed not to have heard her. Nel repeated herself, but to the same response.  Again Nel made clear her plan and while the nymph\u2019s features changed to one of discomfort, Lulu still did not reply. Instead, she groaned and clutched her stomach again. Nel fluttered backwards in case the clumsy nymph might accidentally swat her. Indeed, Nel could hear quite distinctly the groaning not just of the nymph but of her stomach. Steam was about to come out of Nel\u2019s ears with anger when she noticed steam actually rising softly from the nymph\u2019s shoulders and, glancing down that great drops of perspiration were forming on the expanse of breast-flesh below her; it was as if Lulu were boiling up! As if to confirm her suspicions, the giant nymph began to pant and breathe heavily, her long, blue tongue lolling, fanning herself with a huge hand. As this continued, buckets of sweat started to leap from the nymph\u2019s body. Nel began to harbour some hopes that the giant nymph would eventually be shrunk by this sweating and wondered for a moment, darkly, if the salamander might burst from her plushy belly once she did. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNel\u2019s hopes were short lived. Almost as suddenly as she\u2019d swallowed the salamander, the panting and steaming Lulu whipped around, the monstrous bulk of her ass almost fatally clouting Nel as it swivelled and was thrust skywards. Before Nel realised and could stop her, too busy avoiding giant buttocks, Lulu had plunged her mouth and chin to the bog from which she had not long emerged. Clouds of steam gushed from Lulu as she did so, cooling herself with gulp after gulp of marshy water. Nel was at a lost flew through the steam and screamed in Lulu\u2019s ear, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing you bubble-brained idiot!? How\u2019s this going to make you and smaller!?\u201d Nel grabbed hold of Lulu\u2019s ear and tugged, \u201cYou\u2019re. just. getting. BIGGER!\u201d yelled Nel with frustration. Her thirst seemingly slake, her body cooled, Lulu withdrew from the bog and sat once more on the marshy ground, Nel still dangling from her ear. Lulu drew a hand across her mouth and gasped a sigh of relief, followed soon afterwards by a rich and thunderous belch: \u201cUUUURRP!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her smile, thus waxing across her tallowy complexion, which also glowed but with its own sort of anemic light,  met with the limits of lateral expression and curled at the corners in a graceful arc, cresting the stretching of her lips with roundings of navyblue, slicing so slightly more into the thick cream of her cheeks. Her teeth glowed like a darkly light church-hall in the seemingly cavernous, blue fringed, aperture and her skin glowed like the waxiness of a candle and so too did her eyes glimmer and crackle with a dusky phosphorescence of violet and yellow, which in their spots of greater clarity and brilliance in the murky blue pools  recalled the finesse of stained glass - seeming to glow now as one, many dull wicks lit and entombed in the recesses of an immense ivory Jack-o-lantern . Glowing, these eyes languished on the slim form, though once huge and hulking to her point of view, hung from her hand, become substantially larger. The nymph\u2019s eyes rested lazily on the writhing reptile suspended from its tail in front of her face, pinched between the sizable and long candles of her index finger and thumb - the cause of her amusement and the cause of her smile,  rooted, ultimately, in the impish glee, derived from deep in her watery soul, in experiencing the balance of physical size between herself and the salamander being redrawn in her favour and the wealth of coy possibilities of which she could use this adjustment to avail herself. Blinking softly, the blue candlelight irises flicker and gutter briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrashing lizard snorts a slim spark of flame into the air from piping nostrils, flanged with horny skin, the texture of which the massive nymph\u2019s eyes finds difficulty in picking out,, the jet quickly dissipates in a lingering haze of bluish smoke, reeking of brimstone, which is soon snorted from the atmosphere by the immense sucking of the nymph\u2019s breathings. Wrinkling her nose she snorts, wettly, back outwards which extinguishes another jet of flames in its initial stages of delivery, and shocked the blue lizard dangled limply from her big, thick, waxy fingers, charged with fire like a feisty blue chili. Seized by the moment and the notion, the nymph lofts the dragon\u2019s weight with ease higher to hang above her head, running her long tongue along her plump blue lips it separates them stickily from one another and follows this by parting the walls of her teeth and gaping wide her mouth, in the dark cavity lurks her red tongue, retreated there from her lips to rest there, dark and wet - the trashing thus resumed this time bestowed the kind of vigor peculiar to those who are faced with the imminent prospect of being swallowed. A change of heart swells in the nymph and she claps shut her mouth, lowering the lizard - though still thrashing the continual efforts towards any escape, or attempts to influence the nymph, exerted, and their lack of effect on the nymph, act as a testament to its comparative feebleness and the immense strength and power the massive increase in size has afforded the water nymph - the nymph giggle girlishly in booming peals, with her free hand twisting an incredible locks of dark blue hair, like the coiling fronds of the tree of the night sky,  around her long tapering hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the nymph flexes and slightly swings the dangling dragon like a pendulum, appearing to meditate on something, holding her mouth in a delicate purse of blue and to one side of her waxwork white face; she languidly rolls her large tongue around the inside of the cave her mouth. Too hot to handle, a thought gently sparks into the clouds of her mind, again a smile spreads across her face like the splitting of warm wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViewing from below, level with the bog that roots the nymph\u2019s thick ankles, past a thick, waxy, trunk of white thigh and the immensity of a bulwark of hip, semi-obstructed by a projection of breastflesh, Nel and the gnomes watch as the dragon, which seemed huge to them, was gently revolved and then rotated and soon spun, building steadily to a twirl, by the strong turning of the nymph\u2019s thick wrist. Biting her tongue, the nymph lofted the whirling lizard and let it fly away, spiraling, across the treetops. The nymph mockingly covered her brow and shielded her eyes attempting to see the speeding lizard and giggled: she extended one huge and long arm and waved: \u2018BUH-BYE!\u2019 and boomed again with laughter... Nel and the gnomes exchanged glances and looked back up at the huge nymph, who looked mirthfully down at them, but this expression soon clouded and she boomed- 'GAHYS...'</span></div></div>",

Nel looked up at the nymph\u2019s face, becoming increasingly indistinct through the falling drizzle; her colossal form vaguely silhouetted and obscured darkly against the gray of the sky; a long indigo tress adhered to her jaw, dark wirework inlaid into enamel: the nymph cupped her hands over her heaving, wet breasts, the thick flesh bulging perceptibly in leeway between each finger. To hold back her bust was like holding thick cream, Nel mused, she might been bigger than Clare! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \u2018AH THINK AHM -the overgrown nymph balked as her body creaked and groaned like the stretching of rubber -  WAHHHH!\u2019 The huge nymph blubbered and burst, huge tears leaping from her face into the rain. Lulu hefted her huge, thick leg from the sucking quag and brought it down onto the damp ground, a few feet from Nel and the gnomes, with a rumble: from around her hulking foot bubbled and oozed the water from the pulpy bog ground; soon after followed the other tree trunk leg, touching down just beside the onlookers, who reeled backwards to avoid the colossal, clumsy nymph - Nel could faintly distinguish the wet flesh of the huge calve swell thicker even as it lifted into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plashing of rain intensified, Lulu boomed through the trees, retreating with dull, thunderous footsteps. Nel and the gnomes picked themselves up from the wet earth, where they had been knocked by the shuddering of the giant nymph\u2019s stomping as she bawled into the trees: they could hear her resounding tread already far off in the woods, muted by the sound of the rain. Nel, dodging the occasional raindrop, flitted over to the treeline, followed by the gnomes shortly afterwards, who came scampering along behind. Nel rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands, sighing in exasperation as a cloud of birds flew into the air some way off; <i>why is everyone insisting on growing? not like any of them needed it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked pensively at the outline cleaved through the grove by the mountainous nymph, thundering by like a blossoming glacier: the waxing arc of her hips sundering the trunks of trees in her path; her broadening shoulders snapping and pushing aside boughs which obstructed the way; her strengthening arms and lengthening hands sweeping aside and baling fronds and branches from her face and body. Splintered wood, bleeding sap into the wet rain, lay along the corridor formed in the nymph\u2019s wake. Nel noted the way in which the corridor seemed to widen as it got further away from where she stood: the cleft of the hips in the trees spread laterally, clipping and knocking more and more trees and, simultaneously, rose higher and higher up the trunks with each impact. Nel\u2019s eye picked out that, some ways down the forest corridor, the nymph\u2019s head had broken through the canopy above; the pale light fell down from this rupture down onto the path below from that point on; widening further as her broadening shoulders had mounted to the point where they, and her pitching chest, carved through the canopy and Nel thought she could distinguish, through the haze of the rain, that further on the nymph\u2019s shoulders and breasts were replaced by her thunderous hips in her foray through the woods. Nel placed the heels of her hands over her eyes again: <i>God she\u2019s gonna be huge... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie shuffled from foot to foot: \u2018What now?\u2019</span></div></div>",

Sure, earlier today the prospect of becoming larger weighed on her mind, but now she wanted everything to be over. She was tired. And cold. And hungry. As annoying as it was that everyone around her seemed to be turning into giants, she just wanted to go home and sleep for a day or two. She looked back at the gnomes that were her forced companions. Nel thought that they were kind of annoying, and kind of a hassle, BUT Debbie had saved her life today, so Nel felt some sort of obligation to help her out if possible. She also had the giant Clare on the back her mind, and a growing nymph on the loose. Nel figured that maybe if she chased after the nymph and got her to calm down, Lulu might be able to help her with her Clare problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Alright,\" she started, turning back to her gnomish companions, \"I'm going to go after that nymph. Can't very well have her causing a ruckus for innocent folks.\" Nel actually didn't care too much about the nymph causing trouble, but she DID care about people getting hurt, and it seemed likely with the state and size of the oversized fey creature. \"You two stay here, hopefully I won't be long.\" Lifting off, Nel flew above the forest, following the path of destruction left by the enormous girl. It wasn't easy, since it had started raining, and visibility was low. Nel could have sworn that it looked like the trees were shaking though. Just how big had Lulu gotten now? Nel couldn't see her, even though she had to easily clear the tops of the forest trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat Nel hoped would be a short flight proved to be much longer as minutes stretched into an hour, then two hours. Nel saw the path of destruction steadily increase in size until it separated into 2 lines of mowed down trees, then resolved into a set of fantastically sized footprints that steadily grew larger. Nel gulped. By now one footprint was longer than Lulu had been tall last time she saw Lulu, and still she hadn't caught sight of her. It was getting dark, and Nel still hadn't found Lulu. Nel considered giving up and returning back to the others. On the other hand, she had been flying for quite some time. The nymph couldn't be THAT much farther... right? Nel contemplated this as she briefly stopped for a rest in a stretch of forest stamped flat by the colossal Lulu, the print easily large enough that a human village could have fit in it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tNel stretched her wings out and took a sip from a nearby pool of rainwater. If she turned around now, she'd just have to come back this way again later. Assuming she could get Lulu to agree to help her, the trip back wouldn't take anywhere near as long. Nel took off again. The rain had stopped by now so she was making much better time, but the footprints were getting farther and farther apart. Fairly soon, though, Nel started to hear a sound. It quickly became louder - much, much louder - and became more distinct. It was like someone sobbing, except in such a loud and low bass tone that it didn't sound like any creature Nel had heard before. Nel kept following it, assuming that it was Lulu she was hearing. Even being able to hear her, Nel couldn't see Lulu at all. As Nel flew nearer and nearer, she felt the air stirring and pulsing back against her. It was as if... no, it had to be. Lulu was so big that her great sobs were causing shockwaves in the air that pushed against the fairy. Shortly, they became powerful enough that Nel couldn't make headway against them. Just as she was about to give up and land, a sudden gust of wind blasted her towards the sound. Screaming, Nel tumbled through the air as the wind carried her at incredible speeds. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tIn no time, the titanic Lulu came into view. Despite herself situation, Nel was dumbfounded by what she saw. Lulu had grown from a figurative mountain into a literal one, or even a literal mountain range. A momument of firm yet plump womanly flesh, Lulu was a behemoth beyond comprehension now. A single eye could have filled a human's view horizon to horizon if they were close enough to it, let alone a tiny fairy like Nel; a strand of hair could have encircled a large human city, perhaps more than once, and would have been thicker than a car; her ears were big enough that a large aircraft would have been able to safely land, turn around, and take off again in them, with plenty of room to spare; her mouth could have sucked down an entire fleet of ships into a whirlpool bigger than any before, if she were able to find a body of water that was deeper than the back of her head to her lips; her nose could have snorted up an entire city in one inhale, or with one exhale flattened said city and sent every building and person in it flying away on the billowing wind created by her mighty lungs. Nel was particularly fixated on this last bit, because she was being rapidly sucked up into said nostrils. Nel reflected that whenever she thought a day couldn't get any worse, it somehow did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuckily for her though, before she could disappear forever into the cavernous nose of her giant quarry, Lulu stopped inhaling. Nel, still tumbling head-over-heals in the air, crashed into something firm yet soft and pleasant-smelling. After her head stopped spinning, Nel looked around and discovered she had crashed into the cheek of this gargantuan girl. Looking up, she saw the curve of Lulu's cheek lead into a massive eye that was currently closed, a river of tears steaming down from both sides and waterfalling down either side of her eye. Below, Nel could see Lulu's nose to the left, and her plump, full lips parted while her bawling cries echoed over the land. Nel realized that even though Lulu's face seemed to stretch up and down forever, she was actually lying down and all the great distance below Nel was just from where she rested on Lulu's cheek to the bottom of her chin. Nel shuddered to think how large the rest of Lulu's voluptuous body was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNel needed to get Lulu's attention, but wasn't sure how. She could flit around Lulu's eye and hope the colossus somehow saw her, or she could fly into Lulu's ear and scream, hoping that Lulu could actually hear her.</span></div></div>",

She was still getting bigger! <i>She must be twice my size! </i> Nel's eyes opened post impact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nel took a quick look at the destruction she caused. \"This must be how humans feel, when they wander in our forest. I guess, I seem like the bully, now.\" Nel rose to her feet, debris the size of humans falling from her ass. \"Look at me. I'm bigger than every being I ever saw. I'm probably bigger than every being anyone ever saw.\" Nel exclaimed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted by some squeaky screams. Nel turned around, to see what all the commotion was about.  She had to kneel down in order to make anything out. There were a few red splatters where her butt had landed previously. And around them were a handfull of people. Some of them were kneeling over the splatters, others were screaming something at her - not that she could actually understand their little squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Nel to understand what was going on. \"Did I just...\" She quickly touched her butt and found some sticky liquid on it. A thunderous sigh escaped her lips. \"The first day as a big girl, and all I did was destroy stuff and kill beings.\" A wide smile formed on her lips. \"I guess it's time to enjoy myself. And I know exactly who is going to join me for my fun.\" Nel turned around to search for Clare. She didn't need to look far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare was in disbelieve of what just happened. One moment she flattened Nel beneath her feet, the next she was looking at her crotch. She shook her head. When she opened her eyes again, she saw a colossal object in front of her. Two mounds of flesh, each bigger then her won head. Clare couldn't look away from Nel's ass. She feared the moment she looked away, she would be eaten alive by it. Only when Nel turned around and the two mounds vanished from her field of vision, did she snap back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Clare, where did we stop? Oh right you wanted to teach me a lesson. By all means, knock yourself out.\" Nel giggled. She had the upper hand. She could finally have her revenge against the smaller pixie. And she would enjoy every moment of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare quickly rose to her feet. She wasn't going to waste any time, trying to argue with Nel. She had to find a way to increase her size and quickly. She turned around and run as fast as possible.  It didn't even matter where, as long as it was away from the gigantic pixie. She just barely made it out of the city when she felt Nel's foot hit her on her side. The next moment Clare was sent flying. It was over 800 feet when her colossal body touched the ground. She immediately tried to get up, but her legs didn't respond. After a few tries, Clare turned face upwards and lied there, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel watched the fruitless attempts of her old friend with delight. A few minutes ago, she was almost getting crushed by Clares foot, and now a single kick of Nel was enough to immobilize her. Nel slowly approached the panting pixie, looking her all other, like a predator who examines it's prey. She didn't miss the trembling of the smaller pixie. \"Oh is someone scared of little old me?\" Nel's smile widened. \"Come on. Let me give you a big hug, for old times sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare felt herself getting picked up by the bigger pixie. Even though her feet didn't touch the ground anymore, she wasn't able to see Nel's face. There were two colossal orbs blocking her few. These breasts were bigger than most buildings she had destroyed a few minutes ago. They had to be at least half the size of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Clare was pulled towards them until her head touched them. Realizing what Nel had planned, she turned her head to the side and took a deep breath. The next moment everything went dark. This two titanic mount of flesh, which had previously blocked her vision, were now pressing on her from every side and cutting off every source of air for her. Then Nel's released the grip on Clare, letting her breasts envelope the complete upper body of the smaller pixie. immediately Clare struggled to get free, but to no avail. Other than exhausting herself, she didn't manage to make any progress whatsoever.  And if that wasn't bad enough, Nel was starting to sweat. Every few seconds another drop made it's way towards Clare. Soon her head was coated in a thin layer of the bigger pixies sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above Nel was in pure bliss. Whenever she wanted to talk to Clare she had to stand on Clare's breast, so she could be seen and heard. And now the same Clare was almost completely buried between Nel's breasts. This almighty feeling was something Clare had felt every time when looking down on Nel. But finally Nel could put her in her place with nothing more than her natural assets. She started to giggle, which made her breast vibrate and the situation for the smaller pixie even worse then before. The sweat that covered Clare's face, was now forcefully absorbed by the smaller pixies skin. That thought made Nel burst out in laughter. She continued to laugh until she felt the squirming dying down. She released Clare from the grab of her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel waited until she could hear the impact of the other pixie hitting the ground. She would have liked to see Clare's beaten body, but her own breast made it impossible to see anything beneath her, which with her size was almost everything. There had to be a way to reduce her boobs to a more practically size, but Nel could think about that later. At the moment she wanted to enjoy Clare's demise. And if she couldn't see it, she could at least hear and feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know feel better, Clare. We should do this more often, don't you think?\" Clare was way too exhausted to answer her. After a few seconds Clare could feel small earthquakes. It seemed like Nel was repeatedly jumping into the air. Suddenly the sky above Clare got dark. A massive object approached her fast. When Clare realized what it was, it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's butt come down like a meteoroid. The impact could be heard miles away. Clare could have sworn that for a split second her soul left her body. The pain was like nothing she ever felt. She would have screamed, would she have been able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you were still recuperating, but I hope you don't mind me BUTTING in.\" Nel giggled about her pun. \"Give me a moment to get comfortable. This position actually makes me quite horny.\" The gigantic pixie started to fondle herself, all the while grinding her ass into the smaller fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side was Clare. Her lower body was immobilized by the weight of her former friends butt. She could only lay there looking at Nel's crotch, fearing what may come next. She could already smell a faint odor coming from the titanic pixie's womanhood. After a while Nel's weight proved too much for Clare and she could feel a bone in her left wing crack. This pain caused a small scream to leave Clares lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Nel's instinct had completely overtaken her. She was fondling herself like crazy, when she heard a squeaky sound coming from beneath her. That was the last push she needed to climax. She released her cum with a thunderous scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Clare had finally regained her senses, after Nel stopped moving. However her break was short lived, hearing Nel's scream. She had barely time to close her eyes and mouth, before the the stream out of the bigger pixies womanhood hit her right in the face. The release seemed to last forever and the Clare couldn't hold her breath anymore. She opened her mouth, only to swallow her former friends cum. After a while she blacked out from the loss of air.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ground trembled and thundered under Nel's colossal ass. Buildings groaned as her thighs and hips exacted growing pressure on them. Nel opened her eyes. She was amazed to see Clare sprawled in the street, her legs splayed in the air. She gazed enraptured at the dust clouds billowing around her ass, the crowds of people standing agog. Pixies didn't make a habit of interacting with the human cities, for the city-dwellers pixies were little whimsical creatures, not towering behemoths. Nel grinned and hefted bosom. <i>More than handfuls!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's smiled faded slightly. She could feel rumbling through the ground aside from the occasional tremors that increased her size. Her vast beautiful green eyes focused Clare. The blonde pixie, still where she'd fallen, was shaking all over. \"Oh no! Not again! Please!\" Nel pleadingly boomed and tried to stand. But Nel had still not adjusted to her new size, she wasn't entirely in control of her voluminous  body. She fell back to earth again with another thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare's eyes popped open, wide. An \"Oh!\" burst out and shook the nearby windows. The spurt rumbled and shook the ground beneath Clare, dislodging the rubble from her ivory body. Her legs grew violently skyward. Clare's  ass burgeoned and billowed, bhouying her pelvis off the ground by sheer rubbery size. A massive arm shot out, growing alarming quickly, and clutched into a building, twisting metal and rock with increasing strength. The other grasped the road and pavement, Clare's nails boring into the earth. Her mountainous bosom rose and fell like an empire; droplets of sweat beaded about her body, sliding to the street below and swamping the odd by-stander who had let curiosity get the better of him. Clare, closed her eyes and moaned; it was like the sky opening for a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel hauled herself to her knees and attempted to crawl through the comparatively narrow street. She maneuvered by like some gargantuan awkward cat creeping forward, flattening cars and such needless to add. Nel winced, her hip had become entrenched in the buildings. She braced herself against the building and tugged. Her cruise-liner hips plowed through the office blocks and retail stores in their path; pulverised rubble left in their wake. Nel was amazed at how immensely strong she had become. Slowly she dragged her hips in an attempt to free herself. She was convinved she was still growing.  All of a sudden, she burst free, flying forward; only to be cushioned by her vast pillowy bosom and...something else. Nel was still pretty stunned from the suddeness of her take off. She was quickly alerted to her situation, when something clamped onto her left ass cheek, then something onto the other. Nel lifted her head and gazed into a pair of sea-green eyes. Clare beemed, hefting Nel's ass slightly, \"Hello Nellie!\" Clare ran her tongue across her teeth, \"My my\" she boomed from beneath Nel, \"What big girls we are!\" She slapped Nel's butt-cheek teasingly. Nel's ample tits met their equal (To be honest it may be the case that either Nel or Clare had a more ample endowment, it scarcely seems worth it to split hairs when the only viable way to measure bra size is by how many average sized auto-mobiles one can store in there.) The result was a chasm of cleavage that Clare teased a finger through, relinquishing a hold on Nel's right cheek. Nel could feel her body inching larger; she could feel Clare's too, bubbling and groaning beneath her. Clare smiled a impish smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly, Nel's body matched Clare's inch for inch. This only caused the blonde's smile to widen as she reached up to stroke Nel's cheek. The blue-haired pixie was caught off-guard by the tenderness of the touch, instinctively leaning into the caress as her eyes fluttered shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare saw her opportunity. Swift as a viper she lunged up and met her lips to Nel's in a sensual kiss, her tongue slipping between her friend's lips and exploring Nel's mouth. Clare let out a deep purr, pulling Nel's hips down to grind against her own. Nel yelped, pulling her head back but still too shaken by her new size to actually escape. \"Clare! What\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off when Clare wrapped her arms around the blue-haired pixie, hugging her tight and nuzzling into her neck. \"I've loved you for so long, Nel, but I've always been afraid of how you'd react. But now that I'm so big, I don't have to be inhibited. I don't have to be afraid.\" With one massive heave she rolled their bodies over and through the buildings constraining them, sitting up on Nel and grinding their pussies together. She gazed at the object of her desire through lidded eyes, a sexy smirk on her lips as yet another small spurt grew both girls even larger. Resting her hands on Nel's huge, delectable breasts, Clare inched down to claim her prize...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>People ran through the street. Some having to abandon their cars and take to their heels to escape the enormous obstruction. Others had to remain inside their offices and department store because a wall of flesh obstructed the exits. Others still sought refuge on the rooftops of these buildings and attempted to cross from rooftop to rooftop, affording a view of the scene, where others could only, perhaps, distinguish an immense buttock or foot as the attempted to skirt around it. Some brave individuals sought to, or where forced to, clamber over the sward of blue hair now lying across the breadth of street to get to the other side, still others nervously navigated around the trunk of a huge white arm. The whole impression was accompanied by the sound of crunching asphalt and concrete. Even as they escaped the commotion, people knew that the problem was only getting bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the equally huge Nel pinned beneath her, clamped between her leg, Clare grinned down at the street. With her wet lips parted, Clare\u2019s anticipation mounted and she could not help but drool down onto the crevasse where Nel\u2019s breasts met and the creamy mountains that this crevasse unfolded into. Clare rose up, her excitement having got the better of her, still pinning Nel\u2019s body beneath her ass and hips, and drew her hand across her mouth, wiping away the rivers of lust. Clare briefly took the opportunity to look about her, not so much shocked as she was pleased by the buildings grazing the soft flesh of her upper arms - to think that little potions could have done such big things to her and to Nel! She was increasingly, as she became taller, thrilled by the notion of the human city in comparison to herself and Nel. What filled her up with enjoyment was the complete reversal of roles: where human\u2019s were much larger than pixies and where to be avoided, now Clare and Nel were ever so much larger than humans and their bustling metropolis was their playground. Pixies, by and large, with no pun intended, knew little of humans or their culture and this inspired in Clare a childlike wonder and abandon, which served only to terrorise the city and its inhabitants! Clare felt a shudder pass up her spine and was first confused, but soon realised she had had another \u2018little\u2019 growth spurt and that the buildings were soon lying just that little bit lower on her - just what she needed! Clare heaved her bosom and buzzed her gigantic wings with delight. She turned her lusty gaze back to Nel, blue-haired, huge and bosomy, contoured by rubble, and she cocked her head and grinned mischievously again. As she bore down again  on the giant form of the supine Nel, Clare found herself drawing deeper and deeper breaths, panting increasingly heavily, with her gigantic bust swelling larger and larger as it impended on Nel\u2019s like an approaching moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel had taken the chance, in momentary lapse of Clare\u2019s attentions, to gather together her wits after having grown so big and after Clare\u2019s advances. The weight of Clare on top of her kept her clamped to the ground; Nel turned her head to look about her, seeing only the smoke and the dark forms of people flitting by her green eyes, so small compared to her huge face. Nel was aware of her view darkening and she soon realised that the dark pillar of Clare, as she appeared silhouetted against the sun, was leaning back in, bearing down on top of her, her huge tawny head blocking out Nel\u2019s view the sky. Barely thinking, Nel brought up her hands in front of her; Clare, as she came down, found her breasts meeting with resistance, the resistance of Nel\u2019s huge and long hands. Nel saw Clare smile coyly, as the soft, warm flesh of her massive breasts bulged around Nel\u2019s fingers, and arch an eyebrow. Nel attempted to push Clare back, but the wall of her bosom yielded, Clare\u2019s weight bearing down pushed it down and down, little by little. Clare, tired of what she construed as foreplay and not wishing to be denied any longer, wrapped her own fingers around Nel\u2019s wrists and pulled them out from under herself, letting her huge bosom bounce free, and slowly lowered her chest to meet with Nel\u2019s. Clare breathed a relief sigh, while Nel tensed under the weight. \u2018Much better\u2019, breathed Clare, deeply. Biting her lip, Clare deftly pinned Nel\u2019s arms to the ground behind her, Nel tried to object, but Clare immediately locked them shut with her own, stifling Nel\u2019s objections. \u2018Grrrt orfff!\u2019, Nel grunted as she attempted to rise. But Clare was too heavy, having, Nel suspected, grown a bit bigger again; she now had a fractional edge of Nel, above having seemingly acclimatised to being gigantic much more quickly than Nel. Instead of listening, Clare chose to squash Nel\u2019s objections with her height advantage and, with her knees propelling her forward, swaddled Nel\u2019s face in the flesh of her immense chest. Nel\u2019s found herself muffled by Clare again; she struggled against Clare\u2019s weight and her own conflicted feeling. This felt so good - this growing and humping! She had only dreamed of actually being this big! But she knew that there was no doubt Clare was becoming a big problem, and that she was getting increasingly out of control. Clare enjoyed being big even more than Nel, perhaps too much.  Even though it was initially Nel who wanted to be the big one, Nel hadn\u2019t even had a proper chance to ENJOY being so big because Clare had become such a size-queen. Although Nel had initially wanted to outgrow Clare, to maybe put her in her place a little, this had spiralled out of her control. Clare was becoming more of a bully the bigger she became and was prepared to use her size to get her way! Clare just kept spurting up! Maybe all this amorous activity was great, but what would happen if, as seemed likely, Clare got bigger? Nel, being the only creature nearly as big as Clare, could only just about struggle against her since she had grown that fraction more. Clare was soft enough just now, but what if she chose to play rough? If Clare grew drastically again, she could have her way with Nel and there was little Nel could do to stop her. And what would become of the city and Nel if Clare \u2018outgrew\u2019 them, outgrew the satisfaction they could give her? And though she could not see or breath properly for moist flesh, Nel could feel Clare\u2019s weight around her stomach beginning to undulate and press down, to clamp her sides for firmly - if she could not get out from under this embrace, Clare would surely hump her into the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare drew back from Nel\u2019s lips and breathed a moist breath onto her face. Biting her lip again, Clare hefted herself upwards to readjust her hips, before the inevitable plunge down. Nel, gasping for breath, and although her arms were pinned, seized the moment with a rekindled vigour and brought her knees up under Clare. Clare\u2019s eyes widened, but was too shocked to react properly to Nel\u2019s huge legs being suddenly under her. Nel strained and grunted to bear Clare upwards and pushed her feet upwards. \u2018I said... GET OFF!\u2019, Nel boomed, as she kicked Clare\u2019s huge frame back from her and off of her body. Clare\u2019s surprise and Nel\u2019s conviction sent Clare tumbling backwards over the line of the buildings and from Nel\u2019s immediate sight. Nel, sweating profusely from her exertion, heard Clare\u2019s massive body thundering across the streets as she rolled across them, crunching against the roofs of buildings. Nel, feeling not unlike a huge, bruised orange, brought her arms up and hefted herself up from the Nel-shaped crater Clare had pressed her into, using the sidelining buildings. As she rose, more people ran and screamed. She caught a glimpse of her enormous self in the windows of one building; behind the image of herself she saw people dashing around inside. She frowned around at the rubble that had fallen into the street and the occasionally tattered structures about her, caused by generous growing and amorous horseplay. \u2018Well don\u2019t look at me!\u2019, Nel huffed, \u2018these things are really fragile!\u2019.\u2018It isn\u2019t my fault I\u2019m such a big girl\u2019, She looked down at the craters where Clare had planted her colossal knees and then, across on the other street, at the Clare-shaped crater. As she said this, she pulled herself upright, staggering with booming footfalls as she rose to her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel swooned with vertigo; she hadn\u2019t actually been able to stand up since her last radical growth spurt, she had become so big and ungainly so fast. As she caught her bearings, Nel was a aware of a sound, a high-pitched sound, coming from somewhere. It took a moment of casting about her, which only made the sound worse, to realise where it was coming from. Nel saw, as her blue locks twirled with her head\u2019s searching, a small figure clinging to a strand of hair, out of the corner of her eye. As delicately as she could, Nel ran her fingers through her hair, to remove the little person. Nel squinted at the little woman between her fingertips for a moment, before, as carefully as she could, stooping to place the woman on a building at thigh-level, which Nel could easily reach. Nel, straightened up again, and stretched; she was still quite tender from all that growing and wrestling. Nel frowned with discomfort and waggled her enormous ass in an attempt to shake loose the bits of street that had become clogged in her butt-crack. Nel stood tall with her knees together, massaging her wrists where Clare had gripped them, looking about for Clare\u2019s landing site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust clouds were still settling in a block where Clare had landed. From with them came a pained groan. As they resolved, Nel saw the outline of Clare\u2019s body contorted against the rubble and buildings, but in time it twisted and struggled to rise. Clare\u2019s huge shoulders and head came up from the sea of clouds, her body had a few scratches and a bruise was beginning to form on her left cheek. The huge, now sexually-frustrated, Clare stood for a while heaving deep breaths that sounded like thunder; her eye twitched...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carefully Nel approached Clare, her steps still unsure from the dizziness and her attempt to avoid further damage to the human city. Nel's sinuous lips formed a smile. It was almost ridiculous, the human settlements had been vast towering mountains and extremely dangerous for her, her whole life - and now she was tiptoeing through less than tiny streets, trying to save the now-fragile constructs humans called their houses. She was now almost being too big to worry about the damage she was causing below -- the occasional car she'd kick by accident or tree she'd knock down -- but she was careful to avoid the people who ran out into her path. <br>\r\nI\u2019m huge! Finally I\u2019m huge!, Nel thought. Now getting precious seconds to relish her own growth and size. But her job wasn\u2019t done yet, she reminded herself and focused on Clare again. The blond Pixie stood straight and still in the crater her own massive impact had created. The dust cloud was still rising and almost mighty enough to obscure Clare\u2019s colossal frame. While Nel was approaching the cloud expanded, covering Clare more and more every second. Even bruised Clare was a sight to behold. Secretly Nel had to admit, the view of Clare was absolutely majestic. She was beautiful, from the sinewy working of her muscles, to the sinusoidal curve of her hips, to the welcoming swell of her awe-inspiring ass. The alabaster white abundance of her colossal breasts - those gigantic tear-drop globes - drew Nel\u2019s eyes, swaying gently as Clare breathed heavily. It almost seemed like they were still gradually puffing larger.<br>\r\nNel\u2019s wonderful eyes widened in fear, could this possibly be true. \u201cNo!\u201d, she whispered as softly as a being of her massive size could. Before she could proof here terrible suspicion the dust cloud fully engulfed Clare, depriving Nel of clear sight. Nel stopped, the cloud finally had stopped expanding, but there was no sign of Clare. <br>\r\n\u201cClare? Are you alright?\u201d, Nel asked, but no one answered. Now Nel realized how noisy the fleeing humans were. Their mechanic carts created a cacophony of disturbing noises and screams and shouts were audible even at her current size. But all those noises were drowned out, when Nel heard a familiar, deep and lust filled moan from the centre of the cloud. Suddenly Clare\u2019s blonde hair was visible again, steadily rising above the dust cloud. Shocked Nel heard the noise of splintering human building materials \u2013 concrete, steel and stone, the shattering of glass and the stressed groan of the ground itself, burdened to carry an increasingly enormous weight. Like a volcano from the ocean Clare rose over the cloud, her beautiful, colossal body started eclipse the cloud and cast it\u2019s shadow over Nel and the fleeing humans and their structures. A minute ago, Clare had to stand on her tip-toes and her head hadn\u2019t passed the cloud. Now, the cloud was about even with the underside of her ample bosom. Nel\u2019s eyes widened in terror when she saw the lust burn in Clare\u2019s emerald green eyes. This growth spurt was far from being over. Clare was growing even faster now. Her torso had eclipsed the smoke by now, and the blonde behemoth was getting bigger by the second. <br>\r\nClare grinned impish: \"That's better,\" she said. \"I get my way, because I'm the biggest.\"<br>\r\nNow, her legs were longer than the smoke cloud was high. She had to be at least two hundred feet tall! It gave her an idea. Carefully she bent down and grabbed something from below. Grinning triumphantly she rose again. Nel saw that Clare had picked up one of the giant smoke stacks from one of the large factories around her. Clare\u2019s unintended \u2018flight\u2019 had taken her to the industrial area. Even a behemoth of her size had been dwarfed by most of the large buildings\u2026 well, five minutes ago at least. Unable to move Nel watched Clare mustering her discovery. <br>\r\n\u201cIt has the perfect size!\u201d, Clare moaned.<br>\r\nThen she looked down, peering over her spectacular breasts, smiling down at the \u2018tiny\u2019 Nel below her, who was completely engulfed by Clare\u2019s shadow.<br>\r\n\"Pardon me,\" she said, \u201cbut you were unwilling to help your old friend Clare.<br>\r\nThen the blonde pixie spread her endless-long legs wide open and inserted the smokestack inside herself. It disappeared most of the way in.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" she cried out as she rubbed it back and forth. Her gigantic breasts heaved with her quickening breath. She continued to grow bigger, now nearing three hundred feet tall sitting down! Clare breathing was getting faster, her cries louder, as she approached orgasm. Her incredibly beautiful body was growing quickly now, that Nel was starting to fear the whole town would soon be crushed under a giant Clare. The smokestack was starting to feel puny to Clare, but she was way too worked up to stop now. Suddenly, she screamed so loudly it could be heard for miles. She threw her head back and arched her back, sending her long, golden hair cascading down in endless glimmering waves, her upright breasts literally seemed like luscious mountains made of alabaster. The peaks of this ample mountain ridge were crowned by her delicate, pink nubs, which proudly erected stood on these wondrous orbs, like small towers.<br>\r\nHer orgasm lasted for close to two minutes. Finally, with a lusty moan, Clare came down from it. The giant pixie removed the smokestack and tossed it away carelessly. With a pleased smile she looked around. To her own disappointment, she had finally stopped growing.<br>\r\nThen, slowly, she stood up. She looked down at the tiny people below. She cast a giant shadow over the whole industrial district and poor Nel. Clare joyfully realized that she could see for miles. She was even bigger, than before. Smiling she turned on her toes - effortlessly grinding everything beneath them to dust \u2013 and faced the midday sun, which was bathing her gargantuan body in golden light. The dust cloud, once high enough to engulf her, now didn\u2019t even reach her knees.<br>\r\nBelow Clare stood Nel, still shocked by her friends growth spurt. There was nothing to use for reference, but Nel estimated Clare was somewhere in the area of six hundred feet tall. Clare had been a bruised giant pixie, but had arisen from the crater of her impact as something\u2026 more. Giant pixie was no longer fitting, because Nel was also described by this term but completely dwarfed by Clare. She had been able to make Clare stagger and thrown her down, but Clare had ascended from the \u2018ashes\u2019 of her downfall and returned even more powerful -Clare had turned from a behemoth to a leviathan.<br>\r\n\u201cHow I\u2019m going to stop her now?\u201d, Nel muttered.<br>\r\nClare \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 just smiled a mischievous smile. With her sinuous dark red lips she kissed the index finger and middle finger of her right hand. <br>\r\n\"Make me grow,\" she boomed with her mighty voice, still. She spread her massive legs and reached her huge hand down toward her crotch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her place in the street, Nel could only look up at the towering form before her now, casting a shadow over Nel and the city streets, appreciably reducing the temperature. Blood was pumping in Nel\u2019s ears and all she could hear was the screams and commotion from the street below and the buildings lining the street, dulled, as if by wads of cotton wool, by the ringing in her ears. In what seemed like only a few moments, Clare had gone from Nel\u2019s size, formidable enough to struggle to fit through tight city streets, for rooftops to graze her calves as she walked and to struggle to see the little people swarming beneath her feet, to, frankly, monstrously huge, now towering over rooftops and sizzling pylons at her feet, her legs taller than many buildings as she straddled whole neighbourhoods and could probably only dimly see the people thronging through the city streets or the doll-like Nel amongst the buildings. Clare\u2019s body rumbled reluctantly to a halt; as it did so Nel saw Clare clasps and heft her enormous chest, weighing it in her palms. Nel imagined an impressed look across Clare\u2019s face, imagined because Clare was tall enough now that her face was difficult to make out, eclipsed, even to Nel, by the monumental thrust of her bosom, bulging out before her like small, warm moons. The people of the city became conscious though, even though they could not see the face of the much bigger Clare, of a low rumbling sound, like thunder, beginning to brew, grow and come faster and higher, conscious that it emanated from the several-hundred foot pixie and passed through the ground, while it soon came to Nel, kneeling in the street, and her much larger ears, that Clare, no doubt delighted with the results of her latest growth spurt and bursting with glee at how she loomed over the city, was laughing menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel started to climb to her feet, reaching out a hand to heave herself up on a nearby building. There was a sinking feeling in Nel\u2019s stomach and her head was swimming, partly from her increased altitude and partly from Clare\u2019s situation, which had radically worsened from Nel\u2019s perspective. She had barely had the time to adjust to her own new height when Clare suddenly changed the game again by sprouting up! Was there no stopping this girl!? Her body just kept growing and growing! And Nel, tall though she was, much taller than she would ever have thought possible, could not keep up with Clare. There was something like fear beginning to talk a hold on Nel, for the disparity in size between herself and Clare was such now that Clare was very much in charge now and it was just possible that Clare did not appreciate Nel\u2019s having hurled across several city blocks. Nel stumbled a bit in the street, her foot accidentally crushing a car abandoned by a lamppost. Nel muttered an apology and scraped the vehicle from her foot, holding onto the building. Looking up at Clare again, still somewhat in awe of her own body and rumbling with rather self-congratulatory laughter, Nel\u2019s mind worked furiously over her options: fight or flight? Usually when you yourself are larger than an elephant and taller than most trees the latter is not normally your first port of call. But when an elephant is little more than a mouse and an oak tree is little more than a weed to your antagonist this starts to make a great deal of sense, particularly when you are just big enough to be unable to hide from her. With this in mind, Nel turned and attempted to retreat through the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nel found herself to be just too big to navigate the city streets with ease. Nel wished desperately that her wings could carry her, but they too were unused to her new weight, huge and diaphanous though they were, like sheets of powerful, latticed glass. Nel was soon distressed further to find that she had to basically sidle and shimmy between the buildings on either side of the street. She found herself cursing the ripe and fat peach into which her buttocks and hips had broadened as she became wedged time and time again. Nel was finding herself too tall, or perhaps curvy, to walk through the streets with ease, but, ironically, not big enough to stride across the rooftops, from street to street, as Clare now could. Turning a particularly tight corner, Nel became wedged again, her large chest squashed against one building and the cheeks of her rump pressed against another. They plainly didn\u2019t design this city with the plus-sized girl in mind, fumed Nel to herself. She was working herself free, just thinking that a growth spurt right about now would really help her pop out of this bind, when she felt a shadow pass over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked up as best she could to see a grinning Clare looming above her again; having cleared many city sectors in just a few strides, Clare was standing, busty and resplendent, bent down the better to see Nel with her enormous hands placed on her hips, her gigantic breasts hanging and wobbling, grazing the rooftops, each seeming to Nel, who found their pendulous gait somewhat hypnotic, like some colossal and overripe fruit. \u201c<b>WELL, WELL, WELL, NEL</b>!\u201d, boomed Clare, surprising even herself with the loudness and depth of her voice, \u201cYou seem to have a BIG problem!\u201d Nel struggled to free herself as best she could, ignoring Clare\u2019s taunt. Clare, still grinning, thunder: \u201cHere! Let me give you a <b>LITTLE HAND</b>!\u201d Reaching forward, but still inclined, Clare pinched Nel by the wings and, with only a moment of resistance, plucked the smaller pixie free of the street. But Clare did not deposit Nel on the street again; instead, Nel found herself, dangling from Clare\u2019s huge fingers, going up and up, as Clare straightened up and brought Nel with her. Nel, dangling like an apple before Clare\u2019s face, twisted back and forth in pain and discomfort, but was unable to thrash free on Clare\u2019s grip. Clare beamed at Nel suspended before her eyes. Clare licked her lips, \u201cNow\u201d, Clare thundered, \u201cwhere\u2019s that kiss!?\u201d Leaning in, Clare planted a kiss on Nel\u2019s body; Nel felt the huge warm lips wrap around her for just a moment, like huge, wet blankets. Nel sputtered and struggled, while Clare smacked her lips. Clare continued: \u201cAww, that\u2019s no way to treat the girl who helped you out!\u201d Clare looked around and went on, \u201cNow I know that you rejected my advances Nellie\u2026and quite rudely I might add!\u201d Here Clare took another glance down the length of her frame: \u201cBut, I have to say, I really appreciate the little growth spurt you gave me! I can\u2019t stay mad at you Nellie, not when you made me so big!\u201d For a nightmare second it crossed Nel\u2019s mind that Clare might still be harbouring amorous intentions towards her, and, now quite a bit bigger, Nel would not be in quite the same position to refuse. But Clare grinned again and boomed \u201cAll the same Nellie, love your little butt-cheeks though I do, I\u2019m sorry to say that I might have\u2026\u201d, here Clare swelled her chest and looked down at herself again, \u201c<b>OUTGROWN</b> you!\u201d Nel was starting to feel sick from swinging back and forth over the chasm of Clare\u2019s cleavage. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Nel, but you\u2019re just too itty-bitty for me; I like a girl I can really hold on to!\u201d Clare was now looking around the city now \u201cAnd there\u2019s so many big toys for this big girl in this city.\u201d Suddenly Clare snapped her attentions back to Nel and piped: \u201c<b>CIAO, BELLA!</b>\u201d, pecked another kiss onto Nel before wheeling around and hurling Nel across the city\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel\u2019s world swam back into view as a jumble of colour and sound, a glowing pool of light. Nel\u2019s body ached, she could hear sirens wailing all about her, feel her body lying on sharp rubble and her body and hair were sopping wet with something. It was all Nel could do to lift a hand before her blurry eyes; she seemed to have landed in a puddle of electric-blue slime, lying like a film across her body, which trickled from her hand before Nel\u2019s head sank backwards and she lost consciousness again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it transpired, as was more apparent to some of the city\u2019s inhabitants than it was to either Nel or Clare, Clare had managed to throw Nel for some distance, but Nel had come to a stop, as she flew over the rooftops, on the city\u2019s nuclear power plant. In fact, Clare had unwittingly and carelessly sent Nel spiralling straight onto the power plant\u2019s reactor and its nuclear pile. Nel\u2019s form had ploughed into the structure as she fell, her huge rear making short work of the foundations, her long leg catching a smokestack and the rest of her pulverising the reactor as she fell. Now Nel lay recumbent amongst devastation, as the nuclear materials seeped from the plant like a melting glacier. Alarms immediately began to sound and the employees not trapped by Nel\u2019s unconscious form began to evacuate in droves. Meanwhile Nel\u2019s huge, bruised body lay outstretched in a veritable soup of radioactive slime from the reactor, soaking her hair and covering her body, her legs protruding from the power plant\u2019s main facade. Nel had briefly come to in the power-plant, but had felt so sick and in pain that she\u2019d fallen unconscious once more, sopping back into the bath of electric-blue slime. Braced for the worst, the power plant and the neighbouring buildings were evacuating, feeling the nuclear fallout which was now gushing out of the ruined structure, which all the while drenched Nel\u2019s giant, unconscious form, wave after wave. Little is known about the effects of radiation on magical creatures such as pixies, but what is certain is that those glancing back from the cars and trucks driving away from the power plant at breakneck speed could see, amidst the smoke, the sirens and blue glowing light, two huge, white legs starting to creep more and more out of the power plant and stretch across the confines of the plant like two coursing trains...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clare wiped her hand across her mouth and burped richly, the sound rattling the canted slates of nearby houses. Following her elegant vanquishing of Nel with a sleight of hand Clare had felt she ought to treat herself, and, besides, who was going to tell Clare that she couldn\u2019t? Or tell her that she ought to watch her weight? Watch her weight!? Watch my weight pound you flat you little twerp! Clare, having roamed and explored the city for some time, had come across an ice cream factory! Heedless of the panic amongst the workers suddenly erupting beneath her feet, swirling about her feet like ants, Clare stepped into the factory compound with deliberate inelegance, her huge foot thumping down, heaving up the tarmac. Affecting coyness, Clare broke open the nearest factory, discarding the chunk of masonry in her hand over her shoulder. Reaching in, her tongue licking her lips and the tucked into a corner of her mouth and she rooted, and with only momentary resistance, Clare managed to remove one of the massive mixing-vats of ice cream from the factory. Raiding the vat to her mouth, Clare\u2019s lick at its contents, running her huge tongue into and around the vat, scooping out the soft ice cream. Clare, when she was done, tossed the vat over her shoulder and reached into the factory to extricate another and did as before, before tossing this vat too over her shoulder. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis scene continued in this fashion for some while, the enormous pixie plucking vat after vat from not only this but neighbouring buildings, freezing warehouses perhaps, positively gorging herself on ice cream, and the workers and authorities, who swarmed about her feet or buzzed about her head, could do nothing but watch, powerless to stop her. So absorbed was Clare in this little treat for herself that she had remained basically obvious as sirens and hysteria began to go up on the far-flung outskirts of the city, out by the city\u2019s nuclear facility. It was some while before Clare wiped her mouth, as best she could, for it was still sticky, and let out a sky-shattering belch, which seemed to shake the world around her. Clare beamed and looked around her, suddenly conscious of a wailing, droning noise from somewhere, above the sirens which followed her wherever she went. Clare furrowed her brow as she cast about, before her huge stature allowed her to see, far out over the city, a rising column of black smoke, coiling in the wind. Her curiosity starting to be piqued, Clare absent-mindedly discarded another steel vat, which plummeted and crashed through the roof a nearby structure, as she started towards the source of the commotion, her immense legs carrying her swiftly across the rooftops and city streets. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs a consequence, it was not long before Clare stood on the verge of the city-centre, standing by the river\u2019s banks. From the offices of the many-tiered, glass-fronted buildings that lined the riverfront, the amber light of the evening was blotted out by the massive, cloven orb of Clare\u2019s rear, which wobbled threateningly as Clare crane and shifted her weight to see across the city. Indeed, the screams of those quaking under decks inside redoubled when Clare inclined herself forwards, her hands resting on her knees, partly in an attempt to alleviate the stress of holding up such a monstrous bosom, and the cheeks of her huge ass pitched towards the glass, cracking the panes as it pressed, softly against the structure. As she craned, Clare could not help but catch sight, when she inclined herself and the prominent thrust of her gigantic chest no longer blocked her view of anything beneath her, of her reflection in the still, honey-coloured water of the river, and. Furthermore, could not help but marvel for a moment at her own immensity. But this lasted only a moment for there soon came, from the direction of the smoke and sirens, an immense boom. Clare\u2019s attention snapped back to the commotion, her chest bouncing agitatedly. Clare forded the river in a single step, her glance resting for a second on the bridge stretching across the water and laughed a little to herself to think how her weight would break it as if it were made of twigs. Standing on her tip-toes Clare shaded her eyes (being this tall did have its drawbacks) and attempted to see what was causing such an uproar. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThrough the flashing lights and smoke, Clare could see a power plant of some description. Gouts of flame were pouring from the structure though, bluish in quality as if from a gas burner. And as Clare strode closer, still craning to see (if only she were a whole lot bigger!), she saw what looked like an unfolding avalanche flowing from the power plant, or perhaps foam billowing out from the windows, doors and apertures in the building. At this distance, tall though she was, Clare took this, so she reasoned after a moment, for whatever the fire brigade has sprayed to dowse the flames. But in such great quantities!? No, surely not. For, even now, as Clare took another step closer, squashing several vehicles in the process, the milky white masses poured from the power-plant, seeming to stretch the broken foundations. In fact, such was the pressure of this white mass that there now began to erupt from the roof of power plant, not far from one of the cracked smokestacks, a great, white dome and then, soon afterwards, another nearby, both of which seemed to swell up from the building like two giant boiled eggs or a quantity of milk boiling over. But as Clare tried to properly discern the scene unfolding at the power plant, her vision was temporarily occluded by a drifting veil of low cloud. Clare furrowed her brows and swept with one huge hand at the mist before her, another drawback to being so large that she had not anticipated. It did occur to Clare, though, for a moment, that it was strange that the citizens were more preoccupied with the power plant than with the several-hundred foot tall pixie in their midst! She, towering over the rooftops, seemed like no more than another bystander; for pixies, for all their knowledge of the world of magical arcana, had had next to no exposure to the world and nuclear secrets of the atomic age. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAttempting to brush aside the cloud before her eyes, Clare heard, from the direction of the power plant, an eruption, booming above the sirens and wails from the city. Clare tried to extricate herself from the mist, but as she lifted her leg, a squat building, which, granted, she may not have seen in either case given the prodigious girth of her chest, caused her to stub her toe. Reeling with pain, but conscious that losing her head might cause her to topple, Clare winced and gritted her teeth as she held her foot, balanced precariously on one, monolithic leg. It was some time still before the mist began to clear from about her head, during which Clare could nought but hear the dampened uproar from the power plant and strain her eyes to distinguish anything of her surroundings. As the cloud drifted across the city, trailing from Clare\u2019s head as it might from a mountainside, leaving her hair damp with dew like the grasses on Alpine slopes, and her vision began to return to her, Clare could soon distinguish, dimly and in grey shadows, the scene unfolding at the power plant. She was conscious of movement, a form she could not make sense of, as if gushing from the plant, perhaps the white foam from moments before? She could discern also colours coming through the vapours, the red flashes of lights, an eerie sea-green glow suffusing the ruins and, just for a moment, a vibrant efflorescence of blue. And Clare could hear the most terrible cracking and rumbling, as if the earth were breaking asunder, and fancied she could feel tremblings through the soles of her feet. Indeed, as Clare squinted and waved to disperse the remaining mist, she could discern the shadowy outline of something mushrooming up and up, as if a mountain range were piercing through the earth\u2019s crust! So violent was this impression that it soon became hard for Clare to tell if it were not a trick of the eye and she soon reasoned that it had been a gigantic plume of smoke sent up from the plant. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut as the mists finally cleared, and Clare\u2019s vision no longer impaired, it was as if scales had fallen from her huge, green eyes, which widened in horror as the scene before her coalesced, as if forming out of the cloud. Before Clare there rose, magnificent and white, a pair of huge legs that seemed to be stretching up towards the heavens, which splayed so that the knees formed cloud-capped mountain summits and there yawned between these huge mountains a deep and reddish chasm, crested with a steaming forest of blue hair. Clare stood frozen before this spectacle, gazing as a weary traveller might before the mouth of hell gaping before them. Clare noticed the eerie glow of the skin as her eyes travelled over the recumbent form. To Clare\u2019s mounting horror, the huge form began to stir and let out a groan, as one might awakening from a deep slumber. There hoved into view, over the chasm and the mound, a titanic torso, folding upwards like a chalk cliffside. Soon thereafter, as anyone could now predict, there throbbed into view, now starting to be veiled by cloud, the gigantic teardrops of two breasts, which swung and slapped together suddenly with a booming thunderclap. Clare could now discern, backwards in the clouds, the huge, rounded shoulders and obelisk-like arms supporting this tremendous form in the effort to sit up. The moment Clare knew was coming, but nonetheless dreaded, for she had immediately drawn the correct conclusion, came when the figure was sitting up and for a moment the head was obscured from view. But soon the monstrous figure\u2019s breathing dispersed the clouds about its face, or maybe drew them in greedily, revealing the huge, heart-shaped face of a gigantic Nel...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\"><br>\r\nEven though her own monumental size was minuscule compared to Nel\u2019s gargantuan body, Clare was pretty sure, the blue-haired behemoth of a pixie would spot her with ease. Taking into consideration that she had treated Nel in a rather despicable way before, Clare was pretty sure it would be wise to escape her towering rivals\u2019 gaze. At the moment Nel\u2019s bright eyes were half-closed, her angelic face, which was filling the heavens, blushed. The earth trembled violently when the behemoth-pixie moaned deeply, buildings collapsed as the ground shook violently. Unaware of the destruction a mere moan of her caused, gigantic Nel\u2019s hands started almost absently stroking the exposed tops of her monumental breasts, working up and down the long line of her cleavage. Almost mesmerized Clare\u2019s gaze followed the workings of Nel's fingertips. Her titanic rival pinched, rolled and kneaded the literal mountains of cleavage. Despite the mix of fear, awe and eny Clare experienced, she had to admit she loved the moments when Nel would open her hands, and Clare could watch Nel\u2019s firm flesh spring back to its natural position, bouncing with a healthy, youthful suppleness. <br>\r\nHer moans intensified, causing more tremors and quakes. The succulent orbs of Nel\u2019s enormous breasts bounced and swayed with her every movement, her enormous body twitched and shuddered, clearly experiencing waves of pleasure. Only now Clare realised what was happening. Even without direct stimulation of the wet chasm of her womanhood the waves of after-growth pleasure were strong enough to get Nel off, even by \u2018mere\u2019 breast stimulation. There was a rapid contraction of Nel\u2019s inner muscles and then Clare -and the whole city - felt her cum. A torrent of the blue-haired pixies sweet juices spilled out to coat the comparatively miniature-sized city beneath her, drenching the area between her pale, velvet thighs almost flooding the remains of the buildings under her womanhood and firm butt. Far from running out of steam, the still sitting Nel leaned back, her mighty back flattening the remains of the warehouses and parts of forest behind her, slowly she raised her hips the best she could \u2013 Clare was realising that Nel was thrusting her hips high into the air in an effort to make her tender parts more accessible -her mighty legs effortlessly ploughing through buildings and deep into the ground. <br>\r\nIn awe Clare starred at Nel\u2019s right foot, which was now very close to her vantage point. She was no longer able to see Nel\u2019s face, which was now hidden by the mountainlike-globes resting on the behemoth\u2019s chest. Still using one hand to caress them, Nel drew the tip of her other index finger smoothly down against the dew-soaked line of her outer lips. She twirled for a moment around the edges, causing her titanic form to wriggle in pleasure, then all at once she plunged two fingers into the steaming wetness of her pussy. Her moans and howls became even louder.<br>\r\nFinally, Clare decided now would be a good moment to act. After all Nel was distracted. Ignoring the danger, the gargantuan pixie\u2019s massive, out-of-control body posed she surged forward. The same moment Nel pressed the tips of her fingers hard against her g-spot. Another orgasm shot through her like a bolt of lightning, howling at the top of her voice she let her hips drop down again with the force of an impacting meteorite. Her mighty legs came up and were crashing down again on either side of the smaller giantess, missing her by the slimmest of margins. The last vestiges of Nel\u2019s self-restraint were gone. Clare felt herself being losing balance, stumbling between more or less collapsed buildings, the irresistible force of her giant rivals\u2019 ecstasy throwing her around as if she was nothing more than a leave in a thunderstorm. By now she had lost count of the number of times, Nel had come. The blue-haired behemoth pulsing, streaming out, coming repeatedly. So, Clare suspected that Nel might be in the midst of one long, overpowering orgasm and Not just having multiple orgasms, but having multiple orgasms simultaneously. Suddenly she was hit by Nel\u2019s right leg with incredible force and lifted of the ground. Her world spun violently, split-seconds later she blacked out..<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

There was softness and warmth here, but the brightness of the light hurts her eyes, so she closed them again. She had no clue where she was, where she had been, what time it was, or anything else. The impact had quite profoundly disorientated her, even colossal Nel had completely slipped from her mind. She was waking up in an unknown place somewhere and that was never a good sign. There were faint city sounds, human city sounds, and she believed she could feel a breeze on her legs, while something sticky coated her butt, back, shoulders and even her face. Only slowly she regained her body sensation, but as her senses slowly returned, they came with it a strangely soothing warmth, where her body was touched or had been drenched in the strange glowing material, moving from the points of contact, slowly spreading, becoming more and more intense. Clare felt a strange tingling in her lower back, which quickly spread up her spine and into her neck. Within a few seconds the fallen pixie\u2019s whole body was filled with this odd sensation. The tingling transformed into caressing warmth, finally eradicating every thought to stand up or assess the situation more thoroughly. Enjoying the warmth filling every fibre of her body, the golden-haired pixie revelled in the strange sensation, embracing its gentle touch. Finally, it filled every inch of her body, from the tips of her toes to the top of her head, and absolutely every place in between. Clare moaned involuntarily, when the warmth suddenly intensified to heat, replacing the former warmth with fresh surges of even more pleasing tingling through her body. The heat felt immeasurably great, but it was even surpassed by the building heat within her loins.<br>\r\nArousal overwhelmed the fallen pixie and she almost casually fondled her huge breasts in her hands; enjoying the waves of pleasure her own touch brought her, magnified by the strange heat. Sensually she massaged her large breasts, not noticing that her body started to swell larger. Clare had always been fond of her own breasts \u2013 although they seemed even larger than usual, a fact she didn\u2019t want to second guess right now, but she was getting surprisingly excited by her breast fondling even more than usual. All though the questions where she actually was and what has happened still were a nagging thoughts in a corner of Clare\u2019s mind she found that she had no way to stop touching herself she had already gotten too carried away. Her sopping wet womanhood was aching for attention and she was very tempted to satisfy it, ignoring the increasingly more muffled voice in her head, which was telling her this wasn\u2019t the time. Aching her back and straightening her endlessly long legs, she reached her left hand towards the glistening folds of her womanhood. Tenderly, she stroked her cleft, moving in a slow circle, urging own juices juices to flow. Whatever the blue slime was, it seemed to have super-charged Clare's libido. After all, the blonde pixie had barely touched herself, and already she was practically dripping. She gasped with pleasure. It just felt so incredibly good\u2026 She was so lost in ecstasy, she didn\u2019t even notice, she was starting to grow.<br>\r\nWhile the question where she actually was, was no longer relevant for Clare, the humans working in the powerplant, which had out of the blue been hit by a several hundred feet tall pixie naturally had quite a different opinion. Most of them had starred at a tv, smartphone or computer screen, watching the broadcast about the gigantic naked women, who had suddenly appeared in the city and caused havoc, especially when one of them had hit the powerplant in the closer outskirts and grown to a mountain-dwarfing size, when the other one had hit the ground next to the plant, like a falling star. Digging deep into the ground, the blonde behemoth had ploughed through the parking lot and outer areas straight into the main reactor core. The few remaining security cameras in the reactor area transmitted pictures, which defied every rational belief. Undaunted by heat and radiation the sleeping beauty had rested there. Unnoticed by Clare, workers and engineers were fleeing from her towering form, shutting down most of the plant in a hurry. The foreman of the emergency team was admirably calm as he followed the shutdown-procedure, his darted his eyes forward and back from his screen to the security footage were saw her body filling the space from the front of the first to almost the back of the fourth reactor chamber! He closed his eyes, shook his head and looked again. Things did not get more rational. Well, if a giant beauty falling from the sky could be counted as rational\u2026 In fact; he could actually see her growing. And there was some kind of blue glow around her that had nothing to do with her half-closed sapphire eyes or the strange wings on her back. His jaw dropped as he could actually see her growing taller again. He had to finish and get out of here\u2026 fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Clare had realised that she was swelling larger and savoured it. Her body was expanding in every direction, her athletic, perfectly-shaped dancer\u2019s legs elongating at an incredible rate. She could feel her perfect, full teardrop-shaped breasts pushing further out, expanding against the skin of her also growing hand. Her already overstimulated body wriggled in the grasp of ecstatic pleasure \u2013 amplified by pure, unadulterated growth. Her already gargantuan body swelled continuously larger with increasing speed. Every, not already outmatched, part of the plant was overwhelmed, by Clare\u2019s alabaster-white skinned flesh. Concrete walls and steel girders groaned, bent, and crumbled beneath her weight. Clare\u2019s moans became deeper, more guttural. The waves of pleasure surpassed even those she had felt, when she had experienced her first incredible growth spurts, when she had grown from a tall pixie to a fifty feet tall giantess\u2026 if this growth spurt was proportionally as potent, even the sky was no real limited, considering her starting height of hundreds of feet compared to her meagre 1\u20197\u201d this morning\u2026<br>\r\nWhich each moan Clare inflated a couple feet. Her torso lengthened longer and wider and bigger and larger, shaping and finalizing the incredible curves and tone she had already sported as \u2018normal\u2019 pixie. An elfin frame, with endless long legs, an angelic face and an incredible firm and succulent bosom, which was once again growing even faster than the rest of her body, but retained it\u2019s perfect shape and firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Clare grew so quickly that her long legs kicked out unexpectedly, Burrowing deep chasms into the landscape with contemptuous ease. Still flopped onto her back and laying across the ground, the blonde beauty had already buried the remains of the powerplant under her growing frame, the generous swell of her ass encroaching on the vast industrial area next to the plant as the moments passed.<br>\r\nHer enormous weight caused Clare to push deeper and deeper into the earth. Without her realising it, she was causing the ground around her to crack and droop, pulling in machines and houses and trees, her body literally inhaling and smashing everything as it expanded outward across the earth.<br>\r\nShe began expanding faster and bigger just to press into the industrial sprawl, which was already marked by the kick of her legs. Her blonde head was pressing uncomfortably against the mountains, uprooted trees, mere splinters to her, were caught in her golden hair. <br>\r\nHer already gigantic form continued to rise, weightier and larger. Clare's breasts stuck out like from her chest, casting a shadow over the area, the pale wondrous globes expanded relentlessly, rising higher and becoming more massive, like two tremendous volcanos rising out of the ocean.<br>\r\n\u201cMORE! MORE!\u201d Clare thundered. <br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

They just decide to sit and wait, and Nel decides to just talk to Clare as they fly back out of the vial, and sit on the edge of Nel's coffee table. They just sit next to each other, just waiting for something to happen to the two of them. So, while they were waiting there, they start talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: So, what was it like, y'know, you just being able to see the world from my POV?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: It was so weird. I felt like I could finally see what you had to go through. I mean, being 1'7\" was normal for me, but being 4\" tall was the strangest thing that I ever could have experienced. *actually looking up to Nel* Boy, something tells me you're growing faster than I am, almost as if you're the one getting to my height and me just getting to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Well, I always did want to be bigger. I was kinda jealous of you, Clare, being so big and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: I was always jealous of you, being small and not having a care in the world, just living fun and fancy free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Well, I guess we were jealous of each other. *looking down* boy, you are growing slow, or am I growing fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Might be both, and it might be we're switching places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Let's take a look at my height chart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fly over to Nel's height chart, which had her height and Clare's height in comparison to each other. Nel reached Clare's height perfectly, while Clare reached only Nel's height perfectly. However, Nel felt herself bang on the ceiling, finding it odd that this is so. Nel then had a shocking revalation, the two of them were still growing up. Nel was now 2'7\", while Clare was 1'4\" tall. The two of them were getting pretty cramped inside the house, so they bailed out before they were able to burst the house. Nel was now an Amazonian 6'7\" tall, while Clare was an average 5'4\" tall. Their wings had grown, but not enough to be at normal ratios, about only half the ratio they were supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel managed to grab some mystical cloth from her closet, and it conformed to hers and Clare's bodies no problem. Nel had on a red tank top with red trim and a navy blue pair of shorts, and some black sandals. Clare had on a green short-sleeve shirt and dark green denim jeans, and a pair of flip-flops for her feet. The two of them ran out of the village before the other pixies could spot them. Nel still had her long, blue hair with red highlights, and her blue cheek markings. Clare still was a long-haired blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Nel, do you still have those potions you used on us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Sure, they're right... uh-oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the vials had shattered, and the contents were lost long before they got out of the house. Nel just smacked her hand to her forehead, and Clare just sighs in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Well, what now? We can't go back to the village now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Well, I think that now we'll fit in quite nicely with the Human crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Are you crazy?! My height would work out, but yours is practically Amazonian! Besides, these wings of ours would be a dead giveaway, emphasis on \"dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Clare, relax! I was only joking! *pats her head* Don't worry your pretty little head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Don't get me started, Nel Nightfall! I may be comparable to your old height now, but I paid attention in self-defense class, unlike you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Sheesh, Clare, calm down! Can't you take a joke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: Oh, sorry... I got kind of carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: Come on, sisterly hug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: *hugged* Oh, so now I know why you sighed when you hugged me, because boob was in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel: *guffaws, rofl's*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare: *chuckles hysterically*</span></div></div>",

He is wearing a green jacket, green pants, brown boots, and a green-toned top hat. Red in the hair and green in eyes, and with pasty white tone in his skin, it is all too obvious that this one is an overgrown Leprechaun. But how did he get that way? Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeprechaun: Faith in Megara, Carlisle, why did ye have tae take that dumb growth potion, anyway? \"Wanted a head up on the boyos,\" ye said, but ye never did expect this, did ye, Carlisle?

She suddenly grew a centimeter (1/5 of an inch) taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel continued growing upward, careful to avoid her furniture. She was about 10 inches by this point, 6 inches taller than normal. She looked around the room, seeing things and Clare getting smaller and smaller in her sight. She was now a full 2 feet, about 5 inches taller than Clare was. She then noticed her dress was practically destroyed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare giggled, seeing Nel trying to cover herself up, and she said, \"Here, Nel. UMPH! You can wear my dress.\" She tugs it up to her now giant (kinda) friend. Nel, without a second thought, covered herself up with the silvery blue dress. When she put it on, she said, \"It's a bit snug, though...\" Clare just snickered at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel, being careful not to bonk her head, picked Clare up by the underarms, looking over her. Clare then jokingly said, \"Goo-goo gah-gah.\" The two laughed at this, since Clare was kind of like a baby compared to Nel now. Clare then started buzzing around, knowing if she was normal-sized, she'd conjure up a typhoon in Nel's house with her larger wings. They then went outside, Nel taking the potions with her, and they went to the nearby lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel said to Clare, \"Hey Clare, what would you think if we saw eye to eye like this for once?\" Clare then said, \"I think I can live with that, I mean, I've never had you see eye-to-eye with me before at that height.\" Nel then said, \"Well then, here's a drop, little sister.\" At that joke, Clare giggled. She took the drop of potion, and she started stretching out. She returned to her normal height of 1'7\", but she didn't yet see Nel eye-to-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel, still looking down somewhat, sighed, and gave Clare another little drop. But then, Clare decided not to, and took the shrinking potion again. She shrunk down to 3 inches, smaller than she was last time, and she said, \"I don't remember having to look so high up to you, Nel...\" Nel replied, \"Because you took too much. Here, have the little drop again.\" Clare, back to 4 1/2 inches, sighed in relief. She then flew up to the shoulder of her 2-foot friend, and smiled, knowing this is what Nel always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went back to Clare's house, and Clare then realized that she was too small now to reach anything, so Nel had to do all of the reaching, Clare flying up once or twice. Nel and Clare then took each of the potion and decided to have a little fun with it.</span></div></div>",

She splashed a little bit on her wing, while she went over to clare and dabbed the other formula on Clare's wing, the shrinking formula. She went back to Clare's bed, and went to sleep, waiting for the shrinking to commence. Oh, it was commencing, alright, but not with Nel. Clare, unbeknownst, was starting to shrink again. She shrunk down to a short (Clare-wise) 1'2\" tall, while Nel was growing more. She grew up to a full 3' tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came, and Clare noticed her shrunken form. She dabbed the growth formula on herself, and figured that Nel grew herself by accident, so she went into her bedroom, and splashed some of the shrinking formula on Nel, not only waking her up, but bringing her back to her normal 4 inches in height, maybe half an inch higher. Nel said to Clare, \"I guess I might have goofed up on which formula I grabbed.\" Clare said, \"It's okay, Nel, but don't use these unless there's plenty of light to do it, okay?\" \"Okay.\" Then Nel had an idea. She said, \"Hey, Clare, did you ever wonder what it may be like, if you were half my height, and I was double?\" Clare said, \"Boy, that would be weird.\" Nel then grabbed the shrinking formula, and splashed a good portion on Clare. She then took the growth formula, and splashed herself with it. Clare was rapidly shrinking, but it slowed down and got to 2 inches tall. Nel just doubled in height to 8 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare then said to Nel, \"Well, this is certainly a weird angle, I can't even see your face.\" The tiny pixie then flew up to Nel's face, and Nel just giggled. However, Clare then splashed some of the growth formula on herself again. She exploded with growth, back to 1'7\" tall, while nel took a splash herself, also returning to 1'7\" tall, back to equal heights with Clare. The two apologized to each other, forgave, forgot, and just moved on with the here and now. Clare made breakfast, pancakes with rich maple syrup. The two girls just had breakfast and went on with their now equal lives.

Clare was looking into one of Nel's now quite small books, and Nel asked Clare, \"Say, Clare, you want me to do something so you can read that better.\" Clare replied, \"No, thanks, Nel. I'll try to read this as best I can.\" Then, as Nel had gone into her new room to pick out another outfit, Clare started to shrink again. She saw the book get bigger and bigger, and shouted to Nel, \"Nel, I told you not to do anything to me!\" Nel replied, \"I'm in my room, Clare!\" Just then, Clare found that the book she was holding was about to fit perfectly to her, until she kept shrinking. Now only about an inch tall, Clare struggled with the book she was now holding in her hands, which had now practically filled up her lap. Nel came into the room and spotted her now inch-high friend, and splashed some of the growth formula on her. Instantly, Clare shot up to 1'4\" tall, her clothes still a bit loose.

Nel put the book away, and closed the cupboard it was out of, and made a mental note not to open to that particular page. Clare yawned, and decided to go home. Nel, however, decided to go around, showing off her new height to all of the Pixies in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare had taken out a book from Nel, which focused on nature spells that she thought were interesting. Nel just strutted her stuff around town, and every pixie was starting to become jealous. Most of the pixies around town were only around nine or ten inches tall, and Nel, like Clare, had one up on them, or more rather nine or ten, nine or ten inches that is. Clare and Nel decided to meet up later. Nel had placed an enchantment on her and Clare's clothes so that should they grow or shrink again, their clothes would conform to their new size, whatever size they ended up being. Nel kept strutting her stuff, while Clare just kept on reading the book she borrowed from Nel, which was, surprisingly, the right size for her.</span></div></div>",

She woke up Clare, and she saw what had become of the formulas, as well, or more rather, what had become of her and Nel... Upon closer inspection, and with a little pulling of Nel's right wing, which was now, by pixie ratios, half-size, Clare had found out what happened. She told Nel, \"Uh, Nel, I think the growing formula had been affected by the Lunar Eclipse last night...\" Nel then deduced the same thing, saying, \"I think we're human size now...\" They then saw a human on a horse, and got up close to find out if Nel's measurement was correct. However, the human on the horse, a teenaged boy, shouted, \"YAH! Amazon Women!\" They then realized that they were now taller than the humans, and they walked up to a lamp post that the humans have been using to measure their young ones. Clare then said to Nel, \"Oh, Nel, we're still equal in height, but that equal height is... is 9'7\"... We're near half short of 10' tall!\" Nel then declared, \"Oh well, maybe we can still have some fun with the humans, eh?\" Clare then said, \"Nuh-uh! We have to get back to the village, pronto!\" Nel then sighed, \"Fine, fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got back to the village, but everyone was astonished by the sheer height of the Amazon Pixies. Josh, the village leader, gathered everyone together and started talking about the two titanic pixies he had behind him, \"Now, now, my little pixies, relax! It is clear to me that the growth formula that Nel was delivered will most assuredly bring these two girls back down to normal size.\" Nel protested by saying, \"No way, I actually liked being at Clare's height, we both wanted to see eye-to-eye, and that's the way we still want it!\" Josh sighed and said, \"Fine, Nel, you can still be on equal heights with Clare if we use the shrinking formula on you two.\" However, the formula only made a dent in their height until it bounced back in height, growing further to 14'7\" tall. Josh sighed, and declared, \"Alright, since the shrinking formula only made things worse, it is notified that these girls will have to wait until the next Full Moon before taking it, only then will this spell be broken and they return to their previous height, Clare's normal height of 1'7\" tall.\" All of the pixies went back home, while Clare just said to Nel, \"Well, Nel, seems things will be very different around here...\" She replied, \"Relax, Clare, we'll be alright at the next full moon.\"</span></div></div>",

Clare started feeling the dress getting looser, while Nel tighter. Clare then shrunk to 3 inches, while Nel grew to 3 feet, practically bonking her head on the ceiling. Clare then shrunk to 2 inches, and Nel grew to 4 feet. Finally, Clare stopped at 1 inch, while Nel stopped at 5 feet, she was practically Human-sized. Clare then started flying around her now huge friend. It appeared that Nel's blue and red hair had grown extremely long, almost like a pixie Rapunzel. Clare joked, \"Nel, Nel, let down your long hair. Tee-hee!\" Nel snickered at the comment, and said to her friend, \"Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of a pixie named Clare!\" They both laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Clare then felt really strange, and asked Nel if she could have some more of the growth elixir. She agreed, and splashed a drop or two on Clare, practically soaking her. Clare then exploded with growth, becoming a full 6 feet in height, practically pinning Nel down. Nel took another drop of the potion, and grew to 8 feet, and then 9 feet. Clare then took another splash of it, and grew to practically 15 feet. The two bursted out of Clare's house. They had to make a run for it, and did so quick. Nel then splashed some of the shrinking formula on Clare, reducing her to 8 feet tall, still pretty big, almost Amazon big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing they didn't notice was, with all of their growing, they also grew their endowments. Nel was first to see this, noting, \"Clare, your boobs are HUGE!\" She then said, \"You, too! But I think mine are bigger than yours.\" Nel replied, \"You're right... Mine are probably G-cups, yours are probably K's by now.\" Clare then said, \"Let's just get something to cover up these bazongas already.\" Nel nodded in agreement, and found some cloth that someone must have left behind. They took the cloth and covered up their breasts and lower bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare and Nel knew they couldn't go back to Pixie Village in this state, and ran off to the lake. Clare then said, \"We need to take the shrinking potion, and get ourselves back to somewhat normal size.\" Nel shook her head, and Clare said, \"Why not?\" Nel then took out the potion bottles... They were empty... Clare slapped her head, saying, \"Great... just great... We're stuck as Amazon Pixies...\" She crossed her arms, causing her K-cup boobs to squeeze upwards.</span></div></div>",

The blue and red-haired Pixie slapped her face, and said, \"The Giant Witch who lives in the Forbidden Forest, duh! She's another friend I made not long ago.\" Clare, shocked, said to Nel, \"Nel, we can't go there! And why didn't you tell me you went there before? And how can we trust a Giant Witch?\" Nel, crossing her arms, squeezing her G-cup breasts in the process, said to Clare in anger, \"We have no choice, Clare! If we want to get back to normal... On the other hand... DOH! If we want to get back to normal, Kathrin is the one to look to!\" Clare, sighing, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours walking, Nel and Clare came up to Kathrin's humongous hut. Nel then knocked on the door, and there was a voice behind saying \"Coming.\" Kathrin, her long silver hair falling over her shoulders, then looked down, seeing a pair of abnormally big Pixies. One she recognised as Nel, but she never met Clare before. Nel, excited, said, \"Kathrin, it's been a while!\" She replied, \"Certainly has. Let me get down to Eye-Level here.\" She then shrunk down to 6 feet, only to realise that Nel was 9 feet and Clare was 8 feet. But she shrugged to herself, and said, \"Let me guess, a situation of Growth?\" Clare then extended her hand, saying, \"Yeah. My name is Clare, nice to meet you, Kathrin...\" She replied, \"Likewise, Clare.\" Clare explained everything that happened (which took a while); Kathrin, now enlightened as to the details, nodded, saying, \"Nel, I am the one who sent you the shrinking formula. I merely wanted a test subject. I apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel then placed her hand on Kathrin's shoulder, saying, \"It's okay, Kathrin, I actually kinda like being like this.\" Clare said, \"I'm kinda getting used to it, too.\" Kathrin patted Nel's cheek, and sent the two of them off, back home with a little something, some new clothes. She gave nel a crimson tube top and skirt, as well as some black cloth knee-high boots. Clare got the same, except her top and skirt were blue and her boots brown. When they got back to the village, everyone around them saw them in shock. Kevin, Nel's crush, fell backwards, fainting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel and then saw Clare by her old house, or at least its remnants. Clare was crying, now she didn't have a home and she couldn't live in it if she did have one. Nel then put her hand on Clare's shoulder, being sympathetic for once. She said to her, \"It's okay, Clare. I can't exactly live in my house either...\" Clare just cried into her friend's tube top.</span></div></div>",

Nel was now a 9-foot, kanteloupe-boobed Amazon; and Clare was 8 feet with watermelon boobs. The other Pixies were either envious of what they had, or were scared of them. There was especially one who was scared of Nel now, it was Kevin. He didn't know what to think. He always had feelings for Nel, and Nel always had a crush on him. But now, that crush might end up with him getting crushed, literally. At least there were some things Nel and Clare were useful for now, getting the heavy fruit out of the trees. It was because of them that life was flourishing in the Pixie village. But Nel and Clare weren't too happy. They had no homes to go to. The only thing that kept them from catching a cold was eating fruits and drinking plenty of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, Kevin became less and less scared of Nel and Clare, and became sympathetic of them. They were doing so much, and yet they get so little in exchange. Kevin snuck around Nel while she and Clare were asleep, and tried to get to her house to get something. However, almost as if Nel knew he was there, she crossed her arms over her abdomen, and grabbed Kevin as he was flying by. Shocked, the 10-inch Pixie had no intention to struggle. It actually felt nice to be close to Nel, and Nel seemed to be enjoying it as well. All Kevin heard was Nel talking in her sleep, and she suddenly said, \"Kevin... I love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, Nel woke up, rubbing one eye with her finger. But then she noticed that she was holding something, and looked down. But she couldn't see past her G-cup bosom for anything, so she picked up what she was holding. She then brought to her face a sleeping Kevin. She yelped, and accidentally threw Kevin into Clare's K-cup cleavage. She saw that Kevin's hand was still sticking out, and she could hear muffled shouts from him. She pulled him out, but this woke Clare up. She said to Nel, \"What happened here?\" She yawned heavily, and Nel replied, \"I accidentally dropped Kevin into your cleavage, Clare.\" Looking confused, Clare then bursted into laughter, as if someone was tickling her. Nel then burst into laughter, seeing what she was meaning. Kevin, however, didn't get the joke...</span></div></div>",

She smiled as she returned the embrace by stroking his back with one of her fingers, smiling down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she gasped as the pleasurable senses washed over her again, but this time a surge of light flashed out from her -- from her heart, and connected with Kevin. Nel felt herself dazed, in a state between being awake and tired, as she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when she wakes up?</span></div></div>",

As she awakened, she found herself lying under a tree, small Kevin standing over her, looking a bit worried. \"Oh god, Nel your awake! What luck!\" Nel propped herself up against the tree but, to her disappointment, she was no longer a giantess, but to Kevin she was, sending a tingle down her body as she looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smiled up at her, only half of Nel's height. \"Enough to satisfy me.\" suggested the odd thoughts in the back of Nel's head, sending the strange feeling up through her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel smiled as she said to Kevin \"Well, at least I'll get to be at a manageable size. And so will you.\" Kevin, not quite sure by what she meant by that, said \"I was worried, especially as you started to shrink. You were out for an hour. And--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel gasped, she bolted upright as the feeling was stronger than ever. She brought her womanhood face to face with Kevin, before grabbing his head and burying it within. At first he resisted, but that was only out of shock, once he had realized what was going on, he dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel grunted and moaned as she slowly collapsed to the ground, eclectic tingles surging out from where the tongue writhed about happily and hungrily, Kevin's arms wrapped all the way around, squeezing her round, soft backside. She was so happy that Kevin went so fast into this..and so aroused. The feelings that Kevin brought to Nel only make the feeling inside her stronger though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Kevin lapped up Nel's womanhood, she dug her pelvis into the earth a little more, trying to find a way to make it more pleasurable, to please whatever was growing inside her. She said to Kevin finally, as his tongue and actions just weren't enough \"It's not working!\" and she let go of her new lover's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, Kevin came up, coated with Nel's labored juices. Nel smiled and cleaned him up. She said \"You were...simply incredible. I don't know where that came from but-\" there was too much pleasure in her, she had to have him make her release it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped off Kevin's clothes with one tear of her hand and said \"You tried to make me feel good one way, now try a bit harder.\" as she tickled Kevin's stiff hardon. No need for incentive, Kevin slipped it into her already glistening sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Nel gasped as Kevin placed his penis within her, it felt so much larger than it should have, perhaps the fruit was working it's magic on her? Regardless, she let it continue penetrating her. As it slid quickly in and out, she felt her orgasm reaching it's finale. She was burying her behind into the earth, and she was grasping her still large breasts, heaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, your amazing! How can you do this so well?\" her vision was drowned, her eyes sealed shut, too lost in the emotion to bother staring out. Every few seconds, it almost felt as though it was getting bigger inside her, like she was contracting, and that it was constricting tighter and tighter around him. She gasped and grunted, thrusting herself toward Kevin, working it along with him. Until finally, something strange happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's penis popped right off me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, exploding in an orgasm then and there. Her sex drive was sated for now, and she had found her new lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awakes from her orgasm, what has happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well this wasn't good. This wasn't good at all! Nel was less than a bug to Kevin now. Her magic wasn't very strong in most circumstances, but now, she would be powerless against something as big as Kevin. Conversely, Kevin's own magic power was now increased several times over. It wouldn't take long for word of this to spread throughout the land and reach Pixie City where Kassandra, the current Pixie Queen, would hear about it. Technically, she wouldn't even be considered the Queen anymore, as her powers would be nothing compared to Kevin's. And worst of all, the fruit was gone. All of it. That bag hadn't had much to begin with and there was a chance that fruit was one of a kind. No, the only thing she could think of doing was heading back to her village to talk to Josh, the leader of her village, and have him send word to Pixie City so Kassandra could try and sort all this out. She took one last look at Kevin, heading towards the nearest human settlement, and just stared. Despite the fact that he had swatted her away like a bug, she still had feelings for him. In his growth he had shredded away his clothes. Kevin hadn't been wearing much to begin with, just a small pair of shorts, a half vest, and some leaves wrapped around half of his foot for shoes. The other Pixies often wondered at this strange dress, but since it showed off a lot of his athletic body, Nel never cared. And now he was completely nude! Nel could see Kevin's manhood, bigger than her several times over! She shook her head to clear it of these impure thoughts and turned and flew back towards her village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to make it back and Nel instantly headed straight toward the biggest building in the village where Josh would be found. The building was big by Pixie standard but any human who found it would be sure to think of it as nothing more than a child's playhouse. Surrounding it was a gate and guarding the gate were two male Pixies one 1'8'' tall and the other 1'7'' tall. Both towered over Nel, but she wasn't about to be intimidated. She marched right up to them (being unable to fly over the gate since the area around this government building was a strict no fly zone enforced by a powerful spell set by Kassandra herself. She often traveled to the other villages renewing those old spells that had been set long ago when the villages were first built. Every Pixie ruler was charged with this duty in addition to their other responsibilities.) and said, \"I need to speak with Josh! It's an emergency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard on the left, who had red hair, said, \"Absurd! Josh it currently dealing with a momentous problem facing the Pixie village. Surely whatever a runt like you has to say would pale in comparison to his duties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel stomped her foot and said, \"Stick a cork in it Azriel! I'm in no mood! I'm not a child anymore and I won't be bullied by you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guard, who had longer blonde hair, laughed and said, \"You're as feisty as ever Nel! However, Azriel is right. Josh is currently dealing with the recent drought conditions. Surely you know how important that is? If this drought continues any longer, we won't be able to grow any food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel sighed and said, \"That's a small problem compared to what I have to say! Just let me in for five minutes! That's it! Please Azriel? Please Rok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards looked at each other and Azriel shrugged and said, \"You decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Rok was slightly taller, he held slight authority over Azriel. Rok looked at Nel's desperate face and relented. \"You may enter. But only for five minutes. I've known you since you were a little girl Nel and I know how tricky you can be. Don't waste Josh's time with idle stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel, all smiles now, said, \"Don't worry I won't! Thank you both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates opened and Nel rushed inside, pushed open the double doors leading into the government building and ran inside. Everyone that worked within were all much taller than Nel who slipped in unseen. She quickly made her way down a hallway towards a door marked: Josh-Leader. She pushed open the heavy door and ran inside. Josh was looking over some papers and only glanced up when the door opened. Since Nel was so small, she couldn't be seen over the paperwork on his desk so he didn't know immediatley what was going on. He stood up and spotted Nel, bending down to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Nel?\" he asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel quickly told her story about the human on horseback, the mysterious bag containing a strange fruit, about giving the fruit to her friend to test it's edibility. Josh didn't comment, but his look of surprise quickly changed to concern as Nel explained about how Kevin had eaten one and grown taller and then eaten the rest of the fruit and grown even bigger, bigger than any Pixie, bigger than any human! Josh couldn't believe what he was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had felt the ground shake earlier.\" Josh muttered to himself. \"Yes, Kevin lives far away. We wouldn't have noticed this drastic change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Nel asked, worried about her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This kind of problem is out of my hands. We're going to have to see Kassandra about this. Nel I'm charging you with a very important task. Do you know where Pixie City is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Nel said, offended that Josh would think she didn't. \"What Pixie doesn't know the way to Pixie City?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and said, \"Very well. I'm going to write a letter to Kassandra. I want you to take it to Pixie City and deliver it to her personally. No one should give you any trouble since I'm sealing the letter with the insignia of our village. If anyone gives you trouble, show them this letter and you should be okay. No Pixie would dare hurt a messenger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I meet someone who isn't a Pixie?\" Nel asked, nervous in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will have to do what you can to escape. Use the magic you've learned in your studies to conceal yourself, to move fast through unfriendly territory, to be without danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel nodded, thinking of her pocket book of spells in her room. It would be a good idea to bring a reference with her. She flew up to look over the paperwork and watched Josh write out the letter to Kassandra. Nel looked at the size of the letter and started thinking about how she was going to carry it. But it was an unfounded worry. As soon as Josh sealed the letter with a blob of wax and pressed the insignia of the village into the warm red wax, he tucked the letter into a small bag. Nel instantly recognized it as a magic satchel, a treasure created by powerful magic. The bag was small enough for her to carry in both hands, but she knew it could hold an unlimited amount of anything. All she had to do was stuff it into the bag, even if it was several times the bag's size. To pull it back out, she recited to herself, all I have to do is think about what object I want and it will appear in my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bent back down and said, \"Good luck Nel. Make sure that letter reaches Kassandra no matter what. Do not take any detours, do not speak to any strangers. With any luck Kassandra will know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel nodded and ran out of the room, down the hall, out the door, and back through the gate without looking back. She flew with all her haste to her house, pulled out her pocket spell reference and stuffed some supplies into the satchel. When she was ready, she locked her house with a quick spell and turned to the path that would lead out of the forest and towards Pixie City. She took a deep breath, smiled, and was on her way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luckily for Nel, Pixie City was finally visible on the horizon. Nel breathed a sigh of relief, glad to finally be close to the city. She had been traveling nonstop since that morning and was almost at the end of her rope. She had had a few scares as well. Not five minutes after getting out of the village she had been attacked by a snake. Nel was quick on her feet though and had managed to throw a confusion spell on the snake before it could use it's own brand of dark magic to hypnotize her. Nel had fleed soon after casting the spell as she knew it would not last long. Things  had gone better after that thankfully. But after she had finished a small lunch under an elm tree she had heard strange sounds coming from deep within the forest. Curiosity getting the better of her, she travelled through the trees until she came to a clearing. As soon as she had, she wished she hadn't. Inside the clearing were a pair of goblins each with a large sack. Nel had no doubt these were thieves and they were carrying their wares back to their guild leader. At the time, they had been resting, using the sacks as pillows. Nel quietly managed to sneak away without alerting them to her prescense. Finally she had been flying down the path when she heard laughter. She had thought about investigating, but remembering the goblins, she thought better of it. Unfortunately, she soon found out what had been laughing. A small boy with a pair of tweezers appeared, holding a jar full of various winged insects. Judging by the wingless corpses littering the bottom of the jar and the tweezers clutched in his hands, it didn't take Nel long to figure out what this kid was doing. She had tried once again to escape, but the boy had spotted her and grabbed her. She had struggled futiley as the tweezers inched closer to her wings, thinking her flying days were over. Just before the tweezers could close on her right wing, however, the boy shifted his grip allowing Nel to pull one arm free and perform a quick fire spell that burned the boy's fingers. He dropped her in alarm, allowing Nel to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would all be worth it now that she was at Pixie City. She flew up to the gates surrounding the city and held out the letter to the guards. Both were slightly over two feet tall and in her weakened state Nel couldn't help but feel a little intimidated. They didn't say anything about the letter, merely opened the gates and let her pass. Despite her fatigue, Nel was anxious to see every part of Pixie City she could. She had heard stories about the city and seen pictures of it in books but nothing could compare to it's reality. It was a huge city with buildings higher than any Nel had ever seen, the biggest of which was a huge castle, gleaming brightly in the oncoming darkness. Nel quickly flew over next to a building to avoid getting stepped on by the Pixies in the city, most of which were near or over two feet tall. She looked behind her and saw she was leaning against a tavern, one of many in the city. The whole sight and sounds of the city were overwhelming, but Nel was on a mission and quickly made her way to the castle. The castle boasted a huge courtyard though lacked a gate. But then again, Kassandra was the most powerful Pixie in the world. Why would she need a gate to protect her? Of course that meant nothing, now that Kevin could destroy the city in a few footsteps. Remembering her friend, Nel focused on the castle doors and walked inside. Everything within was made of marble, giving the castle an unreal white quality. The floor was made of tiles so brightly polished it was like walking on the feet of her twin. Numerous Pixies were chatting to each other as they walked through the palace on their various duties and the longer Nel looked the more she came to realize that, for all its grandeur, the palace was much like the government building in her own village. Feeling more confident, Nel moved down the biggest hallway she could find and came to a huge ornate door with silver lines sketched across it in a language long since lost to the Pixies. No one knew who built the palace anymore, only that it was a gift to the Pixies to a race long since gone from this world. As such, no one could read the various strange scripts that appeared throughout the castle, though some historians theorized they're instructions left by those who built the palace. Even they could not venture a guess as to what these intstructions might be. Nel pushed open the door, without knowing any of this, and found herself in the throne room of Queen Kassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment she was alone, sitting on her throne, reading a huge book, a small pair of round spectacles over her eyes. Her white dress was long and flowing, with bright stones sewn into the lining so that everytime she moved it appeared as though the dress was twinkling. Her somewhat long reddish hair was pulled back by an ivory circlet that was locked in the center by a sapphire. All the rulers of the Pixie Kingdom wore this gender neautral circlet as a symbol of their power and prestige. As soon as the door closed behind Nel, Kassandra looked up in surprise, removing the spectacles and showcasing her emerald eyes. Her gaze was piercing though, at the moment, only curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello child. What brings you to my palace, and how did you get here without appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was like music and Nel found herself unable to speak. Kassandra's eyebrow arched and Nel blushed and looked down. She hated feeling so overwhelmed, but Kassandra oozed authority. It didn't help that, even sitting down, Kassandra was staring down at her. Nel took a deep breath and said, \"Please your highness. My name is Nel and I've traveled from a far off village with dire news that threatens the entire Pixie Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyebrow arched, if it was even possible, even higher, but she said nothing. Nel tremblingly held out the letter and Kassandra made a motion with her finger. The letter instantly jumped from Nel's outstretched hand and into Kassandra's own. She put the spectacles back on and slit open the letter. She read the thing quickly, her eyes darting left and right with practiced speed. A frown creased her forehead and Nel thought she could feel the temperature drop. Kassandra looked up from the letter and set it aside. She appeared to be deep in thought. Finally, after Nel was thinking of leaving, she stood up and said, \"This is dire news indeed. Follow me child. I am about to show you something that only I, as the Queen of the Pixies, am allowed to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurning with curiousity, Nel watched Kassandra turn to the wall behind the throne and move her arms in an ancient spell casting gesture, one that Nel had never even heard of, let alone practiced. The wall burned bright enough to make Nel see spots and when her vision cleared, it was gone. Kassandra held out her hand and made a light appear in it. Nel did the same and flew after her as she walked down the concealed staircase. Deeper and deeper underground they went until Nel started to truly feel the chill and dampness of the underground. At the bottom of the staircase was a simple wooden door which Kassandra opened and stepped through. The door closed behind them and Kassandra threw the light into the air where it exploded into a million pinpricks of light bathing the room in a starlight glow. Nel saw they were in a large cavern with pictures drawn upon them. Kassandra moved to the first one and said, \"This is a prophecy made long ago by the those who created this palace and entrusted it to the Pixies. It was no accident we recieved such a lavish gift. For you see, it was Seen that the Pixie race would give birth to the new world order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Nel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Pixies, our power is governed by our sizes and thus, we do not have magic that can alter our sizes. Even I, who am the most powerful Pixie in the world, do not have the power to shrink Kevin or increase another Pixie's size to fight him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what can we do?\" Nel yelled desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear child. Each of these pictures tell a story. The building of this palace, the rule of the Pixies, and now, a gigantic figure of a Pixie, one who overcame the boundaries placed at Pixie bright, changing his size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Kevin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Kevin was Seen at the beginning of Pixie rule to be the one who would change the world. For you see, by increasing his size he has gained powers that no Pixie has ever wielded. No other magic user can increase their own power in this way. I fear, even if he doesn't realize it yet, that he can even control his own size. If he ever becomes aware of this knowledge, he could continue to grow in size and power and eventually overthrow the kings who govern this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that be so bad?\" Nel asked. \"Isn't it time Pixies were on top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand your thinking my child. But the prophecy continues. If Kevin does increase his size enough to rule the world, then the balance that was placed at the Beginning of Time will be disrupted and the Universe will become undone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...\" Nel couldn't think of anything to say. For once, she was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear child. That is only one branch of this prophecy. Another branch says that Kevin will come to his senses and stop his domination scheme before it really can begin. Another branch says that Kevin will be tempted to find a partner to rule with him, but will not choose a close friend. The last branch, says that Kevin will be shrunk back to his normal size and be forgiven his brief trangressions as they were against his power to prevent. I hope to make the final branch come true. As such, I am sending you on a mission to the human capitol, to find the one man who can save us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this human?\" Nel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is only a boy, but his interest in magic specializes in the change of size. To that end, he has been devising a special potion that will shrink any who drink it. I'm afraid an ordinary potion will not suffice as the fruits that Kevin ate were magically altered at their very core. Trust me when I say this boy is the only one who can make this particular potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel nodded and said, \"What does he look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is sixteen years old and stands six feet one inch tall. He has short dark brown hair, like and oak tree, and lives alone in the slums of the human capitol. I will supply you with a map, food, drink, and a spell book from the library that will help guide you through the dangers on the way to the capitol. Be stout of heart, my child, as the path ahead of you is long and treacherous. It will take you at least one week to reach the capitol and then the task will fall on you to persuade this boy and take the potion to Kevin and get him to drink it. I ask that you do this because you are closest to him and have the best chance of convincing him to stop this madness he has engaged in. But for tonight, you sleep. When you are recovered, you will go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Kassandra led Nel back up to the throne room and had two maids escort her to an empty room. Nel fell asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kevin ate the fruit he felt energy course throughout his body. He felt electrified, like every hair on his body was standing up. His breathing started increasing and he looked down at his body as he started to change. Kevin had never been one to conform with the other Pixies. That was one of the main reasons Nel liked him so much. He was always fun to hang out with unlike the somewhat vain Clare. Nel liked Clare a lot too but she could get superior which annoyed Nel. Kevin never got like that nor did he ever make Nel feel small which was why Nel had developed a crush for him long ago. She was just too nervous to say anything. She didn't want to ruin their perfect friendship. Anyway, Kevin's clothes showed his non conformity. Instead of dressing in a standard green or blue tunic and shorts with sandals, he instead wore a bright red half vest, nicely showcasing his strong chest and faint six pack, and shorter than average shorts, showing off his toned thighs. In place of sandals, he simply walked around barefoot. Now, as Nel watched Kevin change, these sparse clothes became increasingly tight on his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's muscles were expanding. His biceps swellling, his shoulders broadening, his pecs pushing out as his abs deepened into a true six pack. His legs followed suit, growing thicker and thicker. Soon, his shorts were shredded leaving him in nothing but a tight pair of Pixie underpants. His back flared out and ripped his vest straight down the center. Even his feet grew larger to support the increased weight now being pushed on them. Lastly, Kevin grew a few inches taller, evening himself out at one foot tall. Kevin looked at himself in shock, but wasn't unsatisfied. He was about to say something to Nel, when the growth came back. This time focused down under. Nel and Kevin were both transfixed as Kevin's package started straining the underwear, the threads unraveling slowly, revealing bit by bit spots of Kevin's penis and balls. Suddenly, the underwear shredded completely leaving Kevin exposed. Nel clapped her hands over her eyes, her face flooding red. She wanted to look, but thought it would be too awkward for Kevin so she decided to be considerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look now Nel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel slowly uncovered her eyes and saw that Kevin had wrapped his ripped clothes around his crotch like a loincloth, hiding himself. She sighed and said, \"Well I didn't see that coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin flexed his bicep and said, \"Although it's not altogether a bad outcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel privately agreed but thought it might be wierd to say so. Instead, she looked at the fruit. While it did make Kevin a little taller it had also made his penis and muscles grow larger. Nel only wanted to get taller. She didn't want to lose her feminine figure. Nor did she want to grow a penis! She could just hear the comments from Clare about how she looked more like a man than a woman. But there was still quite a bit of fruit left. She knew Clare wouldn't hear of ruining her gorgeous figure, and she didn't know very many other Pixies half as well as Clare and Kevin. Kevin was eyeing the fruit too. Maybe she should just give the fruit to Kevin? There had to be more ways to grow than this. Plus, she liked seeing Kevin big and wouldn't mind seeing him even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the bag of fruit towards Kevin and said, \"It's all yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin grinned happily and picked up another fruit, quickly eating it. They both waited eagerly to see the growth.</span></div></div>",

His loincloth not going to be able to cover himself much, he quickly told Nel, \"Don't look\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel quickly looked away, but snuck a peek at Kevin while he tried wrapping and tying the torn clothes around his penis and balls forming a sort of closed-ended sleeve, trying to get as best use of the fabric as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished, and told Nel \"Okay, you can look now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel looked to see him groaning as his body grew past the point of Nel no longer even being able to reach his crotch without flying. As his knee passed her eye level, the torn clothes over Kevin's growing manhood were beginning to rip, just beginning to reveal what they had previously concealed. His penis was growing fast, it was now as big as Nel herself, a full four inches, and his balls were each as big as his head. Kevin was having to strongly lean backwards to not fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin blushed, \"Um... Nel? Could you look away again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright.\" Nel turned away, though snuck a peek in every once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin watched as his torn clothes fell away, revealing his penis, now half as long as his two-foot frame. He felt a bump on his head, and he fell over backwards with a loud whump that shook the entire house. His head had hit the ceiling. His penis became heavier... and heavier... and slowly came to rest on the ground. He had to put forth an effort not to lose control of his excitement and cum, likely blowing away a wall while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth finally stopped, leaving him three feet tall with a two-foot penis.</span></div></div>",

Nel figured he'd be nine feet tall if he stood up, and his penis was already almost twice that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, aren't we a big boy,\" Nel said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was just barely holding in an orgasm, and strangely, Nel's bag of fruit seemed just as full as before.</span></div></div>",

She groaned as she sat up; her dress, her hair, her entire body completely covered. She tried to prop herself up on her hands, but her arm slipped and she fall onto her back once again. She could feel a tingling sensation spreading through her body, and her dress seemed to be tightening and clinging to her body. Nel figured it was because she had just been drenched, but she suddenly hear a tearing noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great...\" she said sarcastically. \"I tore my dress too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...you look different...\" Kevin observed from above her, cradling his huge member in his hands to stop another explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel wasn't sure what he meant. Then she looked down at her body...noticing that her dress was pulled tight across her breasts...did they look...bigger? Was <i>she </i>growing too?! Nel gave a squeal as she felt her whole body start to grow in one sudden burst. Her red dress tightened even more as her legs grew longer, lengthening and spreading across the floor, almost kicking into Kevin's muscular body. She groaned as she looked down and saw her breasts swelling before her eyes, rising like baking dough and overflowing the top of her red dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin couldn't help but be turned on my this display, and had to cover the tip of his huge penis to hold back another ejaculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's dress finally gave up the battle to contain her body and began tearing apart, splitting across the chest to allow her breasts to burst free and inching up to allow her expanded rear end to rip through her panties. Nel's hands grabbed what was left of the tattered material and tore it away as she continued to grow taller. She placed her hands on the floor and bent over as she saw what was left of the ceiling inching closer towards her head, but her new position just caused her butt to crash into the wall behind her, causing her house to tremble and shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-careful Nel...\" Kevin stammered, watching the whole thing eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel moaned and tried to stand up, knocking the wall down behind her and crashing through what remained of the roof. Her house crumbled and fell apart as she rose up, tall, naked and with much bigger breasts than ever before. Her hands cupped her huge boobs and squeezed them as she reached six foot, the same height as Kevin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Nel gasped as her growth finally slowed to a halt. \"I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both of her hands shifted under her overgrown bosom, scratching in an attempt to relieve the itching, only to discover a little something odd.

Curious, she began to move them around, enjoying the feeling of her multiple arms as they moved around. Soon, though, her attention was taken back to her front. While she was distracted, all of the bumps beneath her chest had pressed outward, filling out into what felt to her touch to be two more pairs of breasts, each the size of her newly-expanded originals. She smiled widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top things off, her growth had also finished. She stood in amusement, standing at 5'6\", happily twirling around in the air. Then her attention turned back to the potions contained in the bag in her hand.</span></div></div>",

About two days into the ride, though, the driver got out of his truck and decided to stop at a local fast food place to pick up some food. Nel was still asleep as he proceeded to stop there, unaware of the movements after all the bumping she felt over the last two days. As she was sleeping she felt a weird smell in the air around her, enough to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise it was a human! It was a boy, who looked around 11 or 12. He had light brown hair, green eyes, and couldn\u2019t have been more than 4\u201911\u201d. He wore a blue, long-sleeve shirt and jeans, and his shoes were black with blue stripes on the sides. The boy looked at Nel with an awe-inspiring look, but the pixie was more annoyed now than scared by his gazing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked the kid sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, the boy said to Nel apologetically. \u201cMy name\u2019s Anthony.

We\u2019re during this out of favor for one of his colleagues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t happen to know anything that can make objects grow, do they?\u201d Nel asked in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026my father WAS carrying an experimental growth formula, but it hasn\u2019t been tested yet\u201d, Anthony told Nel before being cut off. Nel didn\u2019t even wait for Anthony to finish his sentence before she proceeded to look all over the truck for this growth formula. Anthony pointed out that was in his father\u2019s glove compartment, and Nel quickly went in and opened it. Unfortunately the bottle was too big for Nel to lift, so she rushed back to Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you help me open the growth formula bottle?\u201d Nel asked the boy, pretending to be sad. \u201cIt would really make me happy if you do.\u201d Anthony blushed a little at seeing the cute, puppy dog-eyed pixie ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but maybe we should until we arrive at the lab tomorrow..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I want to grow NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Miss Pixie..\u201d, the reluctant Anthony said, taking the bottle from the compartment and placing it on the ground outside of the truck. He then took out a spoon, scooped up some of the liquid, and placed the spoon on the ground next to Nel. The little pixie then proceeded to lick up the drink, feeling a tingling sensation in her body shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Pixie, you\u2019re getting bigger\u201d, Anthony said in amazement, looking at the increasingly bigger Nel, who went from 4 inches to now at least a foot high.

Kalavik, Almokta aa'i Optumo Seshui!\" (English Translation: \"Heart of Atlantis, make my stand with the gods!\") She continued to chant it, and she started growing.

When she did, all that was left was a couple leaves serving as underwear, growing with her body. If she were Human size, her breasts would now be the size of beach balls.

She came out at about 60' tall with boobs in comparison to Fitness Balls, what you'd find in a gymnasium. Standing ten feet above the forest, she started walking away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat then points her finger and tells Nel to get on. Her voice rumbles as she tells Nel, \"This is going to be more pleasurable than painful, but even so, fold in your wings so you don't accidentally squish them as you grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, Nel folds in her 3 and a half inch wingspan, each wing as beautifully decorated as a porcelain butterfly and clear as glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat continues, \"When I tell you to, hop off my finger. Ok?\"<br>\r\nNel's tiny voice echoes in reply, \"ok.\"<br>\r\n\"Good\" the giantess said, before her finger began sparkling and Nel began growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's figure began to stretch out, her legs pushing out first. Her already ripped dress strains at the mere gain of a few centimeters, then the rips begin to widen as an inch comes in. Her body stretches as well, giving her a rail thin appearance at 7 inches, then 8. However, this wouldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 9 inches, her hips begin to widen again, and her breasts grow. At this point, they only grow to be proportionally the same as when she started, and up to this point she hadn't felt any of the pleasure promised to her. Suddenly, she gasps, her stretching body has begun to gain a bigger butt and larger breasts in proportion to herself. She nearly orgasms, but keeps herself in check a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can feel her dress coming up higher and higher on her body, the mere fact that it still hasn't come off is extraordinary. Her height, if nothing else, would've had her 4 inch dress, now stretched to 7 inches, right around her ass. However, her breasts have hiked it up further. Showing off her midriff as her breasts are now each the size of her head. She can feel their nipples cutting against the fabric as her dress slowly slide and stretched against her still growing bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one foot, Nel hears the giantess say, \"jump off now!\" and obeys. She jumps onto a table and lands on her butt. Immediately following that she gasps in pleasure and orgasms onto the table. She can feel her butt propelling her longer legs and stretching torso even higher as it presses against the wood grain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a foot and a half, her former dress is merely a bra, barely holding in her nipples that Nel might not be able to reach anymore. The fabric now has so many rips in it that if you were to attempt to poke the side of it, odds are you'd poke skin instead. Her breasts now seem to shake as they can't grow any larger with the bra there, leaving Nel to squirm and squiggle in pain and delight. Finally, the makeshift bra almost explodes off, letting her breast size expand another 3 cups all at once. When this happens though, she feels her legs shoot forward, her head spring higher, her ass bounce bigger, as she is now three feet tall, the size of a little human girl. With curves that a porn star wishes she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree now from all clothing restrictions, Nel's growth speeds up. Her breasts, extremely firm, only hang down to her navel, while jutting out a few feet. They are round except for a slight tear drop shape, and are becoming even bigger on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frame, of which, is still growing. Her legs extremely shapely and pushing onwards to 4 feet long. Her torso meets this challenge and let's her come to 7-9 feet tall overall. Her ass and hips continue to push outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel is laying with her back on the table, writhing in ecstasy. The table, while built for a giantess, creaks a little bit. In response, Kat picks Nel up and lays her on the floor, where her growth seems to stop for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel's entire body starts quivering, more and more, as if some unseen pressure is building up inside her. Then, her body explodes in size as it reaches 20 feet tall in a few seconds. Her mammaries, while growing in proportion, only gains another cupsize in relation to the rest of her body. Her ass only grows a similar amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her breasts and ass stop getting bigger in proportion with the rest of her body. Leaving Nel to stretch across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few more seconds of growing and leaving wet marks on the floor. Nel gets up to her new height of 50 feet. She wobbles, unaccustomed to the new weight distributed around her body. Kat runs over and steadies her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now\", Kat remarks. \"It takes a little getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel is appreciative of the help. She rubs the back of her head in shyness only to find something interesting. Her hair had grown too. Becoming a waterfall of blue with red sparkles in it that reached all the way down to her shelf of a backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on\", Kat says as she departs to another room of the house only to come back with a few dresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These should mostly fit you but...\" Kat's eyes dart towards Nel's breasts. They are firm and round with a slight tear drop shape to them, they also hang slightly below her navel. Kat resumes, \"I'm not sure if I have anything to fit your chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Nel's nipples having 2-3 feet each (remember, they're both 50 ft. tall) if a bra existed that could fit her breasts. Her nipple would still show through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat looks at her own breasts. Not even half the size that Nel's had grown to be. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Nel's four-inch form slipped through his hand like butter. Flitting her wings to spray off the putrid human sweat, Nel planned her mode of attack. Go around the head and buzz in his ear? Cliche, but do-able. Scratch his eyes out? More effective. Or just flee? The man had to be taught a lesson for messing with a defenseless pixie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the one who should've studied more was Nel, as her conniving left her completely open for capture. This time, the man considered every possible avenue of escape, by sliding her into a black box through a four-inch slit. She barely eased in, so there was no chance of her mustering her way out. As added precaution, the man closed the tiny bar of freedom from Nel, leaving only pinpoint holes to aerate her prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this terrible?

Nel awoke to the sights of slightly larger pinpricks for a ceiling, but the same dull, pitch black surroundings. Perhaps a bit more spacious, but no opening in sight. The walls dwarfed her even more than the last box, and she found herself a helpless prison. Kneeling over in anguish, she almost missed the overshadowing eye peeking through the top. Instantly she sprung up to reach at it, but the human moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alive! Wow, a real, living pixie! And everyone told me I was a fraud... I'll show them, won't I?

All she could do was watch him peek around at her, trying to glance at whatever he could behold of her figure. Flustered, Nel tried to concoct some way out of this trap.

What with your magic, and the assistance of the witch, I should find myself in a very pleasing position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel wondered. Just how does he aim to take her? Then, she recalled his mention of the witch. So old Kathrin Keebler had brewed up this nonsense? True, her magic was strong, but what could be done to make a pixie the fitting wife for a human? Suddenly, it struck her. She gasped in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she finally get her wish, thanks to this fool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my darling, the witch advised me to sprinkle you once daily, so that our love may grow as gradually as you will. But, I'm eager to see you in all your beauty, so I'll add just a bit more than recommended... It can't hurt, the witch deals only in good magic, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel sunk to the bottom of the box. Sprinkles? She'd be trapped in this prison, fed on bits of magic dust. The thought didn't excite her, even considering the potential growth. Old Kathrin had been known to be wrong, too.

The dewdrops graced the tip of her nose and the middle of her lips, ever so gently dripping off the ends of her hair from the top of her head. Covered in whatever miraculous powder this might be, the hope of growth filled Nel's body with anticipation. Her toes writhed and her hands quivered. Her tiny abdomen shook. Only a moment now, only a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it only took a second! From four inches, she bolted up through five, six, ten! Cramped within the confines of her black prison, she pushed her larger, stronger arms against it. The growth continued, and strength proportional to her new size, surpassing a whole foot and a half. At last reaching two feet, her squished form shattered the four walls of her imprisonment, opening her up to a brighter, yet bigger world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there her growth halted. She stood at two feet tall, barely below the chest of her captor. For the first time, she could glance up at him and examine his features. To her dismay, he was just a youth! A boy of no more than seventeen, naive to the world at large. Her own age surpassed his, a shocking discovery. What was he doing, growing pixies for his bride? Wasn't there some stupid human girl he could marry and unhappily settle down with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My! I never expected this to happen... I'll have to get you a new cage, so that you don't run away before I can make you the proper size. The witch was right, once a day is the only way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please, don't imprison me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad to finally reach his ears; being taller meant a more human frequency. Though she could tell, the quality was still hypnotizing to a mortal. How perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dream of it, now. I thought you couldn't speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can speak. Every creature can speak, it's just a matter of understanding the language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours is a truly beautiful one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lovingly glanced upon her; she coyly shielded herself in response. With an outstretched hand, he tried to hold her, but instinct had control of Nel this time. She nipped his hand. The boy recoiled in pain, but without anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You will have to stay here longer, if we're to control <i>that</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't force yourself upon me! I don't take kindly to larger things striking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I never intended you any harm... I haven't caused you any, have I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ignorance was utterly unbearable. Nevertheless, she thanked him silently for giving her that perfect opportunity to grow. Though not the tallest of the pixies, Nel's stature would dwarf most of them. If she could escape now, that world of bragging rights would be open to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, she was clever. With a little more time, she could become the tallest pixie to ever live. Never before had one reached the height of a human, after all. Her mind oozed with the possibilities.

It's a magic that's unknown to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That'd be the kindly old witch's work. I told her that I could not marry in the village, as all of the women there were idle, dull, and unbecoming. I wanted a wife with spark, someone clever and intelligent, as well as beautiful. She smiled upon me, and told me to look for a wife in the forbidden forest. But, as the legend goes, none but pixies live there. Knowing this, she offered me this power, a type of ancient dew collected from a now-extinct animal who produces it naturally. The dew, she said, would allow my wife to meet my eyes and thus kiss me. Eager for such a happy companion, I gladly obliged her whatever she wished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the... perhaps it's better if I don't tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNel had a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, there I was in the woods, searching for what I thought would only be myth. Yet there you slept on a log, the most immaculate creation I'd ever witnessed... I fell immediately, and knew that I had to have you for my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a touching compliment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis statements were cringe-worthy. Humans. Always needing what they shouldn't have, witches letting them get away with it. A part of her wondered if old Kathrin had singled her out for this treatment. The two conversed regularly, with Nel always desperate for her to whip up some growth concoction. (Witches can speak with mythical creatures, as they have a much larger hearing range and a much better vocabulary) She wouldn't put it past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you found me!

Something about the after-effects, but I can't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad old Kathrin known full well that Nel would be the pixie of choice, she would have advised the human involved to punish her with agonizing slow growth. The two enjoyed playing tricks on each other, after all. And, what's more, the witch hadn't even spoken to Nel of her fortunate discovery.

Oh well I am getting hungry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she began to nibble at the part with frosting. After 3 bites Nel began to feel strange. She took a few steps away from the cake and table with her hands on her stomach. The strange feeling grew stronger and stronger until Nel started growing clothes and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness I'm finally growing\" Nel beamed as she inched up in height and Size. She was now 1/2 as tall as the table. She continued to inch up and grow until the table only reached just below her waist. According to an oddly placed measuring chart on the wall Nell realized she had grown to 8 feet tall.</span></div></div>",
