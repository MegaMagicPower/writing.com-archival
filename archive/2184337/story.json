I mean, I didn't mean to... they were just so tasty-looking, and I missed breakfast this morning, and... ugh...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do now? They hadn't introduced themselves to anybody yet, so... maybe I can find a replacement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... they know the mayor is supposed to be a human... and where am I going to find a human on such short notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh... think, Isabelle, think...!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis definitely seems like it was going to be a long train ride\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but you can easily relax by just watching the beautiful landscapes roll by, clearing your mind as you lean against the window. As the train rides along the countryside, you quietly contemplate the future that lies ahead of you. You used to live in a big human city, but apparently, the town you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving to is a small village full of animals\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just about as different as it can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, here was one of them now. Your attention was drawn by the sound of heavy footsteps walking down the aisle of the train, only to lay eyes on a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 peculiar person. He appeared to be some sort of cat, with blue and white fur and a big smile locked on his face! Down below, though, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but notice that round, fluffy white tummy peeking out beneath his shirt, showing just how chubby he seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared to be casually munching on some strange chips from a plastic bag he was carrying around, only for him to perk up when he saw you. You were a little surprised when the chubby cat walks right up to you, those cheerful eyes glancing into your\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow! A-are you a human? This is the train to Camellia town, right? You must be the mayor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard so much about!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiled widely, like he was meeting a celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused, to say the least. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUhh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think you have me mixed up with someone else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You shake your head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am heading to Camellia town, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the mayor or anything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry! I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make assumptions like that, should I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He apologizes sheepishly! \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just moving into Camellia town, huh? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cool, too! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting two new humans in the same day\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what are the odds, huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it. Is the mayor of this town you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving to a human as well? Well, that was a bit of a relief. \"Oh, hehe! How rude of me! I forgot to even ask you your name!\" He smiled, reaching out a fluffy hand. \"My name's Rover! And you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... my name's Pepper,\" you shake his hand, nervously. You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really spoken to an animal before. \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you to! Hope you don't mind if I plop down right here!\" Before you could respond, he plopped himself down on the chair aside from you, rubbing his grumbling belly as his behind took up most of his entire chair, which creaked under his weight. \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a real home anywhere. I just like to travel the world, seeing all the sights\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiles, wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two sit together for a while, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re distracted from your window-gazing by the sound of the feline happily stuffing more chips into his mouth as the train rode along. He was one of the first animals you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever met up close, though, and you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but be a little fascinated by him, despite how ditzy and pudgy he was. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, do you live in Camellia town...?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You ask, wondering why he seemed so excited about the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no. I just know about just about every animal town around here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He giggles, before reaching into his satchel, past all the food tucked away in there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I even have a map! You should have it - you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it more useful than I will!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pulls out a crumpled piece of paper, covered in crumbs and dried soda. You flatten it out as best you can, giving it a look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a whole map? Uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 thanks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You thank him, despite wondering why he has a map of a town he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHehe\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to be honest, I really just travel around to taste all the different fruits\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and all the different restaurants\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiles, blushing and smiling, his eyes closing as he reminisces about all of the delicious meals he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had, instinctively groping his own soft tummy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd man\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the food in Camellia town is sooooo good~\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him squeeze his own belly for a while, blushing and feeling a little awkward. Before this could go on for too long, though \u00e2\u0080\u009cOooh! It looks like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re arriving!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiles, starting to shift back and forth in his seat excitedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could stay, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a buffet at the next stop I gotta get to! Hehe\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you later, Pepper!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He waves at you as you grab your things, but before you walk out, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but wave back to the cheerful feline.</span></div></div>",

You bounce right off it, falling onto your butt on the train platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re dazed for a moment, looking up to see\u2026 what looks like a huge dog girl! Standing at around a foot or two taller than yourself, she was covered with enough softness to make Rover look thin! At the moment, she looked stressed out of her mind, bags under her eyes as if she\u2019s had a very bad morning. And, notably, there\u2019s visible bulges and movements coming from her big, round gut\u2026 what on Earth did she eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh! I\u2019m so sorry! Ugh, I just mess EVERYTHING up, don\u2019t I?\u201d She sighs, feeling somebody go bouncing off her gut\u2026 before she leans over and sees you sitting there, dizzy. \u201cW-wait. Are you a\u2026 a h-human\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \u201c... uh, last time I checked, yeah, I\u2019m a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sweat dripping down her forehead, she gave her best sheepish, nervous-looking smile! \u201cW-well! Do I have an exciting offer for you!\u201d She says, taking your hand and lifting you gently off your feet. \u201cHave you ever wanted to be the mayor of your very own town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 no, not really\u2026\u201d You reply, deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wraps an arm around your shoulder, showing you the whole town from the platform, trying to feign enthusiasm! \u201cO-of course you have, silly! Just imagine it! The power! The influence\u2026!\u201d She gestured her hand over the visage of the small town. \u201cAll of it can be your\u2019s\u2026 mayor~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only growing increasingly confused by this, and a little blushy at getting pressed up against her furry, pudgy side! \u201cUh, listen, I\u2019m not the mayor you\u2019re looking for. I just came here to learn how to cook-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing like she doesn\u2019t even hear what you\u2019re saying, she just shakes your hand, acting as if everything was normal even as her stomach groaned around whatever was moving around inside. \u201cMy name\u2019s Isabelle! I\u2019ll be your secretary and assistant while you focus on your important mayoral duties!\u201d She smiles, warmly all of a sudden. \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, we simply must head to the town hall! Our villagers are waiting there to finally meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding your hand, she started to lead you through town\u2026 and despite only holding you gently, you realized just how immensely strong the pudgy dog woman was! You blushed, unable to work up the courage to squeak out any words as you just obediently followed the big, cheerful-seeming canine towards a quaint little wooden town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned as you were suddenly bombarded with excitement from all the animals waiting there! You'd only seen a couple in your life, and now, it seemed like a bunch were all over you, excited to meet their new mayor! Notably, while some were more slim, most of them were some variation of big and pudgy...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, I would like you to meet your brand new mayor!\" Isabelle smiled, with you blushing as she wrapped an arm around your shoulder and showed you off to the adoring crowd of animals of all shapes and sizes. \"Yes, yes, I'm sure you're all very excited! But our mayor here is going to be very busy, and they to get to work right away! They will meet you all individually in the coming days...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Isabelle calmly shepherded you into the town hall, before you could say anything that might alert the other animals to the fact that you're not really the mayor. With a light smile, she sat down across from you at her big, wooden desk. \"Alright, mayor! This little office is going to be your headquarters! But before we can make this official, we need to register you as a resident. First of all, I'm going to need a name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pepper,\" you reply, still dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister or misses...?\"</span></div></div>",

Wonderful you will fit right in and don't worry I will help you with anything you need mayor!\" Isabella beamed a nervous but much more convincing smile to you, her large belly made gurgling groans which made her give another nervous smile. \"Ehehe.. so mister Pepper we are going to get you settled in Carmellia the best town around with best food!\" Isabella wrote down your papers and filed them away in her desk. \"Erhm... thank you Isabelle?\" You give her confused smile and massive dog nods to you few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right mister mayor you are going to need a house! Let me make a quick phone call first.\" Large dog grabbed her phone and soon spoke with someone. You watch around the Townhall seeing many pictures of Isabelle going from thin to thick along former mayor who seemingly disappeared recently. You wonder where this all has been so sudden! Along the photos are diplomas for being the best town with best food that might explain the sizes of animals you seen and your obese secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mister Pepper! Mister Nook will be with us soon so lets go outside shall we? We have to find you good place to build your house!\" Isabelle seemingly have gotten much confident after having you forced to take the mantle of mayor you can't help but oblige and see where this crazy ride goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside townhall an obese tanuki has arrived huffing while wearing green sweater that barely covered his large gut. \"Aaah welcome welcome, so you decided to take our post for new mayor? I wonder where the old one left so fast! He still had some loan to repay me... neverless I am Tom Nook of Nook Homes! I'm going to get you settled in Carmellia and I look forward to do business with you.... or a meal if you offer.\" large tanuki introduces himself to you with powerful handshake. He has been eating well but not like your secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm thank you mister Nook... do I have to pay the loan of former mayor?\" you ask hoping its not ridiculously lot, thankfully fat tanuki shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we can discuss that about later! You of course need proper income to pay after all! Now then show me good spot where you want your house to be built and I get my workers on it oh and Isabelle?\" Tom Nook offers smile to you before turning towards Isabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes mister Nook?\" Isabelle looks nervous hoping Tom doesn't realize what she has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not misplace our former mayors before they pay me fully.\" Nook said before turning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle wipes her sweaty forehead and sighs in relief perhaps your secretary hides something but now time to settle in this crazy town!</span></div></div>",
