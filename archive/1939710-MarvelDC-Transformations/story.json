He had already foiled a car-jacking, and had gotten some great photos of himself stopping the crime.  Of course his boss wouldn't believe that he was doing the world any favors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider-Man's secret identity was that of <b>Peter Parker</b>, the lovable loser with the super-hot supermodel wife, <b>Mary Jane</b>.  His boss was <b>J. Jonah Jameson</b>, (JJJ,) owner of the Daily Bugle. JJJ didn't take kindly to Spider-Man's activities, and was trying to convince the world for years that Spider-Man was a menace.  The only reason Parker still worked for the guy was because he gave the best pay for the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million things went through Spider-Man's head as he swung from building to building.  Was he getting to old for this?  Was it really his job to save everyone?  He thought back to the one time he refused to stop a thief, and it led to his <b>Uncle Ben's</b> death.  \"Never Again.\" he thought.  He had learned from that experience that with 'great power came great responsibility.' A motto that his uncle told him over and over again.  He made a mental note to visit Ben's widow, <b>Aunt May</b> later on today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he swung by the downtown region of New York, his ears heard a familiar ringing of a burglar alarm coming from one of the giant corporate buildings.  \"Well I am here anyways, I'd better check it out.\" Peter said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider-Man crawled on the building for get a glimpse of the situation.  People were being evacuated, but he couldn't see from what.  As he crawled up the building, he finally came across the reason for the commotion.  Four men in advanced mechanical suits were in what looked to be a lab, carefully grabbing a vial from one of the freezers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look boss, a freak.\" the smallest one said.<br>\r\n\"Uh, that ain't no freak, that's ah Spiders-Man.\" said the tallest.<br>\r\n\"So, blast him.\" said the boss.<br>\r\nSpiderman quickly crawled out of the was as what seemed to be a laser blaster was aimed at him.  The glass flew down to the street below.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the opening. I'll be taking that gun from you.\" Spider-Man said as he shot artificial webbing from his suit, stuck it to the gun, and pulled it towards him.<br>\r\n\"We's got what we wanted.  Just go.\" the boss said, as the other three dashed through the door.<br>\r\n\"No so fast, Iron-fan rejects.\" Spider-Man said as he caught the bosses back and dragged the crook towards him.<br>\r\n\"Nots todays wall-crawler.\" the crook said as he took the vile and tossed it right towards Spider-Man.  Spider-Man used his super-human reflexes to catch the vial, but his Superhuman strength crushed it and the fluid inside leaked through his suit onto his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stinging sensation overcame him, as the crook he caught used the time to eject from his suit and run after his men.<br>\r\n\"What was in that vial?\" Spider-Man asked as a dizziness overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer, as the man was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider-Man tried to get up, but his body felt like it was fighting itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze mutie scum!\" a security guard said as he ran into the room.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Now you do your job.\" Spider-Man tried to reply but all that came out was an incoherent mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming his right arm out the window, he shot a web at the skyscraper across the street, and pulled himself out of the room.<br>\r\nHe was barely able to turn around before hitting the side of the building.  Creating a noticable crack on one of the office windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" he said as his grip loosened and he went falling down its side.  Trying desperatly to stick onto the glass as he fell, he manages to slow himself down just enough to avoid breaking any bones as he hit the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onlookers stared in amazement as one of New York's most famous vigilantes limped towards a small alley behind the two buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo dizzy that he was barely able to stand straight.  Spider-Man picked up a manhole cover, and crawled in.  At least if he passed out in here, the cops wouldn't be as likely to find him.</span></div></div>",

Two blocks later, Spider-Man emerged from the sewers, and grabbed some clothes he stashed on a balcony of an abandoned apartment for just such an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clothes feel a bit looser than normal.\" Parker thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a pain in his hips struck him like an icy dagger.  Peter fell into the shadows of the balcony.  Fear racing through his mind.  A tingling sensation began to spread from his hand up his arm.  His bones began to feel like a tight rubber.  With clenched teeth, Parker let out a grunt.  His arm collapsed down as it seemed to reform itself, his fingers seemed to be becoming slimmer, as did his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's scientific mind began to process what what happening, the mass on his body was beginning to rearrange itself.  The tingling spread, his heart beating as it were racing quicksilver.  His mouth opened to scream, but only air existed his lungs.  Something was happening to his chest.  It began to swell.  Beneath his shirt, two noticeable mounds emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in his hips grew, so much so that he instinctively squeezed his legs together and braced them against his torso, in a fetal position.  He could feel the legs reshape themselves.  More than that, he could feel the area between his legs reshape itself.  Within a minute, he could feel a noticeable difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling overtook his skull, and Peter shut his eyes as his body tried to fight the changes.  The blackness beneath his eyelids became a red, followed by blue, consumed again by black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Parker woke up just minutes later, his body felt like it had taken a beating by the Sinister Six.  He stood up, trying hard to get his balance, as the sun's position turned the screen door in front of him into a near prefect mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection before him was not that of Peter Parker, but one what looked like his twin sister.  A hot lesbian, wearing her brothers clothes, with a curvier than average body.  The hair was still short, but as the girl ran her dainty fingers through it, it clearly felt softer, like she had used a whole bottle of conditioner on it mere minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips seemed plumper than the average women's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned closer to the window to analyze even the most minute changes.  Feeling herself, just to see her body's reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker looked at her curvy new body.  Her mind ran through what had happened.  Obviously something in the vial triggered the change.   Her body was curvier because of the extra mass that he held as a male, it had redistributed itself accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" she said with cautious sarcasm. \"Mary Jane is never going to believe this one.\"<br>\r\nEven her voice had instantly adjusted to create a more feminine quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was still Peter's, she thought about her options, she could either return to the scene of the crime to get some clues, or try and convince one of her allies to help.</span></div></div>",

Doctor Strange had been summoned to another dimension.  The Avengers were in Asia for some reasons, Peter forgot to read the memo on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to Spring this on Mary Jane, or Aunt May, yet.  Her mind raced through a bunch of suitable candidates to help her.  Eventually one popped into her head.  <b>Felicia Hardy</b>, a.k.a. <b>the Black Cat</b>.  She was an ex-cat burglar who could help Peter get back into the lab and look around for the information she needed.  Peter looked down at her newly formed breasts, if nothing else, Felicia could lend her a shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked her balance, the center of gravity was odd, it was a bit lower to the ground, but it it easier to move.  She jumped up against the wall and touched it.  Her grip on it was solid.  Her powers seemed stable, even after the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like that liquid is altering my DNA too much.  Just the X-Y Chromosomes.\" Peter thought.<br>\r\nPeter quickly descended the building, and made it to street level.  She looked around for any video cameras or people taking pictures with their cell-phones, but couldn't see anyone.  Not that it really mattered, he wasn't planning on staying female long, and pictures of her like this wouldn't give away her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the subway, Peter eventually made her way to Felicia's apartment.  No one had even tried to grope her on the subway, her trip under the manhole cover made sure that smelled enough that everyone gave her three feet of space in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the elevator up several stories, Peter knocked on Felicia's door.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Peter said.<br>\r\n\"Just a minute.\" Felicia's voice responded.<br>\r\nThe door opened, and Felicia looked around the hall to see no one.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Up here.\" Peter said.<br>\r\nFelicia looked up and saw with woman.  \"Neat trick.\" she said.<br>\r\nPeter dropped down right in front of her.  \"Felicia, it's me, Peter.\" she said.  \"I did that roof stunt to save us time in convincing you it was me.\"<br>\r\nFelicia was quiet for a second, and looked closely at the woman.  She analyzed the woman's face.<br>\r\n\"Peter, it is you!\" she said. \"And you stink!\"<br>\r\n\"I need help.\" Peter pleased.<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" Felicia invited her friend.  The girl entered the apartment, and they closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Felicia asked.<br>\r\nPeter went into detail about her day, leading up to the moment of the change.  \"...And then I came here.\" she finished.<br>\r\n\"Are you in pain, or feeling mentally different in anyway?\"<br>\r\nThe girl looked down at her breasts.  \"I don't think so.  I mean, I feel smaller, and not as strong, like I can only lift 20 tons instead of 50.\" she answered.  It was supposed to be a joke to lighten the mood, but secretly, it was true.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're not dizzy, or feel like blacking out?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Then there is no reason for you not to take a shower.\" Felicia said.</span></div></div>",

She never did like going into the sewers, not only was it a constricting place to fight, but a lot of the time, her clothes would prove to be useless after a battle down there.  And there was always a risk of her wounds getting infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter shut the bathroom door behind her, and locked it.  Stripping down, she looked in the mirror.  The image looking back at her was completely female.  She was curvier than she wanted to be.<br>\r\n\"Most women would kill for a body like this.  Thankfully, I am not most women.\" Peter thought, still trying to get used to the fact she was currently female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned on the shower, and let the water warm up a bit.  Before walking into the water and grabbing the soap.  Her body felt more sensitive than usual.  Maybe it was still sore because of the transformation.  Maybe his skin was just more sensitive, now that it was female.  She let her mind be occupied by this as she started scrubbing.  Foam soap bubbles formed on her as he skin started to get soar once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter gritted her teeth.  \"WHY?!\" she yelled.<br>\r\nHer skin began to crawl, as it absorbed the water.  Peter quickly shut the shower dial off as she slid into the tub and laid on her back.  Her body began to twist and convulse, and make strange sounds.  She could feel bits on it altering.  Her hair seemed to grow about an inch, and her breasts and ass felt a bit 'fuller'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, Peter went to the mirror, and looked at her reflection.  She looked curvy, and by curvy, it was Mary Jane curvy.  Her face looked different too,  her jaw wasn't as defined, her nose seemed a bit smaller, her eyes and lips a bit bigger.  She defiantly looked more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good. I need to fix this, fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's mind raced trying to process what just happened, adding water seemed to be what was triggering her physical changes.  It must have temporarily altered her bones into a rubber-like substance, where they reshaped before hardening again.  The change was redistributing the existing mass to her ass and breasts.  The chemicals her body created during the change must have caused her hair to grow as a side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I am still mentally me.\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Peter?\" Felicia said as she knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smelled her odor, and noticed the sewer smell was gone.  She grabbed a towel, and opened the door.  Felicia was standing there with some new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the size won't be perfect, but try these.\" she said, handing Peter the pile of clothes in her hands.<br>\r\nAs Peter reached out to grab them, her towel fell off, leaving her totally exposed in front of Felicia.<br>\r\n\"You know Pete, it's only taken me until now to get you naked in my apartment.\" Felicia said with a wink.<br>\r\nPeter blushed, as she used her Spider-like reflexes to grab the clothes and shut the door behind her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter tried on the clothes Felicia gave her.  A two piece skin tight Spandex suit, which showed off a lot more cleavage than she was comfortable with.  It was flexible, but also strong, it wouldn't easily break under pressure.  The bottom of the feet had light soles built into them, so they could work as shoes.  They were designed to be hidden in an actual pair of shoes to make for a quick change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror after changing.  The black suit defiantly made her ass look fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the clothe given were designed to go over top of the cat-burglar suit.  Knee socks that went up to her thighs, a skirt that went down to her knees.  A thick red blouse that only showed the top of her breasts.  Peter carefully folded the arms of the spandex suit under her blouse's short sleeves.  It made her shoulder's looked defined but she didn't care.<br>\r\nThe last thing she grabbed was a purse Felicia had in the pile.  The arm band on it hid her scrunched up shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the purse was a brown wig, a mask, a pair of gloves and two tubes of lipstick, a soft pink and a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter opened the door.<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the only reason you got that long to get ready was because you were going on a date.\" she said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n\"This is new to me, okay.\" Peter replied.<br>\r\n\"I can tell.\" Felicia said, as she walked over and grabbed the pink lipstick tube from the purse.  \"Drop your jaw.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n\"I don't really want to...\"<br>\r\n\"Just drop it.\" She repeated, and Peter opened his mouth.<br>\r\nIn one movement, Felicia put the coat of lipstick on Peter's lips.<br>\r\n\"Now smack you lips like this.\" she said, and Peter obeyed.<br>\r\n\"I don't see how this helps.\" Peter replied.<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a boy about it.  This stuff wipes right off.  It's my own custom blend.  The light pink if the first coat, the red goes on right over it.  Wear the bright red, and everyone focuses on your mouth, they don't remember any other part of your face, when you leave a scene, wipe it off, and you have the pink one still underneath, no one suspects a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia threw the girl a pair of half-inch black heels.  \"Wear these, they don't draw too much attention, and go well with your outfit.\"<br>\r\nPeter slowly put them on, and stood up.  They were easy to walk in.  She then walked over to a chair to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, game plan, I get us over to the building across the street, and we swing in through the broken window.  I search for the formula that changed me, and we see if there is a way to reverse this.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good Pete.  I also have this USB key that can instantly download the memory on most computers.<br>\r\n\"Where did you get that?\"<br>\r\n\"A girl's got to have her secrets.\" Felicia said with an innocent eye roll.<br>\r\n\"You stole that from Stark, didn't you?\"<br>\r\nFelicia faked her shock.  \"Why Peter, how could you every accuse me of such a thing?!\"<br>\r\n\"Because I came to you to help me break into a giant corporation to steal their secrets.  We are going to head out in under an hour to do this.\"  Peter said, trying to hide her annoyance.  Felicia was having too much fun at his expense today.  Also, it might have just been psychological, but Peter noticed the transformation seemed to make her more emotional.</span></div></div>",

In fact, it just looked like the door was locked, and nothing else had changed since she left.  \"Maybe they don't want the cops to know what's going on here.\" Peter observed.<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" said Felicia as she plugged the USB key into the largest computer in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Peter felt a tingling on her head. It was her Spider-sense.  A sixth sense Peter had to let her know when she was in danger.  \"Quick hide!\" she yelled to Felicia before gracefully jumping into the shadows of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's back was facing the floor as she tried hard to balance herself on the roof.  She wanted to face the other way, but was afraid of the effect that gravity would have on her newly formed breasts.  She was not getting the support she needed in this costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist of the knob, the door creaked open.  A security guard wandered around the room, doing his patrol, stopping for a minute to lean out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look revealed nothing of notice, and he turned to make his way out.  But before touching the door knob, he paused.  Looking around one last time, the man failed to see anyone else in the room.  He slowly put his hand in his pocket and Peter heard once familiar noises, which made her doubly uncomfortable in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, the guard turned around and left, shutting the door on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was awkward.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n\"I am not touching that door knob.\" Peter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia took the USB drive out of the computer slot, and wrapped her body around Peter.<br>\r\n\"Alright Spider-girl, we got what we came for.  Let's go.\"<br>\r\nPeter was going to object at being called Spider-girl.  If anything his code-name should have been Spider-Woman.  Then he remembered that that title was taken, and decided that it was best to leave before any more guards walked in the room to pass some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbraced tightly, the two women swung across the New York skyline until they arrived close enough to walk to Felicia's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want to read this data at my place, or is there some high-tech lab you'd rather be at?\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter thought for a second before replying...</span></div></div>",

The same thing was true for the Avenger's tower.  She at least knew that Felicia's apartment was safe, and Felicia would be right there to help her out if the transformation went any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your place is fine.\" Peter said.<br>\r\nFelicia gave a sly smile, she knew that that was going to be the answer from the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing their street clothes, the women walked up to the apartment door.<br>\r\n\"Hi Ladies.\" said a short bald headed man with a nasally voice.  He seemed to be in his mid thirties, and was a scrawny looking fellow.<br>\r\n\"Hi Larry.\" Felicia sighed.<br>\r\n\"Who's your friend?\" Larry wheezed.<br>\r\n\"This is...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm May.\" Peter said, once she saw Felicia hesitate.<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, I am Larry.\" he said as he shook the new girls hand.<br>\r\n\"I am going to have to wash my hands now.\" Peter thought, she could feel Larry's finger rub her palm for a brief second as he drifted his hand away.<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again Larry.\" Felicia said in a tone that showed no emotion.<br>\r\n\"I'll catch you later, ladies.\" he said with a wink as he went into the apartment beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's his deal?\" Peter asked as Felicia opened her door.<br>\r\n\"Larry is what you would have become, if the Spider didn't bite you.\"<br>\r\nPeter laughed, \"That's a bit harsh.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Nerd, lives alone, too interested in high-school grade science to do anything...or anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"So he's harmless?\"<br>\r\n\"He's a creep.\" she said as she turned on her computer and let it boot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information on the USB stick was fascinating.  The test preformed where for a private donor to the corporation.  The formula was supposed to allow the user to alter their DNA at will. Allowing them to shape-shift into whoever they needed to be.  But it was still in it's trial phase.  Early trials showed large problems with the results.  Mainly that the change seemed to be random, and would only alter one aspect of their body.  Most the changes were insignificant, from eye to hair color, the occasional skin color, and sometimes even height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so instead of being blond, I go from sausage to eggs.\" Peter thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information went on.  Mutant genes seemed to be the most stable.  Any genes altered before being exposed to the formula, seemed to have a stronger reaction to the formula.  Water, and liquids always caused instability to the transformation, changing the person further.  Overuse of the formula, and being trapped in a transformed form for an extended amount of time could cause mental alterations as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will not end well.\" Peter thought after she finished reading the data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say?\" Felicia inquired.<br>\r\n\"Nothing that will help with finding a cure.  But this is supposed to be a temporary thing.  I just need to wait it out and dehydrate myself.<br>\r\n\"That's it?\"<br>\r\n\"That's all it says, honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two starred at each other.<br>\r\n\"It's not supposed to rain today, we could have some fun.\" Felicia said.</span></div></div>",

She emerged from the bathrooms to find a large water spout tearing through the boardwalk. Peter shot a web to the top of the Ferris Wheel, and pulled herself upwards. She shot to the top, and was now higher than the water funnel.<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" said Peter, inhaling slowly.<br>\r\nOn the exhale, She jumped upwards, and shot a web to the ground. She pulled on the line, rocketing her towards the spout. diving through the center, Peter tackled a solidified Hydro-Man. The funnel collapsed as they both fell out of the air. Hydro-Man's face collided with concrete, while Peter stayed on top of him. She rolled off, exhausted, and clutching her stomach. Suddenly, Hydro-Man picked himself up, his face a dripping mess of dirty water. He rose his arms, which became swirls of water. Peter didn't have enough time to react as...</span></div></div>",

Peter was flung back a few yards, landing harshly on her back, her increased spider-stamina stopping any real damage from occurring.   She got up, her torso soaked, the suit's fabric clinging onto her chest like a second skin.  The outline of her nipples on display for everyone to see.  Some brave teenagers even took pictures of her, as she stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Parker luck.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough babe?\" Hydro-Man said as he pulled himself back up.<br>\r\n\"Babe?\" Peter said.  \"That's all you got, babe?\"<br>\r\nShe shot her webs and propelled herself into him.<br>\r\n\"You have a new friendly do-gooder super chick, and you can't come up with any corny quips?\" she said as she started hopping around, jumping off the walls.  \"He's some free ones for you: You should have said, 'don't feel bad, I'm known for making chicks wet.' or 'I just got my bodily fluids all over you, care to return the favor?' or 'I'm so distracted by your breasts that I didn't notice a web pulling a lamp pole towards me.'\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Hydro-Man said as he turned around to see a giant lamp pole come straight at his face, knocking him into the pavement below.<br>\r\nPeter swayed towards Hydro-Man, her hips and behind noticed by all the male onlookers.  \"Oh, and I just happen to have these super convenient webshooters, complete with waterproof webbing, donated to me by your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\" she said as she sprayed her target until the cartridge emptied, leaving Hydro-Man in a nearly airtight cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onlookers cheered as a kid came up and said \"smile\" as he took a picture of her standing over the villain with his phone.  Peter found herself reflexively posing for the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly swung around the building Felicia meeting her shortly with a pair of purses to hide the suit and mask.<br>\r\nPeter's hair was still soaked, her skin tingling all over.  \"I can feel the changes working again.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"But you look the same.\" Felicia noted.<br>\r\n\"Well, something is happening.\" Peter insisted.<br>\r\nThe both ducked into the woman's restroom, were Peter took a handful of paper towels and started dabbing herself to get dry faster.<br>\r\n\"I think your nails are longer.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n\"That's random.\" Parker replied.<br>\r\n\"And your eyelashes seem longer and more curled.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the worst of it, than I guess I got off lucky.\" Peter said, trying to relax her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they left and stepped into the hot sun.  \"This should dehydrate her in no time.\" Felicia thought, jealous that the eyes of men passing by were on her partner, and not her.<br>\r\n\"Hey beautiful.\" some guy said as he walked by and winked as he pointed at Peter.<br>\r\n\"Um...hey.\" she said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, a sound a sirens could be heard in the distance, as the cops came with a special disposal unit to capture Hydro-Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it was a good thing we decided to have a girls afternoon off. Hydro-Man could have caused a lot more damage.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you're not enjoying this.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine, except for the strange New Yorkers leering at me, and being in an alien body, and going through the most changes I've done since puberty, but I just think that you're enjoying it more.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but the way you're strutting your stuff, I think you're getting comfortable with your changes.\"<br>\r\nPeter was about to ask what she met, but looked down, and noticed that her blouse was completely undone.<br>\r\n\"I don't remember undoing this.\" Peter said, as she daintily lifted her hand over her breasts.<br>\r\nFelicia snickered, \"you probably haven't been noticing your body language either.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Parker said, concern swelling up in her voice.<br>\r\n\"I mean the way you're swaying, leaning forward to show off your goods, and sucking your stomach in whenever a guy walks past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stopped for a full minute, looked down at herself, and replayed the last five minutes in her head.<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" she gasped.  \"The water must have changed my behavior.

You're still the same nerd you've always been.\"<br>\r\n\"You're probably right.\" Peter said, her body language conveying that she overreacted.<br>\r\n\"Hey beautiful.\" a body builder said as he walked past Pete.

With so many eyes focused on her new body, it almost felt like her Spider-sense was going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia had stopped making eye contact with the New York men, as long as Peter was in arms reach, she wouldn\u2019t be the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMary Jane!\u201d she shouted.<br>\r\nThe redhead kept her stride.<br>\r\n\u201cMJ!

Both Mary Jane and Felicia had fought over Peter\u2019s affections before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love your purse.\u201d MJ said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re shoes are so cute.\u201d Felicia replied.

The gasp has another effect, both MJ and Felicia looked over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMary Jane, have you met my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMelony.\u201d Peter said before Felicia had a chance to give her a fake name.<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend Melony, who is here for the day.\u201d Felicia continued.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Melony.\u201d Mary Jane said, leaning in for a hug.  Peter leaned in as well, embracing her.   He didn\u2019t want to embrace his ex-girlfriend too hard, it would seem weird.  Peter shifted a bit, trying to get comfortable as their boobs connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d MJ said as they finished the hug.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter blushed, it was comforting to know that her ex-girlfriend still though she looked good.<br>\r\n\u201cMelony here is a model too.\u201d Felicia interrupted.<br>\r\n\u201cReally, which agency do you work with?\u201d MJ asked.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I freelance.\u201d Peter lied.<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.  You're gorgeous Melony, but you don\u2019t strike me as the model-type.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Felicia interrupted.<br>\r\n\u201cMost models I know have much longer hair, and don\u2019t usually go outside without at least some make-up on.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was swimming earlier today, and my hair was cut off for charity.\u201d Peter blurted out, desperate not to get caught in the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane took a closer look at Peter\u2019s face.  \u201cYou do seem really familiar.  I guess I might have run across your photo before when you had longer hair.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m known for my photo shoots.\u201d Peter said, forcing a smile.<br>\r\nFelicia tried hard not to laugh as well, she got the reference to Parker\u2019s job as a photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know ladies, I\u2019m on my way to a charity event myself.  If you two have three hours to spend, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to see you strut your stuff on the runway.\u201d Mary Jane said, a sly smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure my agent would allow me to do a shoot without prior approval.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it will be fun, MELONY.\u201d Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Peter said as she stared down at her breasts.  \u201cThe less pictures taken of me today, the better.\u201d She thought   Just then she realized the only reason she said her name was Melony was because she was focusing on her own breasts when she thought of it.  Her mind was probably starting to alter itself more, it was probably best for everyone if she stayed indoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the charity for?\u201d Felicia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s to save the Queen\u2019s orphanage.\u201d MJ replied.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Melony, if that orphanage shuts down, you know you\u2019ll never forgive yourself.\u201d Felicia teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate my life.\u201d Peter thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

MJ came out with the four-inch heeled, knee length boots, and directed her to the women\u2019s change room.   The other model\u2019s inside where friendly, and kept trying to make small talk as they dressed.  Peter recognized a few of them from when she was dating Mary Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter\u2019s eyes kept looking down as she tried not to look at their exposed breasts, although the second she took off her blouse, she realized that looking at her own wasn\u2019t much better.  Squeezing the singlet over herself was surprisingly uncomfortable.  The piece of clothing felt a size too small and almost as if it would rip right open if she bent to far over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Pete, you just have to walk up and down a fashion runway, not fight anyone in this thing.\u201d she thought to herself as she slipped her toe into the left boot.  The next came the gloves, which were surprisingly easy to slip on.   Standing up was simple too.  She found that her wall-climbing powers still worked with the heels, and created a firm grip every time she took a step, giving her almost perfect balance.  Touching the wall with her glove, she could feel her hand\u2019s artificial suction.  \u201cGood to know that still works.\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was easy, Peter was fitted with a long blond wig, mimicking Marvel\u2019s hairstyle  from when she was with the Avengers.  She just had to sit in a chair and wait for the make-up lady to cover her face.  Under about two layers of makeup, Peter saw her face in the mirror disappear as her features became more cartoonishly colourful, accentuating her femininity.  After she got up, she became almost indistinguishable from the girl who had walked in with Felicia and Mary Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d asked the woman.<br>\r\n\u201cI barely recognize myself.\u201d Peter said.<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  Isn\u2019t it wonderful? You look\u2026marvelous.\u201d<br>\r\nPeter gave her a polite but disbelieving glare.   She would have moved her mouth, but she was afraid to smudge anything.   It was going to be a quick photo shoot and runway walk, and she could walk away with a clear conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwaying her hips as she walked towards the other girls, she was greeted by Felicia\u2019s gaping jaw, and MJ\u2019s sly look of disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you are a model.\u201d MJ said.<br>\r\nPeter brushed back her fake hair, giving a heroic pose that she saw Ms. Marvel do in person a few times.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you from the real deal.\u201d Felicia gushed.  This caused Peter to blush, not that anyone could see it under all the makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was dressed up as Silver Sable, complete with white hair extensions, and Mary Jane was wearing the feminine version of the Spider-Man costume, without the mask.  She had thick blue eye shadow to bring attention to the blue in the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can barely recognize them like this.  No wonder the female Avengers always wear so much makeup on missions.\u201d Peter thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be lining us up in a few minutes once the other girls are ready, we\u2019ll be walking out onto the runway, and then taking a few pictures, before doing another costume change.\u201d Mary Jane explained to Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadize, ladize, pvleeze line zup.  Ve\u2019re startzing.\u201d Brian called out immediately after MJ finished, and the girls slowly filed into line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it goes.\u201d Peter told herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several flashes seemed to blind Peter every few seconds as she walked down the fashion runway, giving a forced smile as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her, Felicia held a plastic gun, and stopped to pose every twenty seconds.   She had faced off against Silver Sable before and was mockingly imitating her body language.   Peter immediately recognized what she was doing, and her forced smile immediately became a goofy one as she tried not to laugh.   Behind her, Mary Jane mimicked Spider-Man\u2019s hand gestures as imaginary webbing came out of her sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian gave all of them quick introductions as they walked across the stage, and the crowd seemed unusually enthusiastic.  As Peter reached the end of the runway, she was enjoying the attention, despite herself.   It was only as she turned around to head back when her Spider-sense started tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Peter thought as a pumpkin looking device flew into the crowd.   With an explosion, screams started going everywhere, followed shortly by a second explosion closer to the stage.   Peter used the force of the blast to jump backwards and use her body to cover Mary Jane, as she pushed her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors of the room automatically shut, as a maniacal laughter filled it.   Someone in a goblin suit riding a glider flew in through an open window near the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, but mostly ladies, do not be alarmed.   All we want are your possessions.\u201d  He said as he threw a large bag towards the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cFill it up, and no one gets harmed.\u201d He said as he took out another pumpkin bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked at Peter, using subtle body language to suggest taking him down.  Peter shook her head in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t have my web shooters, I\u2019m not used to this body, and if he\u2019s telling the truth, attacking him isn\u2019t worth the risk.\u201d she thought.   Peter looked up at the goblin.  It was one with a blue mask.  His body language different than any of the other goblin\u2019s Peter fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up!  Hurry up and fill up the bag!\u201d the goblin said.  An old gentleman had taken the bag and was holding it in front of the women so that they could drop their wallets and jewelry into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin dropped the third pumpkin bomb as it exploded beside the crowd.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, he\u2019s unstable.  Now I have to take him down.\u201d Peter thought with annoyance.  She looked to Felicia, but she had already disappeared.<br>\r\n\u201cMary Jane, I am going to make a break for my cellphone in the back.   Hide under the runway.\u201d Peter whispered. MJ nodded silently as she rolled underneath the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter did the math, the blue goblin was 15 feet above the ground.  It was going to be an easy jump.  She could knock him out in one or two punches and secure the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively Peter jumped towards the glider as his back was turned.   She landed a pulled punch  and the glider hovered towards the wall.  She landed a second punch.  A harder one.  The goblin passed out as the glider moved towards the wall, dragging itself down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack up!\u201d Peter shouted.  She was sure he was unconscious, but until she could shut the glider off, it could fly towards a bystander and take their head off.   Peter punched the device ripping through a panel and disconnecting the wire.   The engine powered down, and there was a roar of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me, all in a day\u2019s work for your friendly neighbourhood\u2026Miss Marvel.\u201d she finished, catching herself.   The camera\u2019s started going off.   Peter could see some of the crowd holding up cellphone cameras, recording her fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian came running to her.  \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, forgetting his accent.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Peter said, still waving at her adoring public.<br>\r\n\u201cWe should tie up that goblin-thing until the police arrive.\u201d Mary Jane said, revealing herself from the crowd.<br>\r\n\u201cI have a pair of handcuffs.\u201d said one of the more flamboyant members of the crowd.<br>\r\nBefore Peter could say another word, the fire alarm went off.<br>\r\n\u201cA bit late.\u201d someone shouted from the crowd.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019z ze automatic sprinzgler zistem.\u201d Brian said.  \u201cZa smoke fron ze glider must have tripped ze alarm.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs it broken? Why isn\u2019t there any\u2026\u201d whoever was talking got cut off from a thick stream of water that covered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d Parker though as her nipples began to show through her clothes.</span></div></div>",

It was the same way she felt when she went down into the sewers.  \u201cI\u2026I have to run.\u201d she said as she darted towards the change room, slipping and almost losing her balance in a newly formed puddle.   The crowd gave applause to her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed into the changing area, and grabbed her clothes.  The changes were coming, and with a sharp pain, they happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, are you alright?\u201d Felicia asked as she entered the room.<br>\r\n\u201cPain.\u201d Peter managed to grind through her teeth.<br>\r\nImmediately, Felicia saw Peter\u2019s hair almost double in length.  Her breasts swelled to an extra cup size, and her ass seemed to fill out more.<br>\r\nPeter\u2019s hands fell onto her knee caps as the changes happened.  \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s not as bad as I think it is.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s much worse.\u201d Felicia said in a voice, trying not to break out into a giant grin.<br>\r\nNearly naked, Peter looked up at one of the vanity mirrors, brushing her hair out of the way, she saw that her face was a smudge of colours thanks to all the running make-up.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a rainbow vomited on my face.\u201d she said, her voice at an even higher octave than when she last spoke.  Grabbing an instant make-up removal cloth, she brushed off the cosmetic goop until she showed some natural looking colours again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy face changed.\u201d she said.  Her lips were poutier, her eyes had more of a doe-like quality, her nose seemed daintier, and jaw was much less defined.  Felicia took a step back in surprise as Parker looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is so much prettier than me.\u201d Felicia thought to herself.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Pete asked her.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d came her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked dumbly at her for a moment, before Felicia decided to take charge.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get you dressed.\u201d she suggested, as she picked up some clothes, and handed them to Peter.<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Peter said, as she struggled to fit them on.  \u201cI think my hips became wider too.\u201d Peter whined.<br>\r\nAs Felicia took off her heels, she noticed that Peter was now two inches smaller than her, but made no mention of it.  Peter had always been above average height for a man.  No need at embarrassing her any more than was she already had.  Felicia felt a bit of guilt for bringing her outside in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, the girls were dressed and walking towards the exit.<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Mary Jane said.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting for the police to arrive.\u201d Felicia promised.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like you have a record, right?\u201d MJ said in a harsh voice.<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to leave, MJ. Okay?\u201d replied Peter.<br>\r\n\u201cIt took me a while PETER, but I\u2019d recognize those moves anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Pete said.<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, are you okay?  Did this bitch put you under some spell? Blink twice for yes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know who you think I am, but I\u2019m not Peter.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, are you going to feel stupid in the morning.\u201d Felicia said to MJ.  \u201cMistaking your ex for this goddess?  It\u2019s models like you who give the rest a reputation for being stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know it seems crazy, but it\u2019s not.  We\u2019ve spent enough time together.  I think I\u2019d know him anywhere.  Even when he is a her.\u201d MJ explained.<br>\r\n\u201cMJ, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not well.  We all just experienced a traumatic event, and you\u2019re not thinking straight.  I know you want Peter to be here for you, but she is obviously not Peter.\u201d Felicia said.<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you KAT. I was talking to her.  If she\u2019s not Peter, let her look me in the eye and say it to my face.\u201d<br>\r\nPeter look straight at Mary Jane.  \u201cMJ I\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Like a rapid puberty or something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Just like that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPeter.

Peter just wanted to stay in and let the effects wear off, Felicia wanted a girls day on the town, mostly for her own amusement.  And it didn\u2019t go as planned at all, instead of the dorky Peter making her look prettier by comparison, it seems that all the men wanted the girl with Spider-powers.   But she could at least take some consolation that their day on the town stopped two robbery attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the changes happening to Peter\u2019s unstable DNA, there was a good chance that she\u2019d end up in a situation she\u2019d forget.  Felicia owed it to Peter to try and protect him from the dangers of womanhood, which there were more than she cared to admit, like falling for the dorky scientist boy-next-door, who happened to be a costumed crime fighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d only admit it to herself, she loved Peter Parker, but she knew that it was an unrequited love, one that Peter would only return if she played her cards right.  And this was an open opportunity if ever she had one.   Clearly her friend was feeling vulnerable and needed someone stable to balance her.  Felicia would be that stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time of day, it would usually be quicker to take the subway to one of two places, Peter\u2019s apartment, or hers.   She remembered that she left her window unlocked; Peter could crawl in and sleep if she wanted.  That meant that it was more important for her to check Peter\u2019s apartment out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled down from the roof, looked at her reflection in a store window to make sure she was presentable, and walked towards the subway station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few wolf-whistles from passersby would usually annoy her as it would make her feel too objectified, but this time she felt flattered.  It was nice to know that without Peter beside her, she was still the hottest woman on the block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Subway ride was surprisingly uneventful, not one instance mugging, or pickpocketing, or hostage taking happened.  She was downright disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling up Peter\u2019s fire escape, she looked into the apartment.  \u201cHello?\u201d she yelled, as she knocked on the glass.   Nothing, no lights, no clothes on the floor, and no sign of entry into the area.<br>\r\n\u201cHey get down from there, or I\u2019m calling the cops!\u201d said a random New Yorker from the alley below her.<br>\r\nFelicia looked at herself, she was wearing her civilian clothes, and felt unusually exposed in them.   She didn\u2019t usually climb up sides of the building without a mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly hopped down and landed right in front of the man.  \u201cSorry, just practicing for my parkour group.\u201d she said with a wink.  The man stood stunned at her athleticism. Not risking her being a mutant, he managed to let out the word \u201cgood,\u201d before turning around and briskly walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia again went onto the subway and rode back to her apartment, if Peter wasn\u2019t there, than she\u2019d get a bite to eat and search the skylines as the Black Cat.</span></div></div>",

She walked up her building steps, more tired than she should have been.  She didn\u2019t get the best sleep the night before, ( the large diamond underneath her bed was reason enough why,) and taking Peter wound the town to show off her curves was much more trouble than she thought it would be.   Her stylish shoes were starting to wear on her ankles, if she was honest with herself, her deodorant was starting to wear out.  She needed a hot bath, and was sure that Peter could survive one extra hour in New York City as a woman so that she could refresh herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached her apartment, she heard laughter coming from the neighbouring apartment.  \u201cThat\u2019s good, Larry is never laughing,\u201d she thought.  A playful shriek of a woman\u2019s voice came out, followed by feminine laughter.  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t usually play his porn this loud.\u201d Felicia realized.  She was about to unlock her apartment door when a terrible thought hit her.  Woman\u2019s intuition told her that she had to interrupt Larry, even though she\u2019d hate the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia knocked on the door, twice.

First please keep the noise down, I don\u2019t want to hear whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSecond, do you know if my friend showed up here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMay?\u201d<br>\r\nFelicia thought for a few seconds trying to remember what alias Peter used.  \u201cYes, May.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMay, you\u2019re friend\u2019s here.\u201d He yelled.<br>\r\nAn almost inaudible pair of footsteps hustled to the door.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Felicia,\u201d May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia\u2019s mouth dropped open, creating a noticeable \u2018O\u2019 shape.  Peter was wearing a silk babydoll, which was barely translucent.  Squinting her eyes could reveal the clear outline of her darkened nipples.  She was wearing a pair of Felicia\u2019s panties, and she was wearing fishnets, which stretchmark\u2019s formed into Spider-Webs.   Peter was even wearing Spider-themed earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand, \u2018May\u2019 had a bottle of wine, and Felicia could smell the alcohol on her breath as well. \u201cMay? Are you feeling okay?\u201d Felicia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeshh.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMay, can I talk to you alone, for a second?\u201d<br>\r\nPeter walked outside into the hallway, partially closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, you know what you\u2019re doing, right? I mean you\u2019re a guy.\u201d<br>\r\nPeter looked down at her breasts and jiggled one with her free hand.  \u201cDo I look like a guy to you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the quickest way to return to normal. Speed up the anti-diuretic hormone to increase diuresis,\u201d she said slowly, thinking at what to say for every word.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only hormone that the alcohol is speeding up.\u201d Felicia said as Peter fell against her chest, her powers inadvertently activating as she got stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry opened the door to see May\u2019s face planted in Felicia\u2019s breasts, trying to push herself out.<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend is a wild one. I mean she sticks to walls.\u201d he said with a wink.<br>\r\nFelicia could now smell the funky odor coming from Larry\u2019s room.  \u201cShe\u2019s coming with me.\u201d Felicia said.<br>\r\n\u201cI think the woman is capable of deciding if she wants to finish or not.\u201d<br>\r\nFelicia looked at the woman who had just unstuck her head from her boobs.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to come with me, or finish up with Larry here?\u201d Felicia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her eyes, Felicia could see that Peter was split, she didn\u2019t want to let anyone down.  After a few seconds of thought, Peter turned back to Larry.  \u201cI\u2019m going with Felicia.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to leave me hanging?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe does that, a lot.\u201d Felicia interrupted.<br>\r\nLarry slammed the door shut.   Seconds later, the sound of a porn video came on television, followed by inconsistent grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot your clothes in there.\u201d Peter said, ashamed of herself.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them later.  You just come inside my apartment and clean yourself up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies entered Felicia\u2019s apartment, and shortly after Larry\u2019s apartment went silent.</span></div></div>",

I had fun.  Really.  It washn\u2019t as bad as I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re so drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy body\u2019sh not handling alcohol.  That\u2019s a good thing.  I\u2019m dehydrating myself.\u201d she said very slowly.<br>\r\n\u201cDehydrating yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve pished four times already.\u201d  Peter explained while holding up four wobbly fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit Felicia, the reason the girl in front of her was drinking was to speed up reversing the process.  The quicker she dehydrated, the quicker the chemicals would revert her DNA back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Peter, do you still like men?\u201d Felicia asked in a way that was both playful and serious.<br>\r\nPeter just blushed, or more likely, she was flushed.<br>\r\n\u201cThe shprinklers.  They effected my brain, uh, thought process.  Too mush water.  I found myself making out wish strangers, forshibly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh Peter.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMade it back here.  Waited, waited.  Larry kept shaying hi.  Went in, hish foreplay wash beer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that gave you this idea.\u201d<br>\r\nPeter nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked at the bedroom clothes her friend was wearing, and realized that sections of it would glow under a black light. <br>\r\n\u201cPeter, we\u2019re burning those clothes and getting you some real ones.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHold that thought.\u201d Peter said as she raced towards the toilet.  Felicia followed and held her hair up as the spider-powered girl violently vomited in the toilet.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t look.  Let me flush.\u201d Peter said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll order some greasy food.\u201d Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a pleasant night, Peter only seemed to piss and vomit, as the night went on.  But slowly, her face became more defined.  She grew taller, centimeter by centimeter.  Muscle mass began to form on her limbs, and soon moved its way to her torso, as the breasts became reduced and her chest area hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was in pain, but it was a growing pain.  She help passing out, and eventually Felicia took a peak under her pants to see his the sex organs had transferred.  She had, but was disappointed by the size.   The checked about five hours later, and found that Peter had completely returned to normal, physically at least.  She\u2019d have to wait until Peter came to in order to see if he had his wonderful dorky mind back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose over New York, sneaking through Felicia\u2019s unlocked window, and hitting Parker\u2019s face.  Peter opened his eyes and saw the cat burglar sitting over him.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, how do you feel Pete?\u201d Felicia asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026please tell me that yesterday was just a terrible nightmare.\u201d<br>\r\nFelicia giggled.  \u201cNo such luck babe.\u201d<br>\r\nPeter grabbed a pillow and placed it over his face.  \u201cMaybe I can smother myself to death.\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter Parker, don\u2019t you dare try and smother yourself to death in my apartment.  Do you have any idea what it would do to my value?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a terrible dream.  Nothing you can say can convince me otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFeel your hair.\u201d Felicia said.  Peter put his hands behind his head and felt the hair flow all the way to his back.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut it before you go.\u201d<br>\r\nParker jumped up from the couch to the roof, and hung upside-down, his long hair shooting straight down like a waterfall.<br>\r\n\u201cLeast I still have my powers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s working?\u201d Felicia asked as she started to undo her blouse.<br>\r\n\u201cYa, I guess so.\u201d Peter said.<br>\r\nFelicia sighed.  \u201cYou are such a dork,\u201d she yelled as she threw a nearby pillow at his face.<br>\r\n\u201cTypical Parker luck.\u201d He told himself.</span></div></div>",

No one seemed to hang it over his head, and no one asked him any questions about it.  But like anything in his life, good luck never lasted long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Avengers tower, Peter Parker, as Spider-Man was having lunch before a meeting, eating Wheaties to keep up his strength.  \u201cCan I see you for a second?\u201d Tony Stark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony Stark was the Avengers main funder, a playboy millionaire, who had developed an Iron suit and become one of the world\u2019s most successful heroes.  \u201cSure.\u201d Peter replied as he walked towards Tony\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, do you have a sister I should know about?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCarol Danvers complained that a fashion show was using her image.  I told her it was for charity, but did a facial recognition scan.  And do you know what I found?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing of interest?\u201d Peter quipped.<br>\r\n\u201cI found that her face had a 95% match to yours.  Sure the chin and nose are smaller, the lips are more luscious, but the ears, eyes, skull shape are incredibly similar.   Thanks to Reed\u2019s new ulta-definition cameras, we were able to scan her eyes, and the strangest thing happened.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe eyes were a 95% match to our retinal scans of yours.  That\u2019s a similarity that twins have.  But I looked in the database, and found that you don\u2019t have a twin sister.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just as surprised as you are Tony.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can see that.\u201d  Tony ripped the picture of the girl in the Ms. Marvel uniform out of the camera.  \u201cI\u2019m going to study this much more intimately tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the way he said intimately.\u201d thought Peter.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry Pete, if I don\u2019t find anything tonight, I\u2019ll send my best men to track her down.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you?\u201d Peter said.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you have a twin sister, I\u2019ll make sure you know about her.  But if you remember her, give her this card.  It\u2019s my private number, and she looks like a good lay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick, again.\u201d Peter thought.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else you want to get off your chest?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo Tony.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019re done here.  You can go back to eating breakfast.\u201d Tony said, and Peter was sure he heard a chuckle as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallway, the clawed mutant known as Wolverine was posting pictures of the mysterious woman on the walls.<br>\r\n\u201cHey bub, at least they got yer good side.\u201d he snickered.<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be dead you troll?\u201d Peter yelled, and Wolverine continued to put up the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker slumped down defeated, someone figured it out.  Now he could never show his face around here again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning\u2026he\u2026he\u2026Parker,\u201d Dr. Henry Pym giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat now Ant-Man is mocking me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sat back down at the table and sighed, a lot.  His luck was never going to change.  It was the curse of being Spider-Man.  Although maybe if he could expose himself to the chemical again he could make some money from Stark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter stopped his thinking.  Thinking was dangerous.  He went back to eating Wheaties.</span></div></div>",

He was finally fitting in at school and making friends, his spider patrols were progressing nicely, and the people of New York were warming up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something was bugging him, his spider-sense itching at the back of his mind. He had come into the role of Spider-Man naturally at last and yet being so close to the machine that brought universes together... it made him feel weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Miles know that his proximity to the super-collider was altering the very reality around him.

But stopping the noise wouldn't stop the march of time and he had to reluctantly push himself off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles stretched his arms wide, dreading the start of the new day. Patrols had taken up a lot of time last night and he was nowhere near prepared for his math exam. No use putting it off, however, and he quickly went to work on getting on his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh.</i> With the arrival of Spider-powers, he had to get his uniform refitted. Yet it seemed like this uniform size was now too big. <i>I must have overestimated the growth spurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing aside these thoughts, Miles quickly went to work gathering his things together. Yet a few other things seemed odd. His hair seemed a little longer than usual, curls trailing down his neck a few inches. His body hair, or what little h had, had vanished in comparison. Reaching between his roommate and the desk to get to his backpack didn't take as much effort as he remembered. Had his arm slimmed down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the changes coming with Spider-Man, Miles supposed things like this would just be explained in their own time. Did Spiders even have body hair? He wasn't entirely sure. He just knew he had classes and Spider-work to complete before heading back home for the weekend. Just one more day befofe he could enjoy a little relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that things would settle, Miles ventured out into the academy to continue his day.</span></div></div>",

His spider-sense was \"handy\" enough to let him know when eyes were on him, which did just wonders for his anxieties. And today, it seemed to be telling him that people were looking at him... differently. It didn't seem to be attraction or awe (or at least not yet). But there was definitely something off. His roommate Ganke was oddly less comfortable talking about his comics than he was before. His classmate Judge, who he had gotten along with fairly well so far, gave him a few puzzled looks before seeming to accept him once again. It was a disconcerting change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing he noticed was the newfound ease at which girls approached him. He wasn't exactly Mr. Unpopular but he wasn't despised or anything either. Still, he wasn't expecting to be approached by two girls from his class. He recognized one at least: Barbara Rodriguez. Full of about as many sarcastic quips as Spider-Man, but on a more musical career path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned on the lunch table, fixing Miles with a serious look. \"Miles, you can settle a bet for us, right?\" She gestured to her friend. \"Becca says she'd fuck Daredevil, marry Luke Cage, kill Spider-Man. I say fuck Luke Cage, marry Spider-Man, kill Daredevil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca lifted up her hands defensively. \"I just think Luke Cage would be a good husband! He's got that gentle giant thing going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara waved her off dismissively. \"Where are you on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles didn't know how to react. \"You're asking <i>me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... why do you think I'd know?\" He didn't think he was smooth with the ladies, but he didn't expect question like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara rolled her eyes. \"You're harmless so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a compliment?\" He wasn't sure how he felt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should take it as one. You've got a... trustworthy aura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does <i>that</i> mean?\" Although he found that much easier to accept. Trustworthy felt like natural Spider-Man charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just answer the question, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles pinched the bridge of his nose. \"I dunno, fuck Spider-Man, marry Luke Cage, kill Daredevil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls groaned. \"You were supposed to be our tie-breaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll show us. Hey, if you're at the mall this weekend, text us. We can hang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to force himself not to look too pleased with that. \"Uh- yeah! Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls waved to him casually as they left. He waved to them awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school was a weird time. Luckily, the day would end quickly. The teacher didn't seem to call on him as much and the only other thing bothering him was the way boys seemed to be casually looking over in his direction before catching themselves. What were they expecting to see...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a cheerful walk downtown, he could return home. But even that seemed different from usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's been bothering you at school, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles had to double take at his father. \"Yeah, its been fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJefferson's face was fixed in a stern look. \"No troublemakers? Because I can cause them some trouble if they're giving you any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, really, its been going great.\" Mr. Morales hadn't exactly been an <i>un</i>protective father, but he tended to have a \"stick with it\" philosophy to things. Now, he seemed pretty nervous about his son being off in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the weirdness of the day, Miles was really looking forward to busting up some crime.</span></div></div>",

It sounded like a compliment but it also felt like a weird way to describe a person just generally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bothered him so much, he found himself pausing to look himself over in mirrors. Was there something wrong with him? He couldn't deny that he was slimmer than usual. In fact, looking at the whole picture, there was an almost shapely quality to his hips and pecs that didn't exist before. Could that be the problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe,</i> spoke a new thought in Miles' mind. <i>The problem is you aren't shapely enough.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unfamiliar concern, but teenage anxieties quickly took a grip onto the idea. That was it, wasn't it? He was too gangly, too thin. He just wasn't attractive enough for anyone to take notice of him. Barbara didn't consider him a threat, and Ganke and Judge clearly considered him a nuisance. He was just an ugly, gawky, little weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFears about his appearance wrapped around Miles' mind, needling him with new anxieties over hair and body and weight and all the reasons he was undateable. By the end of the night, he just wanted to cuddle up to a pillow and try to sleep away his fears. He couldn't think of any way he could wipe away these newfound paranoias. Maybe there was an expert for things like this.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but treasure what sleep he could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shuffled into his clothes, he couldn't help but look himself over in the mirror. Maybe the costume made it look like he had extra weight. Somehow, he looked even slimmer than before. His hair was certainly growing longer and curlier at a faster pace than usual. His face softer, lips fuller. What was a decent amount of muscle had shifted into a small chest that his brain wasn't ready to recognize as what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his brain focused on the negative. His clothes were definitely too big for him now. Images of girls whispering behind his back, gossiping about his lack of taste, haunted his mind. He quickly fired a text off in Barbara's direction. He <i>needed</i> something more fashionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he met with the girls that he began to wonder if something was wrong with him. While there had been an enjoyable amount of laughing and gossiping over snacks (which he wasn't quite used to but couldn't help getting invested in), it was the actual shopping that got to him. The girls were all shopping for things he had no interest in! Perfume, lipstick, even bras.... This wasn't what he signed up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger was how quickly the girls seemed to accept his presence without the blink of an eye. They even dragged him into the girl's clothing section to get something for <i>him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Miles, you never get anything for yourself when we go out!\" Barbara huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've <i>never</i> gone out with you guys before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly my point! You need to treat yourself.\" She pulled a flowery dress from the rack and pressed it against his chest. \"This could look great on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled back, a retreat blocked by one of the others. \"Guys! These aren't... my kinda thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara crossed her arms. \"Well, you aren't leaving until we find you something that <i>is</i> your thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Becca placed a hand on Miles' shoulder. \"You've been kinda stressed since you arrived at Visions. Wouldn't it be good to do something nice for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...They made a compelling point. With everything else going on in his life, he hadn't had much time for himself. Maybe it was time for him to do something for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...alright, alright, I'll try something on, if it'll make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>would.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, he quickly took his pick off the rack and escaped into the changing room.</span></div></div>",

School and Spider-activities both got a little easier, with the right help:May Parker generously provided some of Peter's old journals, aiding his patrol circuits immensely; Supervillains had been lying low ever since Fisk had been arrested; and with his roommate, Ganke's help, he was able to catch up on the work he missed (and get some quipping advice.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, everything was pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the stability of Miles' life, the source of his powers wasn't. The fabric of dimensions was a tricky thing: it liked to keep everything in its place. When the Supercollider had fired before, the strings of the multiverse were inextricably close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose enough to bring about a veritable army of Spider-People. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose enough to give Wilson Fisk hope for a second chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose enough to give Miles Morales his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, the spider that bit Miles was an interdimensional tourist itself. It had escaped the Collider's chambers during a more inconsequential test involving household furniture and made its way to the unwitting Miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bite spliced his DNA with a dimensionally displaced creature, something that normally has the consequence of rapid cell death. But Miles fits a 'niche' in his own universe. A Spider-Person shaped niche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the unique situation of Miles isn't quite 'recognized,' so to speak. He doesn't quite fit.

As an heiress to a massive, almost unending fortune she had influence, but using it for anything other than furthering her popularity and social status meant nothing to her.Toni lived for likes and views of social media as, to her, those were all that mattered. Sure, a lot of them were just sad guys whacking off to her, but she couldn't control that. It actually made her feel even better, knowing that she was desired, even by people she considered absolute losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni reached the park and glanced around and sighed with annoyance before tapping her phone a couple of times.

He sounded out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy, I have been standing here in the parking lot for three minutes! Where are you?\" Toni barked to her bodyguard. He'd only been hired a few months ago, part of a 'protection plan' that her handler/agent/employeemom Pepper Potts had drummed up with help from her Uncle Obadiah after a prankster had goosed her at a social event. And not that Obadiah Stane was actually her uncle, but he had been running the weapons company her father had built since her mother and father were killed in a car accident when she was very young. Toni was pretty sure that she loved him like a father, but then again, she was pretty sure she'd love anyone that doted on her the same way he did. And Toni was pretty sure he was dating Pepper. Not that Pepper Potts was bad...She was a good agent but sometimes she was just SO overbearing and protective. Toni was sixteen! She was allowed to have her independence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ms. Stark! I had to chase away the paparrazi! I'll be there in a minute!\" Came his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be, or I'll find someone else! Like that Natalie Rushman! Then I'd have a bodyguard with some fashion sense!\" Toni's voice was bratty, hateful. But she meant every word. While Happy seemed nice enough, it was just weird having to hang out with an older guy all the time. She tapped her designer sandal'd foot impatiently, unaware that the Arc reactor in her chest slowly shifted and parted, turning into a glowing blue crystal necklace and matching ear rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut true to his word, Happy was there in the lavish sports car that Toni was pretty sure she owned, and she climbed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! All right Happy, take me into the city! I want to visit Maria Hill's before it closes!\" Toni's favorite store was Maria Hill's, who in this new reality created by Loki, was now a top fashion designer with her own stores all of the globe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms. Stark!\" Happy replied, stepping on the gas as the sports car roared out of the parking lot.</span></div></div>",

She was attractive, athletic, kind, and generous. She was everything any girl at school wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve frowned at these kinds of thoughts. Did she really have such a big ego? True, she was strong and athletic, but she wasn't sure if she thought of herself in such flattering terms. She just wanted to support her school, in any way she could. It was full of such wonderful people. It was her duty to make sure every student, whether on her team or otherwise, felt welcome.</span></div></div>",

She had every routine memorized, but keeping practice was essential. The school deserved a rehearsed, perfect cheer for all its amazing students and staff. It was the patriotic thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her routine complete, Eve made her way through the hall of the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">mansion</span> dorms. With her work-out complete, she still had so much to do! As Captain of the cheer squad, she needed to make sure everyone knew which events they were cheering for. The student council might need help fund-raising other clubs; she <i>had</i> to make sure there was at least one cheerleader ready to lead a helping hand. And that was on top of studying for school, attending after-school charities, and keeping an eye out for any students that looked like they needed someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much to do, she didn't have time to think about anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted with her mental to-do-list, Eve didn't notice the large man in the halls until they bumped shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" she apologized immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis unnecessary, miss...\" Thor trailed off, staring at the girl curiously. Eve was already several feet away, mind wrapped in thoughts of practice and bake sales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss!\" He shouted after her, startling her out of her reverie. \"How... What are you doing in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve blinked, tilting her head curiously. \"Heading to my computer to see if the student council has any new projects for us, mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How is this possible?</i>, Thor wondered in amazement. <i>Stark has metal guards surrounding the mansion on 24 hour surveillance! How could a Midgardian child such as this bypass his security?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you enter our domain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve frowned slightly, parsing his words. How...? Oh! She smiled a bright smile. \"You mean the code to the training room? Its in your student handbook, page 34!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Thor's turn to blink in confusion. \"Student... handbook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed lightly. \"In your dorm! Every student got one. If you lost yours, you should head to the main school and ask for a spare copy!\" She checked her watch. \"Sorry Thor, I gotta go- just don't be so ditzy you walk into the girl's changing rooms again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Thor could protest, Eve had vanished around the corner.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something was terribly wrong in the Avengers Mansion and Thor had to figure out <i>what.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was, it was so difficult to spot all the clues. Signs that should be obvious required immense mental strength to fully comprehend. It took three loops around the second floor before the  God of Thunder realized that several rooms had disappeared or been replaced. What had once been a conference room was now a lounge with couches and a TV. When he looked out the window, it seemed to him that the Mansion had been split into two buildings. <i>Tis almost like some sort of private Midgardian campus? But how can this be...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite what his heart and memories told him, his mind seemed to remain unusually calm. <i>This is all perfectly normal. The mansion was always like this. One building for dorms, the other for work. No need to trouble yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the most startling change was when he briefly stopped near the room of Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, the heroes known as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The former was wrapped in the middle of his scientific experiments, working on building some sort of mechanical device. His hair was disheveled and he had let some stubble grow on his cheeks. The latter was relaxing in a chair, reading a fashion magazine. Janet was perhaps, in Thor's experience, the most fashionable human he had met on Midgard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend Pym, hast thou noticed unusual changes recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, definitely Thor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor grinned. Excellent! Perhaps he was getting somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My latest experiment with the Pym particles has had a surprising chemical reaction to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's troubling you, blondie?\" Ah, Janet. Always with the good humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something appears amiss. I struggle to define what is troubling me, but rest assured, I will track it down to its source!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we see anything out of the ordinary, we'll be right there to kick some baddy butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a laugh. \"I shall save some villains for your fists, compatriot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor once again circled the building, trying to find the mystery that was ailing him. It was on the tip of his tongue, yet his brain couldn't quite make the mental leap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cry from the dorms! The God raced to the room of Pym, ready to catch the villain in the act. \"Halt your assault, knave, or face the hammer of the Mighty Thor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thank you</i>, Thor!\" A teenage girl with blonde hair was shoving away a brown-haired boy, looking incredibly annoyed. \"Would you drag John somewhere he can't bother me? Some of us are trying to complete homework!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not a villainous assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'moooon,\" whined the boy named John. \"You've been studying for hours, Hannah! Can't your particle whatsit theories stay on hold for a few hours? We could go to a park or a b-ball court-\" He paused to flex demonstratively. \"And I could show you my moves~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah\" rolled her eyes. \"If I'm going to do well at the science fair in a few months, I need complete concentration. Take Hulk if you need company so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn flopped into the chair grumpily, pushing aside a sports magazine. \"Back me up, Thor. Prissy Pym here can't stay cooped up indoors forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor considered himself a fighter of great prowess, with quick instincts and a keen mind. Yet all he could do now was stare, mouth flopping like a fish. \"I... apologize, I am afraid I might be in the wrong room. Where are my fellow warriors? Hank and Janet were here a second ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn snorted. \"Smooth cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked slightly more concerned than her fellow teen. \"You... feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey recognized him, just like the girl in the halls... But they were but Midgardian youths! How was it possible? He gripped his forehead in bafflement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name... is Hannah Pym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Since I was born, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you are not Ant-Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow John looked concerned. \"D'you hit your head, bud? D-do you need to go to the nurse or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor backed away slowly. \"Ah... No assistance necessary, strange youths. I shall relocate myself elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens glanced at each in mild alarm as Thor quickly escaped from the room. Mansion changing, heroes changing, <i>everything</i> changing. Yet somehow similar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sorcery was this?!</span></div></div>",

If he could escape this mysterious spell, find aid outside the mansion, perhaps he could end this foul scheme against the Avengers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor could feel the dorms playing tricks on him. Moving the stairs to the opposite end of the floor, changing hallways when his back was turned, reinforcing windows when he attempted to hammer his way through... But finally, he managed to reach the front of the building. Only a few more steps and he could return with-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving so soon, brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun quickly.  Loki, God of Mischief and Lies, grinned wickedly from the couch. \"I must say, mortals really must update their waiting room magazines. This copy of People is at least three months old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Loki.</i>\" Thor growled. \"What sort of witchcraft have you cast this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frost giant smirked, rising from his seat. \"A few parlor tricks, advanced to levels never seen before by anyone of the Nine Realms. A few illusions there, a body shift spell there, memory alterations here and there... Simple on their own, but with an enchanted ring circled around your mansion, I have lifted its potential to new heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End your spell, brother, before I find where you <i>truly</i> have hidden yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki laughed in surprise. \"Finally caught on to one of my basic tricks then? Yes, I won't be entering your base without magical protection over myself. Anyone that enters the magical circle will change as your friends have. The school is <i>always</i> accepting new students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus capturing any other heroes, Avengers or otherwise, under Loki's spell. Damn. \"Your spell has not dominated I, brother. Once I leave through these doors, I shall find you post-haste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mischief maker raised a solitary eyebrow. \"Those doors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes brother, those-\" The doors were gone and Thor was facing a brick wall. On the second floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't really think I'd let you get that close to exit, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, end this madness once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA villainous grin overtook Loki's face. \"Yes.... perhaps you are right. Watching you run in circles and panic at the changes to the patriot and the insects has been amusing, but I think its time you see what identity I've crafted for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor's eyes widened in horror. \"You would not dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took a long time to decide. Deviating too much from your original personality might stretch the power of spell, giving you an inkling of what's happened to you... but <i>that</i> sounds amusing too, doesn't it? Aware of what I've done, but struggling to fight it for a little longer? They're both tempting options in their own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his staff melodramatically and Thor felt the changes overtake him. His height and build shrunk immensely, his hair lengthened, his entire body shifted and changed to fit the new identity created for him. He could feel the fog overtake his mind, trying to destroy every bit of himself. He had to resist! He was the Mighty Thor! He had fought giants, demons, and Midgardian creations of all kinds. He could beat his brother's villainous magic! He was the Mighty Thor! He was....</span></div></div>",

The two had a close bond, both foreign exchange students in an unfamiliar country, heirs to wealthy homes, and a habit of speaking quite formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... sounded right. Didn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright? Hannah and John said you were acting strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange? Her? Thor brushed her hair out from under her blue jacket and silver-dotted tank top. Yes, she supposed something did feel off today. She just had trouble defining it. What was it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need for concern, my friend. I was troubled by a mere headache, nothing more.\" She blinked at the sound of her voice. Was it always that light and high-pitched...? Of course it was. What else could it sound like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT'Challa sighed in relief. \"That is good to hear.\" A smirk rose on her lips. \"I had a feeling John was trying to show Hannah how considerate he was by creating problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor laughed in surprise. \"I thought rumor was below you, T'Challa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumor is based on suspicion. A keen observer can tell when a man is trying to impress with no trouble.\" She frowned slightly. \"But Thor, I told you that name in confidence. Remember: my father has me under the name \"Lucy Charles\" to avoid any discovery from his business rivals hoping to embarrass us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor felt another moment of confusion. Since when had T'Challa required a fake name... But the answer came quickly. As a future princess of that country Wakanda, of course T'Challa wanted to remain under the radar while she received her education. How could she have forgotten? Thor's own father was a politician in Sweden, so she understood the desire for secrecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, my friend. I was behaving, as John and Toni might say, like a ditz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnort. \"I wouldn't go that far. I know I can trust another foreigner in America, especially one as loyal as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked off together, discussing various classes and events present in their daily lives. Neither of them heard the fiendish cackling of an Asgardian.</span></div></div>",

Something about that seemed wrong somehow. Shouldn't she be doing something much more active than that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up quickly, only to feel a sharp pain in her leg. She straightened her glasses and looked down. Of course. Being active wasn't really an option for her. After an injury in elementary school, Donna needed a leg guard and a cane to walk around. Even now, it hurt to move too quickly or to exert herself beyond her means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about that felt wrong too. She brushed her fingers through her short, dirty blonde hair which only went as far as her chin.

Pages of hardware and engineering books that would be more interesting to the likes of Toni nearly exhausted Donna's patience until she paused on one entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythical Weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a mission of mystery, Donna walked to the appropriate section and pulled the book from the shelf. She flipped through pages until finally, at last, the image of Mjolner was proudly displayed in the middle of the colorful book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rush of familiarity overtook Donna and she had to lean against the shelf to stop herself from falling over. She eyes skimmed through the text, looking through anything of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Norse myths... only the worthy... wielded by Thor, God of Thunder...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the book shut, breathing in terror. Why? Why was she so scared of what she'd find? What was wrong with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands drifted along the shelves, feeling the binds of every book. Eventually, it stopped on a big, sparkling cover with the label \"Norse Mythology and You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could stop herself, she was back at the table, pouring over every legend and tale and myth she could find. Tales of heroic battles, astounding tricks, incredible feats, and faraway lands. And with each word she read, it all became crystal clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Thor Odinson. God of Thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind screamed that she was going insane, she was just a girl, everything was normal everything was normal <i>everything was normal.</i> But she could not deny the increasing confidence in these stories and the memories they stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A scheme by Loki then,' she thought to herself. 'If my memories are real, Odin once turned Thor into an ordinary doctor named Donald Blake in order to humble him. Only after Donald proved himself could Thor's memory and identity be returned to him. Loki must have made me, Donna Blake, as a reminder of Thor's original failure to live up to his father and his hammer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure how she felt about that. She was still Donna, even if she was also Thor. She didn't like to think of herself as an insult. Nonetheless, Loki was messing with the minds of mortals. As a doctor in training, she couldn't let that happen. Even if it might lead to the end of her existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? Even with this knowledge, the idea of confronting anyone or even speaking over a quiet whisper seemed terrifying. Loki had made sure her confidence was shot to hell and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only two things that could help her now. She either had to find Mjolner and regain the powers of Thor or she had to find a way to convince one of the other students that she had been changed. That maybe all of them had been changed.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I should take a break...\" Donna muttered to herself, holding her head in her hands and doing her best to ease the headache by rubbing her temples. It was true, Donna had been crunching the books hard in order to impress Ms. Foster, the science professor at the school. Most of it was just the need for pure academic success, impress the teacher, get a good letter of reference and possibly even some intern opportunities, but a part of Donna, a secret hidden part, knew that she was attracted to her favorite teacher. Which was strange, because she knew that otherwise, she was as straight as an arrow, men, particularly muscled ones, excited her, but there was something about Ms. Foster that she couldn't help but think about late at night in her dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dorm sounds pretty good right about now\" The bookworm muttered to herself and she slowly and carefully pulled herself to her feet, stabilizing herself on her cane before leaning over to gather her things. She slid her enormous notebook that was crammed full of notes into her denim backpack before stacking the three books she had been reading, two medical journals and a textbook on anatomy and biology and tucking them beneath one arm before hobbling towards the large desk that guarded the library's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, behind the desk sat the librarian, Ms. Heimdala, a ridiculously attractive African-Scandinavian whose mixed heritage had given her a knock-out body and flowing black hair that she kept styled with a massive golden hair clip, while two huge hooped earings hung off her earlobes. Even her soft, brown eyes were flecked with gold, and showed a highly keen and watchful intelligence despite the fact that the librarian hardly ever spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, was not one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ms. Blake. I hope you are not thinking about taking my books without checking them out first\" Heimdala's voice was smooth, pleasant, but her eyes betrayed and cordial nature. They were watching Donna like a hawk as she suddenly realized that she had been headed out the door without checking the books out first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, sorry Ms. Heimdala. I've got a headache coming on, I was just focused on getting back to my room and laying down for a bit\" Donna said as she laid her books on the counter, giving the stoic librarian a small, nervous smile as she fished her library card out of her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My condolences, but please do not make the same mistake again. I would hate to have to place you on probation over such a silly and avoidable mistake\" Heimdala said as she scanned the barcodes of the books with a impossible large and somewhat old fashioned scanner. Donna stared at it for a moment and lamented how, even in such a prestigious academy such as this, the modern world didn't seem to care enough to fund teacher who arguably had one of the most important jobs in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I can't change the world' Donna thought to herself as she signed the receipt the librarian handed to her, 'All I can hope to do is get out of here and get a good hospital job. Maybe I'll figure out a way to fix my leg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there you go, Ms. Blake\" Heimdala said as she took the receipt from Donna and placed it within a lockbox next to her computer monitor. \"Make sure that you return these by next week. I will know if you did not. I know of every book that has been taken from my library, and I know where they are at at all times. I WILL come find you and make you pay a late fee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gulped at the thought of Heimdala stalking through the hallways of the academy, searching for Donna and leaping on the somewhat crippled girl like a tiger, \"Uh, yes ma'am!\" And with that, Donna gathered her books and make her way slowly back to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two changed Asgardians noticed the invisible trickster god laughing at his own antics, though Heimdala did give the library a slow, piercing scan before going back to her paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, 'brother!\" Loki laughed as he moved on to witness the change of another Avenger.</span></div></div>",

Usually the Professor X first team rarely practice together since they became more and more evolved at the bureaucratic part of X-men, so this practice were so prized by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Scott Summers, aka Cyclops, were shooting his optic blasts against one of many robotic drones built to nullify their powers on the first contact. Close to him was Iceman, Robert Drake, building ice walls and making freezing some individual drones, usually lured by Warren Worthington III, the Angel or by Jean Grey, aka Phoenix or Marvel Girl, depending which power level she is right now. And the whole team effort were programmed by the first X-men genius, Hank Mac Coy the Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the air distorted around the room and a bright light filled it washing the four of five early X-men. When the bright light had faded away the things looked similar but at same time different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean Grey was the first to recover herself. She was wearing a very sexy green short dress and her long and  bright red hair seemed longer, reaching almost the end of her backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fine Warren?\" she asked for the deep blue skinned handsome man with blonde hair who was laid on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said he blue skinned elf like man \"it got me at the middle of a teleport\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody was expecting that\" said the crystalline man close to Warren. \"I was lucky I already was shifting from the organic steel to diamond form\" said Robert Drake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody\" said Scott Summers taking his breath and catching his shield \"How about we take a break?\" He said lowing his hood and revealing his face and the brown hair with a white central stripe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" said Jean Grey \"Computer play the 5th track from my music drive\" she said seconds before her mutant power start to generate light from the intense dubstep beat which started to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hank Mac Coy, the Beast remained static observing the new versions of his old friends. Front of him, at the computer screen he saw the settings established for the danger room. The mutants names listed were<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren Worthington III- Elf - teleportation and superior physical condition slightly beyond the top of humankind can reach in every physical aspect<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott Summers - Rogue - uncontrolled power theft by touch. Accidentally almost killed Captain America trying to save his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean Grey - Marvel Girl - sound and vibration control. Her body can generate intense amount of sound which let her fly, blast concentrated blasts of sound and phase thru solid matter, as well she can convert sound into other form of energies, mainly light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Drake - Metal - super strength, night invulnerability and can shift his body molecules between any form of metal or crystal</span></div></div>",

My mother and father were shocked to discover my existence. Yet I'm sure some of you already know this, but I'm telling those who are new about how I came into being,\" Marvel Warrior said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to use your origin story to subtly break the \"fourth wall\" Nate? How many times do I have to tell you to cut it out?\" Icewoman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Maybe I am or maybe I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could speak the Blackbird suddenly began take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, if we're all back here then who is piloting the Blackbird?\" Elf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Marvel Warrior starts to get concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm currently piloting the Blackbird. You guys have just been talking to an astral projection. Now let's get ready to rock'n'roll as we head to the old Essex lab in Arizona!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden rock'n'roll music begins to play. Marvel Warrior creates a sound shield to blockade the door to the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did Nate learn to pilot a plane!\" Elf yelled over the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! He probably uses one of the many powers that he copied to create a double of himself and sneak out at night!\" Laura aka Giganta yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that kid doesn't try to kill everyone we may as well suit up!\" Titanica yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea! Ladies suit up here while us men suit up in the back!\" Colossus yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed! Yet, I'm already in my suit!\" Marvel Warrior responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of light Marvel Warrior's projection changes appearance. Apparently Marvel Warrior was wearing a black and white jump suit with X's on his belt and chest. The other members of Nathaniel's team grumble amongst themselves as they get ready to suit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone is getting ready Marvel Warrior continues piloting the Blackbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I would say this, but being a teenager again rocks! Yet, this isn't the normal main reality though which sucks. I'll be perfectly fine if we're not able to change things back to normal. I know you readers may call me a hypocrite, but who wants to worry about turning into a mindless and soulless android every waking minute of their life? Besides, I've never have had this much fun in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock'n'roll music stops as a notification tells Marve Warrior that the team has arrived at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quick. Hopefully everyone is ready? We are about to land.\"</span></div></div>",

She has been illegally experimenting on humans for a long time. Some of those videos where she unleashed a gamma bomb are horrifying,\" Marvel Warrior said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maximoff, eh?

However, what Ororo's team didn't realize that the Sephirot with them was an imposter. The real Sephirot had left with Angel and the original X-Men an hour earlier than both Colossus's team and Ororo's team. The imposter was none other than the Scarlet Warlock who is an exact clone of Marvel Warrior sans his abilities. Both Marvel Warrior and Scarlet Warlock were created in Ms. Sinister's lab. Unlike Marvel Warrior who escaped to meet the very parents he was cloned from Scarlet Warlock stayed loyal to his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok everyone let's scan the area and search for Madam Bendore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't know who this Madam Bendore is, but I know that these guys are doomed. How stupid can they be? They haven't realized that I used a glamour spell to conceal my identity. Nor do they know that I'm a clone of Nathaniel. God, I always hated that guy. Sure we're both 6'4\" muscular hunks, but he gets all these powers while I only get the ability to cast spells.</i> Scarlet Warlock thought to himself as he followed Ororo's team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something strange in the air. It almost smells like Krakoa is alive...\" Ms. Wild said as she sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Polarity asked. \"I sense a strange increase in the magnetism here. Maybe Madam Bendore is building something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, but I can easily check with my super speed,\"Dazzler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't necessary Ken. Let's ask Sephirot what she thinks,\" Ororo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely Krokoa. He is in the process of revival,\" the fake Sephirot replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the others could comment a chunk of the island begain rumbling or so it appeared. In actuality this was a well crafted illusion created by the Scarlet Warlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X-Men! Get ready to put up a fight!\" Ororo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro and her team begin attacking Krokoa without realizing that they are under the Scarlet Warlock's spell.</span></div></div>",

Kitty what are you doing?\" Ororo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Sephirot.\" The Scarlet Warlock undoes his glamour spell. \"I'm the Scarlet Warlock. That's what you get for calling me Nathaniel.

He raced toward the figure of Bruce Banner, desperate to reach safety from whatever was about to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going- Oof!\" Banner quickly pushed Jones into the tent before the kid could say another word.

Yet he managed to escape the blast with only a few injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Jones was, of course, interrogated for hours and issued a fine of $1,000 for his behavior. For his part, he was all too willing to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, can I give you a ride home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce raised an eyebrow at the teen.

I'm alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. \"Feels like I owe you after all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't a bad kid, really.

The pain was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...yet erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce couldn't explain it as he contorted on his bed. But these sensations were driving him absolutely wild. A high-pitched moan escaped his lips. \"Ohhhhh mama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin was changing, his mass growing, his sex altering, but all Bruce could do was stroke himself, gasping in delight. This was incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair stopped at his hips and his chest stopped growing once it was appropriately proportionate to this hourglass shape he'd gained.

She didn't quite know what she looked like, but she had a feeling it was gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the mirror, she wasn't disappointed. An Amazonian beauty, with looks and strength combined into one stunning package. She dragged her hands from her hips to her chest, feeling the curves for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you!\" a sassy voice said from her lips. \"You're one hulking mass of gorgeousness. Brucie will be so sad to know he missed meeting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hulk struggles to remember who that Bruce was. He was some kind of scientist, running some kind of experiment. The specifics eluded her, but she knew that whatever he and Rick Jones did led to the creation of the amazing She-Hulk she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to thank him later,\" she muttered to herself, with a flirtatious tone. She wondered how that cute, mousy little man would appreciate her way of thanking people. Granted, she wasn't one hundred percent sure of the answer to that herself. After all, she was new to this world. Whoever she was before hadn't left any information on what she did in her free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned at her reflection, tossing back her hair. \"Maybe it's time we figured out who we are, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she'd need new clothes. She ripped these pajamas the old her had been wearing. Speaking of, the old her needed better taste. These weren't flattering at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, really, almost anything was flattering to her body. Maybe she should go find Bruce, Rick Jones, or some other handsome gentleman to figure out what kind of girl she really was...</span></div></div>",

You should be dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that I'm alive and well. You did ruin my favorite suit. Shoot all you like, but it won't do a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die you son of a bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Punisher starts shooting Alex Wolfblood.

A hard work, where both he and his coming and going girlfriend and actual Batgirl, Stephanie Brown did. But at the end of this week their operation worked very well. The shipment burnt yet on the ocean with no casuality, the Zodiac Tong lost hundreds of millions dollars at this transaction and both he and Stephanie agreed what they did over a Chinatown rooftop was just to relief the tension and not the return of their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weekend long at the titan tower's monitor watch, where he and Connor could spend some quality time, chat and maybe even relax for a while with the tower permanent residents was a welcoming moment, but that changed when all the horizon line looked like a huge blood red crack and it was leaking some strange white-purple light which bathed the room for a while. Don't matter where Tim looked, he just was seeing this crack and the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudenly the white-purpleish flash which bathed the titans tower slowly faded away and the deep blood red crack all around the tower closed.

The uniform looked very close to Tim's uniform, except she wasn't wearing a cowl, but just a mask very close to Huntress kind of mask, letting her mid back hair flow over her back and a rebel . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had about the same heigh of Timothy and a very similar body language. She was exactly where Timothy was and she was looking confused, like Tim did.

With his eyes closed, it still felt like the room was spinning. But he knew he was flat on his back. Experimentally he flexed his fingers, he felt a grip in one hand, more cautiously, more sensitively, he worked out it was a pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt triggered another memory. He snorted, as he lay there, his nostrils flaring slightly, quietly. He'd been fighting Harley Quinn. He listened intently once more, for footsteps, for breathing, for manic laughter. But there was nothing louder than his own soft breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing shallowly, so it wouldn't show, Bruce felt the room stop spinning, his balance returning, as the floor stopped moving beneath his back. It was time to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift, athletic leap, he flexed, and leaped into a low combat crouch. Before rising higher, straightening up, the gun at the end of his extended arm sweeping the room for dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of things hit him in rapid succession. Each one more unsettling than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun felt heavier than it should.... was he suffering from an injury a weakness, he hadn't realised. He tensed his muscles, holding it steady, unwilling to show vulnerability to any potential enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down his arms, they looked wrong... His familiar bat-armour stripped away, again a feeling of peril tweaking his sense of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body, just didn't feel right, not as strong. Oddly, both more flexible, and yet, somehow more ... not flabby ... but with a certain excess to his flesh. He looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a moment, to realise he'd spotted his own still prone body slumped on the floor. His feet scuffed, and scrapped over the floor as he stopped scanning the room. Turning his attention instead closer to home, to... to ... his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn't his body... Undeniably it was her body... a woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patterned scarlet and black bodysuit, clung to her curves, the clown princess' body clear beneath every clinging inch of fabric. Her chest rose and fell rhythmically, as Bruce caught ?her? breath. The outfit leaving her in no doubt about her current sex. The shifting weight of her bust, a constant reminder. A distraction, she could barely afford, even the teasing spandex teasing her nipples. Just the awareness, driving her pulsing blood harder, faster. She saw in horror as her nips stiffened, revealing themselves through the fabric of her top, outlined in intimate detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her outfit, ... her camel-toe.... HER camel-toe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the world spin around her, as she fought to catch up with the revelations. Hunkering lower, as if that reduced profile, made her less of a target, and somehow less of a woman. She found instead, the shifting invasion in her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crouched lower, she felt the presence of a thong. Invading deeper between her plush, fulsome arse cheeks.</span></div></div>",

More throaty, deeper, ... masculine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands leaped to her chest. Her fingers tracing the outline of a stylised bat embossed onto the armour.

Batman was a man after all. And now so was she... so was he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping upright, she sat there and looked over to her former body. Her chest moving as she breathed, the swell of her thigh, so soft and round, leading to that perfect ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head, she appreciated her body for the first time, as an outsider.

Popping open the pockets of the utility belt, she found the first item she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick squirt of gas in her former face, he heard the gagging cough, followed by deeper breathing. She wasn't going to be waking for the next hour at least. Another one for good measure, and Miss Quinn found out that she really did a cute snore as she slept. Free to examine her own (former) bag of tricks, she found some of her own concoctions, and some from Mista' J.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of drops, would ensure that Bats woke up, dizzy and confused, when SHE did regain consciousness. Her throat worked instinctively, as she swallowed. A soft groan, marking the start of her head-ache. The confusion and her new body meant that she'd be in for a fun first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next concoction was one she'd been threatened with herself. Her joyful enthusiasm, not always appreciated. A couple of these drops, and she listened to the whistling snore, fade. Her throat tightening, and robbing her of a voice above a rasping whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls flashed red and blue, as the police arrived. Entering the building weapons drawn, they advanced until they found the sleeping body of Harley Quinn. High in the steel rafters of the building the real Harley watched as her body was cuffed, gagged, and taken away. A special order ensured a high priority call to Arkham, and a van specially equipped for Maid of Mischief was summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder close watch, her cuffs were replaced with a straitjacket, and she left with a siren and a police escort. A non-stop journey back into care and confinement.</span></div></div>",

A pride in her toned, and tuned physique swelled in her heart, as her chest swelled as she took a deep cautious breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA catch in her throat, reminded her of her thirst. She bellowed for a guard... Or rather tried to, her voice a soft, hoarse whisper. Surveying the room a stainless steel sink was screwed to the wall in one corner, in another a plain stainless steel toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water quenched her thirst, but didn't return her voice. Rubbing her throat, she was surprised it didn't hurt, no punches, no crushed windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman was a gentleman when he fought, she giggled.

The police were responding, but there was something in the Despatcher's tone of voice that made her sit forward, when she heard the fateful words, '... The Joker has been sighted in the vicinity..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already racing off to her bike, mentally planning her route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine throbbed powerfully between her legs, her thighs clutching tightly to the warmth of the seat, and the vibrations from the engine. She felt excitement in her veins, as her hair flew behind, and her cloak flapped in the wind. There wasn't much traffic at three in the morning, but she swept between the cars as if they were parked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling the engine as she got closer, she silently glided into the dark alley opposite the labs. Despite the modern interior it was styled with seven large roman pillars at the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting quicker.\" a gruff, growling voice admitted from deep in the shadows of a doorway. He stepped forward until he was almost visible, the sharp ears of his outline already confirming why her heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't get away with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermination resonated in his voice, her ... bones also harmonising with his sentiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They...\" she cursed the softness in her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got Harley with him...\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to tell her who had which target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Babs cut his question, his suggestion off. She kept her voice firm, and flat, determined, avoiding petulance. She wasn't going to step aside to let him face the danger alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hold my own.\" she assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer but a hint of teeth showed beneath the mask... My God, had he just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they crept from the alley, using the cars for cover. Keeping low, they darted across the road to rest against the low wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaynetech Labs didn't need a high wall, or an electric fence. It's defences were high-tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs considered a stiff e-mail to Bruce Wayne, before stopping herself. That wouldn't have done more than slow the joker down. Alas, it was a pristine lawn from here to the front doors. Without the slenderest sapling to provide cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing the same concern, Batman answered with a shrug before leaping from cover to land on the grass. She followed a moment later, and the pair sprinted across. As they reached halfway across, a figure strutted out from behind one of the pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in skin-tight lycra, with something large and round resting on her shoulder. Stepping into the light, the red and black diamonds of her outfit were revealed. But it was the head of her hammer that she was toting. The metal of a stubby barrel caught the moon light. It looked like no weapon she'd ever seen before, with a wide... so wide muzzle but short. It looked like a sawn-off rocket launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the tension from Batman. He lowered into a crouch, ready to dive one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, boys and girls. You're up bright and early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze flicked towards the voice, as out from the shadows stepped. She spotted the same weapon, briefly a smile cracked his make-up, and he fired. Brilliant blue lightning shot from the weapon, in an instant it danced around Batman, crackling and sparking. Whatever it was, it was bypassing his armour, his teeth were gritted in pain. She turned to help him only to be struck with a second beam from a giggling Harley Quinn. Agony raced through every nerve in her body, as blinding light flared across her vision. Impossibly, the pain intensified, until a high shriek was ripped from her lungs as her agony filled the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight returned as the weapons cut off. The pair were capable of nothing beyond collapsing on the spot, helplessly, they listened to a car speed away into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecks and dots danced in front of her eyes, as she tried to blink them away. Her legs refused to respond, they felt alien and distant. Every impulse wrong and resisting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough watery eyes, she made out the dark outline of her companion. It wasn't really any comfort, but she felt a sense of pride that Batman too was ... just as ... incapacitated.</span></div></div>",

Her breathing was deep and rasping, with pain coming from each jarring leg shuddering pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnheard behind her, a soft groan came from Bruce, as he too struggled towards consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest felt heavy, and his breathing laboured, as he lay curled up on his side. A frustrated groan burst from his lips, and he rolled onto his back. Again his chest shifted heavily, his strength sapped, it felt off, very off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan verging on a scream, he managed to land one hand, one arm with leaden weight on his chest. He needed to find out if his armour had been ripped, if he was wounded, his chest ripped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breath caught, as the arm landed. It landed to a familiar softness. In his guise as a billionaire playboy, he'd felt more than a few soft, supple breasts. But this was the first time he had felt the groping in his own chest, as well as with his combat coarsened fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat bolt upright, this time, the sloshing weight delay from his chest just confirmed what he suspected, what he knew, what he dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he saw the yellow stylised Bat outline, as it followed the swell of his... her bosom. He somehow switched bodies with Batgirl. The sumptuous bust was framed by two cascades of long gingery, red hair, that just confirmed he was in the commissioner's daughter's body.<br>\r\nThe taste, the alien waxy-ness on his lips was lipstick, The difficulty with her feet, had to be the heels she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder, he realised, that SHE had to be in his body, with access to his equipment. Able to discover his identity merely by pulling off his own mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking his vision clear, he saw the shambling outline of Batman, his cloak hiding his body, but those boots were familiar, and the moonlight gave his head a unique silhouette. Instinctively, she reached forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/0f/19/fb/0f19fb02fe884a798e9d165457102708.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was far beyond reach, a few metres ahead.</span></div></div>",
