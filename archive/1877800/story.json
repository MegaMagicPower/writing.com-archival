The large library was divided up in many sections and the section on spells and potions was located in the far back, against the wall. Not only was this one of the largest sections, but also one of the oldest. These were among the oldest books in the library, with layers of dust on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ron walked towards the back, he spotted Harry, standing on a ladder, removing books from the shelves and stacking them on a pile next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Ron asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spilled a potion in Professor Snape's class this morning... And he made me clean up the shelves in this section and dust off the books...\" Harry answered, as he blew a cloud of dust off a big, thick book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Harry! All that dust!\" Ron coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come and give me a hand! Then I'll be done faster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who got punished, not me!\" Ron grumbled, as he started removing books from the lower shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost done! Besides... Some of these books are really fascinating!\" Harry responded. \"I found books on fire-breathing, on metal-changing, on color-changing-potions, on... Ohhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ron asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a secret compartment behind this shelf, in the wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry opened a trap door in the wall, uncovering a secret compartment containing a small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a box... Let me open it... It's long and narrow... Ohh COOL!\" Harry gasped, as he uncovered the lid from the box. \"A book... and a wand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see!\" Ron said, as he took the box from Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly dusted the shelves before he placed all the books back on the shelves, in order. Then he got off the ladder, and dusted all the other shelves quickly. He returned all the books to the empty shelves and told Ron to come up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, they examined the box, the book, and the wand...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because at that point he tapped the tip of the wand with a curious finger, and there was a flash of sickly light. It glared first crimson and gold before shifting to forest green and yellow sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shielded his eyes against the light.

The Red head was the give away, Hermione casts a sly glance over her shoulder. There wasn't a hint of her friend in her face, but her posture and manner were pure Weasley, and the slightly unsure... wavering towards cocky ticks of the other girl could only be....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whirled around \"Ron Weasley and Harry Potter...

Until, I feel that you've learned a degree of restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at both the women, her eyes shifting to their generous breasts, and back to their gorgeous faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon opened her mouth to object, but thought better of it.

She also didn't spot the horrified awkward way Hermione looked away, as she leaned over to pick up her books. The flash of curvaceous feminine ass doing nothing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk on Harry's face was more than enough to force her to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Scolastica</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell shot from Hermione's wand, even the tickling impact, and the sudden, stretched appearance of panties over Ron's voluminous ass helped calm her. The giggling fit from Ron, as the magic struck was also rewarding too. As she straightened back up, a sturdy bra was forming around her chest, keeping the girls in place. Well, at least restraining their movement a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it was working, she cast the same one over Harry, too. Well, it took two attempts, with the latex gloves deflecting the first one away from her. The second hit her in the midst of her chest. Her bust shimmying and shaking, as she danced on the spot to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, underwear was appearing over Harry's body, and Hermione was happier to look at the two girls. It was easier to see her friends, now they weren't quite so naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan, and some muttering was coming from Ron, as she discovered her uniform now included a skirt. Her agitated fingers trying to pull the hem lower. Giving up, she tried to smooth the sides of her jumper. It too, resolutely remained obviously feminine. Her bust pushing forward marking her new gender undeniably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rueful thought accidentally comparing herself with Hermione, and noting that she was bustier than her friend. Naturally, Ron's gaze shifted to Harry, as her uniform started to appear. He recognised the twitching finger restlessly flexing, eager to tug at her hems. But she resisted the impulse (only just).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same judgement caused her gaze to flicker over Harry's bust. Again, Ron was bustier by far than her friend. A sense of pride, shifting to embarrassment, as she realised, it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was almost certainly the bustiest in their year now. Her gaze met Hermione's before breaking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you look decent now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded to herself, admiring her wand work. Harry's long sleeved jumper hid the length of his gloves from sight, and stopped her attempts at pulling them off. Ron awkwardly shuffled her books, her bust getting in the way of how she'd normally carry them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked just as mortified by her nails, painted alternately green and pale silver to mark her new house. She tried to hide snake crest on her house badge, so proudly displayed by the swell of her bust. She snatched the tie, tugging it free from her V-neck. It was mostly emerald marking her house as Slytherin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low glance spotted, that Harry was now sporting a eagle on her house badge. Her tie was navy blue with thin silver stripes.</span></div></div>",

I've been a girl my whole life and I'm sure you've noticed I can handle my schoolwork very well thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually,\"  Harry stammered under Hermione's gaze, \"I mean I can't go to class like this.\"  Harry held up the magic blocking latex gloves Hermione had attached to him, \"I can't go to class if I can't do magic, what kind of wizard am I with these on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well,\"  Hermione was a bit flustered at the slightly unexpected yet valid complained, but Hermione didn't want to waver.  With a renewed resolve she said, \"Well Ron completed a full year of school with a broken wand, I believe you can handle the rest of the year with those gloves on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of the year!\"  Both Harry and Ron cried out.  They had never expected Hermione to hold onto that powerful wand that left them like this for a day let alone the rest of the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two of you need to learn that you shouldn't interfere with mysterious magical object.  Think of it as a learning experience.  But don't worry Harry, I'll remove the gloves before final exams, if you keep up with your studies that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood in shock at what Hermione was saying as Ron actually got down on his knees dropping his books.  \"Please Hermione, you've got to turn me back, turn us back.  You can't leave me like this!  Nobody deserves to have to be Draco Malfoy's girlfriend!  You have to save me.  I promise I won't ask you to help me with my homework for the rest of the rest of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this plea that once again made Hermione shake her resolve.  It was true Ron didn't deserve the be stuck with Malfoy, but was she really going to back off now after making such a grand statement?  She had mostly said that to scare them, but now Hermione was seeing both boys had reason to be scared if they were left like this.  Finally Hermione made her decision.</span></div></div>",

The girls decide to go to Samantha's room, when they enter to the bedroom, they closed the door behind them, Samantha's room was not much difference of the others student's room, except for the fact of her personal things and some plushies on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ling goes to bed to leave Ron on it, he quickly move his hands to cover his dick as Ling sit him on the bed, he look down and noted that his feet where to far away of the floor, as he look back up to the girls, both of them were looking down to him with hungry eyes as they were smiling to him, making Ron feel unconfortable and intimidated by their glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, girls, why are you looking me like that?\" Ron ask incredulous with a fear in his tone while he look to the amazon girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little one, let us do our job\" said Ling smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait one moment there Ling, i said that i be the first one to play with him\" said Sam without taking her eyes of Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, be my guest\" replied Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Sam comes closer to Ron as she bend down to him extending her arms, Ron try to go backwards on the bed, in a futile attemp to escape, but there was no way to go, Sam catch him so easily grabbing him by his armpis, moving away his arms, reveling his dick to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look Ling, he said he don't want to, but his \"peepee\" is eager to say yes\" said Sam smiling as she look down to Ron's erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, and look, he even has a cute natural red bush there\" said Ling giggling about Ron's pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please girls, don't do this to me\" plead Ron embarrassed, but his pleads go to deaf ears, the girls were more interested in his body than his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is ok cutie pie, you will enjoy this\" said Sam as she take a seat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not objetion about it, Ron couldn't conviece the girls to stop, in fact, they look more eager to continue with this, he then decide to left them do whatever they want with him, he accept the fact that he don't have the strength to fight back in his puny state, Sam then make Ron to sit on her legs, Sam decide to take off her shirt and remove her bra, reveling her breasts in front Ron, it was obvious what she want him to do now. this was going to be the second time for today that Ron was going to suck a girl's boob, the only difference was that Sam's boobs were huge to Ron's perspective, he gulp about it,  as he move his head closer to her right nipple opening his mouth putting Sam's nipple inside of it, he start to suck her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam in response, move her left hand to Ron's dick, and she begin to give him a handjob, massagin his penis with her fingers in a gently way, touching the tip and his balls, Ron was now in heaven with this treament, and he enjoy every second of it as he suck the huge boob of Sam, it doesn't take much time for to go the climax as he moan in pleasure as he cum, shooting a little stream of semen out his dick that fell on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See little one, it was not so bad as you think right?\" said Sam looking down to Ron who replied nodding in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now is my turn to have some fun with him\" said Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nod about it and give Ron over to Ling as she grab him by his armpits lift him up to her face, he look a little upset being treat in this way, like if he was a little toddler, but in reality at his size, he could barely pass as a toddler, but then Ling grin to Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need to be clean down there, little boy\" said smiling as she lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

His mind was in conflict about the fact that he could get more smaller if he drag the heavy towel with him, and being in his birthday suit again for the rest of his quest to get back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, without Ron even realise, a huge shadow was coming down to him from behind, and just in the moment that he was about to turn back and look, a pair of hands quickly decend and grab his body from his back, by this surprise, Ron was struggling to get free as he try to look back and see his attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!!!! let me go!!!\" exclaim Ron trying to break free, but it was in vain, this person was so much stronger than he is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, this person turn back with the newborn baby size Ron in hands, the little red head boy try desperate to at least see his kidnapper but it was useless, instead a few steps up in the stairs Ron could see a black bag that was open, and this person was bringing his body closer to it, when Ron see this he was hiperventilating scared of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me go, don't do this to me!!!\" exclaim Ron by this moment he could feel tears coming out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his intends to reason with this person were in vain as Ron was pushed inside the black bag with his pink towel, at the moment that he was about to turn back to see this person, the zipper was closing leaving a little opening in one of the sides of the bag where the air could enter in the bag and a little of light so Ron don't be in total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why this has to happen to me?\" said Ron as he feel the bag moving, being carried by this mysterious person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note from the author: Who's this person that have Ron? we will know in the next chapter....anyway, i hope that the chapter is ok)</span></div></div>",

It could be you've just received your animagus form?\" Harry's voice didn't carry a lot of conviction. However, he did keep a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try concentrating on regaining your human form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse stood still, after a few moments, it looked Harry deep in the eyes, before shaking it's head. Jerking it's head, it nodded towards the original wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to pick up the wand that made you a horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was greeted with an enthusiastic nod, and a brief whinny of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed and looked at his friend, \"I suppose if it all goes wrong, we can always smash the door with a powerful kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremble ran down the horse's spine, as she struggled to control her nervousness. Harry picked up the wand, and released the breath he'd been holding. With one hand he stroked Ron's mane, to calm the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what he hoped would happen, but wasn't sure if it would, or how Ron would react if it didn't. He also made a new observation, one he decided to keep to himself. Ron was a mare... or a filly. He wasn't sure the exact term, but he ... she was no stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly he thought that now Ginny wasn't the first Weasley female in the school, wondering if he could present this as a joke, an ice-breaker. He had always wanted to be different from all his brothers, but Harry decided this probably wasn't the time for humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked Ron in her wide deep eyes and tapped her on the head with the wand, right between her twitching ears.</span></div></div>",

As the flickering intensified, only the outline became visible. The long equine neck, with it's muzzle, her broad back. But with each flash a more human outline formed. Snorts, and nickering burst randomly from the whirling silhouette. Harry hoped it was confusion rather than pain. It sounded more like that than distress. But in either case, there wasn't much he could do. Retreating from it, he kept the wand low until he could put it aside on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe height shrinking lower, the equine body pulling shorter each time, until four legs became two, and an undeniably human outline formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his smeared vision, Harry couldn't be sure. But... He thought Ron looked smaller, shorter. Snatches of words came now, '<i>Bloomin'... Tha's weird..</i>..', the too familiar words of Ron. He recognised from reading in the dormitory, just a little revision to help convince Hermione that he was't stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it might be his reduced size. But the tone sounded slightly higher,... almost girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light intensified, brighter than before. Harry had to shield his eyes his forearm blocking the light. Until with a single pulse, the room returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm human, again.\" Ron cried triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Shit.\" his voice taking on a shrill, girlish tone, \"Kinda....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his arm, Harry took in the damage. Ron was restored to the human race. But as naked as the day he was born. Harry flushed, and spun around again allowing Ron to explore his human body. His... well, undeniably her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/b9977096c55d35722e0c2ffde597e18c/tumblr_ojovr5DkGf1w2lwkto1_540.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/b9977096c55d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon took the changes as best she could. Her hands blindly confirming what her chest was amply suggesting. She was now... She smiled, \"I'm the first Weasley girl to come to Hogwarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry heard the strain in her voice. The humour was still there, it was still the same Ron he knew... just repackaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a burbling, rumbling, she lifted a heavily speckled fist to cover her mouth. As she burped, she felt her entire chest vibrate in sympathy. With a surge, her bust leaped forward, to settle with a rippling roll further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H..H.. Harry... what's going on...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fear made Harry turn around, overcoming his awkwardness to help his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/85b4a98d59f69e3c3e15990425ad7841/tumblr_ojovr5DkGf1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/85b4a98d59f6...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite trying to avoid looking, even Harry couldn't deny spotting the changes.

Conservation of energy, a scientific concept, they never went over with wizards or witches easily. But restoring Ron the magic had somehow kept his animal gender. Ideas bubbled as to why that was. Were horses in season, at the moment? Or was a filly/mare, just more filled with hormones? Whatever the reason, Ron was restored female. His reduced height had to go elsewhere, that missing height that missing mass, was impossible to ignore. Even now, the girls were still settling. As much as they could as Ron's agitation kept her bust from ever fully settling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSense and embarrassment, finally surfaced on Harry's face. His cheeks as crimson as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Uniformo.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRound Ron's feet a whirl of darkness spun, rising from the floor, it ascended, keeping close to her body. In it's wake a layer of clothes appeared, until it reached the top of her head, when it dissipated in a puff of grey, and then vanished entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was dressed in the full witches uniform for Hogwarts. Ron's fingers tugged at the hem of her skirt, flinching whenever her fingers brushed innocently against her tights covered legs. Despite his nervous gestures, it was clear that Ron was struggling with the new sensation of wearing a bra. With one hand on her skirt, and the other plucking about her shoulders, trying to reduce the pain digging into her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was contorted with humiliation. Even as she stopped playing with the hem, she forced her fingers to relax. But she couldn't be sure, as they were invisible to her. Hidden beyond the swell of her prominent bust. A bust that looked even more impressive now it was supported.</span></div></div>",

Ronni's hypnotic bust a power Ron had never experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's awkward stuttering retreat emboldened her. A triumphant smile on her face, as Harry shuffled backwards. He gave a squeak as his back hit the wall.

Only his loyalty to his friend keeping him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't aware of the wand stuck between them, the hand curled tightly around the wand.

He felt his uniform turn to tatters, and those tatters to dust, and that dust to smoke. Harry was as naked as Ronni. Horrifyingly Harry was just as feminine as Ronni. The same Ronni who wasn't interested in Harriet, backed away as if confused. Stepping back, as if unsure how she got there. She glanced up and down at Harriet's sumptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's burning cheeks felt hot, at the same time, jealous. Ronni's gaze was judgemental, as if she were looking her over as a potential rival. Harriet covered her new bust as best she could. The abundant flesh overflowing her cupping hands.

She was truly blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to be too obvious, she also took in Ronni, too. The mirror revealing the red-head's plump ass, full and firm.

Bending quickly behind Harry's back rubbing his breasts against him, Harry was caught off guard and Ron managed to grab the end of the wand and tugged it from Harry's hand.  But Harry managed to barely keep a slight grip on the wand.  Before either boy knew what was happened, there was a flash of bright light from the wand.</span></div></div>",

Dobby will make Harry Potter proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but I can't use a wand anymore and I don't know how to use elf magic.\"  Ronni said wiping her big eyes with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ronni!  Dobby will teach you!\"  Dobby said with pride, but in the hallway outside of the library there was a sudden rush of students.  Ronni covered herself with her new black hair in order to hide and keep anyone from seeing or recognizing her.  Although the later would be all but impossible.  \"Elf magic is tricky, I will teach you more soon, but it is soon supper time in Hogwarts, I'll take you to the kitchens and you can watch elf magic in work!  Maybe that will help you out Miss Ronni!\"  Dobby snapped his fingers again and Ronni went from wearing the remains of his Hogwarts uniform, to what looked like a pillow case wrapped into a toga or dress with the Hogwarts insignia on the front.  \"Follow me Miss Ronni.\"  Dobby said as he held out his hand.  Ronni sniffed and took it, Dobby very gently yet firmly grasped Ronni's arm and there was a CRACK as Dobby disaperated the two of them into the Hogwarts kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni's eyes readjusted quickly to the familiar sights of the kitchen, although now it felt different.  Instead of looking down at hundreds of creatures who were more than happy to do anything he asked, he was now just a face in the crowd, maybe one of the smallest elves there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDobby lead Ronni beside a gigantic fireplace and said, \"You stay here and stay out of trouble.  If you watch the our movements you might learn so basics of elf magic.  I'll be back as soon as the evening meal is complete.\"  Dobby said before he went off to do some of his own kitchen duties.  Ronni slumped down, he didn't know what he was going to do, but Dobby's words rang in his head to 'stay out of trouble'.  Ronni knew he should do as he was told because his master...no his friend, Harry had told him to listen to Dobby and follow his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni sat in silence watching the other house elves do their magic.  Most of them seemed to be really moving and contorting their fingers as a part of their magic as delicious looking food floated and cooked before his big eyes.  Ronni looked down at his own long fingers wondering how the magic worked when he heard a voice, or more like a sound beside him.  Ronni looked to her left and saw a sheet on top of a lump of something.  Curiosity got the best of Ronni as she lifted up the sheet and gasped what he saw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down in a heap with many empty butter beer bottles was the house elf Winky.  She was making noises that couldn't be construed for words with her mouth and she reeked of butter beer.  Ronni recalled Dobby telling him that butter beer was strong stuff for house elves.  He then saw something beside Winky.  It was a miniature box.  He remembered seeing it in a book and Hermione had called it a 'refrigerator'.  And it seemed to be full of butter beer.  Ronni saw Winky pull out a bottle and magically get replaced with another one.  Winky downed her drink and passed out into a peaceful stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni wished he could do that after the last hour he'd had.  Surely he could loosen up with one butter beer and not get into any trouble like Dobby told him not to.</span></div></div>",

No...\" An unknown elf grabbed her by the shoulder, taking Ronni away from her obvious fascination with the drunk Winky. Without a backwards glance, the elf, a male Ronni noticed distantly. He tossed a blanket backwards without looking. But as Ronni was dragged away, she watched it sail through the air, and cover the sleeping, snoring house-elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... That's not good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ronni felt the appeal of passing out, the speed it worked, and how little was needed made her feel vulnerable and afraid. In a body that was already primed for timidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dobby... Dobby...\" she squeaked, hoping for him to come to her rescue, or explain her inactivity.

Soon she's absorbed in her task, and humming to herself.

Ronni's tennis ball sized eyes had a tuft of red hair in front of it as Ron was just moping about with her head down.  Sirius frowned, he cared about the youngest Weasly boy, he protected Harry and was willing to die for him, he'd shown the bravery to Sirius himself.  But now he was just a down and out house elf with no idea if he'd turn back.  Sirius pondered on Ronni's situation before he came up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ron, you and Harry aren't the only ones to hear about the animagus wand,\"  Sirius said as Ron looked up from the floor.  \"Actually James, myself...and worm tail looked for it.  After we learned about Remus's hairy little secret we were determined to turn into animagus and help him out when he transformed.  We searched for that damned wand for almost a whole year trying to find the easy way to become and animagus, but we eventually gave up and had to do the real thing.  And you know what?  It was the best thing that could have happened to us.  We had to spend months preparing our mind and bodies for the transformation and I think that is what made it so easy for us to eventually transform into our forms.\"  Then out of nowhere Sirius put down his box and transformed into the great black dog that was his animagus form.  Ronni instinctively backed up a few steps from the large fanged beast, but seconds later it was Sirius once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had just tapped myself with a wand and turned into that, I probably wouldn't have any idea what to do or how to turn back.  Those months of studying the magic and learning about myself, well, it was a great thing and I wouldn't trade it for anything...well except maybe hitting Wormtail with that wand.  Wouldn't mind if he got stuck as an actual worm now that I think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what am I supposed to do Master Sirius Black?\"  Ronni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius growled, \"I have a theory, if you become more acclimated with being Ronni the house elf, you'll be closer to turning back into Ronald Weasley.  It's just a theory, but it's all I've got for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I can turn back!  Oh this is such good news Master Sirius Black!\"  Ronni said jumping for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all I think you need to start acting like a house elf for this idea to work.  And that means following orders and my first order is to stop calling me 'master'.  Just call me Sirius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon seemed to be having to take a moment to accept this order, he felt the magic of the order flow through him, \"Yes...Sirius.\"  Ronni said with a smile.  But what neither saw, was Krecher lingering in the corner with a scowl on his face.</span></div></div>",

So they waited in the corner of the library.  Harry kept the Marauders Map open at all time making sure to keep a close watch over Filtch and Madame Pince.  Whenever either of them got even close to the two trouble makers location, Harry would pull out his cloak and stretch it out as much as he could and hug up close to Ron as he squatted down low.

You shall be my mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...what?!\"  Ron suddenly stumbled on his four legs, \"I've barely snogged a girl!

And you are an outsider who would be in danger if you went into the Forest which would otherwise be your home.  I offer you my home.  I shall inform the headmaster I have taken a mate explaining your presence while you find yourself within your animagus form.  And I shall name you a more fitting name of my people.  While you have that form you shall be known as Ronalsa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Oh that's...actually really nice of you.

And food did appear, but it was a bunch of uncooked vegitables and raw meat.  \"What are the kitchens playing at?

Ron wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok, I've seen my mom do some of this enough.\"  Ronalsa took a sharpened knife that Firenze gave her and she cut up the vegetables and put them in the pot with the meat.  Ronalsa saw a stream nearby and put some water in the cauldron and before tossing the meat in.  Firenze seemed to want to say something about the order of the things he was doing, but did not interfere.  A few hours later, a starving Ronalsa dug into a meal that Firenze deemed 'edible'.  It was one of the nastiest meals Ron had ever eaten, but because he'd made it himself oddly it made it more tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night the outdoor room in the castle oddly enough had a cool wind blow through.  Ron feel his nipples get uncomfortably hard and covered himself.  \"Do centaurs were shirts?  I'd even settle for a bra at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirenze had a look of disgust on his face, \"Clothing are the creations of wizards who fear their own natural body.  We centaurs have gone through the years and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one good thing about this living situation, is that Firenze's droning on was the best sleep aid Ron had ever had in his life.  He didn't even get uncomfortable as his laid down on her four legs and fell asleep under a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ron awoke hoping to see Harry with a brilliant solution on how to turn him back, but alas all he saw was Firenze's muscular form at his side.  Ronalsa ate some fruit provided by the castle and before he knew it, they had company.  Ron had almost forgotten that Firenze was a professor when a group of students walking into the room.  Ronalsa blushed with embarisment when he saw it was his fellow 6th year Gryffindors.  Including his ex-girlfriend Lavender Brown and her best friend Parvati Patil.  Ronalsa awkwardly stood by a tree trying to pretend to be invisible as the class went on.  Against Ron's wishes Firenze adressed the centaur in the room by introducing him as Ronalsa, his mate.  Ron looked at the class and saw that the boys of the class were absolutely staring at his chest, Ron made sure to cover himself up a bit, but as he did he caught a weird look from Lavender and Parvati.  They were giving Ron the strangest look, <i>'Are they...jealous?'</i>. Ron thought feeling a mix of confusion and oddly enough pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Boy I hope Harry figures out how to undo that stupid magic from the animagus wand.</i>. Ron thought playing with his hair once again giving the boys of the class a free show.</span></div></div>",

Almost unbidden, one hands slipped beneath the table. Tentatively, she felt around her new crotch. Feeling the outline of her new cock. Suppressing a shriek, she gasped as she felt it respond, swelling at her touch. Harry's cheeks flushed crimson, rapping her knuckles on the underside of the table as she whipped it back into sight, and away from temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an angry, amused look on Cho's face, the expression was pure Harry Potter.

Besides, if we do find a reversal wand, you might sell it to your brothers for the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let go of Ronda's now trembling hand, and watched as she careful but the pink tipped wand back on the shelf.</span></div></div>",

If the accused was sexist, it would work against them, building their sex appeal. Some men just view women as sex objects, as a vessel to be used and cast aside.

Her hands flapped wildly at her side in agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh... oh,</i> yeah. You can talk again.\" Hermione hiding just a hint of a smile at how obedient Ronda was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, loudly as if she were surfacing from a deep dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Never do that again.\" Ronda's voice resonant with sincerity. Hermione rested a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled at his two friends, knowing what had to happen next. \"Okay Hermione, what can you tell us about this spell. Oh, and please concentrate on how it can be broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hermione's turn to inhale deeply, the 'boys' knew it was going to be a long speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of the Witchmaker, is that it draws it's limits from the person cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to Ronda, \"Ron here, clearly likes women to be beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonda's lips moved silently, as she stopped herself from saying that was only reasonable. She was quickly realising the downside to being so gorgeous. Ron knew deep down, that much as he loved beautiful women... it was more as eye-candy, and not as a whole person with opinions, that he'd listen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He clearly prefers women to be obedient, too.\" Hermione continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't ...\" Ronda squawked in outrage, but her objection fell silent, as Hermione raised a stiff finger jabbing towards Ronda, and a disapproving scowl on her face. Once more Ronda silence was ensured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a reaction against his mum.\" Hermione mused. Ronda's cheeks flushed crimson, heating with shame. All three knowing who ran the Weasley house, and who held the family together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Harry's turn to squirm, as a conversation... hopefully a joking one, came back to him. A late night conversation, from the dorm room, after everyone else had fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><i>\"... a witch should be obscene and not heard...\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sincerely hoped Ron had been joking, though his enforced quiet suggested otherwise. But it certainly wasn't a conversation he was going to have in front of Hermione. She was already fighting her own disappointment with Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione herself was squirming too. Unable to put into words her deepest fear. In quiet moments, and on walks around the castle. Their conversations, haunted her. As a hard-working witch, she was afraid that Ron didn't like how much time she spent studying. Except when it was time to hand in assignments, and a good answer was needed for him to copy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione couldn't face the possibility that this gorgeous, curvaceous copper-topped beauty might be a bimbo. That soon, she'd be using her body to bend men to her will. She shuddered as she imagined Ronda trying to manipulate Harry. But Ron's contempt for study timetables, for studying in general made her very nervous about how she'd prefer her witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even felt a twinge of guilt, at being so studious herself. Had she driven Ron further in his prejudice against hard-working witches. She thought of Ginny too. She was already stronger than Ron, though being a year lower she too hid her skills to protect his self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vague wave of her hand in Ronda's direction, Ronda started gabbling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... I said, Please don't do that again...\" her voice high, girlish and uncomfortably agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she continued. \"This spell lasts at least a month. So you'd better get used to the silky underwear. Oh, and I doubt how to silence you, will remain a mystery for long either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonda's cheeks flushed even redder, at the mention of silk underwear. Her rump trying to sink though the bed she was sitting on. Her arms coming up, as she cuddled herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month...?\" her voice almost beyond human hearing in pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least.\" Hermione answered clearly.</span></div></div>",

But it was already too late, he was too slow. As the spell shot from the wand. Hermione was hit in the stomach with a blast from the 'Witchmaker' wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, her job was done, Ronda let the wand fall to the floor. It's impact barely audible as it landed. Hermione's face a shocked mask, as she felt the spell transform her. Harry pushed her backwards towards a nearby chair. The cocoon of magic spiralling around Hermione, her torso disappearing behind a blinding white gyre of magic. It spread upwards and downwards from her stomach, until only a vague silhouette of an outline was visible. A whimpering, whisper of 'No... No... No...', was heard from the whorling chaotic mel\u00e9e of magic. Moments later even that disappeared, as the white light grew too bright to face. Then a silent explosion, the light flared, and darkness returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends blinked away the tears, fighting to see anything beyond black and white specks, and a blurred impression of the room. Ronda's giggling suggested her sight cleared first. Followed moments later by the rare, but eloquent expression of Hermione swearing. Harry was impressed with the passion and imagination of Hermione's outburst, and tried to remember as much of the tirade as he could manage. As Harry's vision returned too, the reason was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will ever think of calling you a nerd, or a geek now.\" Ronda announced triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/502abdb0e9514cbe03856ba5fdf06546/tumblr_oyslev22cs1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/502abdb0e951...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's hands fluttered in front of her bust, as if afraid of touching her expanded chest. As if that would destroy her last hope that ... that this might be an illusion. A Weasley Wizarding Wheeze. But even without those confirming fingers, the weight was unmistakable, pulling at her shoulders. The heft as she breathed, it was all already far too real to be denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See....\" Ronda added brightly, \"I did you a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sincerity, was undercut, by her giggling. The giggling more hysterical than amused, as she drank in the expanded bust of her girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

It will also help to humble out a guy like Malfoy!\u201d  said Ron enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to admit that the proposals were interesting to Ron.

She grabbed her tie that was now too small for her larger throat, and ripped the knot, letting the tie fall to the ground. As she did that, she groaned with satisfaction.

She was now the size of Harry and still growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled of pleasure as she ripped the remains of the rags, flexing her bicpes, now the size of two bowling balls. Her torso was now massive as an old oak trunk while her abs had become an improbable 10 pack. She roared of pleasure as her eyes turned in their orbits. She stucked out her tongue as she opened her mouth with pleasure. Her bra was more and more strained, while her breasts were now far larger than a H-cup. It also seemed like her hair had grew, now nearing her massive glutes that were almost swallowing her underwear. She groaned as she slowly reached 5 meters in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stopped the beam and looked at the massive giantess that was standing before them. \"Wow!\" She exclaimed with her now deeper voice. She smiled, her face seemingly more beautiful than before as she started to flex in multiple bodybuilder poses she had seen in the Muggle World. As she did so, the new reality started to take place, Harry and Ron now remembering new added memories from this new reality where Hermione was always a massive muscular goddess. \"That's awesome!\" She exclaimed as her clothes slowly reappared on her body. \"It's like...

Almost instantly he began to gain muscle mass, his arms biceps selling to match his now massive calves and quads. His new pecs strained agains his shirt and the other two boys could see a six pack forming through it. It was the  delts and traps that finally caused his cloths to burst, but almost instantly they began to repair themselves, adjusting to his new frame.

Then, as abruptly as they started, the changes ended. \"- write a short description of the berries.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon tried to hide his amazement. \"Um, thanks,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.

I'd give anything to have gotten to meet my Mum and Dad.\" The three sat around in an awkward silence. \"We'll, I'd better get going,\" said Neville. \"I'll catch you later.\" He left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" asked Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" answered Harry. \"But I think we just changed more than just Neville's muscle mass.\" He looked in a mirror.

He wasn't an orphan anymore!  And he wasn't the Boy Who Lived either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering back Harry collapsed onto the nearest bed as he struggled to cope with the unbelievable new reality he had inadvertantly created.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right, mate?\" Ron asked, placing a comforting hand on Harry's shoulder.  \"I know this is a lot to take in, but you look like you're going to pass out.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like it, too.  Sucking in a deep breath, Harry did his best to pull himself together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.  I'm better than okay.\"  Standing up he gave his best friend a smile that felt like it stretched from ear to ear, joy beginning to replace his shock.  \"Ron, my parents are alive again! I have a family, just like I saw in the Mirror first year!  It's-it's the best thing that's ever happened to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm glad for you, I really am,\" Ron told him.  \"But Harry, we were just fooling around with that wand!  I never woulda guessed it could do all this!  We've gotta tell Dumbledore what happened and get him to help us fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Why would we want to fix this?  Everything is perfect exactly the way it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry . . .\" Ron began and stopped, looking uncomfortable.  \"Harry, it's great that your parents are back, but now Neville is the Boy Who Lived.  He's the one who's going to have to face Voldemort.  And Harry, it's <b>Neville</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of what he had done to his classmate hit Harry then.  He wouldn't wish his former destiny on anyone, much less a friend!  And in this changed universe Neville was an orphan, just as he had been.  Harry was the last person to want anyone to lose their parents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept . . . Neville's parents were already lost either way, weren't they?  Back in the other world they were in St. Mungo's for life, hopelessly insane from prolonged torture.  Even then Neville had never been able to talk to them, not and have them talk back.  While here Harry's parents were alive <u>and</u> sane!  They loved him!  They were even coming to see him before Christmas, assuming that old bat Unbridge didn't bar them from the castle on some pretext.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry reflexively glanced down at his hand, expecting to see the words \"I must not tell lies,\" carved there, but his hand looked fine.  Of course!  With him not being the Boy Who Lived anymore, Unbridge wasn't focused on him; she was focused on Neville.  Another burden he had put on his friend's shoulders-but weren't those newly broad shoulders more than big and strong enough to carry such burdens now?  After all, it wasn't like he had just shoved Neville into his place without providing any help!  He had given the boy what looked to be at least a hundred pounds of pure, rock-solid muscle, and somehow possessing that utterly fantastic physique had led to him being targeted by Voldemort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, though?  All Harry could think was that Voldemort's spies must have told him what a large and healthy one year-old Neville had been, and Voldemort had somehow taken this physical impressiveness as a sign that Neville was the child of the prophecy.  And so he had made Neville that child, instead of Harry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry!\" Ron practically shouted, startling him out of his thoughts.  \"I said it's Neville!  He can't face Voldemort!  You know he can't!  He'll mess it all up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that!\" Harry countered hotly.  \"Maybe he's better here, more confident, more powerful!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Harry!  You just don't want to admit the truth because you have your parents back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do!\" Harry shouted, pushing Ron hard.  \"And I'm not going to lose them again just because you won't give this Neville a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's freckled face reddened in anger, but before he could retaliate the door opened again and in strode Seamus Finnegan.  Fortunately the wand in Harry's hand was concealed by the letter and Harry quickly folded the piece of paper around the enchanted artifact.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, couldn't you find it?\" he asked, his cheerful mood faltering as he noted the tense atmosphere.  \"Hey, what's wrong?  I thought you guys were going to be right back down with the board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What board?\" Harry enquired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron's Wizard's Chess board?\" Seamus prompted, looking at Harry like he thought the boy belonged in St. Mungo's.  \"How could you possibly forget that between here and the common room?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry blinked, unsure of what to say.  He and Ron were friendly enough with Seamus, but they didn't really hang around with him much.  The look of fond exasperation on the Irish boy's face, though, suggested they were much better friends here.  In fact, hadn't the letter said that his parents sent their best to Seamus AND Ron?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Seamus,\" Harry apologized.  \"Ron and I just got to talking about Neville.  What do you say?  Do you really think he'll be able to beat Voldemort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone can do it, Neville can,\" Seamus said definitively.  \"He's brilliant at magic, almost as good as Hermione.  Of course given how much time they spend studying together that isn't much of a surprise, is it?\" For some reason Seamus winked at them before continuing.  \"And Neville's strong as a friggin troll too!  If he can just get his hands on You-Know-Who, he'll break the rotter in half!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant at magic?  Neville?\" Ron asked disbelievingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you call someone who can cast a corporeal Patronus on his fourth try and brews every one of Snape's bloody potions correctly the first time?\" Seamus retorted.  \"If it wasn't for Neville I bet that biased, greasy git would have taken a hundred points off Gryffindor by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snape doesn't harass Neville?\" Harry asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, have you two been having a nip of Firewhisky up here or what?\" Seamus demanded, hands on his hips.  \"I thought we were best mates!  If you've gotten hold of a bottle then I want some too!\"         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't been drinking Firewhisky,\" Ron hastened to assure him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You didn't nick a bottle off of Fred and George, maybe?\" Seamus asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why are you both acting like you're drunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Seamus,\" Harry apologized.  \"I think maybe Malfoy got in some kind of hex on us earlier today.  We're having a tough time remembering things,\" Harry improvised on the fly.  When in doubt, blame Malfoy!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Seamus asked skeptically.  \" After the thrashing Neville gave him and his cronies last year I thought Malfoy hadn't dared resort to anything except for insults, and not even those when the Muscle Boy Who Kicked His Butt is around.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville had beat up Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle?  All at once?!?  From Ron's face it looked like he was as eager to get more details about that as Harry, but they'd made Seamus suspicious enough with their questions already.  Better to go down with him to the Common Room and try to worm some answers out of the people there.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the two of you want to head to the infirmary then?\" Seamus asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now.  If it keeps happening we'll go there tomorrow.  Just be patient with us, okay?\" Harry pleaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have for five years already,\" Seamus said with a dramatic, long-suffering sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the board,\" Ron announced, pulling it and the box of pieces out from beneath his bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant, now maybe Harry or I will finally beat you!\" Seamus said before turning toward the door.  Stopping only to put the letter and wonderful wand under his own bed, Harry followed with Ron and his Wizard's Chess set bringing up the rear.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As the trio headed down the stairs Harry felt something moving in his pocket.  Reaching in he pulled out the now-vibrating DA Galleon and saw there was meeting set for tonight, at 8:00 P.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for Wizard's Chess,\" Seamus sighed, staring glumly at his own coin.  \"We'd barely have time to set the board up.  You'd better put it back, Ron.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking slightly disgruntled Ron turned around and ascended the stairs back up to fifth year boy's dormitory.  It took him a bit longer to put his chess set away than Harry would have thought necessary, and Seamus was tapping his foot impatiently by the time Ron came back down the steps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get a move on,\" he urged the red-head.  \"We don't want to be late.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three passed back down through the common room and through the portrait of the Fat Lady.  Harry was careful to let Seamus go in front, not knowing if they were still meeting in the Room of Requirement.  Sure enough, though, the Irish boy led them straight there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe membership looked mostly the same as he was used to, though there were a couple of Ravenclaws that hadn't been in the DA before.  There was also a glass cabinet full of potion bottles in one corner and the walls were padded for some reason, a fact which unsettlingly reminded Harry of St. Mungoes and Neville's parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone quieted down almost immediately when Neville took his place at the front of the room.  They seemed to be paying rapt attention to their leader; that was a good sign, wasn't it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Neville was worth paying attention to.  He was confident and self-assured, clearly in command but also willing to patiently answer questions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the biggest surprise, however, was the dark-haired teen's grimness.  Neville had never exactly been bubbling and cheerful, but neither had he ever seemed so serious and, well, stone-faced, for want of a better word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, after what he and Ron had done to Neville with the wand, the teen's face had definitely lost its former roundness and baby fat; his features were lean and surprisingly handsome.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville was teaching them the Protego spell and once he'd finished he told them to break into pairs and each take turns trying to hex the other to test the other person's Shield Charm.  Harry was about to pair up with Ron, but before he could Seamus declared, \"Come on, Ron!  If I can't beat you at Wizard's Chess tonight, I'll beat you at this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an apologetically helpless look at Harry Ron went off with Seamus.  So who was Harry supposed to pair up with then?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione,\" he called out as he spotted her across the room.  \"Why don't we pair up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression was kind, but distant, like Harry wasn't someone she really knew well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Harry,\" she apologized, \"but you know I practice with Neville.  Ginny, why don't  you pair with Harry?\" Hermione suggested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's sister glared at Hermione, but trotted over to Harry while Neville and Hermione took up positions opposite each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just trying to keep him to herself,\" Ginny muttered disgustedly.  \"When will she see that he isn't interested?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione's interested in Neville?\" Harry asked, dumbfounded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny turned to him with a scowl.  \"Come on, Harry, has hanging out with my lunk-headed big brother dulled your brain?  Of course she is!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione and Neville?  Really?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready or not?\" Ginny asked, her wand pointing toward Harry.  Fumbling for his own wand Harry withdrew from his robe pocket a length of rowan wood he had never seen before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I think I've got the wrong wand,\" he told Ginny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you've had that wand since first year.  Now quit stalling and try to cast a Shield Charm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning she sent a Jelly Leg hex toward him.  Harry's called out \"Protego!\" and then crumpled to the floor as Ginny's hex took effect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd cast it perfectly, hadn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was grinning as she ended the hex, but Harry had nothing to smile about.  It must be this new wand; it wouldn't work for him because it didn't match him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lumos!\" he intoned, and nearly dropped the wand when the tip began to glow.  It <i>was</i> working for him!  But then why hadn't the Shield Charm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get up and try me,\" Ginny encouraged.  As the session wore on neither Harry or Ginny managed to produce a working Shield Charm, much to his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get all bent out of shape,\" Ginny chided him.  \"Neville said this was a difficult spell; we're probably not going to get it perfectly the first day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had gotten it before!  Why couldn't he now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone,\" Neville called.  \"Dueling time.  Everyone should duel at least five different people before you leave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his chance, Harry realized.  What better way to find out if Neville was up to facing Voldemort than by dueling him?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's duel,\" Harry suggested, jogging up to his friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville looked almost shocked at the suggestion.  \"Are you sure, Harry?\" he asked, with obvious concern and a hint of warning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Harry answered curtly.  Why was Neville making such a big deal out of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want.  Stand by, Hermione,\" he instructed her and she nodded, moving off to open the cabinet of potions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?  Stand by for what?  But there was no time to wonder about that.  Voldemort wouldn't play fair in battle, so Harry shouldn't either.  As Neville turned back to him he shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white light and the wand in Neville's hand flew up above his head-but so did his arm and the wand didn't leave his grasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's jaw dropped.  Somehow Neville had actually managed to hold onto his wand in the face of a Disarming Charm!  How was that even possible?!?  Harry had felt the force involved and he could no more have kept his grip on his wand than he could fly without a broom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville brought his wand down to point at Harry and called, \"Accio Harry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Harry was flying without a broom, soaring through the air toward Neville, who was already drawing his left arm back.  As Harry came within range Neville's fist shot forward and Harry's entire world exploded into pure, unadulterated agony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what he did to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, I healed him; Harry's going to be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't he wake up then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Hermione's voices were penetrating into the blackness that engulfed him.  Slowly Harry opened his eyes, seeing the ceiling of the Room of Requirement above him.  Then that was blotted out by Neville leaning over him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake now,\" Neville quietly said.  He extended a hand downward and when Harry took hold of it Neville hoisted him to his feet, the effortless one-handed lift of Harry's one hundred and forty-three pounds not even causing the muscle-bound He-Boy Who Lived's enormous, mountainous right bicep to flex itself under his tight robe sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Neville asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Harry answered, relieved to feel no trace of the pain that had overwhelmed him before.  He turned to the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was only a few feet away, being restrained by Fred and George, a furious look on his face, as Hermione tried to calm him down.  Standing behind them was the rest of the DA, apparently relieved to see Harry was fine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can let him go,\" Neville told the twins.  Reluctantly they did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know he's a berk, but don't break him, Neville,\" Fred urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neville won't hurt him if he doesn't do anything stupid,\" George declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm worried,\" Fred retorted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you and Harry, Ron,\" Neville calmly said, \"just like I warned everyone.  Voldemort and the Death Eaters aren't going to hold back in battle; we can't afford to either.  If you choose to duel me, I'll make it as real as I can without killing you.  Don't volunteer to face me if you're not prepared to learn what an actual fight is like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bloody broke Harry's jaw and his neck!\" Ron protested.  \"That's mental!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran up Harry's spine.  Neville had done that much damage to him?  With only one PUNCH?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and I had Hermione waiting to heal him.  That's what she's trained for and that's why we have the Healing Potions here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys faced each other Harry was struck by the contrast between them.  Ron was definitely taller, but the new Neville was a veritable dark-haired pillar of powerful, sculpted muscle.  His sheer physical presence utterly dwarfed the youngest Weasley son, making it almost seem as though Neville were the one towering over Ron.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ron,\" Harry reassured his best friend, reaching out to touch Ron's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to dueling, everyone!\" Neville ordered and with the exception of he, Ron and Hermione, the rest of the room returned to their practice matches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, you can't do something like this again,\" Neville warned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too hard on him, Neville!\" Seamus broke in.  \"Malfoy hexed him and Harry today; they've been forgetting things all night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malfoy?\" Neville asked, eyes narrowing dangerously.  \"Hermione, would you please check Ron and Harry over for hexes?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Hermione agreed.   </span></div></div>",

But as she walked down an aisle, she saw an unfamiliar book lying on the ground, with what appeared to be two bugs lying on the ground. One of the bugs -- a reddish-black-colored one -- scampered away, but the other one just stood still and gazed up at her. As she drew nearer, she saw that it was no bug -- it was none other than Harry Potter, one of her best friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of avoiding the tiny figure or stepping on it like she would have if it were a bug, she knelt and scooped it up. Ignoring the book and the other orange bug, she pocketed Harry and scanned the library, trying to find an out-of-the-way table that she could sit at and talk to Harry without raising suspicions. Finding one, she briskly walked over to it, set down the pillar of books she was carrying, and took out the shrunken Boy Who Lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ron had to run to keep up with the behemoth Miss Granger as her quick, wide strides easily carried her far away. Finally reaching her when she sat down, he considered whether he should try to climb her or whether it was best if he stay low. Suddenly, all three heard footsteps approaching...</span></div></div>",

The problem was the bouncing of Hermione's bust meant he had lost all sense of up/down, so in the end he was merely scurrying in a random direction, grabbing handfuls of tit and pulling himself along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione flopped into her seat with an audible groan, unable to ignore the bolts of pleasure Harry was causing roaming around in her sensitive cleavage, she almost regretted putting Harry down there, but as she bit her lip to hold in a pleasured moan she knew she didn't. So with no other option Hermione placed her hands on either side of her breasts and squeezed them together, pinning Harry near the edge 'Stop squirming, we're in class and I can't have you messing around' she whispered into her cleavage, before trying to concentrate on the lesson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry listened for about 5 minutes, the crushing pressure of Hermone's boobs were enough to worry him even if they didn't injure him he still needed to go. So he decided to be subtler, slowly grabbing some of her soft breast and pulling himself along, not the frantic scrambling her had done earlier.
