            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda couldn't sleep. She had just finished watching her favourite show, and it was close to midnight. She normally wouldn't stay up that late, but it was Friday night, so she had little to worry about for tomorrow. She was planning a trip to the city with her housemates, which she looked forward to. She was also excited about going to Scienceworks, as the Star Wars exhibit was there. Whilst David and Rachel only marginally shared her love of sci-fi, they enjoyed Star Wars as much as the next person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright light shot through a gap in her curtains. Could it be the moon, she thought. But this was so bright it was almost as if the light was on. Amanda then picked up her glasses off the bedside table. She normally wore contacts, but in this kind of a situation, glasses would have to do. She crept out her door, careful not to wake up David and Rachel. Rachel was her best friend, but was more feminine. She had been dating David for almost a year now. David was a film buff, and had a large collection of DVD's. Amanda got along with him just fine, but she wasn't willing to wake them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got outside, the light was gone. However, she looked down and saw a package. She picked it up and saw it was addressed to her. There was a card attached, which read \"We have been watching you, and we know you want a change in your life. We have access to technology far advanced of humanity, and believe you would be deserving of this device. You have no need to worry about this device falling into the wrong hands, as it is pre-programmed so that only you can use it. Use it wisely, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a joke? She went up to her room and opened the package, and found a strange device. It looked like an enlarged iPod touch. There was a manual to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on the acquirement of your new Reality Warper! With this device, you have the power to alter the world in your own image. Regress adults to children, shrink people down to the size of a matchstick, speak in a different language, and much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was still skeptical, but at the same time, liked the idea. But she knew it would have to wait until morning, and she had already decided on what to change...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda got up around 7:30. She wasn't due to leave for the city until around 11:30. Now seemed to be a good time as any other to test out the device. She had to read the documentation firsthand, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To set up your device, mount it on a wall. This will make the device change all reality within your building\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how she could place it on her wall. There were no holes for screws or nails. The manual didn't seem to specify how to mount it. She guessed the only way to find out how to mount it was to simply place it on her bedroom wall. She placed the device on her wall, which subsequently seemed to turn into liquid. It engulfed the device, but it still felt like a concrete wall to her hands, which did not get engulfed. After a few seconds, the device surfaced, and it appeared to be attached to her wall. It was now turned on. There were several selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvisible<br>\r\nDisappear<br>\r\nCopy<br>\r\nSize<br>\r\nLength<br>\r\nAnimal<br>\r\nAge<br>\r\nSound/language<br>\r\nAnimation<br>\r\nMind control<br>\r\nAffects<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the word \"Invisible\" and another screen came up. There were two selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole body<br>\r\nSeparate parts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the selection \"Separate Parts\" and brought up \"Head\" and \"Body\". She read the manual again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reality can change a person's whole body, or just certain parts. For instance, to change the reality of your head, press the word 'Head' once. To change the reality of parts of your head, such as your hair, mouth, ears, etc., press 'Head' twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda decided to change her whole body, and pressed an arrow pointing right near the bottom of the screen. She then pressed the selection \"Whole Body\". The words were then highlighted in green. However, Amanda felt nothing. Perhaps a look in the mirror might help. She went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and sure enough, she could not see herself. All she could see was her pajamas, standing there, empty. Where her hands, feet, and head should have been, there was empty space. Her pajama pants appeared to be floating. She raised her arms and waved them around. In the mirror, the sleeves of her pajama top repeated the exact same actions. She clapped her hands, rubbed them together, rubbed them against her face. They were still there, but were simply invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her toothbrush, and sure enough, it appeared to be floating near her sleeve. She tried to put it in her mouth, but seemed to be touching thin air when she did so. She realized now that whilst she could touch tangible objects, they could not touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured that David and Rachel must be up by now. She went to the living room, and found Rachel's nightgown sitting on the couch, watching television. It too was filled out as if she was in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Amanda\", the nightgown said.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you're invisible too! Listen, I can explain...\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n\"Explain what? I've always been invisible and so have you. Hasn't bothered you until just now.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I got an alien device, and warped reality.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sound like a kid. I'm not exactly Einstein, but I know that this is what normal people look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked up at the television. It was showing some kiddie sitcom, probably Wizards of Waverly Place. All the characters in the show were invisible, their clothes were moving as if people were inside them. They could still be heard. There was a DVD case on the table. The people photographed on that were also invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, we're supposed to look like this?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n\"Look out the window if you're unsure,\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out onto the road, and could see various people walking down the street. It looked normal, but they were also invisible. Amanda then went outside, and as soon as she exited the door frame, she noticed that she was back to her normal form. She could see herself again. The people outside were also visible. She went back inside, and became invisible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we're supposed to be invisible?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've made that perfectly clear.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take a look outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed Rachel by the arm and took her outside. They then both reverted to their true, visible form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Amanda said, pointing to various people. \"That's our true form.\"<br>\r\n\"No shit, Sherlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel went back inside, and reverted to her invisible form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you dragged me outside to point out the obvious.\"<br>\r\n\"But we became visible again\"<br>\r\n\"No, I don't remember changing form\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stormed off to her bedroom. She had a read of the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, people affected by this change will accept it as if they were always like that. However, you can program it so they can feel the change. Select 'Mind Control', and a list of names will come up. These consist of people who live or work in the building, as well as regular guests. Names highlighted in green will be people affected by the changes, but will not feel it. Press their names and the highlight will be removed, thus making them able to feel the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda...</span></div></div>",

She also seemed interested in the \"animation\" option. She had enjoyed cartoons since she was a little kid, and so did Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that if she was going to play along, perhaps it would be best if she didn't tell her friends about the device.

She was already going to have to relearn how to walk, being able to see where you are going would probably be an important step. Next, she went to the \"legs\" part of the multiple body parts to find a slider to control the amount of legs. She swiped the slider to the left and the monitor read \"1\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like when she had turned on invisibility, she didn't feel any different, but looking down, things were very different. Her jeans (or would it be jean?) only had one leg hole straight down the middle. Her foot too had changed, so that her middle toe was the longest, and her foot was nearly symmetrical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, only to fall back down. With only one leg, her center of gravity had changed, and she didn't have the second leg to help support herself. She got up again (this time holding on to a table), and took a few practice hops before making her way to her room. Once inside, she took off her pants (pant?) to get a look at how else her body had changed. Examining where your crotch used to be, her pussy now was in roughly the same place, but attached directly to her leg, her anus done in a similar method in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Amanda do now?</span></div></div>",

David and Rachel's names were highlighted in green, but she touched them, making them able to feel the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, she heard screaming coming from the living room.

I made all people invisible, even ones on TV and on photos, but when I tried to explain it, you believed it was normal. So I turned off the mind control that you were under.\"<br>\r\n\"Whew...well, that's a relief, knowing you have control over it. Cool, we should do something like this before we go to the city.\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n\"Thing is, it only affects reality while we're inside this house. The moment we step out, reality goes back to normal, we change back.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's portable or something,\" said David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda went up to her room again, and tried to pull the device off the wall by the side. Nothing happened. She read the manual again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To remove the device from its place on the wall, press the red button at the top. This will turn off the device, and all changes will revert to normal. For portability, press the button again, and it will fold into a more portable form. To have the device revert to its usual form, press the button again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda did as the manual said. Once it had folded up, it appeared to have taken the form of an iPod nano, except there was a red button where the screen should have been.

But I think you have to place it on a wall for it to be on.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've got like three and a half hours before we have to go. Let's have a little fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then unlocked the device, made it its regular size again, and mounted it on the living room wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want to try out?\"</span></div></div>",

While she didn't normally believe in this sort of thing, there was something about this device that gave her a sense of power. She could see that there were buttons for a variety of different effects. Clicking on one, she was suddenly face-to-face with a huge drop down list of things that could be affected, people who could be affected, extra options such as wether they recognize the changes or not, wether or not everyone was affected, whether it affect animals or not. The list went on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the menu without pressing anything. 'Okay,' she thought, 'there has to be an easier way then scrolling through all of the possible options.' She reached over to the letter and found an additional insert that explained the basics of using the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you are reading this, you're probably wondering how this device works. It's easy! Simply press an effect, the corresponding additional effects, and who you wish to affect, and everyone on the list will gain those effects. If this is too complicated, you can always turn on simplicity mode in the main menu, which will narrow down the additional options and only ask to change people that you know. Alternatively, you can enter command mode on the main menu to simply write in what you explicitly wish to happen and to whom, and the proper effect will be applied. As an additional alternative, you can mount the device to any available surface in your home, and the effects will only change reality around the house, and leaving said building will remove any effects in place on the building.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited to test out the device, Amanda placed the device onto the nearest wall. She freaked out a little when the device slipped through her hand, as it appeared to turn into liquid, but then it reformed on her wall, looking as if it had been planted in there when they had built the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took this opportunity now to look fully over the list of options available to her through this device. There was an option for almost everything imaginable, including a randomized setting (which she knew she would have to try out later). On the first few pages alone, she found buttons to swap body parts, add body parts, remove body parts, morph body parts, change history, change personalities, change time, rewrite the laws of physics, grant superpowers, mangle with family trees, create new life, explode the universe and start anew, travel to dimensions unknown. You name it, it was on this device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With this device, I could do literally anything I want!' Amanda thought, new ideas forming in her head on what she could do. 'But first, I should probably actually choose something to change before assuming this device has this much power.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what on the menu would be normal enough that it may have gone unnoticed if this actually did all the stuff it said it did. Scrolling through the variety of options, she eventually decided upon adding an additional body part. She scrolled through the options, choosing the smallest noticeable change she could think of, which happened to be adding an extra eye. Upon choosing the specifics, the menu changed to an anatomical design of her body (Which disturbed her, as she had no naked pictures of herself, and this was perfectly correct down to the strange mole she had on her back) and allowed her to pick where on her body she would like to place the eye. Remembering the old Grimm story <i>One-eye, Two-eyes, and Three-eyes</i> (A very interesting tale of a normal, two-eyed middle child proving her superiority over her exotic, one-eyed older sister and younger three-eyed sister) decided to change everyone into triclopses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Amanda could tell something was up, as her vision was now a bit cross-eyed between her regular set and her extra eye. Thankfully, she had the forethought to attempt this experiment in front of a mirror, and quickly recognized her third eye on her forehead. It looked exactly like her other eyes, but had no tear ducts on either side. She wasn't sure if this was how it regularly was for triclopses, or happened just because she didn't specify enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter messing around with her eyes, seeing how looking different ways affected how she saw and how to close each eye independently of the other, she finally felt like she had enough control to examine what else changed in her world. She assumed that Rachel and David would be up, and that if the instruction leaflet was correct, they would believe this was completely normal. Walking into the living room, she saw Rachel sitting on the couch in her nightgown reading a newspaper with her two eyes while she watched morning cartoons with her third one. David was on his laptop, and swiveled his third eye to look at you and say \"Good morning sleepyhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too.\" Amanda said, as she began to pace around the room looking for other changes that might have been caused. She began flipping through the variety of dvd cases that David had lying around the room. Most of the dvd cases that showed people now featured a very prominent third eye, and she found that those that featured cyclopses regularly now featured two-eyed creatures. \"So ... notice anything different today?\" Amanda asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly,\" David said, still looking at his laptop with his regular set of eyes and only looking at you with his third one.<br>\r\n\"Are you wearing that new nightshirt we got last week?\" Rachel said, focusing her third eye on you, trying to figure out what you meant by something different.<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Amanda said glancing out the window, and noticing a jogger standing near the crosswalk with three-eyed sunglasses and a three-eyed dog. Amanda began to freak out, because the device was only supposed to affect those inside of the house. \"I'm going to go get the mail,\" she said, rushing out the door. Rachel and David shared a weird look with their third eyes, but then eventually went back to what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside in nothing but her nightshirt and panties, Amanda attempted to run up to the jogger to ask him if he had noticed the changes, but became dizzy after stepping out onto the deck. She closed her eyes to regain her composure, and suddenly noticed she only had two eyes again. She looked at the jogger, and realized him and his dog were back to normal as well. Looking into the window of her house, she saw Rachel watching cartoons with a newspaper in her lap, and David on his laptop (a.k.a. Their normal Saturday routine) both with only two eyes. She stepped back inside, and was again greeted by the same discomfort in her stomach. Closing her eyes (this time three of them again) she reopened them, and saw that everyone she had seen with two eyes had three eyes once again. 'Whoa,' she thought to herself, 'that device really is magic.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed back to her room, eager to try more changes once again. She began debating on what to do, and ultimately decided to ...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't due to leave for the city until around 11:30. Now seemed to be a good time as any other to test out the device. She had to read the documentation firsthand, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To set up your device, mount it on a wall. This will make the device change all reality within your building\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how she could place it on her wall. There were no holes for screws or nails. The manual didn't seem to specify how to mount it. She guessed the only way to find out how to mount it was to simply place it on her bedroom wall. She placed the device on her wall, which subsequently seemed to turn into liquid. It engulfed the device, but it still felt like a concrete wall to her hands, which did not get engulfed. After a few seconds, the device surfaced, and it appeared to be attached to her wall. It was now turned on. There were several selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvisible<br>\r\nDisappear<br>\r\nCopy<br>\r\nSize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopy? She wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the word \"Copy\" and another screen came up. There were two selections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole body<br>\r\nSeparate parts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the selection \"Whole Body\" and brought up \"Mind and Body and Clothes\", \"Clothes and Body\", and \"Body\". She read the manual again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reality will change a person's whole body and mind, or just their. For instance, the Mind and Body change, press the word 'Mind and body' once. To change the reality of people's minds, resulting in people looking and acting similarly to the copied target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda decided to copy the body and clothes of Rachel, and pressed an arrow pointing right near the bottom of the screen. She then pressed the selection \"Body and Clothes\". The words were then highlighted in green. Amanda found she was now in her best friend's clothes, but She didn't feel too different. Thus, she went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and sure enough, she was now Amanda. She could see her body looked identical to Rachel's including her pink night gown. Where her body had once been in her comfortable pajamas, she had a noticeably larger bust, longer hair, and meticulously cared for skin. Her underwear was now replaced with a small wedgie inducing thong. She raised her arms slightly to adjust her underwear and her boobs jiggled. She groaned and now understood Rachel's complaints to her about having large breasts. She rubbed her hands on her face and noticed she no longer had acne scars from her teenage years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured that David and Rachel must be up by now. She went to the living room, and found Rachel, legs spread out sitting on the couch, watching television and adjusting her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Amanda\", the nightgown said.<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachel! This must be weird seeing someone who looks exactly like yourself, but listen, I can explain...\", said Amanda.<br>\r\n\"Explain what? Also, it's David duh. What do you mean exactly alike?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I got an alien device, and warped reality.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sound kind of crazy. I'm not exactly as smart as you, but I know that this is what normal people look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked up at the television. It was showing some Sports news show. All the characters in the show looked like Rachel wearing her usual girly clothes. They were arguing, but it was hard to differentiate who was talking because of their identical voices. There was a DVD case on the table. The people photographed on that were also Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, we're supposed to look like this?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, are you OK? Look outside if you don't believe me,\" said David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out onto the road, and could see various people walking down the street. It looked strange, to see her best friend walking and interacting with herself. Amanda then went outside, and as soon as she exited the door frame, she noticed that she was back to her normal form. She could was no longer Rachel. The people outside went from looking like copies of Rachel to their normal male and female selves. She went back inside, and became Rachel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we're supposed to look the same?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I mean what else could we even look like?\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take a look outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed David by the arm and took her outside. They then both reverted to their true, visible form wearing their respective pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Amanda said, pointing to various people. \"That's our true form.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... totally see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went back inside, and reverted to his Rachel form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no I didn't see why you dragged me outside.\"<br>\r\n\"But we became ourselves again\"<br>\r\n\"No, I don't remember changing form, sorry babe I don't think I get what you're trying to say\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stormed off to her bedroom. She had a read of the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, people affected by this change will accept it as if they were always like that. However, you can program it so they can feel the change. Select 'Mind Control', and a list of names will come up. These consist of people who live or work in the building, as well as regular guests. Names highlighted in green will be people affected by the changes, but will not feel it. Press their names and the highlight will be removed, thus making them able to feel the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she looked through potential changes, she realized what she wanted to do. The world was about to change its entire view of sex and sexuality! The went through the choices, and as she went deeper, the device seemed to read her mind. When she was ready, she pushed the button, and there was a strange wave that went out from the device and passed over the entire planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that Amanda knew that all STDs were a thing of the past. In fact, there were none. But that was only the start. Females no longer had periods, but instead controlled their fertility, and could only get pregnant when they wanted to. Of course, that would have been a big enough change, but that was really only a small change if the rest became true. She walked out into the living room to test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Rachel were sitting on the couch playing a video game. You sat down next to them and, after you worked up the nerve, you cautiously said, \"You know that girl who waitresses down at the Meeting Place? Missy?\" They both grunted as they tried to focus on their game. You continued nervously, \"I think she is cute, and I think she likes me, but, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David died, he paused the game, \"Oh for crying out loud Amanda! Why don't you just come out with it? She likes sex with males, and you would like to have my masculum. Am I right?\" After you shyly nodded, he sighed, \"Well, you know I prefer being male, but if it is okay with Rachel, I could let you have it for a while if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled, \"It has been a while since I had some girl on girl time with anyone but Amanda, so it is okay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grinned as he looked at Rachel thinking of that part, \"Okay, but you should be warned, I think he is ready to reproducate. If you get stuck with a penis for a while, don't blame me!\" He began to undress, let's get it over with so I can get back to my game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel held her breath as she undressed as well. Was it really true? Did her changes to the world really take effect? David took her and held her tight, and she did the same to him. Soon, David got a strange look on his face, as one of great pleasure, then Rachel started to feel something probing at her pussy. Soon, many tendrils began to penetrate her vagina and grow inside of her! Soon, the mass of what had been David's balls and penis were moving from him to her. A minute later, she felt it fill her cavity completely, and then blend into her flesh, and it was done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey separated and Amanda looked first at David, who now had a pussy. Then she looked down at her crotch, and sure enough, there was what had been David's large cock! It had worked! The changed she had made was that, now, everyone in the world was born female. In fact, everyone was actually female their entire lives. Reproduction was achieved through a symbiotic parasite known as a masculum. It lived by attaching itself inside of a female, making her what had previously been considered to be male. It would used the genetic code of the wearer to generate sperm for human reproduction, and in exchange for being allow to draw nutrition from the human body, it gave the female a tremendous experience in male sex with a different kind of pleasure than a female would experience. It had little mind of its own, though it might get erect more often when it wants to instead of its host's desire. It could also make the host horny if it went too long without expelling some of its cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had also warned that he, well, now she, thought that the masculum was ready to repruducate, which was how it reproduced. It would do a form of asexual reproduction, leaving part of itself embedded inside the female as it abandoned the host to seek a new one. When that happened, the body of the host would become sexually neutral for a while as a new masculum grew in and on her. It would be permanently attached, forcing her to be male, until it was ready to produce sufficient cum. Only after its first 'orgasm' could it leave that host and attach to a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, having, or not having a masculum effected the host's body in other ways. As Amanda watched, David began to shrink, and to soften as her body reverted to a very feminine form. Withing five minutes, David had the breasts, hips, and waist of a girl, and looked as feminine as Rachel. On the other hand, Amanda felt herself, well, himself, growing, becoming more muscular, loosing the breasts he had known for years. Shen it was done, Amanda was much taller than David. It really worked! He was male!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged David, \"Thank you so much! You are a true friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him, \"Glad to help. I hope Missy appreciates him on you. You look as good as a male as you did as a female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came up, \"Yeah. If Missy doesn't go for you, maybe we can have a threesome tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed, \"I guess we will see!\" He now started to dress in what David had been wearing, and David put on the dress Amanda had been using. Amanda decided to explore the world as a male now!</span></div></div>",

It was a very new experience for him to feel the penis in his pants, but have a flat chest. He actually missed the bounce of his breasts. However, soon he saw Missy, and that was the start of a new experience, hitting on a girl as a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings worked out well though, and before he knew it, he was in bed with Missy, who insisted on calling him Mander because she thought Amanda was too feminine for a hunk like him! He loved sex as a male, and it really was a tremendous experience for him! This new reality was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he fell asleep with Missy laying her head on his chest. He had very strange dreams that night though. Some of that was explained in the morning. He heard a deep, decidedly male, voice calling him to wake up, \"Mander! Mander! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was groggy, but shook his head and saw a strange male with very long blonde hair shaking him away, \"What? What is going on?\" His voice was high, like a girl, but something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy said, \"Why didn't you tell me your masculum was do close to reprudicating?!? I don't really want to be male you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped Amanda awake and he looked down at his naked body. He was small again. Even smaller than his female form, but he was not female. He looked at his crotch, and now he had neither a pussy or a penis, but just a small hole for peeing. Oh no! the masculum reproduced in her/his body! After embedding the offspring in her/him it went to Missy and attached to her while they slept! Amanda's body was like that of a prepubescent girl, or perhaps, since eventually she/he would be growing a new penis, a prepubescent boy would be more accurate. It would be months before 'he' would be able to get rid of the young masculum growing there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"I am sorry Missy. I borrowed my friend's masculum. Don't worry. She grew it from a dwindle, so she will want it back.\" It was funny what information came to his mind in this new reality. David chose a masculine name after just this kind of thing happened to her. And the term dwindle, was the term for the baby masculum now growing inside of him. It was a bit scary, because it was fairly common for a close bond to grow between the masculum and the host body that it developed in. Would he have a hard time giving up the penis when it was mature?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy growled, \"You better be right! If I am not female on time for my shift, it will be a problem. People don't tip males as well as females you know!\" He tossed Amanda a sun dress. \"You can wear my clothes until we get to your place. They better fit ME when I leave there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, David was home when you got there. Both she and Rachel were rolling on the floor laughing at Amanda's predicament. Missy was just glad that David was more than happy to have his old buddy back! Before she left, Missy said, \"If you do end up keep that masculum, don't bother to ask me out again!\" And with that she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your friends, still laughing at you, and said...</span></div></div>",

Since it was an accident, it was kind of the male equivalent of a girl getting knocked up in the old world. (Which, ironically, could not happen in this world. At least, not by accident.) He was stuck with this dwindle until it grew to a full-fledged masculum. \"Seriously! What am I supposed to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stopped laughing enough, David said, \"Well, for a month or so, you could get away with dressing like a girl and passing as a young girl, but as it grows, so will you, so it will become obvious that you have a dwindle. At that point, I would advise dressing in more masculine clothing and maybe picking a male name to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sighed, Rachel added, \"Yeah, and for now, I can run home and get some clothes from my little sister.
