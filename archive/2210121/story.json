I just want a new bike right now\" Misty says enraged about what he did to her bike and wanting him to replace it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Pikachu, my pikachu is not too good\" Ash announces all of a sudden  reaching to Misty's heart of cause since she loved Pok\u00e9mon as much as any other Pok\u00e9mon trainer so she says \"huh, is it very serious\" feeling compassion for said Pok\u00e9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, there is nothing I can do to help now\" Ash continues getting an \"Oh\" from her. Just as all that was said Nurse Joy came out with her Chansey assistants beside her wheeling in Pikachu on a stretcher<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA conversation between the group confirmed that Pikachu will be okay and it was good that Ash got his buddy to the Pok\u00e9mon center quickly (we all know what happens in that conversation and if you don't remember watch episode 2 of the very first series of Pok\u00e9mon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your Pikachu needs a good rest in the recovery room, you should go in with it Ash\" Joy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Ash said thankfully to Joy, than says to Misty \"Look, I am sorry about your bike but I am going to need some time to make things right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I fell for that last time\" Misty yelled at Ash getting a \"huh\" from the boy \"Well you should take care of Pikachu now and we will settle this later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay\" as returned nervously confused and worried about what she will do to settle this issue <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Insert team rocket attack and the saving of the Pok\u00e9mon center*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ash and Pikachu were about to leave Viridian City, Misty runs up to them to catch up and yells \"You haven't forgotten that we still have to settle the issue about my bike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fell to the ground in shock having forgotten about that and was hoping to leave Viridian City as soon as possible \"Look I don't have any money to get you a new bike but I promise, I will replace it\" Ash says hoping to placate the angry water Pok\u00e9mon specialist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are going to replace it, but since you cannot replace it straight away so until you do I will join you on your journey and......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However during this attack Jessie was able to knock out and kidnap Misty. Misty awoke with her hands and legs tied up,  blind folded and gagged.<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing with the twerp?\" Misty heard James say as she was waking up. \"Don't worry about it James I got a plan with her.\" Jessie said Misty was able to regain her senses. However she noticed that her normal overall where completely ripped up leaving her in her underwear. Misty then felt there hot air balloon land as team rocket left the balloon Misty was then picked up over Jessie's shoulder. Misty felt Jessie's hand on her butt as well as her back. Misty felt Jessie's hand start to play with her butt as they walked. \"Gotta say twerp you got a fine bottom there.\" Jessie said causing Misty to blush. After a few minutes Misty was finally set down and her blind fold and gag was removed. <br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do to me? What did you do to my Pokemon.?\" Misty asked \"shh twerp, if you want your Pokemon back you'll have to do what I say if you don't we'll sale your Pokemon away.\" Jessie said Misty then quite down as Jessie lend up to her face. \"For you anyway I got a secret and that secret is that I'm a lesbian so I joy kidnapping girls and turning them into my toys.\" Jessie said as she pushed a button on a remote revealing a screen with other females all dressed up as babies. Misty watched in aw as she noticed females around Kanto some trainer she fought before but there was some nurse joys and officer Jennes. Jessie then walked behind Misty and started to fell up her butt and breasts. \"Ummm your breasts need work but damn your butt fines.\" Jessie said causing Misty to blush again. \"Come on you know you can do anything.\" Jessie said, something inside Misty's body enjoyed the felling of another girl touching her. As Jessie continued to play with Misty, Misty started to squirmed around and moan. Jessie smiled knowing she could break the girl easily however she wanted more fun with her. Jessie then pushed Misty down onto the floor and grabbed an adult wand.she then straped it to Misty's thighs with the top against her privates. A jot of pleasure went up Misty's body as Jessie turned on the wand. Jessie soon left to go grab the diapers leaving misty with the toy. <br>\r\n(Inside Misty's mind.) \"Fight it Misty, fight it, you can't let Jessie win...\" Misty said to herself \"why fight something this good girl?\" A voice come out as Misty looked she saw herself dressed up as a big baby. \"mommy takes good care of us.\" She heard other voices say as she saw the other girls apair in her mind as well. She had to fight it she couldn't let Jessie win she has to get back her Pokemon get back to...to Ash. (Outside of Misty's mind.) Misty's mind fight the pleasure as Jessie came back seeing the girl squirming around and moaning. She lifted Misty's legs up removing her panties and sliding a diaper under her. Jessie closed up the diaper remove the wand right before Misty's body climaxed. Jessie lifted the girl and carried her to a adult baby jumper. Jessie started the jumper kissing the girl. Misty on the other hand started to enjoy the jumper and diaper as her mind drifted away as she finally climaxed. Misty body limped as she fall asleep. Jessie on the other hand smiled as she lifted the room turning off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys time to grab the other twerps.\" Jessie said to James and mewoth <br>\r\nThe three lifted <br>\r\n(Inside Misty's mind.)<br>\r\nMisty first saw her normal room however now she saw a crib, changing table highchairs etc. Worse of all her tomboy clothes replace with bright pink baby clothes. Misty's tomboy personally was no where in her mind anymore she was being turned into a adult baby. Misty diaper began to fell up as thoughts soon lifted her mind. (Outside Misty's mind.) Standing in front of Misty was no other then a Alakazam which was Lifted by Jessie to you with Misty. Misty's mind soon blinded as droll started dripping from her mouth as her diaper got more filled. Alakazam stopped his hypnosis seeing how Misty was just a drolling baby. Jessie James and mewoth where starting to fight Ash and Brock. However the two where beaten kidnapped. Team rocket laughed knowing they win for once and can now rub there victory in the twerps faces. However Misty wasn't completely finished as her mind still remembered her beloved Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will win? Who will be turned into babies and will Misty break free from her captures? </span></div></div>",

Not because of the lack of new pokemon, but many had already been discovered in other regions. Despite the lack of anything new, his life was still filled with the usual as he now faces off against Team Rocket, whose plans had gone to desperation at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more robots!\" Jessie cried, holding a small device in her hand, \"No more holes and no more half-brained schemes! Now it's time for Team Rocket to stand up for what we should have been all along! Now give us your Poke'mon or we'll simply do this the easier way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giovanni disbanded you guys years ago!\" Ash shouted back, clearly irritated from these two constantly hounding him, \"His entire empire was crushed both here and Johto and there is no existence of them anywhere! There should at least be something for you two to do together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shows what you know, kid\", Meowth replied sarcastically, \"Dey ain't gonna be happy till yous Pokie-man's are ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what Poke'mon?\" Ash asked, \"Last time I saw you, all you had left was Wobbufett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this!\" Jessie cried and pressed the button on the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Pikachu flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence swept between the two groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't woirk!\" Meowth cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the demonstration at the Team Rocket lab clearly showed it did! What went wrong!\" James asked, moving to Jessie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should <i>I</i> know, I'm not a scientist!\" Jessie roared back, pressing the button multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is embarrassing\", Ash muttered, \"Pikachu, use thunderbolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu's cheeks sparked as an electric discharge fired at the trio. Within a matter of seconds, their now electrified bodies jerking in pain, an explosion went off, launching the trio into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">blasting</font> <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">off</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">again</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">!!!!!!</font>\" The familiar cry rang out as they once more became a twinkle in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what, Pikachu. After eight years of this, I think I'm starting to get too old for this\", Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu turned his head towards Ash and replied, \"Pika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled, \"Sorry. Just thinking out loud. Hey, looks like they dropped something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walked over to the scorchmarks from Pikachu's attack. The device that the trio had dropped now lay with the button face down and the back compartment popped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no wonder the device didn't work. They had the batteries backwards\", Ash cried, laughing at such a simple mistake. He picked up the device and switched the batteries to the correct position. a small light turned on just above the buttons and Ash examined the device. The device itself was nothing special but with two buttons on the remote, one reading command the other reading undo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what this does?\" Ash asked himself, \"Maybe I should test it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who does Ash test it on?)</span></div></div>",

After all, despite his mom retiring from her job (he suddenly wondered what she did in the first place) and relaxing with Mimey at home, she still called him just to check on him every now and then. It was only right to treat her just as equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was still lightly swept as it seemed Mimey had still been sweeping the path recently, and the laundry was hanging from a clothesline on the side of the house. The grass had been growing taller, but not to the point that Ash could have sworn a wild Rattata could have snuck in to make a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was at his side the entire time, crying out in joy when they finally came home. Hopping onto the second step of the porch, he waited for Ash to approach. Ash chuckled and rubbed his poke'mon's head, scratching him behind the ears and causing him to squeal happily. Smiling still, Ash moved to the door, pulled out his spare key his mom gave to him during his Galar adventure, and walked in. Taking off his shoes as he stepped inside, Ash watched as Pikachu, suddenly smelling the waft of food in the kitchen, scurry off to discover what smelled so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Ash called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here!\" He heard Deliah call out, \"Oh, hello Pikachu! It's so good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-ka!\" Pikachu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was it's own standard affair and Deliah couldn't get enough of Ash telling her that it was so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ash. But I never asked. I thought you would have come here much sooner. What happened?\" Deliah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed, \"Jessie and James were up to their old...I 'm not sure that tricks is the right word these days. Should I go with routines or failures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice, Ash\", His mother admonished, \"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they tried to use this on me, but it didn't work\", He said, pulling out the device, \"Took care of them while they were figuring out what was wrong. Apparently the batteries were upside down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliah chuckled, \"That's happened to me sometimes. I often forget which way the batteries in the t.v. remote go too. So, what does it do? Is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\", Ash replied, \"All I know is that They pointed it at me and pressed the left button\". Before Deliah could stop him, Ash unknowingly pointed the device at his own mother and pressed the 'command' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight 'blip', a series of sparks from the antenna at the end of the remote. Deliah made a slight jumping motion, but settled back into a relaxed sitting position, her eyes blank and staring at Ash with total obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't imagine, what this would do. Do you, Mom?\" Ash asked, looking back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't imagine, son\", Deliah replied robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blinked. \"Uh, Mom? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliah replied in the same monotone voice, \"I am simply waiting for a command, son. Give you the word and then press the button to activate all commands. If you wish me to stop, simply point the device at me and hit the undo button and it will be as if I had awoken from a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, kinda weird you would know so much without having used this before, Mom\", Ash replied, \"Now what do I do?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash had been on his way to Cerulean City before being accosted by the bumbling trio. The trip to Vermilion City was smoother than his experience with the S.S. Anne from long ago, but it reminded him of his earlier adventures with Brock and Misty, whom he hadn't seen since his Alolan days. Now was a good time to check back with them. Misty was closest so he decided to head her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was near evening when Ash arrived at the Cerulean Gym, Pikachu bouncing after him in excitement. Patrons were leaving the gym, talking excitedly or just with a breath of relaxation. The gym itself hadn't really changed much, still with its pink and orange domed ceiling and the large Dewgong smiling down at the passersby. Ash moved to the automatic doors and walked through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of water and sea life brushed his nostrils as he entered. One of the attendants tried to inform him that the gym was closing but Ash merely stated he was an old friend and asked where Misty was. The attendant replied that she was in the gym, relaxing after a hard fought battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh made his way to the gym arena, he and Pikachu having come here so often they were practically regulars here. The gym seemed to have some slight altercations done to the arena, particularly more floating platforms for trainer and pokemon to walk across, but leaving more than enough room for Pokemon to swim in the pool's depths. Misty herself was stretching on the far side of the pool, wearing a white jacket over her one piece bathing suit, her hair let down. Pikachu gave an excited cry and lept towards the water gym leader, causing her to cry in surprise but with the familiarity of two old friends meeting once more. Ash chuckled to himself and followed after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you\", Misty said to the Pikachu, \"But where's-Oh, there you are, Ash Ketchum\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hesitated on those words. The last time they had met, it hadn't ended on good terms. It was hard to catch Misty's mood these days, for she had become as similar to read as the ocean waves: calm and collected at first, but terrible and destructive the next moment. Ash placed a hand behind his head and chuckled, \"It's good to see you again, Misty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\", Misty replied, which could have meant a number of things as she moved to Ash, \"Let me get into something more comfy and then we can talk more. Give me a moment\". She made her way to the changing rooms. After a few moments she returned, though not much had changed. Her hair was tied back in the ponytail style she had when they first met and she was wearing her shorts over her bathing suit. She led them to her private office where they sat and she asked him how his journey went. Ash went into the quick version of the story, not wanting to take up too much of her time, but not wanting to leave out any of the good things that had happened to them while they were gone. As he was talking, Ash watched for signs of emotion of Misty's face. She seemed relaxed, calm, but there was a steel in those eyes that Ash wasn't sure what to make of. He had no idea if she was still upset with him or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and just as soon as Pikachu and I got out of Vermilion City, guess who decided to show up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you don't mean...?\" Misty groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, Team Rocket. Just no robot or hole in the ground. They were using this\", Ash pulled out the device, and showed it to Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Misty asked, \"It looks like a remote, but I've never seen one with just two buttons. Doesn't seem like their m.o. either, ever since Team Rocket was disbanded\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Ash nodded in agreement, \"The idiots didn't have the batteries in the right spot either. All they did was point it at me and tried to press a button\", Ash absentmindedly did the same at Misty before she could protest, \"But nothing happened. Seems rather silly on there part, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It. Does.\" Misty replied in an almost robotic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh started. Pikachu gave a confused \"Pika?\" noting the strange tone Misty was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, are you alright?\" Ash asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty replied in the same monotone voice, \"I am simply waiting for a command, Ash.

If you wish me to stop, simply point the device at me and hit the undo button and it will be as if I had awoken from a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ash thought aloud, \"It's as if she's under some sort of spell. But a device this small couldn't do that. Could it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost reminded of their adventures in HopHopHop Town where Misty had a bad run in with a Hypno's power, causing her to run through the town and acting like a Seel. It had been both terrifying and funny at the same time, though Misty hardly remembered a thing about the incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly smirked as he suddenly realized what he could do with such a device. He turned back and opened the door, \"Hey Pikachu, would you mind going to Misty's pokemon and see how they are doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu turned his head in confusion, but Ash merely replied, \"Only for a short while. I need to figure out how to get Misty back to normal and I don't know how long this will take\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctant to leave Ash alone, Pikachu agreed and moved out to find Misty's Pokemon. Ash closed the door after him, and tunred back to Misty, relaxed and staring blankly at him. He grimaced, but was determined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do?\" He muttered to himself.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps this would be a chance to see if the device would do as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, the room is filled with all the bug Pokemon you can think of. Any bug Pokemon you can think of that terrify you\", Ash said out loud, and then he pressed the button that read, \"Command\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he pressed it, Misty turned back to normal, \"Well, I guess that's Team Rocket, being Team Rocket.

Did the device even work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it do?\" She asked, \"It seems like they were hoping something to-\" Misty stopped as she seemed to notice something in the room.

The next thing Ash knew, she cried out again as she started crawling away from something under the desk. Ash watched as Misty stopped in her movement and then stood up, danced on her tip-toes in a circle, and then jumped onto the desk. She then noticed Ash, \"Ash! Ash, help! There's bugs everywhere!\" But her faced changed from hope to horror as if she was seeing something that would have never even been capable in her woken dreams. She let out a bellow of abject terror and fled to the only spot she could think of, which was the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh got up and moved over to see Misty still in the corner, huddled up and crying. What was more, the twenty year old had a wet pot on her pants and the floor underneath her. She was peeing herself. </span></div></div>",

He tossed the device to Pikachu, commanding him to use thundershock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the accuracy of a well trained Pokemon, Pikachu let loose a shower of electricity at the device and it with a small bang, the device was no more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed to herself, \"Well, I need a change\". She huffed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you clean up\", Ash replied, \"I did kinda caused this in the first place\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty nodded, \"Yeah, you did\". Misty walked out of the office, leaving Ash to navigate the gym to find a cleaning closet. When he had finished the cleaning, thanking that the room was tile rather than carpet, Misty had just returned wearing a new pair of shorts with a white top that reminded him of a Goldeen with the red along the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was twirling her ponytail in an embarrassed way and muttered, \"Thank you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\", Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was silence in the room, broken only by Pikachu looking between them and saying, \"Pi? Pi? Pi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you wanna get something to eat?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure\", Ash replied, \"If...you're okay with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am!\" Misty cried in irritation. She widened her eyes in shock,cleared her throat and said, \"Yes. I am okay with that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they left the gym, now closed, to find the nearest diner.

Ash sat down in the chair opposite and spoke once more, \"Misty, you're going to realize you wet yourself again, but you are okay with that.\" Ash then pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty blinked and looked around, \"Whoa, what happened? I thought I was standing up but now I'm here and...Oh great!\" She stood up again, exposing her wet shorts once more, \"I peed myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked, \"Like a little girl?

They went a small ways to suddenly find themselves in Misty's bedroom. The room had a deep blue carpeting with various posters of both Pokemon tournaments and pop bands on the walls. A model waterfall decorated with various Pokemon cascaded water in a never ending cycle. And in a corner of the room was a bookcase filled with a large assortment of books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty turned around to face Ash and said, \"Wait here\". She turned back around and left the room with Ash inside. Ash sighed, not sure as to what was going on. He then looked at the bedside table to see a picture of him and Misty while they were on the orange isles. Ash remembered that Tracey had taken the picture before they had help from a random passerby to take a picture with all three of them, which Ash treasured. Yet why did Misty have a picture with just the two of them? Wasn't she friends with Tracey too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Misty came walking back, \"Just glad the gym is closed. I don't want to answer any other questions than I am now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh noticed that Misty was carrying a small package that had already been opened with several white objects inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that....?\" Ash started but Misty cut him off, \"We had these whenever we got too sick to move. It helps when we can't get to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out one of the items, and then started to remove her shorts, leaving her in her bathing suit. She then stopped, then slowly turned to Ash as both realized what was going on. She was removing her clothes and Ash was just standing their watching her do it. And in her hand was a diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were blushing harder than the time they caught each other in the Cinnabar hot springs. Misty broke it with a hesitant, \"Well, are you changing me or do I have to do it?\"</span></div></div>",

Honestly, Ash, you have to learn <i>some</i> responsibility\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty took her hands and pushed the straps of her swimming suit to the side of her shoulders. Ash gulped, unsure as to what he was watching but for some reason a deeper voice of reasoning stirred, sniffed the air and merely muttered that this should happen and he should watch till the end. Misty grabbed her swimsuit by the sides and pulled down, revealing her naked body to Ash. Careful to avoid his gaze, Misty kicked the garment to the side and then went to her closet and rooted around in there for a bit, showing off her butt to Ash while he stared. Ash wasn't sure if the AC in the gym had broken down but the room seemed to get increasingly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty pulled back out and then moved to the bed, holding onto a box of wet wipes. She then laid down on the bed, pushing herself into a position so that most of her body was on the bed and looked at Ash expectantly. Something kicked him mentally and Ash moved over to her, grabbing the diaper in the process. He gulped again and muttered, \"I'm sorry. I don't have much experience with this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty blushed and replied, \"Neither do I. Guess this will be a learning experience for both of us. Just use the wipes first\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, opened the box, grabbed a wipe and made to move to Misty's crotch. His hand stopped, unsure as to what would happened next. There had never been a moment where a woman was naked in front of him and asking him to do anything, innocent or otherwise. The closest thing that came to any kind of sexual tension was when Serena kissed him many years ago. The very thought of her lying there in front of him in the same situation was just as intoxicating with Misty. In fact, thinking about both of them together in front of him was even more exciting. Then he thought about May. Then Dawn. Iris. Mallow. Lana. Lillie. More and more, girls sitting in front of him, waiting to be changed, blushing or smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash!\" Misty whined, \"What are you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blinked, \"Sorry. Lost my head\". He pressed the wipe against Misty's skin and proceeded to wipe the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed as the cold, wet cloth came into contact. As ash moved around and lower towards her opening, Misty moaned. Ash was touching her. It wasn't the way she had hoped or imagined, but after all those years he was finally touching her. They had their moments when she felt it was a 'will we won't we' relationship, but nothing like this had ever happened. She always thought with the other companions Ash had he would settle down with one of them. Especially with the three girls she had met in Alola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, thinking he was finished with the task, pulled out, but accidentally grazed Misty's crotch with his hand. Misty let out a gasp, arching her back in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah, sorry. Just....just diaper me already, okay?\" Misty replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grabbed the diaper and, after several false starts, found the front and unfolded the diaper. He told her to sit up and she lifted her body so he could slip the diaper under her bottom. Telling her to lay back down, Ash pulled the front over her crotch. He let go, but it fell over. he tried again, but it still fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash\", Misty smiled, exasperated, \"You have to tape it together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Ash smacked himself in the forehead, knocking off his hat. He looked around Misty for the tape, found them and then moved to tape the diaper together, each strip making a ripping sound and the diaper crinkling all the while.Finally, Ash was done and he stepped back to observe Misty as she sat up, looking at Ash's handiwork, her naked breasts jiggling as she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too tight?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty contemplated the question, \"Well I'm not uncomfortable, but it's tighter than I thought. So either I've been doing it wrong, or you are a lot eager to see me like this than I thought\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked shock and turned around, \"I...I'm sorry! I-\" He was interrupted with Misty turning him around and saying, \"No, it's okay. It's okay. I wanted you to see me like this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blinked, unsure as to what the device did to make Misty thought like this. \"Why?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",
