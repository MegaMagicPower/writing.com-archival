I just want a new bike right now\" Misty says enraged about what he did to her bike and wanting him to replace it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Pikachu, my pikachu is not too good\" Ash announces all of a sudden  reaching to Misty's heart of cause since she loved Pok\u00e9mon as much as any other Pok\u00e9mon trainer so she says \"huh, is it very serious\" feeling compassion for said Pok\u00e9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, there is nothing I can do to help now\" Ash continues getting an \"Oh\" from her. Just as all that was said Nurse Joy came out with her Chansey assistants beside her wheeling in Pikachu on a stretcher<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA conversation between the group confirmed that Pikachu will be okay and it was good that Ash got his buddy to the Pok\u00e9mon center quickly (we all know what happens in that conversation and if you don't remember watch episode 2 of the very first series of Pok\u00e9mon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your Pikachu needs a good rest in the recovery room, you should go in with it Ash\" Joy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Ash said thankfully to Joy, than says to Misty \"Look, I am sorry about your bike but I am going to need some time to make things right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I fell for that last time\" Misty yelled at Ash getting a \"huh\" from the boy \"Well you should take care of Pikachu now and we will settle this later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay\" as returned nervously confused and worried about what she will do to settle this issue <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Insert team rocket attack and the saving of the Pok\u00e9mon center*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ash and Pikachu were about to leave Viridian City, Misty runs up to them to catch up and yells \"You haven't forgotten that we still have to settle the issue about my bike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fell to the ground in shock having forgotten about that and was hoping to leave Viridian City as soon as possible \"Look I don't have any money to get you a new bike but I promise, I will replace it\" Ash says hoping to placate the angry water Pok\u00e9mon specialist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are going to replace it, but since you cannot replace it straight away so until you do I will join you on your journey and......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However during this attack Jessie was able to knock out and kidnap Misty. Misty awoke with her hands and legs tied up,  blind folded and gagged.<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing with the twerp?\" Misty heard James say as she was waking up. \"Don't worry about it James I got a plan with her.\" Jessie said Misty was able to regain her senses. However she noticed that her normal overall where completely ripped up leaving her in her underwear. Misty then felt there hot air balloon land as team rocket left the balloon Misty was then picked up over Jessie's shoulder. Misty felt Jessie's hand on her butt as well as her back. Misty felt Jessie's hand start to play with her butt as they walked. \"Gotta say twerp you got a fine bottom there.\" Jessie said causing Misty to blush. After a few minutes Misty was finally set down and her blind fold and gag was removed. <br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do to me? What did you do to my Pokemon.?\" Misty asked \"shh twerp, if you want your Pokemon back you'll have to do what I say if you don't we'll sale your Pokemon away.\" Jessie said Misty then quite down as Jessie lend up to her face. \"For you anyway I got a secret and that secret is that I'm a lesbian so I joy kidnapping girls and turning them into my toys.\" Jessie said as she pushed a button on a remote revealing a screen with other females all dressed up as babies. Misty watched in aw as she noticed females around Kanto some trainer she fought before but there was some nurse joys and officer Jennes. Jessie then walked behind Misty and started to fell up her butt and breasts. \"Ummm your breasts need work but damn your butt fines.\" Jessie said causing Misty to blush again. \"Come on you know you can do anything.\" Jessie said, something inside Misty's body enjoyed the felling of another girl touching her. As Jessie continued to play with Misty, Misty started to squirmed around and moan. Jessie smiled knowing she could break the girl easily however she wanted more fun with her. Jessie then pushed Misty down onto the floor and grabbed an adult wand.she then straped it to Misty's thighs with the top against her privates. A jot of pleasure went up Misty's body as Jessie turned on the wand. Jessie soon left to go grab the diapers leaving misty with the toy. <br>\r\n(Inside Misty's mind.) \"Fight it Misty, fight it, you can't let Jessie win...\" Misty said to herself \"why fight something this good girl?\" A voice come out as Misty looked she saw herself dressed up as a big baby. \"mommy takes good care of us.\" She heard other voices say as she saw the other girls apair in her mind as well. She had to fight it she couldn't let Jessie win she has to get back her Pokemon get back to...to Ash. (Outside of Misty's mind.) Misty's mind fight the pleasure as Jessie came back seeing the girl squirming around and moaning. She lifted Misty's legs up removing her panties and sliding a diaper under her. Jessie closed up the diaper remove the wand right before Misty's body climaxed. Jessie lifted the girl and carried her to a adult baby jumper. Jessie started the jumper kissing the girl. Misty on the other hand started to enjoy the jumper and diaper as her mind drifted away as she finally climaxed. Misty body limped as she fall asleep. Jessie on the other hand smiled as she lifted the room turning off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys time to grab the other twerps.\" Jessie said to James and mewoth <br>\r\nThe three lifted <br>\r\n(Inside Misty's mind.)<br>\r\nMisty first saw her normal room however now she saw a crib, changing table highchairs etc. Worse of all her tomboy clothes replace with bright pink baby clothes. Misty's tomboy personally was no where in her mind anymore she was being turned into a adult baby. Misty diaper began to fell up as thoughts soon lifted her mind. (Outside Misty's mind.) Standing in front of Misty was no other then a Alakazam which was Lifted by Jessie to you with Misty. Misty's mind soon blinded as droll started dripping from her mouth as her diaper got more filled. Alakazam stopped his hypnosis seeing how Misty was just a drolling baby. Jessie James and mewoth where starting to fight Ash and Brock. However the two where beaten kidnapped. Team rocket laughed knowing they win for once and can now rub there victory in the twerps faces. However Misty wasn't completely finished as her mind still remembered her beloved Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will win? Who will be turned into babies and will Misty break free from her captures? </span></div></div>",

Not because of the lack of new pokemon, but many had already been discovered in other regions. Despite the lack of anything new, his life was still filled with the usual as he now faces off against Team Rocket, whose plans had gone to desperation at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more robots!\" Jessie cried, holding a small device in her hand, \"No more holes and no more half-brained schemes! Now it's time for Team Rocket to stand up for what we should have been all along! Now give us your Poke'mon or we'll simply do this the easier way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giovanni disbanded you guys years ago!\" Ash shouted back, clearly irritated from these two constantly hounding him, \"His entire empire was crushed both here and Johto and there is no existence of them anywhere! There should at least be something for you two to do together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shows what you know, kid\", Meowth replied sarcastically, \"Dey ain't gonna be happy till yous Pokie-man's are ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what Poke'mon?\" Ash asked, \"Last time I saw you, all you had left was Wobbufett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this!\" Jessie cried and pressed the button on the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Pikachu flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence swept between the two groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't woirk!\" Meowth cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the demonstration at the Team Rocket lab clearly showed it did! What went wrong!\" James asked, moving to Jessie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should <i>I</i> know, I'm not a scientist!\" Jessie roared back, pressing the button multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is embarrassing\", Ash muttered, \"Pikachu, use thunderbolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu's cheeks sparked as an electric discharge fired at the trio. Within a matter of seconds, their now electrified bodies jerking in pain, an explosion went off, launching the trio into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">blasting</font> <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">off</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">again</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">!!!!!!</font>\" The familiar cry rang out as they once more became a twinkle in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what, Pikachu. After eight years of this, I think I'm starting to get too old for this\", Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu turned his head towards Ash and replied, \"Pika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled, \"Sorry. Just thinking out loud. Hey, looks like they dropped something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walked over to the scorchmarks from Pikachu's attack. The device that the trio had dropped now lay with the button face down and the back compartment popped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no wonder the device didn't work. They had the batteries backwards\", Ash cried, laughing at such a simple mistake. He picked up the device and switched the batteries to the correct position. a small light turned on just above the buttons and Ash examined the device. The device itself was nothing special but with two buttons on the remote, one reading command the other reading undo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what this does?\" Ash asked himself, \"Maybe I should test it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who does Ash test it on?)</span></div></div>",

After all, despite his mom retiring from her job (he suddenly wondered what she did in the first place) and relaxing with Mimey at home, she still called him just to check on him every now and then. It was only right to treat her just as equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was still lightly swept as it seemed Mimey had still been sweeping the path recently, and the laundry was hanging from a clothesline on the side of the house. The grass had been growing taller, but not to the point that Ash could have sworn a wild Rattata could have snuck in to make a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was at his side the entire time, crying out in joy when they finally came home. Hopping onto the second step of the porch, he waited for Ash to approach. Ash chuckled and rubbed his poke'mon's head, scratching him behind the ears and causing him to squeal happily. Smiling still, Ash moved to the door, pulled out his spare key his mom gave to him during his Galar adventure, and walked in. Taking off his shoes as he stepped inside, Ash watched as Pikachu, suddenly smelling the waft of food in the kitchen, scurry off to discover what smelled so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Ash called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here!\" He heard Deliah call out, \"Oh, hello Pikachu! It's so good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-ka!\" Pikachu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was it's own standard affair and Deliah couldn't get enough of Ash telling her that it was so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ash. But I never asked. I thought you would have come here much sooner. What happened?\" Deliah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed, \"Jessie and James were up to their old...I 'm not sure that tricks is the right word these days. Should I go with routines or failures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice, Ash\", His mother admonished, \"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they tried to use this on me, but it didn't work\", He said, pulling out the device, \"Took care of them while they were figuring out what was wrong. Apparently the batteries were upside down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliah chuckled, \"That's happened to me sometimes. I often forget which way the batteries in the t.v. remote go too. So, what does it do? Is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\", Ash replied, \"All I know is that They pointed it at me and pressed the left button\". Before Deliah could stop him, Ash unknowingly pointed the device at his own mother and pressed the 'command' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight 'blip', a series of sparks from the antenna at the end of the remote. Deliah made a slight jumping motion, but settled back into a relaxed sitting position, her eyes blank and staring at Ash with total obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't imagine, what this would do. Do you, Mom?\" Ash asked, looking back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't imagine, son\", Deliah replied robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blinked. \"Uh, Mom? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliah replied in the same monotone voice, \"I am simply waiting for a command, son. Give you the word and then press the button to activate all commands. If you wish me to stop, simply point the device at me and hit the undo button and it will be as if I had awoken from a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, kinda weird you would know so much without having used this before, Mom\", Ash replied, \"Now what do I do?\" </span></div></div>",
