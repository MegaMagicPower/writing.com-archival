            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Chad McCallum, and in a few short days you will be marrying the love of your life, Pamela Davis. The two of you have been seeing each other now for over 3 years and now it just feels right to take that next step and get married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela (Pam) is a sweet girl who loves life and loves you! You met her initially when you were looking for a personal trainer at the local gym. Being single you thought why not get a female trainer! In walked Pam and the rest is history!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wedding fast approaching, your groomsmen have decided that it is time that you have a bachelor party to celebrate your \"being single\" (you have a girlfriend, how are you single??). Uncle Ted said he'd be happy to provide a private room and pick up the tab at his pub in town for all the guys. After drinking and hanging with the guys, who knows what will happen next! When you hear from your Best Man (and Best Friend) David Russo that you'd better get a good nights sleep tonight because starting early tomorrow afternoon the drinking begins! You smile and shack your head, and wonder how you are going to survive to til the wedding with such good friends looking out for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 9pm, the house door opens and in walks Pam from a night of fitness instruction down at the gym. She might be sweaty, but she's a gorgeous sweaty! Standing at a good 5'8\", with a tight athletic figure; she drops her purse on the kitchen counter before coming around and meeting you at the dining room table. She's wearing a set of her workout clothes (she has many); a tight sleeveless blue top and black form fitting Lululemon yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... what a night.\", she sighs as she approaches, reaching for you with a wiery smile. She works hard, but she reaps the benefits of her work too with such a killer body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough night at work, sweety?\", you ask while taking her in your arms and hugging her.<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I had five customers for personal training with weights, and then had to teach a pilates and yoga class... I'm beat! I think I'm going to go take a nice long bath.\", she says, pulling a way as she starts to head to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got some news....\", you say. This peaks her curiosity and she turns back, \"Oh?\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... I was talking with Dave today and it looks like I'm having a bit of a bachelor party starting tomorrow afternoon.\", you say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam walks back to you, looking in to your eyes, \"Think you can handle it?\", she asks. \"I don't know, but what choice do I have?\", you reply.<br>\r\n\"True.\", she says. Then she looks away in thought before saying, \"Suppose I can't tell you not to get in to trouble since that's what bachelor parties are all about, right?\"  She knows what can happen a bachelor parties, the legends of them at least... strippers.... back room special \"services\"... lots of drinking and getting sick and when you're drunk who knows what will happen! She also knows you get drunk quickly (she does too!)<br>\r\n\"I promise I will do everything I can NOT to get in to trouble.\", you try and reassure her, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShacking her head with a chuckle, she turns and heads down the hallway to the bathroom. She glances over to the table as she walks by it, seeing a Portasizer sitting there. She picks it up and examines it a bit. It looks like you've just finished doing another repair on one for a customer of yours. She glances back to you with a bright smile and playfully points the device at you and says, \"You better not get in to trouble, or I'll shrink you down so you can't go anywhere!\". She doesn't shoot you, of course, but the threat is still there and it makes you a little uneasy having one leveled at you, even if it is in jest. You've never been grown or shrunk from a Portarsizer, but are very familiar with the stories surrounding such devices. And even though Pam knows you work on them all the time and there are a few around the house, she's never taken an interest in them either. What does she need one for anyhow when she has a big guy like you around to protect her! She's just teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam sets the Portesizer back down on the table before turning and continuing down the hallway, entering the bathroom. With the door still open to it she calls out, \"Well, I guess its good to know at least since I was told today by Sophie that I'll be getting a bachelorette party starting tomorrow afternoon too.\" You blink at this news. You actually hadn't thought about her having a bachelorette, too! You're a little uncomfortable with this... I mean... strippers? What if she gets drunk and does something?!! Oh the irony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping her head out the bathroom doorway, its as though she's read your mind, and adds, \"...and I promise I won't get in to any trouble.\", she says, trying to reassure you before closing the bathroom door and running her bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you try and get as much sleep as possible before the start of tomorrows partying. Pam falls right to sleep next to you in bed, but you, you have trouble getting to sleep all night. The thoughts of your own bachelor party coupled with the thoughts of her bachelorette (what will they be up to??) give you much to think about. You can be a tad jealous with her and other men! Finally, you reason that it'll all be good fun with good friends and family. Nothing can go wrong and you'll have a great time, you say to yourself before falling asleep. Unfortunately, you can be a bit naive some times, too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pam purrs gently and hugs your pillow as you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, and head to the door. As you open it, you are greeted by your best man David Russo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So buddy! You ready for a great day today?!\", he says as he enters with a shit eating grin. \"Yeah yeah... I'm ready as I'll ever be\", you reply, and head in to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee. Dave follows you in and grabs a seat at the table, where you still have a few items you had been tinkering with. In the mix of components and gadgets sits, the three Portasizers you had been working. Dave eyes them with some amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these actual Portasizers?\", he asks, having never been this close to one, let alone three, before! \"Yep.. tricky little bastards to fix.\", you say, as you pour two cups of coffee and head over to Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats the plan, ma man?\", you ask Dave.<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as its almost noon, the two us will pick up a few of the guys and then head on over to your Uncle's pub to get things started. After that... well, lets just say the real party gets started.\", Dave says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine...\", you say, \"...not like I can avoid this I guess. It's tradition and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! So what does Pam think about all of this?\", Dave asks.<br>\r\n\"Surprisingly ok, considering she's having her Bachelorette today too. It kind of bothers me actually. I mean, what if ...\", you say, trailing off.<br>\r\n\"What if, what? She gets a stripper and is \"forced\" to suck his dick? Yeah, they can be pretty crazy parties I hear. But chin up old buddy, we're gonna have our own fun, you just wait!\", Dave says with an air of confidence.<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks. That makes me feel sooo much better now.\", you say sarcastically.<br>\r\nDave just shakes his head and grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up your coffee you tell Dave that you are going to go have a shower and get ready for the big day. You head off to do that leaving Dave in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are off, Dave sips his coffee and twiddles his thumbs. His eyes shift over the Portasizers sitting near him on the table, the size of small TV remotes, and thoughts begin to brew in his mind. He gives a quick look around before reaching over and grabbing one. He studies it closely, wondering how it works. It has a small LED screen on it and a thumb pad like an iPod. As he touches the pad the devices comes to life in his hand and he takes in a deep breath, partly of surprise and partly of excitement. In his very hands is a device that only the rich, the military and government are able to afford. Being able to control the size of any living or non-living object with one of these things spoke deeply to a long fetish of size-changing Dave had harboured and spoke to no one else other than you. Dave was so tempted to try it here and now, he was in awe of the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps could be heard coming towards the kitchen and Dave flinches holding the Portasizer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">&lt;A Portasizer Story&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was nearing when Chad McCallum and Pamela Davis would be married, becoming a beautiful couple to share the rest of their lives together. But neither of them have had their bachelor or bachelorette parties yet! Fortunately, some of their family and closest friends have come forward to take them out. The guys with the groom and the gals with the bride. As tradition would have it, neither party knows what the other is up to. It is suppose to represent ones last night as a single man or woman before the wedding. After a few beers and shooters, the guys decide that it would be a hell of a lot of fun to go spy on the bride and the ladies of the bachelorette to see what they are up to. Things take a turn, however, when the guys methods of spying on the girls backfire on them. Do they get caught? And if they do, do they even get recognized by the ladies at the bachelorette when they've become a mere inch in height!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you take on the role of the groom Chad, as he and the guys go on a \"little\" adventure that could, potentially, end their existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a shrinking/giantess story. Chad and Pamela are very much in love; their relationship is strong. They are with their closest friends, and some of their family (and step-family) during this adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Main Characters:</u></b><br>\r\n<b>The Groom</b><br>\r\nChad McCallum (The Groom): Chad (age 27) is a small business owner, repairing and selling computers and electronics. He is Caucasian; stands 6'0\", in good shape,  with a bald head. A little geeky, yes, but he does enjoy playing sports like soccer and basketball to keep himself in shape after sitting at a computer desk most of the day. One of his specializations is the repairing of Portasizers (devices created a few years ago that look like TV remotes that can grow and shrink living and non-living material), which has made him fairly wealthy; its a good business! He's a bit of an amateur at drinking, and gets drunk very quickly. Not as adventurous as his wife.<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://backseatcuddler.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/vindiesel.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://backseatcuddler.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/vindiesel.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Bride</b><br>\r\nPamela Davis (The Bride): Pamela (Pam) is a 25 year old yoga and fitness instructor at the local gym. She is Caucasian; stands 5'8\", with a tight athletic body; dark brown shoulder length hair that she wears in a pony tail most of the time. Brown eyes, light smooth skin and a sweet innocent look on her face. She's also a bit of a geek and loves to read comic books, especially The Avengers. She is an open minded girl that likes to try new things, too; from eating live bugs one time at the zoo to skydiving. She enjoys her independence once in a while and goes out with her girlfriends for Ladies Nights every now and then. She can get a little wild when she's drunk, too!<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinkle/4642018959/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinkle/4642018959/</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/cc222076278393\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/cc222076278393</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinkle/4642633018/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinkle/4642633018/in/photostream/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feel free to fill in the bridal party, family and friends involved in the story!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Things of Note:</b><br>\r\n1.

You can make them aware or keep them unaware, again, up to you!<br>\r\n5. Try not to stay on one \"giantess\" fetish, even if its the kind you like most (ie. You love Feet. Cool! Write some foot fetish stuff, but please don't write only about that)<br>\r\n6. Try not to introduce too many new characters. A parent or grandparent, sure, but what is there already should be plenty to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><b>100 GP per Chapter added will be rewarded as a thanks for contributing!<br>\r\n</b></span></td>",
