The village was full of strong males; Sethryan lucked out of the genetic gene pool, being smaller and thinner than pretty much everyone his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan felt a strong hand help him up. He saw Arista, a tall Amazon, as strong as she was beautiful. Along with three quarters of the men in his village (and some of the women deal), Sethryan had a huge crush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Aristra\" he said, somewhat intimidated by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob, Sethryan\" she said as she smiled warmly, then turned to Krogar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such an ass, Krogar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just trying to help him out. He's a man, he should be a warrior, not so pansy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're warriors, Krogar. We're supposed to protect the weak, not prey on them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he appreciated her standing up for him, Sethryan felt a 'thud' inside at her referral to him as weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrogar stood, then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, we'll go. It's no big deal, Sethryan, if you're in trouble just call for her to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and his group left. Sethryan thanked Aristra then went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Sethryan stood at the edge of the village. He wielded a sword that belonged to his father. Krogar was an ass but he was right: if he ever wanted to impress Aristra, he would need to be a warrior, an adventurer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where to start?</span></div></div>",

Besides, he figured he had beginner's luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at the edge of the witches territory, and stepped onto it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand instantly he was on a dirty, wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, someone tries to come on my property without tribute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch came up; she was very overweight and old, with green-tinted skin and an eyepatch.

His butt wasn't just getting fat, it was looking like the fat ass of a woman, big and bubbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't the only thing; his hips were widening, and his thighs getting thicker. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped, but that was little comfort: he now had a lower body of an overweight woman.

An ass as fine and shapely as his own would inspire unending ridicule from Krogar and perhaps some lustful stares from the more sexually liberal members of his village. He had to fix this, and as far as he could guess, slaying the Witch was his only option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, sonny, how does it feel to have the curviest backside this side of the southern wilds?\" she teased, cackling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan readied his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to die, you foul beast!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA war cry erupted from his throat as he lunged forward towards the old hag, rushing with all of his strength. Unfortunately for the lad, his body was not accustomed to the pounds of thick flesh that had been added to his rump. He quickly lost his balanced and tumbled to the floor, colliding in a flash of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA howl of laughter came from the Witch, harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not as swift as you used to be. Not with these,\" she said, unleashing a painful slap that trailed across his rump. A loud crack echoed through the room as the fat of his behind began to jiggle vibrantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since you seem so intent on killing me, I guess you leave me with little choice. As wimpy of a fighter as you may have been, its only fair I leave your fighting skill permanently neutered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second ball of light escaped from the tip of her wand. It was identical to the first, though somewhat larger in size. It traveleed at a faster pace as well, rapidly circling his prone form. Paralyzed in fear, he didn't even mount an escape as the ball collided into his upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingly sensation overtook his entire upper body, burning from head to belly button. Like with his behind, the change happened in an millisecond. Pounds of fat coalesced in his chest as large, plump breasts came to fruition. Waves of hair forced themselves from his scalp as his locks became more delicate. Facial features melted down, softening into more feminine forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh,\" Sethryan mumbled, running his hands over his newly formed chest. \"I-I'm a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a rather curvy one at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn me back, you must! I can't go back like this. They'll laugh at me, or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of joke?\" the Witch asked. \"You threaten to kill me and then beg for mercy? I should have you serve as my slave, or worse! Alas, though, I feel some bit of mercy. If you want your old body back, listen to me. Return from whence you came, and bring me my tribute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan was immediately whisked away in a magical wind, transported back to his home village. He was just outside the gate, reclining in a pool of mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to find tribute and fast. For that, he would need some assistance. He decided to seek out...</span></div></div>",

Once he did, he sort of quickly walked (it was difficult, he was on the brink of having to waddle) out, the witch's laugh echoing in his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept going, deeper and deeper into the woods. Finally, he stopped, and sat down by a tree. At his new butt had padding, he sighed. What now? If he came back like this, it'd be even worse; he'd literally be the butt of everyone's jokes. But what could he do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you well, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that? and miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a fluttering and a tiny figure appeared in front of him; she was only a few inches tall, but she resembled an adult human woman, a good looking one at that, with butterfly wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're\u2026a wood nymph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"My name is Grazia. And I thought only females of your kind had so large a butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan grew red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not-it was the witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrazia gasped, and listened with astonishment your tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky to have gotten off so easy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy?

He slowly moved his arms and placed his hands on his newly fatten hips reluctantly giving them a squeeze as if to affirm if they were real, to his dismay they were very real and soft to the touch. With his arms at his sides he realised how wide his bottom half had become as he noticed his arms rested at an angle, his hips now curved outwards wider then his shoulders. Moving his hands to around the back he felt that each cheek must have been bigger then his head and felt much heavier too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind raced as to what the village would think of him; his lower half would now make him a bigger target for Krogar and his cronies, also even though he had always felt his chances with Aristra were slim they were much slimmer now. Since it was a warrior village he felt his rump would only hinder him in any form of combat, he would never gain their respect like this! It all became too much for him as he threw out any warrior pride he had left out the window, collapsed on to his knees; his thighs and rump wobbling as he did; and begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please old hag turn me back! I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused! I'm a warrior I'm not suppose to look like this!\u201d He pleaded, his hands clenched together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why should I?

You bring no tribute like any respectful warrior would!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan kept his head low to the ground as he continued to beg, his eyes welling up as he reflected more on his failings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease change me back old hag!

And fine I'll turn you back BUT you must do something for me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan slowly raised up from the floor, he had was ecstatic to hear this though also slightly worried at what she may ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I'll keep to my word, what do you wish me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, what he lacked in strength he made up for in agility and quickness. He wasn't necessarily the fastest person in the village, but he was fairly speedy and possessed good endurance. As such, he jogged lightly through the woods, growing more and more weary as he approached the heart of the forest. Going wasn't really easy- there were many gnarled branches and roots to impede his pace- but he traveled quite a distance before the weight of the sword really began to bother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan sighed and leaned up against a tree.

He walked forward, almost forgetting his father's sword in the process, and admired the ruins. He had heard of an older civilization in these woods that had died out for unknown reasons well before he was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's something-\" he said, imagining there must be some kind of loot he could take from this place that would impress Aristra. The town, or what was left of it, was no more than 1000 yards across at its widest point, and roughly circular. In the center was a small temple of sorts. Sethryan was not a religious man, though he had always tried his best to not be a blasphemous individual so as to not offend any of the villagers. However, he felt an odd attraction to the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm entering, I suppose,\" he pondered as he stood at the door of the temple, which was at best 20 feet across and 9 feet high. Inside, light filtered in through a skylight which seemed close to forcing the whole structure to collapse. Sethryan's eyes had to adjust to the slightly darker environment before he could start to make things out. In this temple, there was only one statue, surrounded by incense that had long ago been extinguished. The statue, Sethryan found, was rather strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikely a statue of some fertility goddess, it was made of gold, or at least seemed to be- but that wasn't what surprised him. The statue was of a fat woman. Large breasts, soft, doughy tummy, and finally a very wide and very prominent lower half. She was pear shaped, that was for sure. The statue was incredibly life-like, which Sethryan found rather unsettling, but a quick tap revealed that she was truly composed of some metal, likely gold. Around her thick neck, a beautiful necklace was tied, on it, a large, pink gem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aristra would definitely like that,\" he thought, knowing that nearly any woman would find such a stone enticing. Sethryan looked around him, half forgetting that this was of course a civilization that had died out long ago. Though he was not particularly attracted to the idea of defiling someone's holy place, he reasoned that this place was truly abandoned and that Aristra would appreciate such a necklace more than any dead person could. With little effort, Sethryan managed to take the necklace from the statue.</span></div></div>",

The way the light played off it was simply divine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm in trying it on, right?\" he asked himself aloud, fiddling with the necklace's lock mechanism and then making it click as he placed it around his neck. The necklace felt surprisingly heavy. Sethryan could feel the weight of it on his chest. Then- much to his surprise- the amulet began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan almost bolted out of the village, amulet on his neck, but he was paralyzed with fear. Much like the amulet, the eyes of the statue of what he assumed was the fertility goddess began to glow. His head began to throb with pain- what the hell was going on? Despite his best efforts to stay on his feet, Sethryan collapsed to the ground, and blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, the sun had moved quite some distance across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- what happened?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took my necklace- you fool!\" hollered a woman's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan looked around, now wide awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I- didn't mean to!\" he shouted, searching for the source of the voice, \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in your head, you fool!\" she shouted, \"I'm the goddess Shephik!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you stuttering fool, the goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my head,\" he pleaded, placing his hands on his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how!\" she said uselessly, \"Since you put on the amulet, I'm stuck in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Sethryan reached around his neck and found that the necklace still hung there. However- the lock mechanism was gone! He'd have to rip the piece of jewelry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No use!\" shouted Shephik, \"Tearing it off won't fix this. In fact, it'll probably only make things worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do?\" asked Sethryan angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- there must be a holy man around here- he should be able to help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan nodded, the goddess seemed to have her head in the right place, even if that place happened to be right inside HIS head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can head back to my village-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was walking, stumbling a bit as he did so- but that wasn't what was freaking him out... he wasn't the one who was making himself walk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!\" muttered Sethryan, almost whispering. The Goddess had possessed him, she had control of his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop fighting it,\" she said, now using Sethryan's voice, vocalizing through his mouth rather than in his head. It was as if he and the goddess had switched places, the goddess now being the controller of his body while he was merely her passenger, \"I mean you no harm, peasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan relaxed a bit. This was almost kind of relaxing, in a way. He didn't feel so attached to his body. Sure, he could feel the mud on his feet and the wind in his hair, but he somehow felt as if a very thin film now served as a barrier between his mind and his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" said the Goddess, now using Sethryan's voice, \"Just let me get this done, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Sethryan, now speaking only in his head, \"Just be quick about it, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" said Shephik, seemingly somewhat appreciative of the fact that Sethryan was being compliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan directed her toward his village in her head, and the made for it. The Goddess seemed a bit awkward when she moved at times, clearly being unused to Sethryan's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thin,\" she said, running her (Well really, Sethryan's) hands down his frame, \"All bones and skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to insult you, peasant,\" she said in a very matter-of-fact tone, \"I recognize that being thin has it's upsides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" responded Sethryan as Shephik almost tripped on a root that was sticking out of the ground, \"I'm just so used to being the small, skinny guy in my tribe. Not too much fun to be had there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Shephik, approaching Sethryan's hut, as he had instructed, \"You know... I could probably help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Sethryan in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes- but it's your choice, should we go see the holy man first or try to do something about your size?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe he won't believe me, but seeing I've physically changed should be convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShephik nodded Sethryan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking, scrawny one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan instructed Shephik to an isolated lake area where Shephik could change him without being seen.

He felt funny, of course, but that was to be expected. He moved towards the water, feeling a strange sway in his walk. He felt quite a bit bigger... had Shephik given him muscles too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan looked in the water, his face looking back at him.

Other parts of his body had followed in suit, with his thighs and arms getting a bit of pudge as well, but none had been as filled as his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell?\" he asked aloud, dumbfounded by his change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The change is complete, Sethryan.

During the day, she liked to spend her time training in the woods, wielding her sword with such amazing skill that it was like an extension of her body. Sethryan found her in the usual spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed only in a chainmail bikini which showed off every inch of her toned body, Aristra was practicing her swordplay, striking at the air, thrusting and parrying with flawless efficiency, her long golden hair glimmering in the sun. She smiled as she noticed the skinny boy approach and walked towards him. \"Come to spar with me?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...not exactly,\" Sethryan blushed. He had sparred with her once, and been left with bruises and scrapes that had left him barely able to move. He wasn't the finest swordsman in the village, and Aristra was probably the best. \"I got you something.\" He reached beneath his shirt and brought out the necklace, the large pink gem glistening in the light as he handed it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gods...\" Aristra gasped as she held the necklace up to the light. \"Where did you find this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...found it on a quest,\" Sethryan lied, not wanting to tell her about the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quest?\" Aristra seemed surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" Sethryan said, trying to sound as confident as he could. \"I killed a Goblin and took it from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAristra looked impressed. \"Ha! And they said you weren't a warrior, wait until they see this!\" She was twice Sethryan's height, and she bent down to kiss him on the cheek. \"Thankyou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSethryan blushed. He wished he hadn't lied, but she might not have accepted the gift if he had told her the truth, and maybe this would finally get him some respect. Goblins weren't exactly the finest warriors in the land, but they were widely hated by his people, and slaying one in combat would at least earn him a few pats on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAristra placed the necklace around her neck and stroke the pink gem in it's centre, smiling. \"I will wear this with honour,\" she said. </span></div></div>",
