            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the last class of the day, an announcement was made via the intercom, listing out names of students who are instructed to immediately come to the school\u2019s gymnasium as the class ends. One after another, the list of names seemed to never end. Even more peculiar was the fact that all of the names were girl names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma silently flinched upon hearing her own name being mentioned. She immediately questioned if she was in trouble, but so many other students were listed brought ease to her heart, letting her feel assured that whatever the reason is, several dozens of other students would have to go through it along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rung, marking the end of class, Emma hurried out as students from other classrooms flooded the halls and crowded the area. Curiosity fueled her fast paced walk. What could be the reason behind rounding up so many girls at the gym all of a sudden? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching her destination, her attendance was taken, showing that this was important enough for them to keep track of everyone. There was a man with a microphone barking orders at the students to take their seats at the bleachers; behind him were many male teachers and students in the school system with stern and serious looks on their faces as if they\u2019re ready for business. In the gymnasium, there were numerous steel cages set up along with several other arrangements involving other equipment and machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma decided to sit down in the front row towards the edge. Once all of the listed students settled down for this unexpected gathering, the man with the microphone went straight to the point, introducing them to the \"game\". Immediately, the girls began chattering with one another only to be quieted down by the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules to a game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma quickly pondered why it was only girls who were invited.The speaker continued on his explanation while the dozen of males standing behind him actually had a big role to play in this game. They were the ones who will try to torture the girls who must yell out \u2018I surrender\u2019 if they submit to them. Once that happens, they get placed in those cages until the game is over. Among those who last the next twenty-four hours without being caught, they would be awarded with free college tuition. Any doors leading to the outside are already locked, but anywhere within the school building was allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidening her eyes at the sound of the reward, she couldn\u2019t believe what she just heard. Half of her was amazed that such a reward would be given out; the other half of her was deeply worried. They were locked inside for the next twenty-four hours, and the word \u2018torture\u2019 brought her concern. Would they actually try to harm them? The fact that only girls were brought here implied lewd intentions from the men. She wasn\u2019t too sure how to feel about this situation and wanted to see what the other students would do before making her own decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls, Kelly, was a renowned bully of this school and complained about this entire setup. In response to her outrage, several of the teachers grabbed and carried her off. As if to set an example, they strapped her down to a table, completely overpowering her in terms of physical strength. Kelly continued to yell in rage until the man suddenly tickled her without mercy, leading to an abrupt squeals of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and the other girls watched fearfully at how effortlessly the class bully was handled. Usually, she wouldn\u2019t pity a girl like that, but as much as Kelly deserves this form of torture and learn what it was like to be handled by a bigger and stronger person, she couldn\u2019t help but empathize what it was like to be tickled in such a cruel manner, not even being able to move an inch from being strapped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a game where she would be pit against the other girls directly, It was the males who were the threats. If torture involved tickling, then she was already at a huge disadvantage if captured. Out of everyone in this gym, she very well might possess the most sensitive body. However, if she was to be restrained and tormented like Kelly is right now, then it would only be a matter of time before she goes insane. But, if that does happen, she could always surrender. However, that free college tuition was also quite enticing, especially being a senior and about to graduate this year. Her family would be thrilled, and she would only need to suffer for twenty-four hours. One day\u2019s worth of time for four years\u2019 worth of benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game had begun. The dozens of men and boys dashed towards the bleachers, scaring off the crowds of girls as if a pack of tigers had been released from their cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma quickly stood up, staring at the students dispersing out. Several shoulders bumped and rammed into hers, causing her to stagger. Following others\u2019 example, she ran off the best as she could, but the crowd of girls caused her to be slower at running, something the men quickly took note on and began targeting the group of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat girl is in danger of being caught first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Details about the game:</b><br>\r\n1. If the girls surrender, they can try and break free and continue on with the game until the 24 hours is up.<br>\r\n2. Come up with descriptions/information on the male student(s) or teacher(s) that will capture and torture the girls, even a backstory on why they chose to capture that specific girl.<br>\r\n3. Add any other details or information that enhance the game and story.<br>\r\n<b>What happens after the game?</b><br>\r\nThe girls who lose will be sent to a new school with the male student or teacher that got them to surrender and will take classes and learn different types of tickle torture. The girls will be used for the male students to get hands on practice while the lessons are taking place.</span></div></div>",
