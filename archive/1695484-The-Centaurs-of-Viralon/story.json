Fiona felt the ground rumble slightly growing steadily stronger, and then came the rolling thunder of approaching hooves. Fiona sprang up, she knew they were coming. She ran back to the village screaming, \u201cCentaurs! The centaurs are coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to shout her warning a second time before several centaurs darted past her into the village. She saw some chase after some villagers, laughing like jesters; some broke down the doors into the homes and started looting the villagers\u2019 valuables.

I\u2019m surprised no one else had already grabbed her. She was just standing there looking so forlorn.\u201d Iolande replied, squeezing Fiona a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the centaurs slowed and Fiona saw their destination, a large and beautiful city made of carved marble. Fiona gaped in shock, she had heard of the centaurs\u2019 city, but the stories of its beauty paled in comparison to the real thing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIolande passed through the gates into the city before trotting eagerly to her home with her catch. When she got home she set the human on the ground and set her front hooves on the human\u2019s shoulders to keep her from escaping as Iolande grabbed a small bottle of a blue liquid from a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh- what are you going to do to me?\u201d Fiona asked nervously, trying to ignore the discomfort the centaur\u2019s hooves were creating in her shoulders. She heard several terrifying tales of what the centaurs did with the humans they captured, and she didn\u2019t what to find out if any of them were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon sweetie.\u201d Iolande replied as she opened the bottle and forced the human girl to drink a mouthful.<br>\r\nFiona coughed and choked as the concoction went down her throat. She was surprised when the centaur stepped off of her, but then she realized that the centaur and the room seemed to be growing. The liquid she swallowed was a shrinking potion! When Fiona finished shrinking the centaur smiled as she reached down and grabbed the now three inch girl. \u201cNow you get to find out what I\u2019m going to do with you.\u201d Iolande giggled. Fiona gulped nervously as she awaited the centaur\u2019s next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please don\u2019t eat me, I beg you!\u201d Fiona screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur paid her no heed. Her tongue emerged out of the wet cavern and licked the human, savoring the exquisite flavor. \u201cPlease. I\u2019m worth more to you out of your stomach. I\u2019ll be your servant, anything!\u201d Fiona pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry lass, I already have three slaves to please me. A fourth is just too much to handle right now.\u201d Iolande said sympathetically before pushing the human into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona screamed and cried, but nothing helped her as the centaur\u2019s tongue writhed beneath her, tossing her about the cave-like maw she was now trapped in. For a few moments this went on, when everything stilled Fiona knew what was coming next. Without warning the centaur leaned her head back, letting Fiona slip down her tongue towards her waiting throat. Fiona scrambled madly up the tongue, or at least tried to, but the centaur\u2019s saliva was too slippery for her. She felt the throat muscles grabbing her feet and pulling her down. With one last plea for mercy she was swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIolande traced her snack\u2019s decent with her fingers until the bulge went down past her chest. \u201cEnjoy your stay within me human. And good luck in the afterlife.\u201d She said as she headed to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Iolande, Fiona soon fell into the centaur\u2019s stomach. She knew there was nothing she could do now. She just sat there, crying for what she had lost, and awaited the end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, I actually would fight for the centaurs.\" \"If I had told you when you were little you might of blown our cover. Over time, it slipped my mind to tell you. I am truly sorry you found out this way honey,\" Her mother says. Fiona replies, \"Well it's in the past and we can't change that. I'm just happy to see you again mother. And now I understand why I always felt different from everyone.\" They then hug each other and shed tears of happiness. Seleen then says, \"You best get some rest dear. They hit you a little harder than they expected to. I don't want you passing out on the floor and risk further injury Fiona.\" \"Alright mom, and thank you for coming to get me, in a manner of speaking,\" Fiona says. \"Your welcome,\" Seleen says, and with that Fiona fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I need you to hold still dear, this may sting a little,\" Seleen says, and starts to clean Fiona's wound. \"Can ask, ah, why was I brought here after centaurs ransacked my village? Not that I'm not grateful for your hospitality, but I thought I would be in a cell or something if they didn't kill me,\" Fiona says. Seleen replies, \"Well for one, Those Centaurs weren't from our kingdom of Viralon. They from the land of Minota, a vicous clan, bent on taking over or kingdom and all other kingdoms surrounding us. They ransacked your village before we could intercept them we drove them off but only found you and that little boy over there alive.\" Fiona looks over and sees her little brother Nick, who was only eight years old and was laying there asleep. \"Nick,\" She says trying to get up, but is soon stopped by a pain in her head and she lays back down with her hand on her head. Seleen grabs her and says, \"Easy does it dear, you body is not ready to get up and move around just yet. Wait till tomorrow, besides your brother Nick is unconcious. We gave him an sleeping potion to help him rest. He won't wake till tomorrow morning. Here have some of this, it will help make the pain go away.\" Seleen hands her a bottle of liquid, and Fiona is not sure if she should take it but so far they have been helping her, so she takes the bottle and drinks it. It had a sour taste to it, but she goes with it. \"Now I suggest you get some rest yourself dear, we'll talk more tomorrow,\" Seleen says. \"Alright,\" Fiona says, feel like she had a mother again and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I am truly sorry for what happened, and I was wanting to ask you, would you be willing to become one of us and leave your old life behind?\" \"What do mean?\" Fiona asks after taking another gulp of her soup, completly confused by this question. \"Well I could turn you and your brother into one of us by means of unbirth. You would both become my children and you would not have to live with the painful memories of your past. You would forget that you ever existed as human. But I would need your consent on this, it's all up to you,\" Seleen says. Fiona was thinking this over, very carefully.

On the other hand, she wouldn't have to remember what happened to her village for the rest of her life and would be much stronger so that if she ever crossed paths with the Minotians, she could fight them.

They a group of barbaric centaurs that kill your people for sport and are bent on ruling all of Viralon and the surrounding kingdoms. Our Queen has been trying to put a stop to their treachery, but by the time we got wind that your village was being attacked, they had already killed all of your people, except you. When the Queen's soldiers found you, they didn't know if you would pull through, but they couldn't leave you there helpless, so one of them carried you back to the palace. The Queen is very kind and was very worried about you, well, we all were, but we're relieved that you pulled through. You've been out for the past three days so you may feel a little light headed. Oh, and the Queen's name is Aglacia in case you were wondering. She's my mother, by the way, what's your name dear?\"  \"Fiona,\" she replies. \"Well Fiona, your going to have to lay in bed for a few days till that wound heals up. And my mother will be in to speak with you in a little while so don't fall asleep yet,\" replies Seleen. \"Wow, I really had the wrong impression about most centaurs. I thought that your kind shrunk us and ate us if they took us alive. Maybe that's just the barbarians you told me about, Fiona says. \"Yes they are. We do have potions that do shrink humans but usually that's the kids around here who ask for it when they want to play games and the potions only last 15 minutes. The barbarians use the potion to their pleasure and that's to swallow humans with ease if they don't enslave you,\" Seleen says. \"I hope I don't run into them again,\" Fiona says. \"Don't worry, you won't.

Since you were the only human left alive, my daughter and I have been talking it over, and it was actually her idea, we were wondering if you wanted to become part of the family,\" Aglacia says. Fiona is a little shellshocked at the Queens request. To have a human and centaur as family seem a little out of place. \"Um, I'm a little confused. How can a centaur and a human be a family? It seems a little out of the ordinary, not that I don't apreciate the offer,\" Fiona says. \"We thought you would react that way. What we're meaning is you would become a centaur yourself. I would have to unbirth you and keep you in me for 9 months, that is how long the transformation takes and you could start life over. Most humans who are brought eventually want to become centaurs themselves and we kindly let them become one. Now you don't have to become one of us if you don't want to but the offer will always be open to you,\" Aglacia says. Fiona had to admit she has always wondered what it feels like to be a centaur, and now she was being offered that chance, in a way she didn't expect though, but still she would get to start on life and have mother and a sister to take care of her. With that she says, \"I will become your daughter I really don't have anywhere else to go and everyone I know is gone.\" A tear falls from her eye as she says this. \"We know dear. But you'll soon let go of your past and have a future with your new family,\" Aglacia says as she gently hugs Fiona glad that she excepted the offer. \"Now you'll have to stay in the hospital for a few more days. After that we'll have you safely tucked away in my womb. So get some sleep after your sister gives you your dinner,\" Aglacia says. \"Yes your highness, I mean mother,\" Fiona replies. The Queen smiles in a motherly way and kisses Fiona on the forehead goodnight, then walks out. Seleen then does something Fiona didn't see coming. She exposes one her breasts and starts pulling Fiona towards it fiona has no choice but to start nursing. Seleen says, \"This is what I've been feeding you for the last three days so don't worry about this being akward. I've been meaning to make my breast a little smaller so I can fit into my outfits easier. This will be your breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next few days so you'll get used to it. Come to think of it, this is what you'll be have this for the next few years after mom unbirth's and gives birth to you again. Once Fiona finishes she lays down on the bed and Seleen says, \"Goodnight little sister.\" \"Goodnight big sister,\" Fiona replies. They both smile at each other as siblings do, and Fiona soon falls asleep with Seleen sleeping next to her, on her own bed. </span></div></div>",

A sudden loud galloping sound could be heard coming from down the hall of the hospital, this had made Fiona look up to see a couple of centaurs gallop through the door and in their hands was a little unconscious boy wounded very badly. Since the boys head was looking down Fiona could only catch a glimpse of the boys face, at first she thought it was her brother, but she was just told he was dead so she had no idea what to think. \"Oh my, lay back and rest I need to attended to this poor boy.\" Saleen said as she trotted off to follow the other centaurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith in minutes Fiona had passed out from the pain she was feeling from her loss of her family especially her brother, but a part of her though she still had hope that someone was alive. While Fiona slept, in the other from beside Fiona's the centaurs are doing there best to help this poor boy who had been wounded badly after his village was raided. He had cuts all over his body, some burns and a broken leg. Saleen immediately took action and began cleaning the wounds wrapping them up to prevent infection and with the help of others she had fixed the broken leg putting it back together. As for the burns the put a special plant over where the burns are to help the healing process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that the boy seemed to be doing alright and was still breathing, so the other centaurs left while Saleen stayed behind to watch over the boy. After a while Saleen had left the room and had to attended to other wounded people and centaurs that came through the doors. As she was going about her duties for hours Fiona had finally awoken from sleep sitting up in her bed wiping the sleep from her eyes looking around the room she saw nobody in with her. Then looking to where the centaurs had brought the little boy she wanted to go see if he was alright and most of all she wanted to know who he was, so she slowly claimed out of her bed with wobbly legs. With a few wobbly steps later Fiona had began to regain her strength back and was able to walk, but with the help of using the wall for balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly walking along Fiona had reached the door where the boy had been brought to and walked in to see the boy just laying there all bandaged up from his wounds when suddenly he just woke up with a loud gasp, but the stared wincing in pain and laid back down on the bed. This had startled Fiona as she almost fell over, but caught herself. There was something about the boys face she recognized, so she got closer to the boy until she was at his bed side and stared at the boy who was moaning and groaning from the pain. Then their eyes locked and that is when Fiona recognized who the boy was, some part of her knew that someone from her was still alive and it was right because laying there right in front of her was her brother. A part of him must has recognized who the little girl was as they both began crying, Fiona wanted to hug her brother tightly, but she knew how much pain it would cause him instead she rested her hand on his and they locked fingers holding each other tightly. \"I...I kn..knew you....w.were still alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...me.....too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona and her brother stared into each other's teary eyes just glad they are together once again, but her brother soon passed out again, so Fiona decided to head back to her room and when she stepped out if the other room she seen Saleen walk out with a worried look on her face. Then she saw Fiona standing there with tears running down her cheeks and barely able to walk, \"oh my god, there you are. I told you not to move from your bed because you're still to weak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.....my brother....is in....there.\" Fiona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me help you.\" Saleen says picking Fiona up and carrying her back to her room and laying her in her bed covering her up, \"now don't you leave again, you made me almost have a heart attack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Is all Fiona says before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better keep an eye on these two.\" Saleen says walking out of the room to go look over Fiona's brother, who is sound asleep. Saleen finds herself just staring at the boy for a while knowing she could help the boy heal faster if turned into a centaur like her, but she would be in great trouble if she did. Thinking it over she decided to do it anyways and began galloping down the hall to a locked room where she opened it up and walked grabbing two potions one for female centaur and male centaur transformation. Quickly she ran out of the room locking the door behind her and made her way to Fiona and her brother, but as she got there she had forgotten which potion was which because they are very similar in color and are not labeled. \"We should really label these.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a guess at which is which she went into Fiona's room and woke her up and to,d her to drink all of the liquid, then she went into Fiona's brother's room and had gotten him to wake up and helped him drink the potion. After that Saleen went back to dispose of the bottles and since it will take a few days for any transformation to appear and hoped she had given the two the correct potion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later with Fiona and her brother still laid up in bed recovering from their injuries after their village was raid by centaurs, Fiona was awoken by a loud rip like sound that seemed close to her. She picked her head up of the pillow and saw two nubs under her dress that she is wearing, but not really sure if she's actually seeing them she rubs her eyes with her hands and looks again and sure enough there are two nubs underneath her dress just above her hips. As for the loud rip she doesn't know what it was until she feel something rubbing on her leg, this had made her get up out of bed and when she did she saw her panties fall to the floor around her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she noticed something else her small feet well....were no longer feet any more they were now the hooves of a horse with a bit of white fur above them around where her ankles were, \"oh my god! I'm turning into a centaur.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up her dress she sees two more hooves sticking out of her stomach area just above her hips and they keep growing and growing until they're about the same length as her legs which had changed dramatically in the back legs of a white horse. Next she felt something changing on her backside so Fiona turned her head around and saw her butt getting bigger and growing out from her back also a long white tail was growing just above her butt. Eventually the transformation became painful and sent Fiona down to her hooves, instead of kneeling down like she normally would she had her new front hooves placed on the floor along with her back ones. Fiona wanted to yell for Saleen, but she couldn't muster up enough strength to do it instead she used all her strength to stay up while her lower half transformed into a white horse body. Fiona kept feeling her spine getting longer as it grew further down into the body of the horse as its white fur covered it from her waist down to her hooves. Eventually the horse body grew it's muscles and its weight of horse that would proportionately fit Fiona's body, but her transformation didn't stop there. She thought it was done, but she felt something growing out between her back legs and being surprisingly flexible Fiona was able to bend all the way over with her hands able to touch the floor and too see just how far her body has transformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that position Fiona sees the long white furry legs of the horse, her long white horse tail and the big body of the horse she now has, but the thing between her back legs that is growing she can't recognize it. Until it has grown enough to where she thinks its a penis because she has actually seen one before. Only confirming her thought some more she sees two large black balls the size of baseballs drop out of her body along with 12 inch shaft looking thing, but then it began to grow out until Fiona could almost touch it with her hand. \"It is a penis.\" she said to herself, \"but why do I have one I'm a girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing curious she reaches with her hand and pokes the head of the huge penis and shutter at the feeling of it as she actually felt it, so she straightened back up and took in all the feelings of her new body. She swished her tail from side to side accidentally touching her big balls in the process making her cringe some more. Then she tried lifting up each of her legs making a clopping sound every time she put it back down. After that Fiona just stood there looking at her newly transformed self and couldn't believe that she is a centaur now. Now she knew she had to used walking again, but now on four legs instead of two, so slowly she moved one front legs then one of the back followed by the other front leg until she had moved forward a little. Then she did the same again until she had completed another step, \"wow this is much easier than I thought it was going to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fiona came to grips with her new body meanwhile in the room next to hers, her brother had begun his transformation and just like Fiona he was awoken by a loud ripping sound. He opens his eyes and picked his head up to see two little nubs under his shirt and lifted it up to see two hooves growing out of him just above his hips. As for the ripping sound he felt his pants that he was wearing feel looser now and wondered why so he sat up feeling now pain any more. \"Wow what ever that centaur gave me healed me fast, but what is going on with my body right now.\" He said looking at the hooves then at his ripped pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of his bed standing up he hear a loud clop like sound and looked down to see his feet had transformed into hooves, but soon were blocked by his pants and underwear falling down around his ankles. Slowly he managed to step out of them to see light brown fur growing up his legs and his penis and balls disappearing into his crotch. Then he felt something behind him and reached and felt a tail growing out above his butt that also felt like it was getting bigger. Soon enough his front legs were long enough to place on the floor while his back kept getting further and further away from his back until he had the large muscular light brown furry body of a horse below his waist. But the transformation didn't stop there he suddenly felt something growing all the way in the back below his tail. He felt like something was opening up almost, not really being able to tell what it is, he ignores it for now and feels the rest of his new body below him. Feeling his strong legs, his muscular body and his tail rubbing against something sensitive behind him, but ignored it again. Slowly he began to walk on his four legs just like Fiona did until he hit the hang of it and was walking around his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two sister and brother explored their new bodies from the waist down Saleen who had given them the potions a few days earlier had stopped by and saw Fiona first, but gasped loudly when she saw what happened, \"ohh noo....I gave you the wrong one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gave me the wrong what.\" Fiona said turning around making clopping sounds <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you the potion for a stallion body instead of a mare, how could I be so, so....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be hard on yourself Saleen, everyone makes mistakes sometime in their life and you said stallion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss...that's why you have a large horse penis between your back legs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what that is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and imagine your brother has gotten the potion meant for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh let's go check on him.\" Fiona said walking towards Saleen with no problem, \"wow walking fluidly so quickly I see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's surprisingly easier than two legs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Fiona and Saleen walk down the hall together until they reach her brothers room to see him standing up in the middle on his horse body below his waist, \"oh my god Fiona you're a centaur too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but there's been been an unfortunate mix up, Fiona here has gotten your potion and you got hers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the huge penis I have.\" Fiona says to her brother who look at it then back at Fiona who is smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait Fiona is now a stallion from the waits down and so does that mean I'm a mare from the waist down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately yes, you are female and Fiona is male.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to fix this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....</span></div></div>",

At least you helped my brother stay alive and me too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I messed up and it's all my fault. You have a penis and you are a girl, he is a boy with a vagina. It's just not right.\" Saleen says picking her head up out of her hands sniffling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Fiona's brother walked up to to Saleen and hugged her as well, \"don't be so hard on yourself, with your help I'm still alive and reunited with my sister, even though she now as a penis and I have a vagina. It doesn't matter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, life is what matters, not what gender you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Saleen.\" Fiona says as she stands back swishing her tail as she does, \"come one brother let her go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Saleen.\" He says as he steps back beside Fiona <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaleen wipes her eyes while swishing her tail, \"it's fine.

With that Fiona looked at her brother and hugged him tightly and he hugged her back the same, \"I'm so glad to see you again Fiona and be alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, but I can't believe that you have a vagina now like I used to have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not to forget you have a penis now like I used to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it so huge too. Look at it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona steps back and her brother looks down underneath Fiona's white furry body to see a huge long 20 inch horse cock fully erect underneath her, \"you sure do Fiona and look at what I got.\" He says turning around moving his tail out of the way causing Fiona to giggle a little, \"oh my god you really have a big vagina.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure feel likes it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"</span></div></div>",

While they walk Fiona watches her brother trot along swishing his tail side to side taking in glimpses of his vagina. As she did she felt her massive horse penis get harder which started to become a problem for her as it bounced around underneath her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona did her best to ignore while she followed her brother into a large room with more centaurs walking about. In the crowd they see Saleen attending to someone who is another little girl like Fiona except she doesn't have a penis, \"there she is Fiona.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce over to where Saleen is Fiona's brother asks, \"hi Saleen, can we talk in private.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She answers, \"Okay Jenny, that should be fine, go run along now.\" She says to the other little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaleen then leads Fiona and her brother over to an empty room, \"How are you two doing?\" She asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Her brother says, \"but we need to ask you something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we...I mean me is wondering where we'll stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I forgot about that.\" Saleen says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering because me and Fiona here are in an interesting situation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Saleen says again, \"but umm....you two can stay with me if you'd like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a husband or something?\" Fiona's brother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't have time for one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we didn't have to worry about anything.\" Fiona adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to, you two can go to my place and stay there until I get back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but we....\" Her brother was about say something, but was interuprted by Saleen saying, \"here's my key and a map to get where it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the key and map in hand Fiona and her brother head off to find this place while Saleen gets back to her work. Fiona this time trots beside her brother instead of walking behind him to prevent anything from happening. Slowly they walk around the building seeing all different centaurs of different ages and colors walking around and some getting attended to. Finally they come across an exit and step outside where they are greeted with an amazing sight to be hold. A beautiful town full of centaurs going about there business. Fiona and her brother just watch in amazement at the sight before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they manage to get back to what they're doing and look at the map to find Saleen's place, \"okay, it doesn't seem that far away Fiona. Just follow me closely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they head off in the direction of Saleen's place with them doing there best to not get distracted by things around them.</span></div></div>",

Feeling it bounce around beneath her as a result from seeing Nick's big horse vagina underneath his swishing tail as they trot along in search of Saleen's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to hold her feelings back, trying to look away from her brothers enticing vagina, but she keeps on looking back at it, \"ooowww.....\" she groans as the feels start to take over her actions and thoughts, thinking with her penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona trots up beside Nick looking flustered, \"what's wrong Fiona?\" He asks before noticing her huge erect penis underneath her, but before he asks about that he suddenly feels her grab his hand. Where she pulls him down a long darkened alley way, \"what are you doing?\" He asks her, but Fiona says nothing as she continues down the alley way until they round the corner where she says, \"I can't help it.\" Before pushing Nick up against the stone wall causing him to look back to see what Fiona is doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he sees is Fiona getting behind his big furry rump and in one fluid motion Fiona mounts him causing him to get worried about what's coming next. That's when he feels it, he feels Fiona's two foot long horse penis slide into his big horse vagina causing him to moan loud whether he wanted to or not. The same went for Fiona who had covered her mouth with her smalls hands as she moaned loud from feeling her aching penis slide into Nick until she couldn't go any further. With them breathing heavily from the initial penetration it took them a bit to say a word and when they did Fiona said, \"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Nick, he just said, \"it's okay.\" As he felt Fiona's big penis start to get pulled out only for it to slide back in making them both moan loud again. Covering her mouth again she shoved her penis all the way back in and pulled it almost all the way out feeling her entire body tingle from the pleasure. The same could be said for Nick as his entire body tingled all over from having his vagina penetrated by Fiona's penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Fiona started to get the hang of moving her back legs back and forth getting into a good rhythm of sliding her penis in and out. While Nick just clenched his fist as he laid against the wall as he took Fiona's penis deep inside his vagina feeling get stretched out. They continued having sex for the very first time, but being the other gender below their waist. Making them moan and groan loudly as their sex continued on in the darkened alley. Where they just couldn't help it, but continue on. Fiona moving her hug every penis in and out quickly while Nick felt slide in and out of him both breaking into a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after 5 or so minutes Nick started to feel an intense feeling way back where Fiona is sliding her penis in and that is his very first female orgasm building up. A very intense one at that as his entire body started to quiver until it happened, he started to experience his first female orgasm causing his entire body shake, his vagina to tighten around Fiona's penis and him to moan louder than he had before. As for Fiona she looked down at what was happening to her brother when she felt her penis get squeezed tightly which made her moan louder to the point that she started to feel something odd down between her legs like something was flowing out of her balls and into her shaft. The feeling only got better the more she went in and out and more intense until she too experienced her first male orgasm. Fiona covered her mouth with both hands as she felt the most intense pleasurable feeling she has ever felt in her life as what ever it was started to shot out of her penis deep into her bother. Spraying out of her like 7 or 8 times until the intense feeling began to stop and the same can be said for Nick as his organs started to subside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter basking in the most intense orgasms the two have ever felt, sweat dripping from their faces, their bodies still shaking and breathing heavily the two stayed in position. Until Fiona began to pull out and get back down on her four legs where she stumbled a bit before catching herself up against a wall where breathed heavily. As for Nick he just laid against the wall breathing heavily while he felt his vagina ache behind from the most pleasure experience ever. It wasn't until 10 or so minutes later that the two finally began to recover and were able to stand up straight without falling over, so Fiona walked up beside Nick and leaned against him, \"sorry.\" She tells him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" He answers as he puts an arm around her pulling her closer where they hug for a minute, \"it's okay.\" He repeats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't help my self.\" Fiona answers as she looks up at Nick, \"I know, but I'm here for you.\" He tells her, \"thanks\" she say back. Where the two hug each other again tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the two straighten themselves out, getting their belongings back in hand where they look at each other again. Little did they know, they had some unwanted guest that watched them have sex with each other in the dark alley way and they were....</span></div></div>",

Looking at each other and grinning devilishly the two say, \"you thinking what I'm thinking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\" They both answer and look back at Fiona and Nick just walking out from the alley way on their way to Saleen's house. As they disappear out of sight the two horny boys begin trotting their way towards them feeling their huge cock bounce around underneath them. Making them feel hornier and hornier by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they trot along the cobbled road towards Fiona and Nick the two begin to wonder who they'll take, \"hey Gavin, which one do you want?\" Evan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, man. I'm kind of confused.\" Gavin answer, \"yeah man, I'm confused too.\" Evan adds, \"I want the girl, but she has a cock as huge as ours.\" He finishes, \"I know right and I kind want the boy because he has a pussy, but he's a boy.\" Gavin tells Evan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they conversed about which one they want they notice Fiona and Nick trot by the end of the road between two buildings, so they quickly run down to the corner and peak around the corner watching the two walk along towards their destination, \"dude, I'm so confused right now.\" Evan says as he eyes Fiona's furry rump, \"me too man, that pussy looks so inviting, but it belongs to a boy.\" Gavin adds and just as he finished saying that a loud booming voice yelled from behind them, \"what are you two doing!\" Causing the two to jump and run away from the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back they see a big muscular shirtless bearded man with a black stallion lower half standing on the corner where they just were, \"holy crap, he scared the shit out us.\" Gavin says to Evan as they run along catching up to Fiona and Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing they noticed because they would have ran right into them, so they slowed down letting them get ahead a few feet before continuing on following them. As they walk behind eyeing what they want, the two horny boys begin to think that it might not be that bad, but then again the have the fear of being caught by their friends. However the urge to have sex is to much for the horny boys. Whispering in Evans ear, \"hey, let's rock, paper, scissors for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why?\" Evan whispers back, \"if I win I get my choice and if you win you get your choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\" Evan answers and holds out his fist along with Gavin and they play two games leaving them tied, so closing their eyes and playing the last game they open their eyes and see that Evan won, \"yes, I won!\" He shouts, \"I get the girl and you don't.\" He teases, \"fine, I'll take the boy.\" Gavin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two quickly get up closer to Fiona and Nick where they're coming up onto the last alley way before they exit the city and into the rural area. Quickly running around in front of them Gavin and Evan stand in front them making themselves look bigger, \"we seen what you two did.\" Evan says, \"yeah, now we some of that too.\" Gavin adds making Fiona and Nick just look up at them where Fiona speaks up, \"want what?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play with us, we seen you two have....\" Gavin looks around and then says, \"sex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we didn't.\" Fiona answers trying her best to lie to them, but she's not the best at it, \"yeah you did, don't lie to us.\" Evan tells her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay look, just tell us want you want so we can leave.\" Nick finally speaks up asking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at each other grinning, then at Fiona and Nick, \"we want to have sex with you two.\" Causing Fiona and Nick to look at each other and silently agree. Then look up at Gavin and Evan where they just nod at them, \"good, now go down that alley way.\" Evan points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that begin said Fiona and Nick walk down the alley way with Gavin and Evan following them feeling their cocks throb. After few feet and rounding the corner Nick gets into position up against the wall while spreading is back legs a bit and moving his tail out of the way showing the boys his pussy. As for Fiona she stands to the side and motions one of the boys to get up against the wall, crossing his arms across his chest Evan says, \"not me, you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fiona asks confused, \"just do it Fiona.\" Nick tells her, \"but, but....\" Fiona begins to say, \"just do what he tells you.\" Gavin tells her. A bit hesitant at first Fiona then gets into the same position as Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at the same time Evan and Gavin mount them. Gavin sliding his huge throbbing horse cock into Nick's big horse pussy. While Evan has some trouble at first sliding his huge horse cock into Fiona's big tight horse asshole, but slides it in making all four of them moan. Nick feels himself full of cock once again while Fiona is feeling a cock inside her for the first time while feeling pain and pleasure at the same time. Then Evan and Gavin begin thrusting their hips back and forth sliding their huge cocks in and out of Fiona and Nick respectively. Giving stretching out Nick's pussy while Evan stretches out Fiona's asshole feeling huge cocks slide in and out of them. Nick moaning and groaning away loudly from Evan fucking him hard. While Fiona is moaning and groaning just as loud from having her asshole stretched out by a huge cock while her own flops around underneath her throbbing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey four continue on having their weird sex together for what felt like a while to Fiona and Nick as they began sweating from being pounded so hard. The same can be said for Gavin and Evan as they begin sweating as they feel their orgasms building up quickly, but it seems Fiona and Nick are about to have theirs as they begin moaning louder and louder until they happen. First Nick feels his pussy tighten around Gavin's cock as he begins orgasm making Gavin moan louder from having his cock squeezed. Then Fiona begins to feel her orgasm happen as she feels her cock throb really hard as her asshole tightens around Evan's cock. While long streams of cum begin spraying out of her huge cock onto the wall and ground in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fiona and Nick orgasm, Gavin and Evan begin to have theirs as they feel their huge cocks throb hard and begin spraying huge loads of cum. Evan filling up Fiona's tight asshole with his cum while Gavin fills Nick's pussy up with his cum. To the point where it begins leaking out around their cocks onto the ground below. Then after a few minutes of catching their breath from their intense orgasms Evan and Gavin pull out feeling their cocks go limp as they stand behind Fiona and Nick.

Making them freeze in place, but they start quivering when they feel their very thick and long cocks penetrate their big assholes under their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Gavin and Evan begin to beg them to stop, but they just place their large hands on their shoulders as they continue to slide their thick cocks in their tight assholes. Stretching them out more and more until all 32 inches of both cocks are deep inside Gavin's and Evans's stallion bodies. With Gavin and Evan reeling from feeling so filled with cock they can't even begin to form words, but they two guys who mounted them say, \"you two have been caught doing an act that is not tolerated around here.\" One says in a deep booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An act that is punishable by the same fate as you did to the new guests.\" The other adds in a similar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Gavin and Evan can't say anything, so they just nod in agreement with the two guys and accept what their punishment is. With that agreed upon, the two guys pull out a collar from the belt that have around their waist of their shirtless upper bodies that have a chain attached to the collar. They quickly unhook it and put around Gavin's and Evan's necks, tightening them before attaching the other end of the chain with their belt that has enough slack for Gavin and Evan to walk beside them when they do leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now however, the two guys tighten their grip on their shoulders and at the same time begin pumping their huge cocks back and forth in Gavin and Evan. Making them quiver under the their hands and begin begging them to stop, but it soon turns to moaning as the guys keep going faster. Which causes Gavin's and Evan's cocks to become erect again and throbbing hard underneath them. Being experienced guys this sexual scene last much longer than what Gavin and Evan were able to muster up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys continue to have their way with them like they did with Fiona and Nick a 15 minutes ago, sliding in and out quickly. Making Gavin and Evan a moaning mess under their huge bodies as they just don't know what to with themselves, so they just put their arms around themselves as they just stand there continuing to be fucked senseless. Right until they feel their second orgasms building which makes their big bouncing cocks start to throb even harder to the point they just about start screaming in pleasure as cum starts spurting out once again, but right onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich caused their assholes to squeeze the guys cocks making them grunt from how good it feels, but even that doesn't make them orgasm. They keep on going after another 15 minutes has passed, more than double of what Gavin and Evan were able to do. However the guys don't last much longer as they feel their orgasms building up more and more to the point they just can't hold it in any longer. Where they slam their cocks in a few times before they unleash two of the biggest loads of cum ever as they feel their cocks throbbing so hard with cum following through the shaft from their massive balls into Gavin's and Evan's small bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling them up even more than they already are to the point where the guys cum starts leaking out around their cocks onto the ground below them, but the cum just keeps on flowing out of them until Gavin and Evan are hunched over from feeling so full. That's when the guys finally stop cuming and pull out causing their cum filled holes to leak, pouring loads of cum onto the ground. Splashing as it hits the ground behind them as they just continue to moan from the intense sex they just endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't even have time to recover from it either as the two guys pull on the chains to make Gavin and Evan walk beside them out of the alley way. Right into the crowded streets where the other people see this where know they have did something wrong giving Gavin and Evan a few dirty looks as they continue to walk along beside the guys. Some even see the gaping cum leaking holes under their tails which makes them gasp. Making Gavin and Evan feel humiliated to the point where they cover their faces as they are led in to the jail where they will be kept over night until they figure out what to do with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Gavin and Evan get out in the same cell which has nothing in it at all unlike the other ones, \"this here is the sex offender cell.\" One of the guys says as he unhooks the chain from his belt and removes the collar from Gavin's neck, \"this one has nothing in it like the others.\" The other adds and removes the collar from Evan's neck, \"so if you have to piss, you have to piss in one another.\" The other adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we catch one of you pissing in the floor, we'll come in there and piss in you ourselves.\" The guy adds before stepping out and locking the door where they go about their business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the cell Evan really has to pee, so unfortunately for Gavin it happens, \"hey Gavin.\" Evan says, \"yeah Evan.\" Gavin answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have to pee.\" Evan tells Gavin, \"Really Evan, right now.\" Gavin says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you know I have to pee every time after sex.\" Evan argues quietly with Gavin, \"I know, but why didn't you piss when we were outside.\" Gavin argues back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I don't one of them to pee in me.\" Evan basically begs, Gavin just face palms and shakes his head before reluctantly turning around, \"just get it over with.\" Gavin tells Evan who mounts Gavin and slides a few inches of his cock in and starts peeing. Making Gavin feel it fill him up while making him feel disgust that his best friend is doing this right now, but he understands why. After a minute or so Evan pulls out where some pee gets on the floor, but just a few drips, as for Gavin he feels it sloshing around in his ass and clenches his asshole so it doesn't leak out. After that Gavin walks over to a corner, kneels down and leans against the wall to just think, while Evan just doesn't know what to do now expect think of what just transpired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they spend a night in jail, Fiona and Nick have found Saleen's house and made it inside. With the help of each other they get themselves cleaned up after their sexual encounter in the alley way. Fiona help Nick wash the parts he can't reach and Nick helps Fiona wash the parts she can't reach until they are spotless. After that they help each other dry off and since their clothes are dirty they just go shirtless and follow each other down stairs. Where Nick and Fiona go into the kitchen to get something to eat and drink. Once their hunger is satisfied and their thirst is quenched, they head into the living room to watch TV as they cuddle up on the large sofa and wait for Saleen to come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue two watch the centaur channels giggling with one another for a few hours until they both begin yawning and soon enough both fall asleep on Saleen's sofa. It wasn't until an hour later when Saleen finally came home to find Nick and Fiona cuddled up on her sofa sleeping soundly. She finds them so cute together and is happy that she was able to bring them together after what had happened, so she leaves them be and quietly heads upstairs to her bedroom. Where she pulls off her work clothes to get in bed as she lays her big body down where she stretches for a much needed stretch. Not too longer after Saleen falls asleep on her bed dreaming of Fiona and Nick as if they are her children. Then back at the jail, Gavin and Evan to have fallen asleep in their cell beside each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they wake up, who do we focus on?</span></div></div>",

As she was knocked to the ground, she turned around in terror. She knew that her attacker must have been a centaur, and she had heard far too many rumors about what they did to humans to feel even remotely comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she turned around, she saw that the centaur who tackled her was only a child! The young horse-girl was smiling at Fiona as she stood above her. Suddenly the girl extended her arm toward Fiona. Fiona thought that the girl was going to punch her, and quickly flinched in anticipation. However, when she looked up, she saw that the girl was simply offering Fiona her hand to help her up! Fiona was baffled by this kindness, but she took the girl's hand and stood up. Now she was even more shocked; this centaur girl was almost the same size as her! Most centaurs she had seen were adults, and were a little less than twice her size. She had simply assumed that all centaurs were huge like that... Breaking the silence, the girl spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High there, human! I'm Amy, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* I'm Fiona... What are you going to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, don't worry Fiona. I won't hurt you, I just wanted to bring you back to our village with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were terrified. If the rumors you heard were true, then centaurs shrank the humans that they captured and ate them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me! I'm too young to die! I'll do anything, just let me live...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Amy's face turned into a confused frown. She didn't even know what Fiona was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I eat you, Fiona? And more importantly, HOW would I eat you? We're almost the same size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't centaurs take humans back to their village to shrink them and eat them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No! While it's true that we <i>can</i> use shrinking magic, we never use it on a human unless they want us to. Actually, I'm still too young to use magic in the first place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a feeling that she was telling the truth, and the innocent look on her face was reassuring... Still, you had your doubts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you do with the humans that you take with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you may not know this, but we centaurs are actually a rather small tribe. Sometimes we get a bit lonely, so we go and find some humans to bring home as friends. That's actually why I wanted you... Will you be my friend, Fiona? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were confused. Amy seemed to be telling the truth, but you still had no way of knowing for sure... She seemed to really want you as a friend, but you had a family in this village. Could you really bring yourself to trust this girl and go with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A lot of the humans we've taken to our village have made that same deal with us, and now they live peacefully alongside us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's reassuring... I just have one more question though. Why do the centaurs ransack our village?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I'm still too young to understand the full reasoning behind it... Something about a 'shortage of resources', or something like that... Anyway, the queen says that it's vital to do it if we're going to preserve the village... I don't see why we can't just ask the humans to share, but I'm not the queen, so I wouldn't have a say in the matter anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is this queen? Is she hooked on some violent traditions or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all! Actually, the queen is really rather gentle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why does she order you to attack our villages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I overheard someone say once that she had a bad experience with a group of humans in the past, and now she thinks that the only way to get anything from them is to take it by force... Either way, she still gave us specific orders to never kill any humans, so I think she still cares about them deep down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Sounds like your leader must have had a traumatic past...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... Well, are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if I go get some food and other stuff from my house first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just don't tell anyone where you're going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen's orders... Something about 'If a human that we're bringing back to the village tells anyone where their going, then they'll track us to our village and send an army to wipe us out'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay... In that case, I'll make this quick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona then walked to her house. She grabbed a backpack and filled it with the essentials for survival. She then returned to the location where Amy had been waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Amy, I'm ready now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Okay Fiona, hop on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona climbed onto Amy's back and wrapped her arms around Amy's human-half's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Fiona, hold on tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then started galloping off toward the forest. She was smiling to herself about having made her first human friend, and she was confident that she and Fiona would get along well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned away, hoping to avoid seeing the fate of her friends, family, and other villagers. She gasped at what she did see when she turned around. Approaching the village with calm, assured strides of her equestrian legs was another centaur. But this one was different, while the other centaurs\u2019 horse bodies were black or brown, hers was pure white; and she wore a revealing set of golden armor on her human half, where as the other centaurs wore simple cloth, leather armor, or nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona gazed up in fear as the white centaur passed, and saw the black eye patch over her left eye beneath her crown-like helm. Fiona knew immediately the white centaur was Lustreign, a centaur rumored to be a cruel powerful mage and bent on conquering all of Viralon. Lustreign didn\u2019t look down at Fiona as she passed the human girl; she merely kept walking until she encountered two other centaurs. \u201cTell the others to bring all the humans to the village square.\u201d She ordered. The two centaurs bowed their heads with delighted grins and galloped off to spread Lustreign\u2019s order. Only when she felt the sharp jab of a spear shaft on her back did Fiona dare to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Fiona chanced a glance around the square. As Lustreign ordered the centaurs gathered all the villagers in the square and forced them onto their knees, most of the centaurs surrounded the kneeling humans, but a few marched down the rows. \u201cEyes down until we say otherwise human.\u201d One of the centaurs said darkly before she forced Fiona\u2019s gaze to the ground before her. Fiona grimaced as a small wave of pain went down her neck from the centaur\u2019s force. Things seemed to keep getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Lustreign stood before the crowd. \u201cAs by right of our total superiority over you humans, I declare you and this village property of the Vabelan Clan centaurs!\u201d She proclaimed, sealing the fate of the villagers and confirming the rumors of conquest. Fiona heard the roaring cheers of the centaurs and felt, rather than heard, the pounding their hooves against the ground. Fiona saw Lustreign talking to a pair of centaurs near her, but she couldn\u2019t make out what was being said. Then without warning the two centaurs leaped out into the crowd, laughed at the humans that screamed and jumped out of the way and those not quite quick enough. Fiona saw one of them grab a girl she didn\u2019t know the name of and Lucy, the former mayor\u2019s daughter who acted as though she ran the village, before returning to Lustreign. The other centaur grabbed Alison, the girl who ran the small village market, and then grabbed Fiona herself before she too returned to Lustreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona heard Lucy demanding to be released as she and Alison were brought before Lustreign who looked at them for a moment before nodding her head and smiling, \u201cYes, these four will do. Take them back to my castle. I\u2019ll sort them out myself when I return.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away Milady.\u201d The two centaurs said before tying their two girls together, seating them on their horse backs, and then galloping away from the village.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucy however was not so timid, she kept demanding to be released, complained about how bumpy the trip was, and so forth until the centaur that held her to stop and stuff a fistful of leaves in Lucy\u2019s mouth to silence her. \u201cI hope whatever Lustreign does to this one keeps her quiet.\u201d The centaur grumbled as she and her companion resumed their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon had risen high above the trees when they arrived at their destination. Fiona marveled at the great stone fortress that loomed above them on a mountainside overlooking the almost as grand centaur city.<br>\r\nAfter entering the castle, the centaurs took the four girls to a dark room and tossed them in, not bothering to untie them or take the leaves out of Lucy\u2019s mouth, much to everyone else\u2019s relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think is going to happen to us?\u201d Alison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not think of that.\u201d Mira replied, trying to sound calm. Lucy tried to say something, but all that came through the leaves were muffled grunts and growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn\u2019t know how much time had passed when the door to the room opened and Lustreign entered. \u201cWelcome girls. I hope you\u2019re not too uncomfortable.\u201d She said with a tone of both mockery and sincerity. With a muttered spell from her lips the ropes binding the girls disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to us?\u201d Alison asked timidly, trying not sound demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLustreign did notice Alison\u2019s unfeigned fearfulness and smiled, enjoying the terror she inspired in the human. \u201cI suppose it would do no harm to me to tell you\u2026 I have some very special plans for one of you, plans which I\u2019ll be keeping to myself. As for the other three, you\u2019ll be my personal slaves, serving my every whim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a spitting sound before Lucy shouted, \u201cWhat? How dare you kidnap me then plan to make me your slave. I\u2019ll tell my father, then you\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d obviously she managed to get the leaves out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLustreign glared for a moment at Lucy. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll keep two of you as slaves, one for my original plan, and another for something else special. But to best decide which of you gets which fate, I\u2019ll need to see what you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lustreign had some centaurs chase them to test their endurance and speed, had them wrestle each other to gauge their strength, and then finally asked them a series of riddles to test their intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the purpose of all that?\u201d Lucy grumbled, why she complained was anyone\u2019s guess as she refused to comply with the tests. Fiona noticed that oddly enough Lustreign didn\u2019t seem at all angry or concerned by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the two best overall will be her slaves\u2026\u201d Mira suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then why ask us those riddles; you don\u2019t need to be that smart to be a slave.\u201d Alison pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was cut short when Lustreign, wearing a gold bracelet with two tiny chains dangling from it, and two centaurs, one carrying two gold collars each with a few links of full size chain the other two bundles of clothes, entered the room. After receiving a nod from Lustreign the centaur with the clothing bundles tossed one at Alison and the other at Mira. \u201cPut these on. The two of you are now Mistress Lustreign\u2019s slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they were reluctant to show their naked bodies, Alison and Mira soon stripped and put on the clothes. Fiona was almost jealous, the clothing they\u2019d been given was much better than the ones they took off. When they finished dressing, the other centaur stepped forward and put the gold collars around their necks. Once the collars were on Lustreign jerked her wristed towards the door, at that motion the two enslaved girl jerked forward as though they\u2019d been shoved. Fiona realized that some kind of magic must be connecting Lustreign\u2019s bracelet to the girls\u2019 collars. \u201cTake them to their new quarters.\u201d Lustreign ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the centaurs took Mira and Alison away, Fiona\u2019s attention was drawn to the small green bottles that seemed to have suddenly appeared in Lustreign\u2019s hand. \u201cNow then humans, I\u2019ve kept you here for two different reasons. One of you is incredibly fortunate, the other not so much. Each of you gets one of these, drink them.\u201d Lustreign ordered handing Fiona a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not drink that! You can\u2019t make me!\u201d Lucy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLustreign smiled before she approached Lucy, and then held the human girl\u2019s mouth open and poured in the liquid. As Lucy gagged, Lustreign turned to Fiona, who immediately gulped down the liquid. Within seconds the potion worked its magic and the two girls had been shrunk to no more than two inches tall. Lustreign quickly grabbed both of them. Without a word she tossed Lucy up into the air, and then caught the falling human in her mouth, swallowing not long after. \u201cNow it is time for you.\u201d Lustreign said before she left the room with Fiona in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several tense minutes Fiona thought that at any moment Lustreign would eat her just as she did Lucy. \u201cNow little human, you\u2019re not going to suffer the fate of you loud-mouthed fellow. I have a special plan for you. At the rate my warriors are going I will soon be queen of all Viralon. Though my race lives longer than yours, I will eventually grow old and die and a new ruler will take my place. That is what you shall be. I will turn you into a centaur, my own daughter to be precise, and one day you will be the queen.\u201d Lustreign said as she opened a door into an ornate room with tapestries and a large cushion, this was obviously Lustreign\u2019s room, and sitting in a corner were Mira and Alison. With a jerk of her wrist, Lustreign pulled Mira to her. She gave the shrunken Fiona to Mira and said, \u201cAs your first assignment as my slave, you will insert her into my womb.

But on the other hand Fiona was a fellow human, and Mira wasn\u2019t too keen on sticking her hand \u2013or anything else- into Lustreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira noticed that Lustreign was growing impatient, given the way one of her front hooves was tapping like a waiting person\u2019s foot would.

Lustreign's armies swept across the land, swallowing up slaves and towns with little resistance. All the humans could even hope to do was run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, they were stopped dead in thier tracks. The Human army had gathered together and began a fearsome counter-assault, adapting anti-calvary tactics to fight thier new enemy. The glorious centaur charges shattered on walls of pikes and shields, and the Humans fell upon them like a hammer. Swift manuvers halted thier advance, and the Lustreign called the other centaur clans to join her cause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazo Clan readily answered the call. They are masters of the bow and javalin, wielding weapons far to large for an human man to use, and at the same time are canny hunters and trackers. Despite thier height, Amazo centaurs hide quite well, and many prefer to hunt from ambush rather then run down thier prey. However, they do have a very powerful sense of honor, respect, and mercy that often clashes with Lustreign's less restrained ideals.<br>\r\nWith the Amazo Clan's aid, the Lustreign's forces were able to outmanunver and break the human's formations. once again they began to push them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the humans did something entirely unexpected. <br>\r\nThey created an alliance with the Minota Centaur Clan. Extremely powerful, incredibly tough, impossibly stubborn and in reality far more intelligent than most legends give credit, the combined tactics and tools of the the humans and the strength of the Minota had forced the entire war into a bloody, raging stalemate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Viralon Empire handn't found a way to preirce the increasingly powerful fortresses of the Grand Alliance, and the slowmoving armies of the Alliance couldn't face the Centaur on the open field. It was a mess and Lustmage would be diving right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLustmage would soon be inspecting her very own platoon of troops, and later that day attend her first war council with her mother.

She was competent enough with a bow and throwing spear, but favored close combat and heavier armor to take advantage of her training. The name Lustmage was a bitter irony and her mother had quickly dismissed her daughter as anything except a political annoyance and now as another inexperienced lieutenant. Thankfully, her teachers, often old veterans, helped her adapt to court life as best they could, and Lustmage had learned much about battlefield tactics from them. While she was relatively confined to the Viralon City, she learned much about life outside the castle. Whether Lustmage seeks to gain her mother\u2019s approval or holds other interests above that is yet to be seen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ranger</b>: While Lustmage had little taste for Magic, she quickly fell in love with the wilds. A master of the bow that rivaled many in the Amazo clan, she preferred leather armor for mobility, but would wear light chainmail if the situation called for it. Lustmage had spent much of her life learning to track and hunt in the wilds, and had learned much about herbs and medicine and even a little potion-brewing. She could handle a blade with moderate skill, but preferred to keep a distance from her prey to use her incredible bow skills. Lustmage chafed at the castle and court politics, as she was much more at ease among common people. However, she was forcibly taught the basics of leadership to succeed her mother.

She had all her mother\u2019s talent and preferences for magic: manipulating minds and emotions was easy with or without magic, and she had no qualms about using transformative magic like shrink spells to incapacitate at will. Like her mother, Lustmage dominated those around her, exploiting all weakness and flaunting her powers. <br>\r\nUnlike her mother, Lustmage was not cruel or heartless. Despite all her skills at manipulation, Lustmage remained a kind, loving person who tried to make the lives of everyone around her as pleasant as she could. Even when she was devouring people, she took steps to make the process as pleasurable as possible to her meal! Lustreign had despaired at getting her daughter to be a proper ruler in the castle, and was sending her into battle hoping that the bloodshed and death would make her a little more ruthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you couldn\u2019t conquer the world with kindness and love. You couldn\u2019t be such a manipulative and controlling person and still actually want others to have their own happiness. There was no way an enchantress could be understanding and compassionate, so all her powers had to be a fluke, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nCaster</b>: There was no denying that Lustmage held great magical power. The problem was, unlike her scheming and plotting mother, Lustmage tended to think in a simple and direct manner. And when a mage thinks in simple and direct manner, spells tends to result in explosions, though fire or property damage may not be involved. Offensive spells were the only magics that Lustmage was good at, and she excelled in powerful and controlled destruction. However, despite all her power and her mother\u2019s coaching, every other type of magic seemed to fail spectacularly in her hands. Because of this, Lustmage had a slightly meek personality, as she didn\u2019t like disappointing her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got really <i>weird</i> when Lustmage\u2019s spells backfired. Her transformation spells either created harmless bugs or terrifying monsters (Always the opposite of what she wanted,) her illusions were either pathetic or not illusions at all (Instead of making a door look like section of wall, the door actually became a brick wall,) and her attempts at summoning were either tiny fairies or things even her mother didn\u2019t dare invoke. <br>\r\nLustmage somehow managed to summon the <i>Colossal Succubus Queen of Lust</i> instead of a minor imp. Thankfully, the Queen was so amused by Lustmage\u2019s incredible blundering (and the tearful pleas of \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Mom!\u201d when confronted by one of the most powerful demons in existence) that she allowed the young centauress access to a portion of her own demonic power. It really just makes things worse for Lustmage, as instant orgies are the most understandable things the demonic energy turns her spells into (sometimes it\u2019s even more random, and not even the queen of lust can figure out why or how it happens). And while the Queen of Lust kept in touch with the young centauress, having an ancient Sex demon as a confidant and friend really didn\u2019t make her life any less embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lustmage wanted to do was impress her mother, but she feels rather like she\u2019s being treated as a living bomb and is about to be thrown at the enemy\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(If you don't know what a centaur is, may a rabid chipmunk bite you on the nose)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you add, which I hope you do, please follow these guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No toilet stuff! (I don't know why some people like it, and I don't want to know)<br>\r\n2.Sex allowed (Just don't go overboard on it)*<br>\r\n                *I'll allow guy on girl, and girl on girl stuff, but NO guy on guy.<br>\r\n3. Female nudity allowed<br>\r\n4. At least try to use proper spelling and grammar<br>\r\n5. Try for at least a paragraph (You can do one-liners for choice chapters but you should then do one of those choices)<br>\r\n6. Keep consistent!<br>\r\n7. swears and cusses are allowed <b><u>to a degree</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, go nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Disclaimer: I reserve the right to edit and/or delete chapters as I see fit*</td>",
