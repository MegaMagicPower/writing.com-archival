But, it is what it is. There's really not point in thinking too much about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be walking around naked.

Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nods. \"Thanks, Zach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" He is about to leave the room. \"By the way, dinner is almost ready.

Marty, a reserved, golf-loving kid with brown hair; and Chester, a mischievous blonde boy who became steadily more perverted as he entered high school. The trio did lots of things together, but their favorite was going on sleepovers. During these get-togethers, they would share secrets, eat junk food, and play games. As they got older, they gravitated more and more towards playing Truth or Dare, to the point where it was the only thing they played. Rebecca remembered one time where she was dared to put Marty's pet ferret, Max, into her pants. She accepted and was tickled by the ferret so much, she nearly peed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the present day, Rebecca's parents were out of town on vacation. Since she was home alone, she decided to invite her friends over to play Truth or Dare again. But there was one rule they all had previously agreed on: NO SEX. They all realized that their current dynamic worked best and opted to avoid trying anything that could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three were in the living room, Rebecca volunteered to go first. \"Alright, Rebecca\", Chester said. \"I dare you to...model the most embarrassing pair of underwear for us!\" Rebecca laughed. \"Challenge accepted! Wait right here while I change\", she said as she stood up and to her bedroom. A few minutes later, she called out, \"Okay! Are you guys ready?!\" \"Yeah\", the guys called back. As Rebecca said, she was wearing her most embarrassing pair: hot pink grannies with yellow stars and a matching bra. She strutted down the hallway in a manner befitting a supermodel. Every so often she would stop and pose in an exaggerated fashion to make sure the boys got a good look. Five minutes later, Rebecca wanted a new dare (but didn't bother to get dressed again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do next?</span></div></div>",

Amelia looked around as Carol putted around the kitchen, slipping on some oven mitts and pulling out a tray of cookies, wafting them with a paper plate to cool them.  Looking at the pictures on the wall, she saw the usual pictures, family, the kids, school, a thin man who was undoubtedly Carol's husband, but something looked off about him, specifically his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See something you like dear?\"  Carol asked as she walked over, \"Ah, I remember that, that was when we moved in, didn't know I was pregnant then yet.  Found out a week or so later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia pointed at the husbands chest, \"Is that a trick of the light?  Or it is something ... else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol laughed it off, \"That'd be his chest.  Poor James was always so awkward about it, but he credits the lifestyle with him accepting it.\"  She looked over at the clock, \"He's still out seeing some old friends who live across town, but he's a teacher too, history in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia's eyebrows went up, 'What're the odds my new neighbor was a coworker?' </span></div></div>",

Although I could use a good tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, after admiring herself for a few more seconds Emma grabs the waistband of her boxers, pushes them down her legs, over her bare feet, steps out of them altogether and tosses them into the hamper with her previously discarded shirt and pants which leaves her standing in the middle of her bedroom completely naked and barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she should go ahead and empty her hamper down the laundry chute Emma walks over to her hamper, picks it up, and carries it a few feet over to the laundry chute leading to the downstairs laundry room and empties the entire hamper down the chute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken care of that, Emma puts the hamper back in the nearby corner and heads into her bathroom to begin her relaxing and luxurious bath.</span></div></div>",

For confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, it\u2019s the same as an ENF story in which a girl loses her clothes in a public place. However, instead of being embarrassed, the girl decides to roll with it and \u201cown\u201d her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, how confident these girls actually are is up to you. Are they truly unashamed about being seen in the buff, or just faking it to save face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound like fun yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nI shan\u2019t allow underage sex, and I definitely shan\u2019t allow rape or non-con.<br>\r\nOther than that, just try to keep things on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 8/1/2020<br>\r\nThe fanfiction section is a mess of endless choice chapters with no actual content right now, so I\u2019m instating a new rule. Once you\u2019ve selected a character, there should be no more than three choices before arriving at a story.</td>",
