Surprise her with it.\" Her mom responds. \"I just wanted to tell you that. I'll call you every once in a while to ask about how you two are. Good night, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, mom.\" Amelia hangs up. She forgot to tell her about Bareside.

Although I could use a good tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, after admiring herself for a few more seconds Emma grabs the waistband of her boxers, pushes them down her legs, over her bare feet, steps out of them altogether and tosses them into the hamper with her previously discarded shirt and pants which leaves her standing in the middle of her bedroom completely naked and barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she should go ahead and empty her hamper down the laundry chute Emma walks over to her hamper, picks it up, and carries it a few feet over to the laundry chute leading to the downstairs laundry room and empties the entire hamper down the chute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken care of that, Emma puts the hamper back in the nearby corner and heads into her bathroom to begin her relaxing and luxurious bath.</span></div></div>",

However, instead of being embarrassed, the girl decides to roll with it and \u201cown\u201d her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, how confident these girls actually are is up to you. Are they truly unashamed about being seen in the buff, or just faking it to save face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound like fun yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nI shan\u2019t allow underage sex, and I definitely shan\u2019t allow rape or non-con.<br>\r\nOther than that, just try to keep things on topic.</td>",
