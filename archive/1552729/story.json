You reach over and slam you hand onto your alarm clock.  The damn thing finally shuts off.  Sleep still in your eyes, you look over at the clock.  Wait.... \"7:45??  Fuck!  I'm late!\"  You jump out of bed and quickly put on your clothes.  Not bothering to get breakfast, you rush out the door and into the car.<br>\r\nIt takes you about a half hour to reach your workplace.  \"Why are all the fuckin lights red when you're in a rush?\" you grumble as you sprint out of your car and into the building.<br>\r\nLet us take a moment to introduce you.  Your name is John.  You are 25 years old, and are working as an intern to the largest lab coorperation in the world: Cattech.  No one really knows why it's called Cattech, but that doesn't matter to you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John!\" shouts your irate boss.  \"You're over an hour late!  I should fire you!\"<br>\r\nYou clumsily put on your lab coat as he yells at you.  \"I know, Dr. Hellsir!  I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the third time you've been late in a month!  If your inexperienced ass manages to chalk up a fourth, you'll be out of a job!  Understand?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again!\"<br>\r\n\"Good!  Now hurry up.  I have you scheduled to examine a new experiment.  Go down to lab #365.  And be careful.  They're experimenting with using magic on wormholes.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?  Wasn't Rob supposed to be the one examining the experiment?\"<br>\r\n\"Rob came down with a highly contagious virus.  And as inexperianced as you are, all the other employees are already booked.  So hurry up!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  You finish putting on your lab coat and rush down to lab #365.<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, you're late!\" says one employee as you enter.<br>\r\n\"I know.  But I'm here now, so just... get on with the experiment\" you say.<br>\r\nYou are in the middle of a huge, almost empty laboratory.  There's about 15 scientist standing around the room, each one of them doing a different job.  In the middle of the room is a giant portal.  It looked kind of scary, but you couldn't afford to run away.  Your boss would have your head.  Beside the portal there is a tall, elderly man in a cloak.  He was holding a large book with some of his own scribbling in it.  But... they looked smudged!<br>\r\nThe wizard raised his hand to the portal and began muttering something under his breath.  A light shot out of his hand and into the portal.  The portal made a loud bang and expelled some sort of yellowish light!  You were knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, the portal was gone, and the scientist were all scattered, talking to each other in befuddlement.  The magician was in the corner, beside you, sadly looking at his notes.  \"Damn, I knew I should've worked on my handwriting.\"<br>\r\n\"What... what just happened?\" you quietly ask him, rubbing your head.<br>\r\n\"I messed up the spell.  I accidentally created a new force.  One that'll grant any wish to anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm calling it Lionscript.\"<br>\r\nYou think for a moment.  You have a lot of questions.<br>\r\n\"How does that even work?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... basically, you simply say something like 'Lionscript, make me a sandwich' or 'Lionscript, turn me blue' and it happens.\"  An sandwich appears in the wizard's hand and he also turns blue.<br>\r\nYou think for a moment again.  Then you say:</span></div></div>",

You smile wickedly at the magician. \"SWEET!\" <br>\r\n\"Not so much, you have to be very, VERY careful what you wish for. Anything will and can happen.\" What he was saying was going in one ear and out the other, you caught some of what he said but you were so fascinated by what you held in your hand. You stretched the bill in your hand, smelling it you smile again. It was real. It felt real, it smelled real. And you could go buy yourself a new pair of shoes. <br>\r\n\"John! John? Are you listening to me?\" <br>\r\n\"Heh? What did you say?\" You turn towards the magician again. He sighs and rolls his eyes <br>\r\n\"I said, I was serious. This could be a serious problem if you do not know how to control this. Lionscript is not something to play around with. It can work in and out of your head. If you are mad and you think 'i wish you would die' they WILL die. Maybe not that instant but it will happen very soon after because you have the gift.\" <br>\r\nThat shocked you back into reality as you listened thoughtfully. I could handle this.

You're starting to think your \"Mean People Really Get Right Up In There And Tongue My Rim\" bumper sticker is counterproductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name's Trish, you're 24, and you're a technical writer for the world's largest corporate lab: Cattech. No one you've ever talked to knows why it's called Cattech, but you finally figured out that you don't care as long as it pays the rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and let go of your road rage, since work will be annoying enough. Six months' documentation for a doomed content management system just went into the trash yesterday, and you're expecting a bloodbath as your team gets culled for the next project. They'll probably keep you, but you're not up for another death march like that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish!\" someone shouts, but you can't tell who it is. There are suits standing around, talking and yelling at everyone, including themselves, as maintenance guys rearrange partitions and cubicle refugees grab their indispensables, scuttling off the farm and into their new sections. This is exactly what you were hoping to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone calls your name again, and now you can tell it's Shigi. You were paired with her last year because no one else could stand her upbeat attitude, but you got used to her. Shigi's already got a cart loaded with your stuff and hers, and she's making a break for the elevator and gesturing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LONEsome Cowgirl!\" you hear, before getting your ass swatted. It's McCutchen, who's somebody's nephew, and there's no escape from him. They call him the Teflon Groper, because he grabs what he wants and dodges every charge of sexual harassment. \"Need you and Springfield down on the front line. 365. Just watch and get a feel for the process, and give me a treatment by tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the magic and wormholes thing?\" you ask him. \"Are we out of the EDI workgroup for good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cutch, uncharacteristically, waves you off and melts back into the chaos. You shrug and head for the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's a big step up for us!\" says Shigi, after you've found your new cubicle and told her where McCutchen has you both assigned. \"That's pure R&amp;D! Where did you let him grab you to get us in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both outside of lab #365. As you open the door, there's a loud bang and a bright flash of yellow light, and you're knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up with Shigi and a wizard in your lap. The wizard staggers upright and starts checking some notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what just happened?\" you ask him, helping Shigi up and looking around. A bunch of scientists are scattered around the lab, scrambling to make sense of the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I messed up the spell,\" says the wizard, more to himself than you. \"I accidentally created a new force. A wish-granting force. I might as well call it Lionscript, since I invented it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WTF?\" Shigi asks, too polite to cuss in anything but initials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You utter a command beginning with 'Lionscript,'\" says the wizard, distracted. \"Something along the lines of, 'Lionscript, fetch me a latte,' or, 'Lionscript, make this polite young lady's hair bright yellow.' To that effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Shigi's hair is now bright yellow and the wizard has a large cup of coffee in his hand... which he passes off to Shigi in consolation, though she has no idea about her hair yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape for a moment before thinking for a second only to open your mouth and say:</span></div></div>",

Thanks, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShigi shakes the wizard's hand, who blusters about these manifestations being trifles even as he blushes like a schoolboy under Shigi's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, it's become obvious to at least one of the scientists that something stranger than an explosion is going on in the lab. While the others hustle around, consulting their various devices and disciplines, one girl in a lab coat comes striding over with a tricorder and starts waving it near Shigi's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you and Shigi both tell her, Shigi more cheerfully than you. You figure this chick's one of those aloof, standoffish types, with her huge glasses and red hair compacted into a severe bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Employee #24752, S. Springfield, confirmed,\" says the redheaded scientist to her scanner, all business as she makes sure Shigi actually works for Cattech and isn't a yellow-haired corporate spy. \"Approximate time and cause of conversion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her natural hair color,\" you say, not caring for the scientist's attitude. \"Go study something interesting. Like how the hell you got YOUR hair screwed onto your head that tight. In fact, can I have a tricorder, too? Because now you've got me all curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Employee #24516, P. Cowgill,\" says the scientist, barely breaking from her routine. \"Confirmed, and noted for insubordinate behavior following a Class 9X event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you're employing far too blunt an instrument to detect the actual cause of Miss Springfield's yellow hair,\" begins the wizard, \"which is in fact the result of a direct request made of the force you're apparently unaware has just now been created, and which shall, with your indulgence, hereafter officially be referred to as 'Lionscript,' which name I've chosen because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?!\" you say to the scientist. \"Well, what's your employee number, anyway? Lionscript, make her tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Employee #11090, N. Rossetti,\" says the scientist, looking very surprised that she's complying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right!\" you say, rattled by the low number. \"Like you've been working here since you were 14! You look like you just got out of high school, kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lionscript, let's all be friends, OK?\" Shigi asks, seeing you're getting wound up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat suddenly seems like a great idea to you, and you shake the scientist's hand. \"I'm Trish, just got assigned in here half an hour ago. Those are some sharp-looking flats you've got on. I never would have thought you scientific types would have an eye for fashion, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicci,\" says the scientist, smiling and shaking your hand right back. \"I don't ordinarily make any concessions to style, but when I saw these on sale, I just had to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm known simply as A.C. Wirtz,\" says the old wizard, shaking hands chummily with Shigi. \"The 'A' is for 'Aldo,' though I'll refrain from revealing what the 'C' stands for, given that knowing a wizard's full name gives you power over him, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you're really enjoying talking to Nicci, you're able to intellectualize your way around the good, friendly feeling you're bursting with to see that things could get out of hand in a hurry. One thoughtless request made of Lionscript, and who knows what could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the secret's only known by four people right now, you think it might be best if:</span></div></div>",

She blushes, teasing her hair free of its bun and shaking it loose around her head... as she begins growing toward the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have known something like <i>this</i> would happen,\" Aldo groans, pinching the bridge of his nose in dismay. \"Youth and its follies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad!\" says Shigi, clapping as she cheers the redheaded scientist on. \"Live your dreams, Nicci! Don't let anyone shame you out of having a good time! Ever! It's <b>your</b> life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guffaw, though whether it's over Shigi's heartfelt feelgood pabulum or a scientist who wants to be a giantess, you can't say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys!\" says Nicci, now 12 feet tall and rising. She waves to you like an excited schoolgirl. You guess she wasn't such a stiff after all! You're also glad to see her clothes are growing with her. Regardless of whether you're Lionscripted friends with her now or not, you don't want to see ALL of Nicci.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope her favorite daydream doesn't involve squishing all of us like bugs,\" you say. You're a little tripped out, because none of the other scientists are behaving as if this is unusual at all. Stranger still, the lab is shifting to accommodate the increasingly gigantic Nicci: a platform appears under those stylish, sensible flats of hers and begins dropping to lower floors, and the ceiling spins open to provide her standing room as the higher levels shape themselves around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" you say, a minute or so later. Nicci's around seven stories tall, Cattech's main building having grown along with her. There's plenty of light, as she's set herself up as a display piece of some sort. No, a specimen: the unconcerned scientists in Lab #365 (along with the rest in the building) are rushing around and diligently restraining Nicci with straps and coils and filaments and you-name-it. Nicci's resting against a formfitting support brace and allowing her Lilliputian peers to bind her fast. Not only has she not stopped blushing, she's started to gasp a little as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done, I suppose,\" says Aldo. \"And, Ms. Cowgill, you're quite prescient in pointing out that we could have 'a real problem on our hands.' Ms. Rossetti's effectively opted out with this innocuous fancy of hers, which leaves the three of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldo looks thoughtful for a moment before saying, \"Lionscript, I issue a retrogression clause appending to all further invocations of your power stipulating that any entity committing an alteration or alterations via said power be subject to an irrevocable retraction of said alteration or alterations after a period of not more than one sidereal day, as deemed terrestrially, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm glad Aldo's a thoughtful and benevolent man!\" Shigi says to you, quietly so as not to distract him. \"Do you have to be a lawyer before you become a wizard, I wonder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it helps,\" you respond cynically. \"As with so much else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Further, Lionscript,\" Aldo continues, your aside with Shigi unnoticed, \"any commanding entity shall enjoy an event duration which is inversely proportional to their moral character, without violation of the aforementioned constraint, weighted against consensual standards of virtue which include...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shigi walk away, closer to one of Nicci's nyloned knees. She's trembling (in a good, <i>good</i> way) now that she's safely restrained and being investigated by Cattech's geeks. There's a platoon of guys with questionable instruments figuring out how to get better access to the giantess, arguing the best spot to \"breach the sartorial layer,\" as you overhear one of them saying. You guess if they just strip her down with any chemical or physical gadgets (many of which you know damned well Cattech manufactures) that it would violate the 'tasteful' portion of Nicci's wish. As if a gigantic scientist groaning with incipient orgasm is tasteful! You suppose it could be, on her terms, though you're not sure what'll happen once Aldo's done with his sprawling charter of Lionscript provisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, part of you thinks it's a little cute, and listening to Nicci sigh as her heat builds turns your own mind in that direction. You could wish for any number of uplifting things, but you muster a blush of your own and whimsically decide to:</span></div></div>",

What happens next is up to you!<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n-No scatological stuff<br>\r\n-Nothing involving underage characters<br>\r\n-No vore or or extreme gore<br>\r\n-No vomit or anything like that (I doubt that'll be a problem, but I wanna be safe)<br>\r\n-If you want to use the idea of Lionscript, you can as long as you credit me and let me know you're using it so I can check it out.<br>\r\nOther than that, everything else is fair game.  Because if I forgot to mention something that I hate, that'll just teach me to remember it next timeXP</td>",
