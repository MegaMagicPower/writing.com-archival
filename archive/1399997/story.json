You stand up to give her a hug and she rises to meet you.  Only, instead of hugging you, she knees you right in the bread basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're curled up in a fetal position on the floor, she storms out, then thinks twice and comes back, ripping your precious XBOX 360 out of the entertainment center and hurling it out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't ever want to see you again,\" she snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe storms out of the apartment, slamming the door behind her and leaving you on the ground, cradling your injury.</span></div></div>",
