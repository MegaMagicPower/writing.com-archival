While you are over 8' tall, your tail  has reached 19' long.  You have already been called long tail but this is just rediculous. You trained yourself to be able to stand on your tail so you could not be intimidated by larger people, but if your did that trick you would be intimidating to all of the people of the world. The up side to having such a long tail is the fact that your powers can be focused through it, Your powers have grown too. You have the ability to use a shield made out of the shadows and your manipulation has gotten to the point where you can lift people up with it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of the girls in your class try to get your attention, but they just manage to get you even more shy.

The path you choose will bring you closer to the truth but i warn you you will have to have at least evidence of a concience to get to the end of the story without dying.<br>\r\nPlease let me decide when to finish the story (If I decide) so please do not write dead ends. you can have end situations such as being eternally lost ect but at least have a nother option that can continue. no swearing unless you censor yourself but crap and variations of frick can be had if you don't over do it. No blood and guts gore. Keep it PG 13 people.<br>\r\n feel free to go out and have fun but be warned, your destiny can go 2 ways. chose wisely and you will live. fail to do so and your existence may never be recognized. Go out and find your path. <br>\r\nall right since no one wants to add i will state the reason for the title. Tales of loss is called that because each character gains great power at great costs. I will edit or ask people to edit chapters if the loss is not proportional.</td>",
