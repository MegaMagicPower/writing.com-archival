Crashing noises and the sound of wood and stone breaking were heard as a tan male clad in luchador makeup rolls into the streets, he looks to where he was flung from before running off. Laughing maniacally laughing, he runs off, yelling, \"You're gonna have to do more than that to catch me, bro!!\"<br>\r\nAt his tail were two well-known heroes. One was revonnahgander referred to as Rook Blonko. The other was Ben Tennyson.<br>\r\nBen was currently in one of his alien forms, one he called Crashhopper. Rook was not that far behind him trying to aim is Proto tool, now in Blaster mode, directly at Fistrick.<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" Ben said, \"Doesn't this guy ever quit!?\"<br>\r\nThe man, known as Fistrick, turns for a moment to shoot the two in order to distract them.<br>\r\n\"I'll Show you quit bro!\" he calls out to them. He then takes another split-second to take out a smoke grenade and toss it at his feet. He then ran away to say, \"You guys can't keep me from this deal, bro's, this is my biggest break yet!\"<br>\r\nHowever Ben used Crashhopper's incredible leaping strength to jump high above the smoke and aimed directly at Fistrick. The criminal turned as he heard the jump. Aiming his laser, he took a few shots before one actually hit him where the watch faceplate was. Fistrick smiled for a moment admiring the shot, \"HAAA! looks like the bro\u2019s taking a fall!\"<br>\r\nBen fell to the ground the, Omnitrix Central on Crashhoppers chest cracked and sparking. As Rook left the smokescreen he saw this and ran to Ben. Rushing to his partner, Rook said, \"Ben! Beeeen! Are you unharmed?\" Once he was standing over Ben he says that the Omnitrix symbol was cracked.<br>\r\nSuddenly, in a flash green light, Ben had returned to his normal human form. He looked beat, but okay, \"I'm fine,\" he stood up slowly and looked around, \"Where's Fistrick.\"<br>\r\nRook looked to the crowd, Fistrick had seemed to have gotten away long since gone from the scene. Rook shook his head, saying, \"He seems to have gotten away unfortunately. But, we will find him and capture him. ...We should probably do something about that though.\" He was pointing to the Omnitrix it crackled a bit on his arm.<br>\r\n\"Ah geez,\" Ben said, tapping his watch slightly, when all of a sudden, if stopped crackling.  \"Okay, that was weird...\" Ben said.<br>\r\nRook had a puzzled look on his face as he saw it stop crackling. \"Does the watch normally do that?\"<br>\r\n\"No... it doesn't.\" Ben said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most likely he has gone into hiding to let his trail go cold.\" Rook then sighed taking a sip from his own smoothie.<br>\r\n\"Great.. \" Ben said, \"Now how are we supposed to find-\" Suddenly Ben felt odd...<br>\r\nRook looked at Ben as the pause in his sentence was somewhat alraming, \"Why did you pause Ben?\" Rook asked, \"Is this one of your so called Jokes?\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's just...\" Ben said, \"I feel really weird...\"<br>\r\nRook turned to look at Ben and he didnt look very different. He thoought that maybe Ben's shirt looked a bit tighter than usual but he chalked that up to him changing up his style. He asked, \"Well, maybe we need to get you checked out? Is it possible you ordered a bad Smoothie?\"<br>\r\nBen then took another lights up from his smoothie then said, \"It doesn't seem off to me.\" Ben smiled, but then that smile was gone as he then wiped his forehead with his arm. Rook took notice of this, Hmm maybe you are hot? you seem very frantic.\" He gave Ben another look over his seemingly slightly more well built than his usual self.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do feel a bit warm,\" Ben said to him.<br>\r\nAs Rook continued to examine Ben, he asked, \"Hey have you been, how do you say 'hitting the gym'?\" punching  the air between them as he tried to get his point across.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no not really?\" Ben asked, confused, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, from my talks with Kevin, You seem a bit more, um, Swole?, I have only heard Kevin use that term when working out but I have been noticing it a bit on you,\" Rook gestured to all of Ben's body, though mainly his arms.<br>\r\nBen looked down to hos body and was shocked at what he saw, \"Whoa!! What the- !?\"<br>\r\nRook raiseds an eyebrow as his companions reaction was a cause for slight alarm, \"So you havent been 'Hitting the gym'?\" Rook asked, concerned, once more gesturing to Ben's body as the clothes seem tighter than before. A small bit of his middle section showing from the bottom of his shirt, \"You do seem quite well built for someone who hasn't been doing so.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know where all of this extra muscle came from!\" Ben said, still shocked at what's going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rook seemed a bit worried now as Ben's body seemed to be growing, the shirts tightness increasing ever more as the cuffs on his sleeves have a small rip at the edges and his chest is a bit bigger than before. \"Ben,\" Rook said, \"Is it possible you are somehow... growing? How could this happen?<br>\r\nRook got up from his seat and closer grabed Ben's smoothie, \"Could this be the culprit?\"<br>\r\nBen looked concerned at what was happening, by was slightly deadpan for a second, \"I'm not sure a smoothie could do this to me Rook.\"<br>\r\nRook looked away from the smoothie cup and saw that Ben's body was actually a bigger than before! His sleeves ripped down the side reaching the shoulder, his chest had pushed out enough causing a tear near his now bigger pecs. His pants rode up a bit too and Rook took a few steps back. \"Maybe...\" Rook said, \"I should call someone to figure out what\u2019s happening cause you really seem to be Growing\"<br>\r\n\"You're... you're right Rook...\" Ben said, flexing a bicep for a second. It was much bigger now, \"I'm getting more buff by the second.\" The small tears around the shirt grew larger, showing his slow growth, bare patches of shirt revealing how well cut he has grown by now. Rook decided he should do something by reaching over to Ben to help him stand up from his chair, which his but was now stuck in (Ben blushed at this self-realization). However, Ben seemed to not be phased by rook's attempt to pull him upwards. <br>\r\n\"Well seems your stronger too,\" Rook said. <br>\r\n\"Heh-heh. I guess I am,\" Ben said, \"He then grabbed the side of his seat and pulled himself upwards. He was easily separated from his chair and standing up now.<br>\r\nRook was now looking UP to be eye to eye with Ben now. He then saw him, his full body, his shirt near tatters over his body as well as his pants looking more like tattered shorts. \"Whoa,\" Rook went, \"Okaaay... let's go before you grow too big to be a little modest.\"<br>\r\n\"Um yeah I should-\" As Ben was about to reach the top of his hand he saw that his Omnitrix was a bit off. The parts that were green were now, instead, a multitude of colors, even white. The black faceplate itself was now a shade of cyan. (somewhere between blue and green) \"I think I found the problem, Rook,\" Ben said.<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Rook leaned over noticing that he was messing with the watch, and the lights beaming off of it were different than usual, \"The Omnitrix? ... Now that you mention it, Fistrick did shoot it but why is it causing you to grow?\"<br>\r\nHe gestured to Ben upon saying that last word as he continued to grow a bit buffer and buffer. His shirt was now in tatters on the floor and his pants were now even tighter, taut across his waistline region, showing off his thick legs and calves. \"You got me there,\" Ben said, now smiling a weakly. <br>\r\nAs Ben keeps growing still, Rook leads him to a nearby alleyway, \"Here,\" he said, \"We should get you out of sight before you scare the locals.\" The two try to slink in being a bit successful after a momentary struggle, as Ben's increasing size became problematic. \"So, Think you can turn it off, Ben? Or maybe you know to fix it?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Ben said, \"I don't know how to watch could be doing this to me, even as a malfunction.\"<br>\r\nRook pondered solemnly. The space in the alleyway getting a bit thinner due to Ben's growing size. Now in thought, Ben leaned against one of the walls behind him and in a few seconds, he actually crashed through it into a nearby warehouse. Luckily the place was empty save for a few freight crates. Rook immediately rushed to him, saying, \"Ben are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ben said, \"I'm fine.\" The still growing Ben stood up.<br>\r\nRook now looked up at the growing Ben, his pec's a giant shelf of muscle. The sound of ripping was heard between the two as the last of Bens pants got ripped from the fall, leaving him in ultra-tight boxers.<br>\r\n\"Well at least we can hide in here,\" Rook told his giant friend, \"Although, I don't think the owner is gonna be too happy about the property damage\"<br>\r\nRook walked by Ben, trying to think up a solution to this problem. He turned, still able to see Ben grow, fiddling with his watch as the lights changed frantically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The revonnahgander then begin to fit with the device. However after a few seconds a small beam shot out and hit Rook, zapping him slightly. \"Ow!\" He yelled, the beam didn't knock him back, but it did sting greatly even if for just a single split second. <br>\r\n\"Rook!\" Ben said shocked, \"Are you okay?<br>\r\n-Soon a strange sensation begins to fill Rook's being,  feeling a bit woozy and wobbly before that subsided, \"Uh... I do not feel so hot...\" He then looked at Ben, the said, \"I'm fine. That was just that was a powerful shock...\" He faced Ben who grew had grown bit more, Rook was now only at the top of his abs now in terms of height, the two stared for a moment before walking deeper into the warehouse.<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, they were at the corner of the warehouse. \"Okay,\" Ben said, \"we need to stop this before-\" Ben stopped music sentence as he looked at the watch. The glowing, multicolored parts were once again green. Even though the normally black faceplate was still cyan he checked himself still. \"Hey! I think I've stopped growing!\"<br>\r\nRook smiled, \"Oh that's a relief... although are you stuck like that?\" He pointed to Ben's entire body as if gesturing towards his frame.<br>\r\nBen thought of it for a moment, then said, \"I'm not sure, I guess I am...\" Ben was now bigger, around 10 feet or so, as Rook was now looking directly at the middle of his abs, which were now an incredible ten-pack!<br>\r\nRook looked at his communicator then back to Ben, his body massive and rippling with a multitude of muscles. \"Hmm I guess you way beyond what Kevin would define as swole,\" Rook touched Ben's arm inspecting its rippling features and his physique.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha,\" Ben went, \"I guess so!\" Ben then flexed his arms in a double bicep pose.<br>\r\nRook took a moment to pout about what he saw, \"Ben you are not... enjoying this are you?\" he asked as he watched Ben flex his newly gained muscles.<br>\r\n\"A little bit,\" Ben said, now bouncing his pecs.<br>\r\nRook flexed with Ben for a moment before the sound of a car pull up followed by a few footsteps. A few men in hazmat suits entered the warehouse to see the two muscle behemoths standing before them. Rook awkwardly waved at them, \"Hello gentlemen.\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually, a doctor said, \"Okay, you too can stand up now.\"<br>\r\n Rook then stood up from the machine towering over the doctor \"Sooo any news doctor?\" he asked, trying to move as little as possible.<br>\r\n\"Hm, I'm not sure,\"  the doctor said, looking at the results on his clipboard, \"It seems like your DNA was altered somehow, strengthened in fact.\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ben said, flexing his arms forward, \"You're right about the 'strengthened' part!<br>\r\nRook smirked at Ben flexing, \"Is this reversible doctor? As well as any future detriment?\" he asked the doctor gently reaching at him.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" the Doctor told him, \"I've never seen such complex DNA modification before...\"<br>\r\nRook took a moment to ponder the situation then told the doctor, \"So what should we do? This is unnatural, so should we worry?\"<br>\r\n\"Worry?\" Ben asked, \"I feel great.\"<br>\r\n\"I may have to agree with Tennyson,\" The doctor replied, \"As far as I'm aware, you are both very healthy young men, according to these reports.\"<br>\r\nRook smiles letting out a sigh of relief, \"Well at least that is good news,\" he said, \"What should we do now?

Rook entered the bar having to hunch over and slide through the door, still clad in nothing more than tight part of underwear as he took a look around the bar and saw Fistrick. Rook whispered into a new communicator he got for himself, then slowly walked up behind Fistrick casting a shadow over him and the patron he was talking to, his new muscles in full display. \"Fistrick, You should surrender now before he gets here,\" Rook said.<br>\r\nSuddenly another, large figure hunched over the doors enters the bar. This was the now giant Ben Tennyson, \"Too late for that.\" Ben was also still wearing nothing more than a tight pair of underwear. Fistrick became aggrivated, but then immideately shoeckd. Rook gabbed his shoulder and lifted him up easily to look him in the eye. Rook said, \"Fistrick, you are officially underarrest for the selling of illegal alien technology,\" Rook had a cocky smile on his face, \"Come quietly and we dont have to use these.\" He flexed his free arm to emphasize his muscles.<br>\r\n\"Your choice dude,\" Ben said, arms at his sides and bouncing his pecs, \"Your choice...\"<br>\r\nFistrick grunted throwing a punch at Rooks arm, the blow not only unfazed Rook but he ended up hurting his fist upon impact howling in pain. Rook frowned for a moment, \"Wow that really did you no good. This is, how you earthlings say 'Shooting your feet'?\"<br>\r\n\"I think you mean 'shooting yourself in the foot,' Rook,\" Ben said, readying his fist... BAM! Fistrick was out cold.<br>\r\nRook then threw Fistrick's unconcious body over his shoulder and turned to Ben. \"Huh, and I wanted to get a good hit in as well too,\" he said, sounding slightly disappointed as he began to turn to leave the bar, \"No worries citizens of Underwood, you may return to your meals and drinks.\" Rook then ducked to fit through the door again and leave.

He turned to Ben and asked, eyebrow raised, \"So, what are you planning Ben?\"<br>\r\n\"I concur, Ben, why would you suddenly invite Kevin to hang with us? Not that I mind of course,\" Rook chimed in, just as curious.</span></div></div>",

You really need to be more observant, Ben.\"<br>\r\nEventually, the two landed on the planet. It was sunset, the sky was similar to that on Earth, only the grass was a mixture of purple, violet, and indigo in color. \"Where...is everyone?\" Rook asked Ben looking around. \"It seems very strange that no one is around and yet we got called here.\"<br>\r\n\"Where is everyone?\" Rook asked Ben. Ben was slightly suspicious, considering that the info on the most recent theft was handed to them via an anonymous tip. Suddenly the two noticed a suspicious looking hover car, speeding into the distance. <br>\r\nBen looked at Rook and said, \"What do you want to bet that car leads to the guys were looking for?\"<br>\r\n\"I would say there is a pretty good chance it is as well as the possibility of being a trap. Either way, I know you are going to check it out so let us do this Ben. Someone has to save you after all,\" he grinned teasing.<br>\r\nBen smiled back, with that, the two partners began tailing the truck. Eventually, the truck led to an old Warehouse building. \"Okay, we have to be careful,\" Rook said. \"No running recklessly into danger like last time. Just nice and slowly...\" he crept forward alert for any traps.<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Ben said to his friend and partner. He reached for the Omnitrix on his arm and selected an alien. A few seconds later, he was transformed into an alien form seemingly best suited for the job: Big Chill. He smirked at the successful transformation (he has worse luck) and fluttered behind Rook heading inside.<br>\r\nThe duo went down a few narrow corridors with, Rook waiting occasionally as Ben scouted ahead with his powers until eventually, the two made it into a large open area. There was a small group of men, gathered around a small table, more like a desk. One of them places a huge suitcase on it. Ben and Rook looked to one another as they saw one of the guys open the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt contained...</span></div></div>",

The guys around the tables spoke in an alien language and then another. Another one took out the containers and placed them on the table. After a few rounds of unknown dialogue, they all laughed. \"Definitely not good.\"<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there,\u201d Ben said rushing in. \u201cYour deal is off and you can come quietly.\u201d He looked fiercely at them and blew a ballast of cold air freezing their hands from moving. One of them, however, was still holding a canister. That man pressed the button on the very top, and suddenly, the odd liquid became gas which quickly spread around the room.<br>\r\nBen shook his head. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d he said jumping into the air and fluttering his wings trying to redirect the flow. He then taking took a breath, he blasted his ice breath and froze the gas into solid blocks, \u201cThat puts your plan on ice!\u201d<br>\r\nRook, however, was not so lucky, as he was apprehending another one of the thugs, also holding a briefcase. \"Freeze,\" Rook yelled, converting his Proto-Tool into a blaster. The thug slid over to him and activated a second canister, his one he placed directly in front of Rook. Instinctively, Rook caught it but ended up getting a large puff of the mist sprayed at his face.<br>\r\n\u201cRook are you alright?!\u201d Called Ben hearing the hiss of a canister. He turned around blew a blast of icy wind breath catching that thug and hurriedly flew over to Rook. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d He asked worked.<br>\r\nRook coughed for a bit, before it stopped, \"I... I don't know. I'm fine now.\" He then looked behind Ben and suddenly said, \"Ben, look!\" He pointed at the direction to reveal that one last thug was holding a second briefcase, and he was running away.<br>\r\nBen nodded and swooped after him. He whooshed catching the guy and grabbed the case. \u201cWho paid you?\u201d He asked sounding menacing. The guy looked intimidated, but he then shook his head in fear.<br>\r\nBen stares at him menacingly before the watch beeped and he turned back into human Ben. \u201cAh dang it!\" He said, \"At least we caught them. Anyways, what's in those canisters and what's this all about?\"<br>\r\nBack at the ship, the guy was being held inside while Rook and Ben were checking on something outside. Suddenly Rook felt strange and queasy. He hiccuped and almost felt like he had to throw up. \u201cI...I feel weird and don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy simply shook his head again saying, \"I have the right to remain silent!\"<br>\r\nRook leaned forward. \u201cNot here you don\u2019t. You are going to tell us who called us here, who is paying you, and what the purpose of these containers is.\u201d He said commandingly<br>\r\nThe guy simply looked down, \"You'll find out in a few minutes anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ben asked aggressively.<br>\r\nThe man, however, silent once more.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d Rook said shaking the guy but he just smirked and said nothing. It worried them what this was.<br>\r\n\"Forget it, Rook,\" Ben said, beat, \"This guy's not gonna talk, let's just bring him in.\"<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rook said bringing the guy and the other thugs back to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the ship, the guy was being held inside while Rook and Ben were checking on something outside. Suddenly Rook felt strange and queasy. He hiccuped and almost felt like he had to throw up. \u201cI...I feel weird and don\u2019t feel so good,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
