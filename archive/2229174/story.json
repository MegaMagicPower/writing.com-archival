Please use comprehensible spelling and grammar to the best of your abilities. I don't want chapters full of nonsensical gibberish that no one can understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) don\u2019t make characters OoC without a reason for them to be OoC<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) I will not give any points for choice chapters, and if you add a choice chapter and it has not resulted in a story (other choices don\u2019t count) after 1 week it will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) please give a brief summery about anything (if there is) that's different from canon before you do your what if<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8) please have fun :)          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
