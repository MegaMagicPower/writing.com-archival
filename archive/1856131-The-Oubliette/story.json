The room she was in was almost pitch black, several dark grey shapes the only indication that there was a tiny bit of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where am I?</i> her mind began to whirl. The night before she'd enjoyed a night out with her friends on holiday. She had a good time but didn't expect to wake up alone in a place she didn't know. She shook her head to ward off the last remnants of sleep and stoof up, hoping her eyes would adjust to the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em?\" she called out, hoping she was just in her room, her best friend near by. But she got no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of panic began to wash over her body. She felt goose bumps rise on her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em?\" she called a little louder, her voice shaky. It echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My voice shouldn't be echoing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled her feet forward her arms reaching wildly to prevent herself from crashing into any unknown objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What now</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The darkness seemed to swirl around her, and the abstract forms beckoned to her, wanting to lure her into an even deeper darkness. Sara waved her hands around her, stepping carefully, trying her best to avoid those looming shapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sara stopped. She thought she heard something. Her heart pounded sickeningly in her throat. There, she had definitely heard something. Or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" whispered a small, tinny voice. \"Hello? Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara turned around slowly, trying to determine the direction the voice was coming from. She wasn't sure if she would avoid it or go towards it if she could discover where it came from. Unfortunately, no matter how hard she listened, she could not determine the source of the little voice. Trying to calm herself down, Sara decided it was probably a broken toy or something. 'Maybe this is like The Island of Misfit Toys,' Sara thought with grim humor. 'Except in a room.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara continued to wander, she heard the voice, continuing to call out. It scared Sara witless. She wasn't even sure what she wanted to do anymore...</span></div></div>",

The voice continued to repeat \"Hello\" and she began to discern that  for every one spoken, two more seemed to be echoes.  <i>Strange </i></span> That is why it was hard to figure out where it was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled  two steps to the center of the room and sat again. She closed her eyes and focused on the first  word in the series of hellos. It seemed to come from above. She had already walked the length of each wall and found nothing so it made sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and decided to walk the walls again this time with her hands reaching up as far as they could.  she found that she could touch the ceiling of the room. <i> Yuck!  Spiderwebs! </i> She grimaced as she waved her hands through one corner.  She brought them down again and wiped off the sticky stuff. what if a spider crawled on her.  She didn't like spiders.  They creeped her out so much she couldn't even kill one in fear of...well, she didn't know what. She always just moved away or had someone else deal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she had a thought. <i>Spiders don't talk , do they?  What if... oh no. I am not going there.{/e}  She shook her head and breathed in again.  The air in the room smelled of mold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued her arm scan of the walls and corners, hoping not to find the maker of the webs.  Her fear of staying here superseded the other. The next corner yielded more webs but the voice sounded closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the tinny voice said and it echoed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara chanced a response,  \"Where are you?\" and heard her own echo two times as well.  It reminded her of the underground tombs and caverns she had read about. They were not as  small as this one  and were connected to tunnels.  She began to get excited, maybe... her thoughts were interrupted as she got to the last corner. There were not webs and her hands did not touch the ceiling, but an open space.  The voice was even more real too as if coming from out side the room now it echoed less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you up there?\" she called.  she stood on tiptoe trying to reach up and find a way to boost herself.

It was only polite. \"I am anamatronic 1.\" It said, putting her down on the mossy cubby-hole. It seemed the robot, or whatever it was, had made a bit of a home in a cubby hole in this...cave-thing.

Are you broken?\" It looked confusedly to the left, then to the right, lifting it's arms and checking it's body. Suddenly it stopped, closed it's eyes and a humming began. After a while the humming stopped and the robot opened it's eyes. \"Functioning within normal parameters.\" it explained, then cocked it's head, examining Sara. \"Are you?\" it asked, seeming concerned. \"I...I don't think so.\" said Sara. The robot nodded matter-of-factly, \"Good.\" it stated. \"Good.\" she agreed. \"Can I call you Ann? Are you a girl? Or should I call you one?\" The robot thought a minute then decided, \"You may call me one.\" Sara nodded then began looking at her new surroundings. There seemed no way out. There was a light coming from above...'<i>sunlight?</i>'she thought, \"Sunlight!\" exclaimed Sara. \"How can we get out of here, One?\" she asked, excited.

After all, she could be working her way OUT of something, or she could be working her way deeper INTO something. She stopped and thought hard. There didn't seem to be any logical way to decide which it was. There wasn't a trace of light and the only sound was that tinny voice in the other room saying, \"Hello!

It didn't react and seemed to have some sort of crisscross pattern on at least one side. She ran her finger along and determined it to be cylindrical in shape. Shrugging, she picked it up and tried to examine it closer. Her fingers hit a soft pad, and pressing it caused a stream of light to hit the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. Light,\" Sara muttered to herself. \"Guess it's nice to confirm that the room is in fact full of blackness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat damn voice. Well, at least I have a little better plan now to figure out what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara did another sweep of the room with the flashlight. She spotted outlines of shelves painted in black and a couple dust bunnies. Just as she thought her efforts would lead her nowhere, she found a crevice in the wall wide enough to stick her hand in.
