I waited for a few moments , shadowing my face with my hands until I fully awoke. I was basking in that warm, orange glow made by the light seeping through my fingers when I heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat bolt upright, my eyes scanning the space around me. I saw nothing that could have moved. I began to relax, my muscles loosening...until the realisation that I wasn't in my own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lying on the ground where there was a patch of luscious, green grass. I was surrounded by huge trees that reached up into a blue sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up I whirled on the spot feeling a slight breeze nip past my ear. At each direction all I could see were trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed off the rising feeling of panic, knowing it would do no good, pulled my hair up into a ponytail and plunged into the trees. I just hoped I was going in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour I came to the tree line. Outside of the copse I was greeted with bright blue skies and rolling green hills. It was the most beautiful place I'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in front of me was a crossroad leading of in several directions. In front of it stood a sign with pointed arrows and one that hung above it which read 'Welcome to the Realm of the Blue Tiger'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realised I had to make a choice.</span></div></div>",

My stomach growling, as I have not eaten in days I decided to follow my gut instincts and go. If there is a castle, there is food, shelter, and possibly civilization. Right now, I am just in this wilderness with nothing but towering trees and animals frolicking about like there is not a care in the world. I am not like them. I am human. I have human needs. These must be satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTraveling along the winding road, I had this inner feeling that maybe I made the wrong decision. I can hear my mother speak in that heavy broken English of hers that I worried excessively. However, mom you know I am always right I wanted to say. How could I respond to her she was not here. I was out here in the middle of nowhere and to talk to someone that was not here was ludicrous. However, I felt that somehow she was here ridiculing me as she always did. I could hear her clamorous laughter piercing my conscious poking fun at me.<br>\r\n\tShaking my head, I decided to continue on my path despite the fact that the skies above began to shift in composure. A heavy breeze swept in from the skies above my hair twirled around as if it would just be torn out of the very follicles that held them in place. Something sinister howled in the distance. Its shrieking wails drove a chill down my spine. Did I pick the right path to go? Was it my anxiety or was I really in trouble?<br>\r\n\tI wanted to turn back and see what other paths lay for me. The road was a complete black abyss. The trees swaggered back and forth their green leaves turning into a sea of darkness. Their thorny branches pricked against my skin almost as if they wanted to harm me. That is crazy I thought to myself. How could trees come to life?<br>\r\n\tMy heart pumped at an accelerated rate. I could hear the vessels in my veins pulsing in my brain. . Sweat glazed my palms as I clenched my fingernails deep into my flesh. A steady trickle of blood went down my bony arms.<br>\r\n\tSearching my pockets proved fruitless, as I did not have any of my meds with me. Where was I? I cannot move. My legs were planted deep in this immovable surface. Was my fate finally to end my life come true? All those times I wished for deaths sweet kiss to take me yet now I wanted to recount what I previously said. Was there any turning back down to another road? Life has many roads we can take. Had I finally taken my final path? Swirling in from above an ominous cloud of obscurity blurred my vision. I could feel the air in my lungs slowly drain out as if someone actually took a pin and pricked them open. That lightheaded feeling that I only had when I had not eaten in hours took control of my troubled spirit. Meanwhile I wanted to run, scream, and cry anything but all my emotions and movement was frozen in this moment. What would become of me?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I walk along I try to remember how I got to this strange and beautiful land, but I have no recollection of anything. Nothing. Not even my name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI become aware of a most intoxicating fragrance in the air around me. I look to the path ahead and can't believe my eyes. Lining both sides of the path are enormous rose bushes teeming with the loveliest blue roses I have ever seen (I assume anyway, since I can't really remember). I run up to the nearest bush and lean in close to smell one of the gorgeous roses. But instead of filling my nostrils with it's heady scent the rose reaches out and bites me on the nose. I jump back abashed rubbing my injured proboscis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your nose out of my business,\" the rose scolds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to smell you,\" I reply shocked. I pull my fingers from my nose checking for blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to smell you,\" the rose mocks. \"Did it ever occur to you that I am NOT that kind of rose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question catches me off guard, much like the rest of the conversation but I pause to consider it before answering. I must admit I AM rather ashamed of my actions when I think about it. So, I try to apologize to the rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon, good Rose. I am new here and a stranger to your ways. Uh, until this moment, I was under the impression that roses were meant to be smelled.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we most certainly are not! How arrogant to believe that a flower's sole purpose is for your olfactory pleasure! Who do you think you are anyway? The Blue Tiger? Someone needs to teach...,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch amazed as every rose on the bush, and some of the neighboring bushes as well rise up and aim their razor sharp thorns at me. The big bush starts shaking as the little rose gets more and more irate. Suddenly, the rose yells, \"Prepare to fire!\" Every rose rears back at once moving as a single unit-- thorns glistening in the sun. I have to act now. But what should I do?</span></div></div>",

Odors drift into my nose. My nose has no control over it. It's not like my eyes who can choose what to look at. I would sympathize with you if you were complaining that I stared at you because vision is an active sense. But smelling is involuntary. I can close my eyes. I cannot close my nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose thought about that. \"You make a good case. A very good case.

Hmmm. That's an awful lot of bee humming going on. I wonder what they are up to? Or maybe the bees here are just very loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are no louder than anywhere else,\" says a small voice and I look around for its owner.  \"Here, on your shoulder,\" it says.

I have to find this Blue Tiger, hopefully he can tell me who I am and what I am doing here. A barrage of flying thorns hit my face and arms feeling like hundreds of bee stings without venom-- thank goodness. Fortunately, it isn't long before I leave the rose bushes behind and emerge into a serene meadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to shake as many of the rose thorns as I can from my hair and shredded clothes before starting to explore the area. I have perspired during my exertions and the sweat sets my multitude of tiny injuries on fire. I decide to rest in the shade of large tree. There is something strange about this tree but I am in too much pain to give it much attention. I sit down and rest my back against its massive trunk then pull off  what's left of my sleeves and use the cloth to dab at my wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe I hate this place,\" I confess to the air, on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly jump out of my skin when my weepy confession is answered in a booming voice from high above my head. \"Whatever in the world could make you hate the enchanted land of the Blue Tiger, my child?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up trying to determine the source of the voice when the trunk I am resting against moves. I jump to my feet and dash what I deem a safe distance from the strange animated tree. I look at the trunk more intently and realize it is not a trunk at all but a giant stem. And what I thought was the top of a bizarre tree is really the underside of an enormous flower. As if to confirm for my eyes what my mind has already deduced, the flower bends down and looks me in the eye with its blue-petal striped face. Now I understand; the Blue Tiger. The Blue Tiger is a monstrous tiger lily the size of a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind is reeling but it is obvious the Blue Tiger expects a reply.

I've had a really bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blue flower snaked its stem low to look me in the eye, \"Please, tell me about it stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I told the Blue Tiger about waking up here with no memories of who I am. I told him about how lost I feel here in this enchanted land. I told him about being attacked by the strange blue rose bushes. The flower nodded its huge petaled head in a sympathetic manner and graced me with a kind smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the behavior of my subjects. These are stressful times, my friend. The flowers are at war. Unfortunately you have stumbled into the War of the Roses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood looking at the floral monarch with what must have been an expression of complete shock. I wanted to speak but couldn't formulate the words to convey my thoughts. The Blue Tiger apologized again, this time taking notice of my injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bee balm,\" the flower said, snapping its leaves like fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart nearly leapt from my chest when dozens of bees swarmed in the air around me. I scream and try to cover my face while mentally preparing to feel the piercing pain of numerous bee stings. But instead of the expected pain I feel tiny daubs of cool relief all over my extremities. It feels like refreshing raindrops all over my skin. I raise my face to the heavenly caress, shocked to see the bees are the source of my reprieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought they were stinging me,\" I stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Tiger smiled at me and I swear I heard my mini nursemaids laughing. As the bees smear their soothing ointment over all the rose pricks I smile, for the first time since waking up in this bizarre plant world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. That feels so much better,\" I say, bowing to the bees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment more of relaxation I ask the Blue Tiger if he knows who I am or what I am doing in his land.

I really wanted to get out of this eerily wonderful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got yourself a deal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a quick nod and went down the path to my left. It had foliage on both sides. This time I was careful enough not to even touch a leaf. If I snapped a twig on the way, I apologised, just in case. I was in enough trouble already and one never knew what could happen next in this strange forest filled with talking flowers and talking bees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my relief, leaves and twigs didn't talk and my journey was uneventful. I could see the oak tree and I hurried to it, with my heart beating fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea in mind as to how to broach the subject with the bees. Should I start with a simple hello and begin with talking about their friends - the roses, or about the Blue Tiger... or should I say I'm lost and ask for directions and veer the conversation round to the lonely giant lily? For all this to work, the bees must be really chatty, or else I would be soon finding myself covered with red stings. I never had a word with bees before (I have to admit I had to entertain a sting or two during my last encounter with them). How would they be? All sweet and honey at first and then red and angry? Or indifferent? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time the oak tree came into full sight. It was quite large and shady. The next moment my jaw dropped because I had spotted my destination hanging off one of the branches. To my horror, the honey comb was of higher proportions than I had i imagined - at least<i> three times the size of an average honey comb</i>! I felt my shaky confidence slowly leaking out of me.<br>\r\nI concentrated my vision onto the extra large comb to see whether the bees residing in it were also of XL size. To my relief, they were of normal size. But I was sure there lived thrice as many bees than in an average sized comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what shall I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, I'm the traveler who has no ambition in the Realm of the Blue Tiger. Let others fight for the throne. I am a dreamer. To wander down a well worn path in a beautiful land of luxurious green grass and <br>\r\nbright blue skies; dreaming of mythical animals befriending me. It had a definite allure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step in the large droppings on the road. Reality has set in. I open my eyes and see two little tiger cubs. They aren't blue. They have orange and black stripes, like ordinary tigers. I hear a loud growl behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nword count = 218</span></div></div>",

His skin looked white. He had a wide nose, thick lips, and a muscular body. The jeans, long sleeved shirt, and hiking shoes he wore were practical for roaming the forest. All in all he looked well cared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe picked our way through fallen limbs and leaves until we reached a wide clearing. One sweeping gaze revealed two large tents with a smaller one in the middle, all arranged in a semi-circle.  A fire pit had been dug in front of the middle tent. A stack of wood sat by the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel led me to one of the larger tents. \"This is where we eat,\" he said. \"The smaller tent is for sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other one?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's their laboratory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their what?\" Had I heard right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The place where my mom and dad do their testing. They go hunting for specimens and bring them back for testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while they're hunting they leave you all alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked at me like I'd slipped a cog. \"I'm not alone, I have Stripey and Bitey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLand a gotion. I was torn between eating and moving on, or remaining with this delusional child until his parents returned. I decided to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell,\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering where I had last stepped  before the roses shot their thorns at me, I hastily removed my left shoe and carried it outside.  Picking up a stick I scraped it as clean as I could. Then I asked for water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We save it for drinking,\" the boy said. \"There's a creek over there.\" Following the direction in which his finger pointed, I came to a narrow but full  flowing stream of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I  returned Daniel had relinquished his stuffed animals long enough to lay out a spread of fruits, nuts, tack bread and jerky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you Daniel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost eleven, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer we heard a woman's musical voice call out. \"Hey, Danny-boy, where are you? Are you playing in the creek again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my hand, Danny pulled me outside. \"Look everybody, I found a lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There had once been a time when the realm had fields as green as that, framed by the brilliant blue skies.

I pull my hand away, afraid of what else could happen. I look at my hand to check for any wounds. To my surprise, I find a branding still burning, I can smell my flesh burning away but I don't feel anything. Intricate designs cover my whole palm as the blue flame spreads out into five snake-like tendrils over my fingers, leaving more of that design in their wake. When the flame is done, it descends beneath my skin and now I feel something. Not pain, but.... power..... so much power. As the flame moves to my skull, I can feel it move behind and over my eyes. Suddenly the world goes black, I feel my body falling down, I stop myself with one knee and arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening? What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you finally found me.\" A firm female voice sounds off form somewhere within the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who.... who is that? What is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is what I've had to call home for the last couple thousand years. As to who I am, I'm the blue tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blue tiger? But that can not be. You are said to have left these lands, and that you are dying just like the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't leave these lands, I was banished into this infernal rock with the hope that one of the people like you would find me.\" A million questions now overtake <br>\r\nmy mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone like me? How do you mean?\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been dying for many years now, the earth can feel it, my power has not been able to protect it from the evil in this world, an evil I've kept at bay and unseen from the eyes of man. The earth is dying from that evil, the Garanar. An ancient form of demon from Karlor. I have been using the earth's life to create hosts. You are a host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A host for what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power. With the power of the earth, I've been able to create humans with the capability to wield my power without being destroyed by it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I to do with this power?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight the Garanar. Close the tears in this reality. They grow in number with every passing day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What tears, I have not heard anything about these tears or seen them myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mere mortal can see them, but you can now. There is more in this darkness then you realize, just look around you.\" I look up, to my right, and to my left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closer.\" I peer straight ahead. Within the blackness, dim orange lines begin to appear. Hundreds come to my vision, they are all over this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't, but as I said, I have created hosts. As in there are more than one of you. The task you have before you is to use these abilities, this sight in particular to find the others, and bring this crystal with you. Together you will become the legion of the blue tiger, and you will revive and protect this world as I have for many a millennia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the people, shouldn't they be warned of this coming invasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the castle is where you must go now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I tell the king, he'll think of me as a lunatic with the way I'm dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fail to realize that you are no longer the same as you once were.\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"How do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point your hand at the cliff here.\" The blackness disappears and makes way for the real world. I look at the dried out pool and waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Repeat after me. Rivnir livnianth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivnir livianth.\" The sound of rushing water sounds out from above before barrels and barrels worth of water fall down the cliff that begins to fill the empty pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into the pool, see your new self.\" I walk over to the edge of the pool, and what I see shocks me. All over my body, I have blue markings, my clothes have changed. I now wear armor, it resembles that of leaves but feels as strong as a diamond. My hair now has blue, white and black streaks in it in the same pattern of a tigers coat. My eyes are a bright pale blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now a knight of the Blue Tiger. The king would be a fool to refuse an audience with you or to think of you as a looney.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.... this is incredible. Where is my weapon? That silver dagger is yours, it is called Drangur or demonslayer in the common tongue. That wand is your weapon as well, it's crafted from the elder trees of Hanlien, it's magic can combat that of the Garanar. That chalice, when you drink from it, it shall heal you from any wound no matter how great and cure you of any poison or curse. These are the weapons of A Blue Tiger knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n</font></span></div><br>\r\n\"Do you accept what I ask of you?\"    </span></div></div>",

It did not matter because eventually the sun would set in the west and I could determine my direction from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked I noticed wild flowers blooming on either side of the road. The flowers released the most exquisite scents and their colors seemed to change at random.

However, as I progressed toward the distant horizon I realized that the flowers did change color. That they progressed through the color spectrum as a wave progresses to the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead I saw mountains, their snow capped peaks jagged against the blue sky.
