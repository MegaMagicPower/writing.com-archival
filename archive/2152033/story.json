His father looked down on him, considering his brother, Fang, to be the preferred leader of their prestigious clan. But when his brother succumbed to the rot, and his father passed away in his old age, Thane suddenly found himself thrust, unprepared, into power. His unwitting reign was immediately met with outrage by the wolf peoples, who balked at the thought of having such an incompetent chieftain in such a dire time.

Today is the day you set out to put and end to the Rot and all this madness. Ever since the King had made his declaration, the Rot had been free to spread across Armello, and now that some of the wolf clan members are getting infected, it's become a problem. Wolves have sensitive noses after all, even a single Rot infected citizen with only one or two rot points can clear a building here! There are only a few Rot infected people in the clan, but it's enough to stink up the whole place! At least, to a wolf that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to leave the smell behind and get some fresh air, you order the guards to open the gate and allow you to leave the Clan Grounds. You can only hope that this place won't succumb to the Rot while you're gone. After all, you are the leaving this place leaderless. Still, this Rot isn't going away on its own, and you won't just let it swallow up your people. You haven't been leader long, and you aren't very experienced, but even you can see that this is the best thing for your people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards salutes you as you pass. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Good luck, sir! Hopefully you can find a way to cleanse this Rot before we all end up snout-deep in each other's boots.</span> He shudders at the thought, and you do as well. After a brief exchange, you step outside and the gates are shut behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold, wind blows up from the base of the Northern Needles. Strange magics have kept most of the land in an eternal summer, but the snowy peaks that the Wolf Clan call home remain cold as ever. It takes you most of the day to climb down, which is fine by you. You fight better in the dark anyways. As you reach the warm ground outside of Wolf territory, the fresh mountain air you'd enjoyed on the way down is replaced by the stench of Rot once again. You groan and hold your nose as you check your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a town off to the East. It'd be a good place to check for more information about the Rot, or just quests you can take for money. To the direct south are some old ruins, a dungeon you could explore. And finally, there's a forest to the East. There's probably not much there save for bandits, or perhaps one of the other people that clan scouts had said are looking to defeat the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHealth: 5/5<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 4<br>\r\nRot: 0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the past few years, you\u2019ve been on a campaign to wipe out a bandit tribe that has been growing in the Northern Needles. It was a powerful organization, a few thousand strong, but you\u2019ve been dismantling it piece by piece, assassinating its leaders, setting fire to its strongholds and picking off its underlings one by one. Over the years, the tribe has been plunged into chaos, and its remaining members have deserted the tribe, fearing for their lives. Now, after years of work, you\u2019ve single-handedly destroyed the bandit organization like you have so many others, resigning it to the annals of history\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned home, however, you were not given much time to rest before you were sent on a new campaign. You\u2019ve tried to keep out of Armello\u2019s affairs\u2026 but the rot has slowly been creeping into your work more and more. It seems to be omnipresent; there\u2019s not a place you could go to escape its influence. It seems like the once noble kingdom has gone made. If you wanted things to return to the way they were, you were going to have to stomp out this chaos; starting with its very source...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rot infects each of us its victims with their own unique, foul stench, which seems to grow worse as the infection grows. This is embarrassing enough, but the true cost is the way it affects your personality. The more points of rot you have, the more you\u2019re controlled by your own id; those who are corrupted become horny, smelly, slobbish versions of their former selves. Truly, in a culture dedicated to honor, chastity and temperance, becoming infected with the rot is the most humiliating fate a wolf could suffer. Thus, usually when a once proud wolf is corrupted, it is kept a secret, and they are mercifully, silently exiled to preserve their honor\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your last campaign, you\u2019ve run into a few corrupted exiles while travelling the wilderness. The ones whose willpower was strong were still relatively normal, and seemed embarrassed and ashamed by their smelly tendencies and sinful urges. The ones whose willpower was weak were now mindless slobs, who immediately tried to fuck and/or fart on you on sight, only to get an arrow through the skull instead. In truth, it hurt your soul to find that so many of your fellow wolves have succumbed to such a terrible affliction. And then you come home, only to learn that your king has succumbed to the madness as well!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never at all interested in Armello\u2019s politics. Hell, you weren\u2019t much of a people person in general. The concept of \u2018loneliness\u2019 never registered with you. Being completely isolated, all by yourself, deep in the wilderness for months at a time was relaxing to you. But hearing about the madness of the king, and seeing the other similarly mad, completely unqualified \u2018heroes\u2019 who were vying for the crown, you knew you had to embark on the most difficult, the most dangerous, and the most important campaign of your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Armello, in its sensitive state, falls into the wrong hands, it is doomed. You cannot risk that happening. You must travel the lands, pool your resources, spread word of your prestige, and become the new queen of the kingdom. There was no doubt in your mind that you will, over the course of your campaign, be infected with your rot. In fact, in order to succeed, you will likely have to harness the rot\u2019s dark powers to your own ends. You will have to sacrifice your honor, your chastity, your temperance, and perhaps even your very sanity\u2026 but all the suffering you will endure was worth guaranteeing a brighter future for your kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had only a couple weeks to prepare. You liked to plan out every detail before acting, but you didn\u2019t have time for that. If you were going to seize the throne, you were going to have to react to whatever obstacles you may face along the way, and rely on your wits and skill to guide you. While preparing to set out, you notice a few opportunities to gain some extra prestige, and maybe a bit of gear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at a library, you hear a few bear sages discuss what sounds like it may be a proper <span class=\"clblue\">Wits Challenge</span>. Apparently, a spirit stone on a nearby mountain was harming the natural balance of the region, and someone needs to go retrieve it. You\u2019ve heard that these mysterious \u2018spirit stones\u2019 can be used to completely banish the rot, which intrigued you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at a bar, you overhear a few drunkards discussing a possible <span class=\"ctan\">Fights Challenge</span>. The king\u2019s madness has left the kingdom destabilized, and opportunistic bandits and brigands have been taking advantage of the chaos. Apparently, a small group of bandits have taken over a nearby trade route, and have been charging travelling caravans \u2018gold\u2019 with the threat of burning their wagons. If you wiped out this group, perhaps you could even claim some treasure for yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you\u2019ve heard rumors that seems like they could lead to a <span class=\"cteal\">Spirit Challenge</span>. Apparently, the king is holding some kind of festival nearby, but there have been whispered rumors that the festival is actually a front, and the entire thing is just a plan to corrupt a few high-ranking aristocrats with rot. If you put a stop to this plan, you could probably recruit some grateful noble to your cause...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 4<br>\r\nRot: 0</span></span></div></div>",

If things go well and the trip is a short one, you may even be able to come back here and deal with the bandits after you get the stone. After making a few preparations and checking your map to ensure which way you need to go to reach the mountains, you head off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to your map, the mountains are just past a swamp to the west. Of course, you could also go through the forests around the swamp, but that'll take almost half a day to get around them and then climb the mountain. Swamps are dangerous, vile places. Some people have said that swamps are places where the Rot has sunk into the soil and befouled the landscape. Of course, it's likely untrue. The swamps had all been here long before the first cases of Rot were ever reported. Still, they are foul, and you're likely to take at least some damage in there, be it from plants, insects, or just the smell. As for bandits and marauders, well, the forests are just as likely to hold people like that. The forests would give you cover and allow you to sneak up on such people though. Hell, you may even be able to find someone to help you in some capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step out of town, you look at the branching road. One leads off through those forest trails, and another straight on to the swamp. Both paths have their ups and downs. The forest path is arguably safer, but it'll take longer to reach your quest. The swamp is faster, but you're all but guaranteed to take some damage going through there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment, but you finally make your decision as you start walking down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 4<br>\r\nRot: 0</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your ambitions here were higher then petty brigands and sage superstitions. You wanted to quell the rot. For some reason, the mad king seemed to want to spread the corruption, until everyone in the kingdom was as smelly and hedonistic as he was. Thus, it wouldn\u2019t surprise you if this festival he was holding really was just a conspiracy to propagate the vile plague. The only thing causing you any hesitation was the fact that these rumors might be just that; rumors. If there was any chance at all that you might save someone from the dreaded fate of corruption, though, you must take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the festival would take you far from your homelands. You spend around eight hours or so quietly travelling on foot along plains and prairies, doing your best to avoid being spotted by anyone despite being far out of your comfort zone. Eventually, you finally make it to the forest where the festival is being held, just as the sun was about to set in the distance. Now, this was more like it! You were at home in the forests of Armello, especially at night, when the thick canopy completely veils you in darkness and makes you feel practically invisible. Traveling through the forest unseen and unheard was soothing to you, and you made much quier progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, halfway through the night, you finally come across the festival buried deep in the woods. It was difficult to miss; it\u2019s bright lights and gaudy opulence could be seen over the trees for miles around. Growing closer, you can hear the cacophony of laughter and music as the nobles within celebrate. Once you got a good look at it, the festival was indeed an impressive and dazzling spectacle\u2026 but that only made you loathe it more. How could these aristocrats be partying and celebrating while peasants are succumbing to the rot as we speak? Out of sight, out of mind, you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step onto the festival grounds and wander around, you realize just how out of place you must look here. All the other guests were wearing stylish suits and beautiful gowns, and you were still donning your ranger uniform. It didn\u2019t take long for one of the security guards to notice you didn\u2019t belong here. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHey! Wolf!\u201d</span> You hear a voice shout behind you, and you stop. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou look like you\u2019re not supposed to be here. Why don\u2019t you just turn around and-\u201d</span> The words were caught in his throat as you turned around to face him. He was a little weasel man, and from the look of it, he was stunned to see a legendary warrior show up at an event like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201c... R-River\u2026?\u201d</span> He gasps, recognizing you. Once he realizes just who he was speaking to, he immediately seemed apologetic, almost terrified. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, miss. I didn\u2019t mean nothing by it, really! Please, enjoy yourself!\u201d</span> He stuttered, staring into your cold, stoic eyes. Apparently, your reputation precedes you, and you could terrify people into submission with a single, unimpressed glance. This knowledge was useful, for sure. The otter breathes a sigh of relief when you turn away from him, thinking he\u2019s just been spared your wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander around, glancing at stages full of exotic belly dancers and amusing jester acts, before finally happening across what you were looking for; the king\u2019s mages. They were mysterious figures of various species all cloaked in robes, hiding their faces as they moved furtively through the crowd. Raising a brow, you decide to tail them from a distance, your senses telling you they were definitely up to something or another. You did not know exactly how the rot was spread, but if they were brewing it here, you had to put a stop to it at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they disappeared into one of the big, strange teepee-like tents, with two guards taking their places at the entrance. Eager to see what was going on within, you climb easily up onto the roof of a nearby hut at the tent\u2019s back. A few people gave you funny looks when you started climbing things, but they figured you were just a particularly drunk guest, and laughed it off. You keep one hand on your dagger as you approach one of the gaps in the top of their tent, remaining completely silent as you peak down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize with a start that they were in the process of some kind of ritual! A few were kneeling along a the sides of a glowing, purple ritual circle, while the magus was standing in the center, guiding their almost whispered chant. The circle grows brighter and brighter as they chant, and you can sense it harnessing potent dark magic. It seemed to be slowly infecting everyone at the carnival with the rot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had seconds to act. You could either tear down the tent with your dagger, exposing the ritual being performed and causing the festival to be evacuated. This might take a while, however, and during the evacuation, a few people might still get infected. Meanwhile, it would be a lot faster to just jump down and slay some of the mages, preventing them from completing their ritual. However, this runs the risk of getting you infected yourself...</span></div></div>",

There was no time to evacuate! You had to stop this ritual now! You immediately nock your arrow, aim it at the mage that gave you the clearest shot, and let it fly! Like always, your aim was true, and your arrow plunged through the warlock\u2019s head, killing him instantly and stopping the ritual in its tracks. While the rest of them were looking around, confused, you took advantage of the opportunity and immediately fired off two more arrows, downing two of more of the mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could fire off another shot, though, the head magus looked up and noticed you peeking in through the gap in the tent. Now that her hood was down, you noticed she was some sort of black bear, and she looked quite angry. You try to nock another arrow, but it was too late; the bear reared back and fired a burst of black magic at you, sending you flying off the hut you were standing on! You land on the ground a few meters away, battered and shaken by the occult energy. Hearing the commotion, the crowd filling the festival all ran away screaming and hollering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lie there on the ground, trying to shake off the effects of the dark magic, the security guards rush towards the tent, only to be easily slaughtered by the bear. By the time you finally climb back up to your feet, the bear was towering over you, her veins black and her eyes glowing purple with dark energy. You pull out a dagger, and immediately swing it at her\u2026 only for her to dodge your attack with unbelievable speed! She immediately countered by elbowing you in the back, a simple blow which somehow sent you flying into a nearby tree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept trying to fight her, but your every attack was easily countered, and her every attack did devastating damage. How was this possible? You\u2019ve defeated some of the strongest bandits in Armello with ease, and yet this simple bear was wiping the floor with you. Then, you realized\u2026 it must be the rot! You\u2019ve heard being infected with the rot can improve your fighting skill. Perhaps, being a prioress of the rot, she was so heavily infected that she had now achieved a level of strength and speed no normal mammal would be capable of? Your blood ran cold when you realized the rot could have such an effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempts to fight proved futile, and your attempts to flee proved even moreso. Soon, you were battered and bruised on the ground before her, a legendary warrior humiliated by being beaten by such a simple mage. As if to add insult to injury, now that the bear was standing over you, her foul stench was burning at your nostrils. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cFool! Interrupting our ritual? I would kill you\u2026 but you\u2019re a champion of the wolf clan, are you not? Your people would just revive you,\u201d</span> she grinned. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNo. Instead, I will teach you\u2026 the glory of the Rot.\u201d</span> You watched, confused, as she hitched up her robes, turning around and revealing her huge, thick booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately flinched at what sounded like the bear letting loose a small fart. But it was no ordinary fart, no; in fact, there seemed to be a cloud of visible purple gas wafting from the bear\u2019s booty\u2026 the same gas the ritual circle had been emitting! That was some kind of dark magic! Realizing what the bear had planned for you, and knowing you can\u2019t possibly overpower her, you do the only thing you could think of; clamp your hands together and pray to the Wyld. You weren\u2019t a very spiritual purpose, but you immediately start whispering every prayer you could think of, desperate to counter her dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear was just about to sit down on you, but seeing what you were trying, she pauses, seemingly amused. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHah! Praying for a miracle, now? Pathetic,\u201d</span> she cackles, rolling her eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHmm\u2026 let\u2019s see if your pitiful Wyld is going to save you, shall we?\u201d</span> She stands there, towering over you, taunting you with her fat booty as you frantically pray for help\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><div align=\"center\">Your spirit is being tested!

Eventually, there\u2019s a sudden gust of wind, which fills your heart with hope! \u2026 but, it turns out to be just that; wind. Seeing the hopeless look on your face, the bear rears back and lets out a long, guttural laugh. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHmm! I guess your \u2018Wyld\u2019 isn\u2019t going to help you after all\u2026\u201d</span> She eventually cackles, looking back down on you with a smug, toothy glare. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBut don\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t need the Wyld anymore. Soon, you will become one with the rot\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her lift her huge butt over you, and you immediately try to wriggle out from under her, but it\u2019s far too late. Before you can flee, she drops herself down on you all at once, her immense weight crashing down on your face! Your screams are muffled by ass flesh as your snout is pressed up between her big, pillowy cheeks. She was heavy, but her booty was so soft and squishy that getting sat on wasn\u2019t painful; simply humiliating. You grab onto her doughy rump cheeks, desperately trying to push her off of you, only resulting in her giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMm! You know, you actually make a comfy cushion, mutt!\u201d</span> She taunted, bouncing and grinding her booty on your face, the sadistic ursine taking great pleasure in your every muffled scream. Eventually, she wriggles her hips until your nose is pressed right up against her puckered hole, causing you to whimper in terror. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cReady down there, sweetheart?\u201d</span> She cackles. You start squirming with renewed vigor, realizing the bear\u2019s about to \u2018break wind\u2019. No luck. All you can do is brace yourself before the bear unleashes an achingly loud and powerful, enchanted fart right into your nostrils!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost paralyzed by the sheer disgust as the purple gas covered your face and filled your nose. You knew the rot was foul, but this was, by far, the worst thing you\u2019ve ever smelled in your life! You once had to hide out in the sewers of the Rat Capital for a week\u2026 and yet this, somehow, smells ten times worse! To make matters worse, you can feel the rot creeping up your nostrils and infecting your body, filling you with nausea and malaise! Eventually, you work up the strength to start struggling for dear life again, but this, of course, continues to have no effect on the much larger bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMm. Not a fan of the stench of rot, huh?\u201d</span> The bear cackled. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll learn to love it eventually\u2026\u201d</span> Eventually, your nostrils have inhaled every last bit of the strange purple gas\u2026 which she took as a cue to let out yet another heinous fart! You let out a muffled scream as the agony starts all over again! You\u2019ve only been under her for a few seconds, and yet it felt like hours. She spent the next couple of minutes bouncing her rump on your face while letting out enchanted fart after fart, making 100% sure you\u2019ll be infected. Eventually, the security guard\u2019s back-up shows up, which the bear takes as a sign that she should leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSee you, \u2018hero\u2019!\u201d</span> She mocked, before disappearing in a cloud of purple smoke, leaving you lying there, dazed and confused. The stench of the gas had not only seared your nostrils, but worked its way up to your brain and made your entire head feel numb. Eventually, one of the back-up guards rushes over to your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMiss! Are you alright?\u201d</span> He asked, reaching out a hand. With a groan, you take his hand, and he slowly pulls you to your feet, letting you lean up against his shoulder. You walked with him for a few seconds, letting him take you towards an infirmary\u2026 but then, a thought strikes you. Were you\u2026 infected? Even with your foggy, addled mind, terror wells up in your chest, and you look down and part the fur on the wrist\u2026 only to see that your veins were, indeed, running black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed with horror, you pass out on the spot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you wake up lying on a comfy bed, and for a moment, you have a hopeful thought that, perhaps, the horror you had just experienced had all been a dream. No such luck. You lazily slid open your eyes, only to find yourself in some sort of makeshift infirmary, with an armadillo woman looking down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cAh! Glad to see you\u2019re okay, dear. It seems like you\u2019ve been through quite a lot,\u201d</span> the nurse says. She seems to be speaking in a strange voice, and you wonder why\u2026 until you notice the nose clip she has on her snout. Of course! You were infected now, you must smell awful! Alarmed, you almost jolt out of bed, only to succumb to a sudden wave of exhaustion. <span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cEasy, there. You\u2019re probably still going to be a little groggy.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTell me. Am I\u2026 infected?\u201d</b> You asked immediately. She grimaced, pausing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. You have a full point of rot,\u201d</span> she sheepishly admits. <span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not contagious. However, many people will probably find it\u2026 \u2018unpleasant\u2019 to be around you for very long,\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, looking down at your paws. <b>\u201cOh, by the four clans\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the look on your face, she leans forward and lays a paw on your shoulder, offering a reassuring smile. <span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cNow, don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d</span> she soothes you. <span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cMany infected individuals still manage to live full, happy lives, despite their affliction...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move away from her, pulling her hand off your shoulder and silencing her little speech. <b>\u201cI\u2026 I knew this was going to happen. Just\u2026 not so soon\u2026\u201d</b> you sigh. Come to think of it, a strange smell did seem to be filling your nostrils. You lift an arm and sniff your armpit, to realize that the smell was, indeed, coming from you. However, it actually smelled strangely pleasant, despite having the sting of the rot. <b>\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t smell that bad\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cOh, everyone who is infected is afflicted with their own, unique stench,\u201d</span> the nurse explains. <span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cIt will smell pleasant to you, but to everyone else, it\u2019s a very different story.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou experimented with your stench for a while, curiously sniffing at your own body odor. You quickly notice another concern, though; the aching, burning desire in your loins. <b>\u201cUrgh\u2026 its feels like I\u2019m in heat\u2026\u201d</b> You whimper, crossing your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cAh! Yes, lust is another symptom,\u201d</span> she nods. She starts spouting something else, but your mind is too distracted fantasizing about forcing her down on her knees and having her eat your unwashed, smelly muff. You indulge in these fantasies for a while\u2026 but eventually, disturbed by these thoughts, you suddenly stand up out of bed and make for the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI-I\u2019m feeling well, now!\u201d</b> You said, fleeing outside before she had the opportunity to say anything else. <b>\u201cMy sincere thanks!\u201d</b> She can only watch with mild concern as you hurry away, rushing out into the forests, desperate to be alone right now. Eventually, you settle down leaned up against on the thicker trees, pondering your situation. You were supposed to be an unbeatable and noble warrior\u2026 and yet, you were humiliated - corrupted - by a single mage. Were you past your prime? Had you been careless? Could your sense of honor ever recover?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, reminding yourself to look at the bright side. This was a learning experience. Now that you\u2019ve experienced first-hand the true power of the rot, you\u2019ve realized that this will be the greatest trial you\u2019ve ever had to overcome in all your years. Besides, you still managed to rescue countless party guests from being corrupted, which has earned you some gold and prestige. After praying to the Wyld so passionately, you now feel a strange affinity towards it, and generally feel more spiritual. Most of all, the rot flowing through your veins seems to have increased your strength and speed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had a problem to attend to, though. With a whimper, you look around, making sure nobody was there, before hiking up your armored skirt and beginning to rub at your clit with a paw. Your sex was now extremely sensitive, and this simple act immediately reduced you to a blushing, panting, gasping mess. While you played with yourself, all sorts of deviant and perverted fantasies flashed through your head. Dominating some measly bandit\u2026 sucking off one of your fellow wolf warriors\u2026 maybe even sitting on that bastard Thane\u2019s face and farting him unconscious, just as that bear had done to you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts, it only took a few minutes for you to reach climax. You were barraged by a brief flood of ecstasy\u2026 followed by a deluge of shame. What was wrong with you!? You were supposed to be chaste\u2026 honorable! Were you letting the rot take over your mind already? Even though the rot may give you incredible strength, you couldn\u2019t let it cause you to forget who you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rises, you make your way into a nearby village, where species of all shapes and sizes were living in relative harmony. River despaired at how people shied away in disgust as she passed by, feeling a piercing sense of self-loathing settle in her heart. Eventually, though, one dedicated squirrel courier walked eagerly up to her. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cRiver! I figured you\u2019d turn up around here!\u201d</span> The squirrel smiles, apparently excited to find you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cListen; many in your clan are ecstatic to hear that you\u2019re vying for the crown! In fact, they\u2019ve offered some provisions to help you on your campaign\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cProvisions?\u201d</b> You raise a brow. <b>\u201cOf what sort?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you an amused look. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, that depends on what you\u2019re interested in\u2026\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

And honestly, after last night, you feel you've seen enough magic to last a lifetime. That said, you DO feel more in touch with the Wyld than before...perhaps one spell couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"How many provisions are you allowed to give to me, exactly?\"</b> You inquire. The squirrel, thankfully, seems to be unaffected by your stench. Either that or he's too afraid to risk upsetting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courier smiles and adjusts his pack, <span class=\"corange\">\"four. Any combination of the three is fine, but I can't spare everything! I've got to provide for Thane and Magna as well! Then the rest of this stuff has to go back to the clan!\"</span> Thane...figures he'd be questing for the crown. Maybe he's finally starting to take his job seriously, or more likely he's using this as an excuse to get away from said job and swing his sword at people. Magna though...you hadn't expected the leader of the Iron Guard to leave the clan, even for a quest to restore the land. You'd never met or seen her, but you've heard plenty from another shieldmaiden who had contracted the Rot and had exiled herself to your mountain. She's a hulking beast of a woman who decorates her armor with the tails of vanquished foes. Normally you'd consider these two allies, but now that you've contracted rot, well...Thane might still try to help you cure yourself, but Magna would probably cut you down where you stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the thought from your head and turn back to the courier, <b>\"I'll take one spell scroll. The rest in equipment.\"</b> The squirrel man nods and rummages around in that pack of his. The thought of fucking him briefly crosses your mind, but you push it away as he turns back to you. He hands you a scroll first, the label on it reads \"Mesmerize\" and it appears to cost 4 Magic to cast. He then hands you two cards and a rather warm waterskin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"You remember how item cards work, right? Magical cards that depict items held in various stores? Just press some gold pieces against 'em until you've paid for the item, and said item will come through! They make it sooo much easier on couriers than actually lugging around a million pounds of steel.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the two cards. A steel sword for two gold, and an Adventurer's Kit for one. You stow them away for now and eye the warm flask. <b>\"What about this, then?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you can see him blush a bit as you ask about the strange beverage, <span class=\"corange\">\"Oh! I got that off a rat merchant in another settlement. It's wine! He said it burns going down, but it'll make you substantially faster for the day! Consider it a gift from...er, someone who wants you to succeed in your quest!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel seems to be eager to see what you think of his present.

You definitely don\u2019t feel like your increasing your rot any more yet. You tuck it into your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank the courier for his hard work finding you, and then tuck yourself away somewhere where no one would have to deal with your stench. With that, you start inspecting the cards he gave you, intrigued by this new magic. Do these things really work? Curiously, you take out a coin and press it against one of the cards\u2026 only for the coin to disappear! Now, the card says that the item only costs one more coin. Fascinated, you press another coin against it\u2026 only for the card to suddenly glow brightly! Startled, you drop it on the ground, staring at its incredibly, magical glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you notice the handle of a sword sticking out from the bright glow. You hesitantly bend over and grab it, pulling a sword up and out of the ball of light. Eventually, you\u2019ve retrieved the sword completely, and the light disappears, the card gone with it. With an intrigued coo, you inspect the sword. twirling it around with your paws and getting used to its weight and balance. It seemed to be in absolutely pristine condition, and was so sparkling and shiny, you could see your reflection in its blade. With a satisfied smile, you tuck your new sword into its sheath at your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you ponder what to do with your dagger\u2026 until you notice a few wolf cubs staring at you, seemingly bubbling with excitement on seeing you. You must be some sort of hero to them! With a chuckle, you walk over and offer them your dagger, and the cubs immediately start cheering in excitement that they were given a dagger used by the legendary Silver herself. With that, they rush off, eager to brag about this to everyone they know. You wave happily as they run off, before turning around and looking back at your cards again. Summoning that sword was pretty cool; you wanted to try it again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the other card; the Adventurer\u2019s Kit. Always useful! Without much thought, you press another coin against it.  This time, you managed to retrieve a bunch of basic adventuring gear from your bag, seeming like it\u2019s designed to aid you in all manner of situations. You tuck this all away in your bag, contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, in the distance, you hear a loud roar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Kings Declaration: Rot Inspection!</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest there for a while, until eventually, two strange figures in robes approach you. They\u2019re both wearing plague masks shaped like the beak of a crow, and carrying strange incense. Eventually, they come to a stop in front of you, making you nervous. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHave no fear, ranger. The king has simply demanded an inspection for rot of every champion of the four clans\u2026\u201d</span> Your blood runs cold in your veins. If the king learned you\u2019d been infected with the rot, he would make sure everyone in the kingdom knows! But\u2026 there was no escaping from the rot inspectors. No point in delaying the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimly but obediently consent to their inspection. They probe you with all manner of strange apparatus and inspect your blackened veins, whispering to eachother. Eventually, one of them chuckles creepily, his raspy voice echoing in his mask. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell, well, well\u2026\u201d</span> He notes, as if amused as he looks over the results. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThe legendary ranger of the wolf clan\u2026 succumbing to the rot.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and stare at the ground, your ears drooping in shame. The two doctors seemed amused by this. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, don\u2019t feel too bad. All of you wolf champions are infected, by this point.\u201d</span> The other waved his hand, dismissively. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt\u2019s the obvious consequence of trying to fight the king of rot\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what?\u201d</b> You look up at him, surprised. <b>\u201cM-Magna\u2019s been infected, too?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, yes, even more so than you are. In fact, I\u2019d wager a guess that she infected herself intentionally.\u201d</span> You were stunned! Magna\u2026 infecting herself with a rot? Such a thing seemed completely impossible. Why would she ever do such a thing? Seeing your confusion, the inspector continues. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThe rot is a powerful and dangerous tool. Extremely so. If you want any chance of being the one to overthrow the mad king, you\u2019re going to have to harness the rot for your own ends. But this, I\u2019m sure, you already know.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. You do already know that. If you want to save the kingdom of Armello, you\u2019re going to have to sacrifice your pride, your honor, and even your very sanity, giving it all over to the rot. But for what end, you wondered? What\u2019s the point of replacing one rotten ruler with another? Was the rot so powerful, it was truly the only path to the throne? While the inspectors walked off to report their finders, you laid there in unparalleled despair, feeling hopeless. Now, everybody in the kingdom would know you have the rot, decreasing your prestige back to zero\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a report on the rot infection of each champion is given to every citizen of Armello:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Brun \u2026 3<br>\r\n??? \u2026 3<br>\r\nMagna \u2026 2<br>\r\nScarlet \u2026 2<br>\r\nBarnaby \u2026 2<br>\r\nThane \u2026 1<br>\r\nSylas \u2026 1<br>\r\nAmber \u2026 1<br>\r\nMercurio \u2026 1<br>\r\nThe Rest \u2026 0</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the waterskin, you remember something. That inspector claims Magna is already more infected than you? You could only wonder at how corrupted Thane is by this point, not to mention the countless other champions from the other clans. If you wanted to keep up, you were going to have to be fast. Relentless. You were going to have to embrace the rot. With a sigh, you pulled out the waterskin, pressed it to your lips, and took a big swig. It burned the hell out of your throat, but somehow you managed to chug it all down. You immediately dropped it afterwards, shuddering at the sensation filling your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel\u2026 rotten. There was a nausea brewing in your belly, you felt even hornier, and your stench noticeably increased. But on the other hand, you feel\u2026 powerful. The rot flowed through your vein, making you stronger, faster\u2026 better! Who cares about a bit of stench when compared to such power! You immediately spring to your feet, filled with dedication! For the people of Armello, you would not fail! With that, you drop on all fours and break into a sprint for a while, travelling far from the small village and descending back into the depths of the forest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the wilderness, you meet an old crone that agrees to tell you a bit about the local rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the nearest mountain range, she hears tales of a potential <span class=\"clblue\">Wits Challenge</span>. When she mentions the name \u2018Vekkius\u2019, you immediately perk up. Vekkius\u2026 the two of you had been friends once, and you had been truly in awe of his skill in battle. He inspired you to dedicate yourself wholly to the trade of a ranger... but eventually, he tragically disappeared, and has not been seen since. Apparently, though, rumors claim that he\u2019s been spotted living a reclusive life up in the mountains, for some reason. It would be a great boon for the Wolf Clan if you found him. However, she warns that <b>a champion of the bear clan</b> happens to be wandering that very same mountain range\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the villages dotting the wolf territory, there seemed to be a potential <span class=\"ctan\">Fight Challenge</span>. Somehow, through some legal loopholes and bureaucratic trickery, a cabal of felines have somehow made themselves rulers of a small village of wolves. Infected with the rot, these felines have been using their positions of authority to sadistically torment the poor villagers. Now, they\u2019re barring anyone from exiting or entering the village, so they can abuse the villagers with impunity. If you were to liberate the village, it would reopen a few trade routes for the clan. However, she warns that <b>a champion of the rabbit clan</b> happens to be stopping by that very same village\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, in the meanwhile fertid, miserable swamps, she thinks you might have the opportunity for a <span class=\"cred\">Body Challenge</span>. A caravan travelling through the swamps has been stranded and maddened by the clouds of rot that often burst from its waters. Many of them are corrupted and overcome by lust and insanity, but it is believed that there might be a few survivors among the wreckage that have only sustained meager doses of the rot. If you rescued them, their families would be eternally grateful. However, she warns that <b>a champion of the rat clan</b> happens to be travelling through that very same swamp\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 4 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic:3<br>\r\nGold:1<br>\r\nPrestige: 0<br>\r\nRot:2</span></span></div></div>",

You'd heard a bit about these creatures, at least one wolf exile had been infected by one. However, you thought they only took the shape of giant crows. The one the traders spoke of is apparently a big, feral skunk terrorizing another town that the traders had fled from.  Ugh, the more you hear about the Rot, the more you wish you could get rid of it. Unfortunately, embracing it seems to be the best way to achieve your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nightfall, the town has come into view. The whole place is surrounded by massive stone walls now! What on earth happened here!? You get your answer fairly soon when you get closer to the front gate. You see a rabbit woman with a feathered, yellow beret and an ornate warhammer. Elyssia...the Wardress of the Warrens...a master architect who's said to be able to fortify an entire town in a day. No doubt, that's exactly what she did here, and given that a rot-marked tiger woman is currently putting a coin pouch in her hands...you know WHY she did it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elyssia walks down the road, away from the village and towards you, you immediately walk up to her and snarl. <b>\"So much for rabbits caring about border treaties. How dare you help an outside force invade and enslave our people!?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElyssia wrinkles her nose at the stench coming off of your rot-afflicted body and roughly shoves you aside! <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Out of my way, disgusting beast! I'd have thought that maybe a so-called champion of your people would have some common decency, but it seems you're just like the rest. A disgusting, flea-ridden mongrel that doesn't deserve the respect others so readily foist on your clan. Tell me, how does it feel to know that the entire kingdom knows that the \"great\" ranger, River has sold her dignity for the power of Rot like a cheap whore? Every one of your champions has succumbed to the Rot. You don't deserve to rule, and I'll be damned if I just sit by and let you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery word this lapine has just uttered makes you violently angry. Between your superior fighting skill AND Rot, you could easily take her down a peg! Though, that Mesmerize scroll is just begging for you to use it. You could force her to serve the very clan she despises so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 4 (+2) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic:3<br>\r\nGold:1<br>\r\nPrestige: 0<br>\r\nRot:2{/c)</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another symptom of the rot was increased aggression. That is to say, you wanted to absolutely destroy this bitch! The expression on your face remained stoic as ever, but fury was festering within your bosom. Elyssia started to walk away, cackling after having taunted you, but as she left, you nocked it an arrow and fired it right into her back! This would be enough to defeat any normal warrior\u2026 but being a champion, to her credit, Elyssia mostly tanked the blow, though it did sting her a little. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cH-hey! Cheap shot! Aren\u2019t you wolves supposed to be honorable?\u201d</span> She\u2019s forgetting that wolves believe that, in combat, the only honor is in victory\u2026 through any means. With that, you nocked another arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you had had enough of her prattle, she drops her up-tight demeanor, and immediately charges at you with her huge, strange warhammer-like staff. Being a rabbit, she hops forward with surprising speed, and she immediately closes the distance between before you can let loose another arrow. With a growl, you toss your bow aside, and draw your sword...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Elyssia Rolls\u2026</b><br>\r\n<i>2 Hits, 1 Block</i><br>\r\n<b>River Rolls\u2026</b><br>\r\n<i>6 Hits, 1 Block</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attacks before you have the opportunity to. She tries to bring her staff down on your head, but you manage to block it with your sword, managing to tug her staff from her grip! Just when you think you have her beat, she grabs her big, wooden carpenter\u2019s hammer and smashes it into your side! You collapse onto the ground, shuddering at the blow, giving her the opportunity to hop over and retrieve her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you let out a loud growl as you suddenly spin around, sending a long tear along the front of her coat with your sword. She squeals, stumbling back and blocking your next blow with her staff, only to open herself up for another blow! She seems to be stunned by how fast and brutal your assault was! Apparently, she was not aware of the sheer level of strength and speed the rot could afford someone. She couldn\u2019t keep up with your savage blows, and eventually she was on the ground before you, battered and bruised. She wasn\u2019t bleeding or anything, since she was the champion of her clan, and their shamans have granted her a pseudo-immortality. However, she was far too exhausted and defeated to resist you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to land the finishing blow, and send her back to her clan grounds, you hesitated. You remembered what she called you earlier. \u2018Disgusting\u2019. You figure that should hurt, but\u2026 for some reason, someone considering you gross was actually a little exciting to you! Those filthy fantasies filled your head again, and you decided to see just how much you could gross her out. She deserved it, after all, after condemning so many of your people to the same fate. <b>\u201cHmm\u2026 you think I\u2019m \u2018disgusting\u2019, huh?\u201d </b>You said, sheathing your sword. Your face remains stoic, but on the inside, you were quite excited. <b>\"How's this, then?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Elyssia opened her eyes\u2026 to see your big, smelly paw hovering inches above her face! She can only let out the faintest yelp before you bring it down her snout, pressing it against her nostrils before she could let out a sound. Her yelp is muffled by your sweaty pawpads as she struggles beneath your paw. A strange feeling bubbles in your chest as you torment her with your stinky paw. It felt\u2026 amazing to dominate someone like this! Especially someone who truly deserves it. Of course, you know that this is merely the rot\u2019s influence wearing down at your will\u2026 but this was so fun, it was difficult to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally lift your paw off her face, and she immediately gasped for fresh air, gagging, tears in her eyes. She had never smelled something so foul in all her cushy, aristocratic life! As she gags and coughs, trying to wipe the smell from her nostrils, you take a knee by her side, amused by her reaction. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYou\u2026 filthy cur! You uncivilized swine!\u201d</span> She screamed, blown away by your sheer gall. You, a simple warrior, dared to inflict such\u2026 uncivilized, disgusting torments upon a legendary architect like her? <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThat was the foulest thing in the four clans!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little, amused huff, almost cracked the slightest semblance of a smile. Right now, all you could think about was the ways you could disgust this oversensitive, snobby little rabbit. You\u2019re quickly reminded of the torment that bear inflicted upon you, and how absolutely miserable it was to be on the receiving end. Your comrades were probably getting sat on in that village as you spoke, so it stood to reason that the rabbit deserved a similar fate. <b>\u201cMy paws? The foulest thing in the kingdom? I\u2019m flattered, but alas, no\u2026\u201d</b> She watched in horror as you pulled up your banded leather skirt, revealing your furry hindquarters! <b>\u201cThis is!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, you dropped down on her with all your weight! Her scream is muffled almost completely by your rump as she\u2019s smothered in fluffy butt flesh. You let out a little gasp, invigorated by the sensation of tormenting some evil, snobby little rabbit beneath your rear. It was so uncouth\u2026 so dishonorable\u2026 and so, so hot! Your chastity was largely forgotten as you learned about the sheer ecstasy of the rot. Eventually, her wet nose was pressed right up against your puckered tailhole, and you let out a little coo at the sensation. It almost made you feel a little\u2026 gassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated. Were you really willing to go that far? It probably isn\u2019t wise to let the rot have too much influence over you! Of course, it has to come out, one way or another. Why not let it rip while you have a, let\u2019s just say, \u2018captive audience\u2019? Your body acts almost of its own accord, and you lift a leg up slightly, and hesitantly pass an embarrassingly loud onslaught of gas directly into the rabbit\u2019s nostrils. Her squirms and muffled screams double in intensity, as she desperately tries to push you off of her, but is far too weak to do so. All she can do is lie there, and inhale every little bit of the foul stench\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally stand up off of her, leaving her lying there, shivering in disgust. She could never even imagine someone doing anything so foul! As you look down at her, amused by the fact that you\u2019ve knocked the smug rabbit down a peg, she opens an eye and stares daggers up at you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201c... whore.\u201d</span> With an amused chortle, you wander over to your bow, and lazily nock another arrow and fire it directly into the rabbit\u2019s chest. She disappears in a burst of light, being sent instantly back to her clan grounds, humbled and humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still shaking a little bit, overwhelmed by the excitement what you had just done had given you\u2026 but you take a moment to meditate, and soothe your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><span class=\"clred\">River takes 1 damage<br>\r\nElyssia takes 5 damage</span></i><br>\r\n<b>River is Victorious!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you get your head back in the game, and proceed into the village. With the rabbit out of the way, it was a relatively straightforward task to scale the wall, though it did take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou travel along the rooftops of the village, moving silently on all fours and staying easily out of sight. The wolf villagers below, clad in simple robes and tunics, all seemed miserable, and they flinched in fear whenever one of the felines walked by. Apparently, when one of the wolves made a feline angry, or even if the feline was just bored, they could expect to be farted on and tortured with sweaty paws and armpits for hours. You shuddered whenever you came across one of the felines tormenting a villager. However, you don\u2019t bother with the small fries; not yet, anyway. Every group like this needs a leader. Cut down their leader, and the rest are vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you come across the tyrant; a big, brawny tiger, dressed in a big, fancy cape and nothing else. He was using one wolf\u2019s face as a throne, while a harem of wolf girls catered to his every need, nervously complimenting him and feeding him grapes. You noticed the huge stockpile of food behind his throne, and for some reason, this above all made you furious! How dare he feast on fine cuisine while the villagers starve? This was the sorriest excuse for a ruler you\u2019ve ever seen! Even if he obtained his position of power through nominally \u2018legal\u2019 means, you couldn\u2019t allow his reign of terror to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had two ways of overthrowing him. You could either find out which legal loophole they had used to come to power, and then find a way to reverse it and get them ousted\u2026 or, you could simply shoot him and a few of his cronies with your bow, and scare away the remaining felines. Then, the villagers would be free to elect a new leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which should it be? The violent or non-violent method?</span></div></div>",

No, he's going to pay for this in blood. His blood. You snarl under your breath as you nock an arrow and take aim. Unfortunately, the tiger man's harem makes it almost impossible to get a shot aimed at his vital areas. Anywhere you could aim for that would give a lethal blow is blocked by a wolf girl! You can't move to another vantage point without the risk of being spotted too, so instead, you let your arrow fly and bury itself right in his right shoulder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger lets out a massive roar of pain, and all the harem girls immediately flee from him. A few nearby felines draw their weapons, and you manage to pick off two of them before leaping down to engage the leader, and the remaining three, with your blade. The leader rushes at you with his sword. Huh, apparently he's a leftie. You leap to the side, only to feel your face press against something warm and wet. Your nose it assaulted with a nasty, swampy stink, and you stumble away from one of the leader's goons who'd had his arm raised just right to catch your face in it! The other two lackeys, a cheetah and lynx come at you now. You duck under a swing from the cheetah woman's swork, only to find your snout next to the lynx's ass!

You\u2019ve cut down over a hundred other bandits over the years, and these ones didn\u2019t strike you as particularly tough\u2026 or smart, for that matter. The fact that they seem to have weaponized stench, however, intrigues you. If they manage to catch you off guard with that, they might actually do some damage. Then again, it might be fun to try and use their own techniques against him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes narrow as you focus all your concentration on the battle, watching the four of them circle you like a pack of dogs. How predictable. All of them were too cowardly to rush you at once, so they\u2019re trying to surround you and wait until you show their back. Well, you\u2019re prepared to show them the fatal flaw in their little plan. You turn to the cheetah, pretending you\u2019re going to focus on her\u2026 only to hear the lynx step forward, thinking he\u2019s going to attack you from behind. Just like you planned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was close enough, you bent over, and he found himself blasted by a huge, devastatingly loud fart that seared his nostrils. These cats seemed to have only 1 point of rot, which meant you were about twice as smelly as they were. He immediately started coughing and sputtering, and you seized the opportunity, spinning around and slashing him \u2018cross the neck! With a yelp, he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others seemed disturbed by how easily you dispatched their comrade. The tiger simply growls\u2026 but the cheetah is overcome with rage! <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou... bitch!\u201d</span> She yells, before foolishly charging forward, her sword raised! The way she fumbled with her weapon was almost embarrassing. She obviously wasn\u2019t used to the weight of her sword. You easily ducked under her swing, grabbing her by the waist and pushing forward, knocking her onto her back on the ground. The fall knocks the breath out of the feline, and in another moment, you\u2019ve laid a paw down on her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirms beneath your foot, as you force her to breath in the stench of your sweaty paw. Meanwhile, you nock an arrow, and pull the string back, aiming it right at her chest. At any moment, you could let go of the string and end the cheetah. <b>\u201cNow. If you agree to relinquish your power, I\u2019ll spare your little underling here\u2026\u201d</b> You offer. You like to offer your opponents mercy whenever you felt it was safe to do so. Unfortunately, the tiger was too stupid to accept your offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cNever!\u201d</span> The tiger yelled. He was drunk on his own power, and seemed outraged that you would even suggest he give it up. He gestured to his last remaining underling, a panther, pointing at you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cGo! Kill her!\u201d</span> The panther nervously readied his sword, and charged at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you can\u2019t help but roll your eyes at the tiger\u2019s stupidity. <b>\u201cAlright. If diplomacy isn\u2019t what you desire, then\u2026\u201d</b> You raised your bow, pointing it at the panther before finally letting go of the string! It pierced through his chest mid-charge, and the feline stumbled forward a few more steps, before collapsing onto the ground near your feet. The tiger looked furious, but stunned. All his underlings were lying limp on the ground, and the only one he had left was squirming beneath the onslaught of your smelly paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriumphantly, you nock another arrow, pointing it at him. He realizes he can\u2019t survive another blow like the first arrow. His entire life flashed before his eyes as he stares at the shiny  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cW-wait! Please! I change my mind!\u201d</span> He falls to his knees, begging you for his life. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI agree to your terms! I surrender!\u201d</span> How pathetic. He was willing to let others lay down their lives for him, but when it was his own life at risk, he was a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were disgusted. Such cowardice had to be punished. <b>\u201cOh? My terms? My terms have changed\u2026\u201d</b> You said, no longer willing to spare his life so easily. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll grant you mercy if you relinquish control of this village\u2026 AND if you take your underling here\u2019s boots off and take a big, long whiff.\u201d</b> Judging from the look on his face, his heart dropped the moment you spoke those words. For a second, it almost looked like he\u2019d rather choose death. But with a sigh, he nodded, and stepped forward, ready to meet his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your paw off the cheetah\u2019s face for a moment, letting her gasp for air\u2026 only to drop your butt down on her face! This time, you hadn\u2019t lifted your leather skirt, so her snout wasn\u2019t pressed right up against your tailhole, but it was still quite smelly. The real point of this, however, was just to pin her down while you force the tiger to humble himself for you. You watched, sword ready, while he hesitantly got on his knees and slowly, reluctantly slipped off one of the cheetah\u2019s boots. Both of you immediately recoiled at the smell! Apparently, when it comes to the rot, how the stench is spread out around your body is different for every person. Apparently, for the cheetah, 100% of the stench went straight to her paws!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger was wretched and miserable when he looked down at her paw, trying his best to brace himself for what was about to come. Eventually, he works up the courage to finally lower his head, and press his snout up against her paw pads. He took the biggest whiff he could\u2026 only to practically howl in anguish at the smell! He immediately recoiled backwards after filling his nostrils with her stench, gasping and coughing like he\u2019d just been poisoned, gagging like he was about to throw up. The stench was so terrible, it actually felt red-hot in his nostrils, causing him genuine physical pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, amused, as he regained his composure. The poor bastard thinks he\u2019s finished\u2026 but he was only halfway done. <b>\u201cNow, do the other one,\u201d</b> you demand. He gawked at you, blown away, looking like he couldn\u2019t believe you were serious. But the stoic look on your face indicated that you were, indeed, dead serious. He tries to protest, but he couldn\u2019t think of any argument he could make that wouldn\u2019t get him immediately killed. So, begrudgingly, he gets down on his knees again in front of the cheetah\u2019s hind paws. He hesitated for even longer this time, but eventually, he painstakingly managed to bring him to pull off her other boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back, taking a deep breath of fresh air\u2026 before suddenly slamming his nose forwards against her paw pads! Apparently, he decided to act like he was ripping off a band-aid; just get it over with as quickly as he could. Once again, he was brought to agony by the sheer smell, and this time eventually collapsed onto the ground, his brain numbed by the stench and exhausted by his reactions. With an amused huff, you finally lift yourself off the cheetah\u2019s face, only to notice that she, too, is too exhausted to move, or even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what to do with the two, defeated villains\u2026 until you feel someone tap you on the shoulder. You turned to see a few of the wolves in the tiger\u2019s harem standing there. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cRiver! We\u2019ve heard about you! Oh, thank you so much!\u201d</span> The tiger\u2019s head concubine, immediately stepping forward and wrapped her arms around you, planting a big kiss on your cheek! You were a little taken aback by her show of physical affection, especially since you were quite stinky, but you reciprocated, hesitantly hugging her back. Eventually, she stepped back, glaring at the two on the ground. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t kill them. They enslaved our village. Now it is fair that they become our slaves, no?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Yes, you suppose that is a just fate for the two surviving felines. Hearing the commotion, this happened to be around the time many of the rest of the villagers wandered into the plaza, as they all quickly realized what had occured. You noticed a few others angrily kicking the tiger and cheetah while they were down. Eventually, a wolf comes with rope, and they tie the feline\u2019s hands behind their back and cart them away. Meanwhile, many of the villagers cheered you on like you were some sort of hero. You didn\u2019t take compliments very well, so you were a little uncomfortable as they cheered for you, but you did appreciate the way they showered you in gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the tyrant defeated as the trade routes reopened, you stumbled from the town, victorious and feeling proud of yourself. Sure, maybe your previous quest hadn\u2019t gone so well\u2026 but this one went great! This dramatically boosted your morale, and made you feel more enthusiastic about the trials that were to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you fled into the nearby forest again to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested among the trees while you watched the sun rise in the distance. Eventually, you heard a rustling in the bushes nearby, and realized something was approaching. You kept your paw on your sword, ready to defend yourself\u2026 only to realize it\u2019s just that courier again! <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, hey! I was looking for you,\u201d</span> he smiled. You stared at him, a little stunned. How in the four clans did he find you again? Were you really that easy to find? <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI just want you to know that the clan\u2019s really proud of you! Y\u2019know, despite the whole rot business. And, you\u2019re entitled to some more provisions!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. You didn\u2019t really know what this courier\u2019s deal was, but he seemed\u2026 adamant, at least. You, apparently, get to choose two provisions this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 4/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold:2<br>\r\nPrestige: 2<br>\r\nRot: 2</span></span></div></div>",

I'm glad they helped, River! Well, I've got a couple more really great items for you!\"</span> He rummages around and then hands you two cards.

Scarlet was the leader of the bandit tribe, and the most wanted outlaw in Armello. Meanwhile, Magna was\u2026 well, Magna. If they were in the same place, that could only mean one thing; they were hunting eachother. You glance out over the town, just wondering where they were hiding. You pondered just how Magna would react if she saw you. Everyone, regardless of clan, was in this to win the throne. So just because you were both wolves didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d necessarily we be friendly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the distance, dusk was approaching, and the purple clouds above you seemed to be growing closer and thicker. You should probably get indoors sooner rather than later. You retreat into a nearby inn, hoping that people didn\u2019t mind your stench too much. Every time someone got a grossed-out look on their face when you walked by, it was\u2026 actually kind of a turn-on, actually. Still, you didn\u2019t want to inconvenience people too much. The old turtle running the inn had a pair of noseclips on, so he, luckily, didn\u2019t seem to mind your smell too much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAye, missy. Aren\u2019t you one of those champions?\u201d</span> The old, feeble turtle smiles warmly as you walk in. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAre you here looking for Magna?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow, a little confused. Why would he assume you were looking for Magna? Just because you were both wolves? <b>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWell, she mentioned ya, so I figure she\u2019s a friend o\u2019 your\u2019s\u2026\u201d</span> The turtle shrugged. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIf you want to speak with \u2018er, she\u2019s sitting right o\u2019er there\u2026\u201d</span> He pointed his cane right behind you! He can\u2019t be serious, right? You turn around\u2026 and sure enough, there she was! Sitting on the bench was a veritable mountain of a wolf, standing at over a foot taller than you are thick with what you presume to be pure muscle. She had a stoic, almost bored expression on her face as she towers over you, seemingly unimpressed by your stature. You immediately step back and grip the handle of your sword, startled but ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI have no grievances with you, ranger,\u201d</span> she waved a hand, dismissively. Embarrassed, you move your hand from your sword and try to calm down. You knew why her enemies seemed to fear her so; she was truly an imposing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d</b> you nod, curtly. After that, she simply stares at you in silence. The awkwardness grows more and more intense until eventually, you\u2019re forced to break the silence. <b>\u201cAre you\u2026 here for Scarlet?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201c... mhmm,\u201d</span> she grunted, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t really consider Magna a terrible choice for the crown, from what you\u2019ve heard about her. Sure, she seems to have an unnerving prejudice towards foxes\u2026 but other than that, she seems like a prime example of a wolf warrior. <b>\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d</b> You perk up. <b>\u201cI can help you fight her.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019ve killed her before. She came back,\u201d</span> she huffs, shaking her head. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEventually, I will be so strong, she does not come back. Very simple.\u201d</span> Behind those stoic eyes, you can sense a deep and piercing hatred. Apparently, Magna\u2019s really not a fan of Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems Magna has a one-track mind. You\u2019re not even sure if she cares about the crown as much as she does killing Scarlet. If you helped her with this seemingly important task, you might have a valuable ally\u2026 but how? Suddenly, you remember your scroll. <b>\u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019s easier ways of getting rid of her than that,\u201d</b> you said, taking out your spell scroll and showing it to the wolf. She snorts, looking up at you, realizing what you were implying. For a moment, it almost looked like she\u2019d cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rot rain poured down outside, you and Magna huddled together in the inn, discussing your plans. She smelled even worse than you did, confirming that she was, indeed, infected with the rot. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 why are you targeting Scarlet in particular, anyway?\u201d</b> You ask at one point. Sure, she was the most wanted bandit in Armello, but Magna acted as if this was a personal vendetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHer bandits robbed my son. Stole everything. Stabbed him in the knees and left him. He died of exposure in the wilds.\u201d</span> She said, simply, the emotionless, stoic expression never leaving her face. You could tell that whatever emotions she did have, she kept thoroughly bottled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh\u2026 by the Wyld! I\u2019m\u2026 so sorry\u2026\u201d</b> You said, a little taken aback by her frank, nonchalant reveal of such tragic personal information. Your ears were pressed back against your head, as you suddenly sympathized by the huge woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo. Do not be sad. Never get sad. Get angry,\u201d</span> she insisted. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI will get even with her. I will make things right. Then, I will feel\u2026 okay again.\u201d</span> You could tell she almost choked up at that last line. You laid a paw on her arm, silently expressing your sympathies, and she went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you got down to the nitty gritty of planning. Apparently, since the last time Magna killed her, Scarlet brought along an entourage of bandit around with her wherever she goes. She\u2019s stopped at a compound on the other side of town to rest while the rot rain falls. One of you should be able to hold off all the bandits easily on your own, which would give the other the opening to get to Scarlet and cast your spell. After that, whoever hypnotized her would just need to survive for the next full day, and she would permanently enslaved. You were hesitate to assist another hero, but it was worth it to eliminate another clan\u2019s champion from the situation completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main question; who should be the one to hypnotize Scarlet?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The choice here isn't entirely too difficult. As much as you felt Magna deserved to have Scarlet for herself, her Spirit isn't nearly high enough to be able to cast the spell. <b>\"Well, Magna...as much as we both know Scarlet deserves to suffer at you-\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds up a hand to cut you off, <span class=\"clblue\">\"It is okay. I...understand. I cannot cast the spell. I am not suited for sneaking anyways. So long as the fox suffers. So long as she cannot kill again. This will be her punishment. If I can not give it to her, a fellow wolfess is the next best thing.\"</span>  You can hear the disappointment in her voice. If it could be the other way around, you'd gladly trade places with her, but as it stands Magna can't cast the spell, and neither of you have any Moon Juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the plan set, the two of you wait for the rains to stop before heading out towards the compound where Scarlet is taking refuge. When the place is in sight, you quickly climb up the nearby buildings and watch from the rooftops, waiting for Magna's distraction. You don't have to wait long before she lets out a mighty bellow, slams her shield into the ground (which causes a small crater in the road), and charges straight in! The first bandit she hits goes flying when her shield slams into his body! As the others move to engage, you almost forget that you have a job to do too. Tearing yourself away from the action, you go back to leaping from rooftop to rooftop. Scarlet appears to be in the top floor of the building you're moving towards, so entry from the roof should be easy at least. You pick off a few archers trained on Magna as you creep along till you make it to Scarlet's hideout. The window isn't locked, strangely enough, so you slip right in. You look around for Scarlet, only to hear a soft, sultry voice next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"So...you must be the great ranger...River, right? You know, I had expected a scarred, scratched up brute like the other two. Instead I find myself pointing my sword at a woman almost as gorgeous as me.\"</span> Sure enough, when you turn your head, you see Scarlet pointing her blade at you. In her off hand, you see an opened flask of the very same wine you'd helped yourself to yesterday! Yet, despite her Rot score now being 4, you don't smell a thing! At first you think its because her paws are sealed away in black leather boots, but something else catches your eye...a glowing talisman around her neck. <span class=\"corange\">\"Like my Wyld Talisman? Well, if you and I can have a calm, civil discussion maybe followed by some...not so civil activities, I might give it to you. Consider it a...token of my affection.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you've heard, Scarlet is just as skilled of a fighter as yourself. And while that charm seems to be suppressing her Rot, she still has a sword to your neck. Plus, the cord looks to be deliberately made so she can tear it off at a moment's notice. With a nod, the two of you take a seat at the small table in her room. Scarlet, understandably, keeps her sword pointed at you. There's a lantern on the table just like yours. No wonder she knew you were coming... <span class=\"corange\">\"So, perhaps you can help me understand all this. Why exactly does the howling wall of metal and meat outside want me dead so badly?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes narrow and you snarl. <b>\"Hmph. Figures...you don't even remember having your bandits kill her son? You probably weren't even there. They say you're a great fighter, but you just hide behind your men like all the rest!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet raises an eyebrow at you, <span class=\"corange\">\"she had a son? Huh, I can't imagine a man capable of climbing THAT mountain. Did she top? I bet she topped. Now THAT would have been a sight to see.\"</span> She chuckles to herself a bit before continuing, <span class=\"corange\">\"Regardless, I gave no such order. I only united all the bandit clans a very short while ago. A good amount of them either haven't gotten the news yet, or have left their clans. Turns out some people don't enjoy taking orders from a former slave.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer slave? You'd always heard she was just a noble-turned-bandit. Still, that doesn't really answer all your questions. <b>\"Alright, so why didn't you just tell Magna this? You've apparently fought before.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet scoffs, <span class=\"corange\">\"Well she wasn't exactly in a talkative mood last time! She just yelled \"murderer\" and charged me with that shield of hers. Besides, even if I were to tell her that those bandits weren't under my rule, do you think she'd listen? I'm not sure if you've noticed, but she isn't particularly fond of foxes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is a fair point. Magna definitely doesn't like vulpines. You aren't sure why she's telling you all this though. <b>\"Fair enough. So, I take it there's a reason your sword hasn't been thrust into my throat yet, yes?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smiles at you and stands up before sheathing her blade. <span class=\"corange\">\"Well, aside from wanting answers, I have a proposal for you.<br>\r\n No doubt you plan on using that Mesmerize scroll on me, and while I'm not particularly fond of the idea of being a slave again, if its to a woman as fine as you, I suppose it wouldn't be all that bad. Still, I do rather enjoy my freedom, so how's this? You let me go, and take my lantern over there. Show it to Magna and tell her that I saw both of you coming and escaped. I'll be waiting in the woods near the town being attacked by that skunk Bane. I'm sure you've heard about that. Give me my lantern back there, and I'll be sure to properly thank you for your help.\"</span> She winks at you and smiles as she waits for you to make your decision.</span></div></div>",

Scarlet\u2019s the most wanted animal in Armello, so obviously she wouldn\u2019t be above lying to your face. Besides, she was your enemy, and it would benefit you greatly if she was eliminated. If anybody had to take the throne, the bandit clan would be one of your last choices, rivalled only, perhaps, by the rat clan. Seeing the uncertainty on his face, the skinny vixen seemed smug, believing she\u2019d tricked you into helping her\u2026 only to freeze up in horror when she watched you unfurl the scroll. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cW-wait! No!\u201d</span> She said, jumping forward, as if she hadn\u2019t anticipated you would actually use your spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far too late, though. Reciting the incantation and pouring all your magic into it, Scarlet suddenly stopped in her tracks, her eyes wide as she felt the spell worm its way up into her brain. Soon, her arms went limp, and her jaw just hung open as her eyes fogged up and became grey. She drooled a bit, just standing there in place. You were a little confused. You expected her to be hypnotized, but she just looked braindead. \u201cScarlet?\u201d You asked, waving a paw in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of you calling her name seemed to almost wake her up from a trance, and although her eyes were still foggy, she smiled dimly at you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cS-so\u2026 you got me. After\u2026 all those years reuniting the tribes\u2026 this is how you want to finish it, huh?\u201d</span> She groaned, obviously a little out of it. She was clinging to the last bit of consciousness she still had. The devoted look on her face was almost creepy. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t be angry. I literally just can\u2019t. This spell\u2026 it\u2019s inside my head. Making me devoted to you. By the Wyld, you\u2019re so damn beautiful\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the spell had been successful, you toss the scroll aside. You\u2019d heard this was a kink for some, but you, on the other hand, were quite unnerved by the whole thing. Especially, when she suddenly stumbles over to you, and wraps you in her arms, nuzzling her head on your shoulder. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cMistress\u2026 I\u2019d do anything for you\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cO\u2026 kay\u2026?\u201d</b> You muttered, a little big uncomfortable. You let her hug you for a while, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would ever again, so eventually you just had to push her away. Now, her eyes were filled with nothing but love and devotion, and her tongue was hanging out of her mouth. <b>\u201cW-well\u2026 you can start by following me outside.\u201d</b> She nods eagerly, ecstatic to prove her devotion. She copies your every footstep exactly as you walk down the halls of the building. As you approach the front door, you don\u2019t hear any commotion, so you figure Magna must\u2019ve been victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhen we get out there, say something like\u2026 I don\u2019t know. \u2018Sorry for killing your son\u2019, you know?\u201d</b> You whispered to her, and she nodded. With that, the two of you stepped out of the double doors in the front of the building, to find Magna surrounded by dead or unconscious bandits. She immediately looked outraged when she laid eyes of Scarlet, but she resisted to urge to strike her down, knowing that doing so would free the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMurderer,\u201d</span> she muttered, stepping forward. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIn fact, the once great leader of murders\u2026 now reduced to a simple slave. How pathetic.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Scarlet flopped to her hands and knees in front of Magna. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for everything I have done! I have seen the error of my ways!\u201d</span> Scarlet immediately begged. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cPlease! I deserve any punishment you could give me, a thousand fold!\u201d</span> Magna seemed a little taken aback. This seemed incredibly out of character for the vixen\u2026 but, she assumes, her action was just the result of the mesmerization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHmm\u2026 punishment, huh?\u201d</span> The wolf said, tapping her chin. Torturing Scarlet, even a hypnotized version of her, would definitely be cathartic. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cRanger, do you think you could give me, perhaps, a half hour alone with this murderer?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, yes, of course. I\u2019ll meet you at the inn,\u201d</b> you said, relinquishing Scarlet to the maiden\u2019s care. <b>\u201cDo whatever she says, now, alright?\u201d</b> You whisper to the vixen, who nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Magna steps forward, grabbing Scarlet by the neck and lifted her up in the air. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAlright, now, murderer. I want to see you squirming and begging for dear life. You hear me?\u201d</span> She said, and Scarlet nodded, immediately starting to squirm and whimper in the wolf\u2019s grin. This was the first time in your life that you\u2019d seen Magna smile. It was a disturbing smile. With that, she retreated into the compound with the fox in her grip, and you could only wonder what kind of fate Scarlet was about to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back to the inn, you notice a wanted poster\u2026 with your face on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WANTED<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shield5.png\" alt=\"*Shield5*\" title=\"Shield5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> River</b><br>\r\n<i>For use of outlawed magic</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled it off of its post, confused. What in the four clans? Mesmerize was outlawed? How did the king already know what you\u2019ve done? How did he already print out these posters? You knew he had eyes and ears everywhere, but this was ridiculous. Maybe he had a way of detecting whenever somebody performed certain types of spells? Well, overall, this wasn\u2019t good. If the king\u2019s guard were after you, it would be much more difficult to survive the next 24 hours required to permanently enslave Scarlet. Especially when you\u2019ll probably also have her bandits after you, too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, you were feeling a little bit frail and groggy after performing that spell. You might be a little more vulnerable to attacks for a while. <span class=\"cred\">(-2 Body)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take refuge in the inn, trying to use the extra time to plan out your next move. Eventually, over a half hour later, Magna walks into the inn, and Scarlet stumbles in behind her. Scarlet looked exhausted and miserable. She had been battered and bruised, and stunk like a regular fart cushion. You\u2019re a little concerned when you realized she only had 1 health left! <b>\u201cHey! Magna!\u201d</b> You complain. <b>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to do any damage!\u201d</b> If Scarlet dies in the next 24 hours, she\u2019s free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna takes a seat down in front of you, looking happier now that she\u2019s vented her feelings out on the beaten fox. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMy apologies. Things got carried away,\u201d</span> she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the fox sat down next to you and hugged you, a few tears streaming down her face as if she\u2019d been traumatized. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cM-mistress\u2026\u201d</span> She whimpered, hugging you close to her for comfort. You pat her on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThere, there. It's okay. You're safe now,\u201d</b> you reassure her, feeling a little bad. She was a bandit, though, so this was the life she chose. Eventually, Scarlet calmed down a bit after her torture, lying down on the booth and laying her head on your lap as she rested. She was actually quite beautiful, you had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDo not worry. I will ensure the two of you survive the next 24 hours,\u201d</span> Magna nods. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBy the way, you don\u2019t happen to know where Thane is, do you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at her. <b>\u201cUm\u2026 no. I haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d</b> you shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThen it may already be too late for him,\u201d</span> Magna says, leaning back in her chair. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou see, we have an, err, undisclosed opponent in this race, it seems. And I think I may have identified who it might be\u2026\u201d</span> She reached into her bag, and pulled out a little medallion, dropping it on the table. It had a familiar star-like symbol on the front, and it seemed to be cracked into two pieces. You inspected it curiously, not understanding its meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat\u2026 is this?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s Fang\u2019s,\u201d</span> she says, simply. You look up at her, a little stunned. She couldn\u2019t be implying\u2026? <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAn entire village\u2026 most of its people wiped out by stench I can\u2019t even imagine. When asked, the survivors told me a hulking, black wolf was responsible.\u201d</span> She explained, grimly. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI only had the faintest glimpse of him while searching the forests, but\u2026 I feel Fang might still be out there.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d</b> You whispered. <b>\u201cFang died years ago!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou really believe that?\u201d</span> She frowns. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhen great wolf warriors are corrupted by the rot, the rest used to be told that they simply died, or disappeared. Surely, you\u2019ve run into enough exiles to know this is not always the case.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back in your chair, huffing. Fang\u2019s still alive\u2026 overcome by the rot? Slaughtering villages? Spreading madness? It was a lot to take in\u2026 <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWorse, still. I think he has a particular vendetta against Thane,\u201d</span> she explains. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHe probably believes that Thane stole his rightful place as ruler of the wolf clan. Which is why I find it so worrying that nobody seems to have seen nor heard from Thane in a while.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThane was always an annoyance to you, but he was your superior, and you couldn\u2019t let him have who-knows-what kind of torments inflicted on him by a crazy wolf. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI was planning on finding him after I dealt with Scarlet,\u201d</span> Magna concludes. You were a little upset with her. Why didn\u2019t she tell you this earlier? If you had heard about this, you would\u2019ve never wasted your time with all this Scarlet nonsense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, looking at the sleeping vixen who was resting her head on your lap. <b>\u201cWell\u2026 if we go and try to find them\u2026 you know that if I die, Scarlet goes free, right?\u201d</b> You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIf you want to take that risk, I won\u2019t stop you,\u201d</span> she responds, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 2/3<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 (</span><span class=\"cred\">-2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 0<br>\r\nGold: 2<br>\r\nPrestige: 3<br>\r\nRot: 2</span></span></div></div>",

Off the top of your head, you could name twenty wolves, excluding you and Magna, who would do a better job at leading the Wolf Clan. That said, he is your rightful leader. As such, you have a duty to find him, or at least find his body should the worst have happened. <b>\"Well, Thane may still be alive. Even if Fang found him.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna shakes her head, <span class=\"clblue\">\"Fang has already reached the level of Rot required for Corruption. No pure person, even a Hero,<br>\r\n could survive his stench if Fang went all out. I don't think he'd hold back on Thane. Our leader is likely dead.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perk up at that. Did the king's inspectors reach Thane after Magna then? <b>\"Thane is not pure. I was told by the King's inspectors that all of the Wolf Clan champions had been infected.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna pauses and leans back in her seat, <span class=\"clblue\">Then...he hides. He is ashamed. It will be hard to find him. But if what you say is true, he may just be alive.\"</span> She thinks for a moment, then nods. <span class=\"clblue\">\"I will set out at daybreak. Will you be joining me, River? I know you do not like Thane.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have Rot now, but you have not forgotten your duty to the clan. <b>\"Of course I will. Thane may not be a great leader, but we still have an obligation to help him. For the Clan's sake.\"</b> You speak with Magna for a bit longer before deciding to retire for the evening. You bring Scarlet up to your room at the inn and keep your eyes on her. <b>\"So, you'll do anything I say, yes?\"</b> Scarlet nods enthusiastically, happy to have gotten away from Magna. <b>\"Then tell me honestly, were you lying when we spoke back at your little hideout?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet shakes her head, <span class=\"corange\">\"I did not tell a single lie the entire time. I had nothing to do with the death of Magna's son.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a tad guilty upon hearing that. Still, she is a bandit, and probably deserves whatever Magna put her through, even if she didn't commit this one murder. <b>\"You still chose life as a bandit. You still chose to harm innocents for your own gain. You deserve this.\"</b> Scarlet's ears fold back and she whimpers softly when you say that. <b>\"What?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet opens her mouth, then closes it. She seems to be trying to come up with the right words. <span class=\"corange\">\"Mistress, you are of course right that I deserve...any punishment you deem worthy! But...I did not choose to be a bandit. Not at first. And then...someone told me I had to remain one...for the good of Armello.\"</span> That's right...she did say something about having been enslaved earlier. And she can't actually lie to you now. You look over the beautiful vixen in front of you. She avoids looking you in the eye, no doubt because she feels inferior to you under the spell's effects. Damn this is hot...you are curious about what she's talking about, but the longer you look at her, the more you want her to lick your paws, or eat you out...</span></div></div>",

Even if she\u2019s not responsible for this murder in particular, many others have been killed by her clan during her reign. Hell, the bandits guarding her compound would\u2019ve even killed you if they had the chance. She had blood on her hands. You\u2019re sure she went through hardships in her life that drove her to her life of crime. But you\u2019ve also endured many struggles, and you\u2019ve never turned to heinous banditry. <b>\u201cWell, that\u2019s all behind you, now. From now on, you\u2019ll be working for the TRUE good of Armello. Got it?\u201d</b> You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYes, mistress!\u201d</span> She smiled up at you, as if excited, her tail wagging behind her. \u2018Mistress\u2019... for some reason, you get a little excited every time she calls you that. She was quite gorgeous, and as you looked at her, fantasies couldn\u2019t help but fill your head. Could you really be attracted to her? You\u2019ve\u2026 never really been interested in other women before. But then again, you\u2019ve hardly been interested in anyone sexually in your entire life. It seems the rot has been taking the liberty of \u2018opening your mind\u2019. Now, you couldn\u2019t help but find a gal like Scarlet irrestisble\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts from your head for a time, you get ready for a long night\u2019s rest. It was nice to sleep in a proper bed sometimes, rather than a hammock deep in the forest. She definitely didn\u2019t seem to mind seeing you naked, so you basically acted like she wasn\u2019t there, slipping out of your armor and bathing beneath the chilly water that dripped down from a bucket above the showerhead. Just because you were infected with the rot didn\u2019t mean you had to abandon good hygiene. Eventually, you climbed into bed wearing a simple cotton shirt, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were finished bathing, Scarlet seemed to figure you\u2019d appreciate it if she did the same. She didn\u2019t seem to mind you occasionally glancing at her while she undressed. When she took off her dress, she revealed that she was actually quite a bit fluffier than you had expected. Eventually, though, once all her other clothes were off, she went to remove her talisman\u2026 only for you to gasp at the sudden stench! Even from over on the bed, it stung your nostrils! <b>\u201cUrgh!\u201d</b> You say, clamping a paw over your nose and waving to her. <b>\u201cPut it\u2026 back on\u2026!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSorry, mistress!\u201d</span> She whimpered an apology, immediately sliding the talisman back around her neck. Once the stench dissipated, you decided to relax and try to read a book you found in the nightstand to keep yourself distracted from your lecherous thoughts. After bathing, Scarlet had to spend a long time drying off all of her fluff, but eventually, she emerged, a smile on her face, wearing nothing but the talisman. You gawked at her body while she turned the lights off and climbed into bed beside you. She let out a happy coo as you let her cuddle up against you, feeling the incredible warmth and softness of her fluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been a day or two since you\u2019ve \u2018blown off some steam\u2019, and the rot has been causing an aching need to slowly grow in your loins. Would it really be ethical to, er, do anything with her, though? After all, she was hypnotized. Then again, she did seem very enthusiastic, and eager to please you in any way she could. She smiles and wags her tail every since time you even pay attention to her. You figure it would probably make her very, very happy to be able to prove herself to you. <b>\u201cYou k-know\u2026 if you\u2019re interested, there is\u2026 <i>one</i> way you could serve me,\u201d</b> you offered, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you blankly for a moment, before realizing what you were asking. Her tail immediately started wagging, and a smile dawned on her face. You shuddered, your heart leaping in your chest went she suddenly leaned forward and planted a quick kiss on your lips! <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, mistress. I thought you\u2019d never ask~\u201d</span> With surprising eagerness, the vixen suddenly disappeared beneath the covers, and you could only watch as her form snaked its way around beneath the covers, until she was propped up between your legs. She giggled and purred as she planted little kisses up along the inside of your thighs, making your way towards your womanhood. She didn\u2019t seem to mind the rotten stench down there; in fact, she enjoyed your powerful musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the suspense build for a moment\u2026 but eventually just lazily pressing your tongue up against the folds of your sex. You shivered at the warmth of her tongue. She just sort of left it where it was for a while, not moving at all, letting the anticipation build up in your chest until you were whimpering for more. Eventually, just when you couldn\u2019t take it anymore, she started moving her tongue painfully slowly, exploring every part of your sex. Soon, she\u2019s moving faster\u2026 and faster\u2026 and faster\u2026 until soon, she\u2019s attacking your clit with her tongue, turning you into a panting, shivering mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, she stops\u2026 and soon, she\u2019s back to moving her tongue painfully slowly again. Eventually, you figure out her technique; letting the anticipation build until you couldn\u2019t take it anymore, before gradually building up to a few moments of \u2018payoff\u2019 before slowing down again. The slow movements had the dual purpose of helping get you used to the feeling of another woman\u2019s tongue exploring your most intimate region. All the while, she was giggling and whispering to you, telling you how beautiful and perfect she thought you were. This certainly wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried on with this until she felt you were getting tired of it, before working eagerly on your clit, this time not relenting for a moment, feeling you whimper and shiver as she quickly works you towards orgasm. Eventually, you squeeze your furry thighs down around your head as your entire body is rocked by ecstasy, experiencing, well, probably the best orgasm you\u2019ve ever experienced in your life. You bite your lip, trying as hard as you can not to cry out and alert the other patrons; which, with your sharp fangs, was probably a bad idea, because your lip started bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she lifts up the covers, revealing herself, a big smile on her face as she\u2019s panting between your legs. She looks concerned, however, when she notices your lip bleeding. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cO-oh no! Did I hurt you, mistress?\u201d</span> She frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a little confused, until you notice you notice what you\u2019d done. <b>\u201cOh, no no no! That was\u2026 well, amazing!\u201d</b> She perks up in awe as she sees you smile for the very first time. It was a small smile, but it was enough for her, and she was practically jumping in joy. With an amused snort, you climb up out of bed, stil shaking a little bit as you hurry over to the bathroom to wash your lip\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you emerge, to find Scarlet lying in bed with a big smile, waiting for you. Without hesitation, you climb in and cuddle up with the fluffy vixen, as the two of you drift off into a restful sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, you and Scarlet were sitting in the foyer having breakfast together while you wait for Magna to wake up. She seemed to like asking you about your life as a ranger, and while you were quite a private person, you were happy to answer some of her questions. Eventually, though, you noticed a squirrel sitting in a nearby booth, a big newspaper covering his face. When you stared at him, he suddenly dropped the newspaper, revealing that it was indeed the courier! <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, hey, River! Funny meeting you here!\u201d</span> He said, eagerly walking up to your booth. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI was just thinking about you! Your clan\u2019s been talking about all the provisions you need!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow. <b>\u201cWere you\u2026 stalking me?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses a paw against his chest, as if shocked you\u2019d even ask. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat? No! Why, I\u2019d never do such a thing!\u201d</span> He crosses his heart. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBut since we happened to run into eachother again, I think you\u2019d appreciate some provisions, no?\u201d</span> You sigh. What is up with this guy and provisions? <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, yeah! By the way, Scarlet. You are owed provisions, too, but you\u2019ll only be able to claim them if you ever recover from your hypnosis.\u201d</span> Scarlet nods, but you\u2019re a little taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWait, you deliver to other heroes, too?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh, yes! Every hero, every morning,\u201d</span> he said simply. You were stunned. How can he deliver to heroes all over Armello, every single morning? How did he even know where you all were? <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBut anyway, enough about that. So, about those provisions\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUgh! Fine, I\u2019ll take some provisions!\u201d</b> You sigh, confused and frustrated.

No, that wouldn't explain why he's giving you so many provisions to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courier giggles a bit, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Sorry, Miss River, that's a trade secret! I can't tell you anything about how I know or do things, nor can I spoil any secrets from the other Heroes. At least, not without a great price. One that your nose is NOT ready to pay! I can tell you, however,<br>\r\n that you really should duck!\"</span> Given that this squirrel hasn't done anything to harm you so far, you do so. Seconds later, some armed ruffian goes sailing over your head and crashes into the wall! <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Howdy Miss Magna! Looks like you accidentally sprung the trap Miss Elyssia set for River here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he runs up to the other wolfess to hand her her own daily provisions, you continue to just stare at him. <b>\"How...you...I...wait...I thought you couldn't-\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cuts you off, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I said I can't spoil their secrets! It isn't exactly a secret now, is it?

Still, he seems trustworthy. Even if he gives spells I cannot cast sometimes. Here, I will trade you for one of those Wyldsap cards. Give the other to the murderer. She does not deserve it, but it will keep her here.\"</span> She shows you the card in her hand. Dark Influence? It...holy hell...it gives the user +1 Rot AND gives them a random Rot spell!? You happily agree to the trade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swap cards, Magna immediately pays for the sap, then stows it away for later. You do the same with the Wyldsap you have left and hand it to Scarlet. <b>\"Here, drink this. It should keep you from keeling over on us.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet looks about ready to burst into tears of joy. A present from her Mistress!? She happily chugs it down, and you watch in awe as all her bruises magically start to heal! <span class=\"corange\">\"Thank you so much, Mistress! You're so kind, and thoughtful, and beautiful~\"</span> She giggles at you and you again can't resist a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then return to your breakfast, and Magna joins you. As the three of you eat, you learn that Magna eats about as much as a family of four on her own. Well, you guess she has to keep that mountain of a body up somehow. Once breakfast is over with, the three of you leave the inn. <span class=\"clblue\">\"So...this Elyssia woman. She is a Rabbit Chamion. Why does she wish to harm you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of what you did to her comes back to you. <b>\"Well...she helped a bunch of felines enslave one of our villages. Built a wall around it so nobody could get out. Then she called me disgusting, and I decided to show her just how disgusting I am.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna nods, <span class=\"clblue\">\"It is truly a dark time in Armello. Even the Rabbits are ignoring treaties. We must find Thane quickly. Those lamps that you and the murderer have. They show you things, yes? How far?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, <b>\"I can only see heroes in the general area. I only noticed you and Scarlet were here after I had entered the town myself.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna frowns at that, <span class=\"clblue\">\"Then we will have to rely on rumors. See what you can find.\"</span> Luckily, rumors seem to be aplenty in this town, just like any other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak to a refugee who brings up that skunk Bane again.

He couldn't identify them for you, but this sounds like a <span class=\"cdorange\">Fight Challenge</span> if you've ever heard one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old fortuneteller tells you about a crystal deep within a city half-sunk in a swamp. Said crystal would allow you to see anything you desire, but it will only work once per person. Of course, the swamps are still foul and full of rot, so this would definitely qualify as a <span class=\"clred\">Body Chalenge.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you overhear a couple of guards talking about a scuffle in the forests. Apparently a member of the Wolf Clan had done battle with a Champion of the Rabbit Clan there.

More notably, though; apparently, it was keeping other heroes as prisoners. You had assumed that banes were the mindless manifestations of the rot, with no sentience of cognisance, dedicated only to spreading chaos. What motivation could one possibly have to be keeping heroes alive? You were curious to find out. You were also shuddering at the image of what their torments must be like at the hands of a creature made of pure rot. Not even the worst criminals in Armello deserve such a fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing causing you to hesitate is that you have very low health, and the consequences for being defeated by a bane can be\u2026 severe. Still, if you let Magna handle most of the battling while you maybe fire some arrows at it, you can probably take it down. Scarlet probably won\u2019t be much help; her hypnosis reduces her fight by 3 points, effectively making her useless in battle. Besides, you don\u2019t want to risk her dying and being freed. You discuss all these thoughts and plans to Magna, and she seems to agree, the two of you resolving to trek out at the earliest possible convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to have to put a pin in that, though, as you can faintly hear an ominous roar in the distance.

You peeked out the window of the inn, only for your heart to sink when you notice fires in the distance. <b>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\u201d</b> you said, you voice shivering a bit as you rushed over to the table and grabbed your bow. <b>\u201cI think something\u2019s terrorizing the village!\u201d</b> Glancing out the window, Magna and Scarlet quickly saw what you meant, grabbed their weapons, and followed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you quickly made your way to the other end of the settlement, more plumes of smoke appeared as more structures were set ablaze. Villagers rushed all around you in the opposite direction, as if fleeing from something. You expect bandits or a bane, so when you finally make it to the blazing part of town, you\u2019re shocked when you discover the culprit; a member of the king\u2019s guard! The armored wolf is rushed around with incredible speed and strength, slaughtering villagers indiscriminately and setting builders on fire with his torch. The town\u2019s guards try bravely to stop him, only to be easily cleaved in twain. His ruthless efficiency and lack of mercy are chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Magna, grimly. <b>\u201cDark times in Armello, indeed,\u201d</b> you said. After all, what could these villagers possibly have done to deserve being massacred by their own ruler? All three of you knew instantly that you had to put a stop to this. The only problem was, the king\u2019s guards were pretty tough. Like, to put it into perspective, on average, they are about as strong and athletic as you are at your base level. Still, with command over the rot, you are both definitely powerful enough to put a stop to him single-handedly. So.. who should be the one to lead the attack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna would definitely tank his wild blows and strike him down, but then she\u2019d end up outlawed. You doubt the slayer of countless bandits would want to become an outlaw herself. On the other hand, while you had low health, you did have that Dark Influence card. Perhaps you could get a rot spell that would help you dispatch of the guard with greater ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 2/3<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 (</span><span class=\"cred\">-2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 0<br>\r\nGold: 4<br>\r\nPrestige: 3<br>\r\nRot: 2</span></span></div></div>",

Over here, flea-ridden cur!\"</b> The guard turns to you, and you immediately let your arrow fly! Right on target, the arrow slides right in the eye slit in the guard's helmet and pierces his right eye! The guard howls in pain and falls to one knee momentarily. You're abut to draw your sword and attack, but Magna rushes at him with surprising speed for a wolf of her size. She slams her shield into the wolf man as hard as she can, and actually manages to shove the arrow further in!

He was wearing a regular tunic with a blue cap, and a big, blue hat. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cMoof Grebble, at your service!\u201d</span> He smiled, as if excited to serve such legendary heroes. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cLong-time Magical Apprentice!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow, but decide it can\u2019t hurt to have more help. You get down on one knee in front of him, so you\u2019re at about eye-level. <b>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</b> You ask. <b>\u201cWhat kind of spells can you cast?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems a little embarrassed. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cW-well\u2026 I can\u2019t really cast any spells by myself yet. But!\u201d</span> He points out. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cI can help you cast spells you find in scrolls!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little disappointing\u2026 but whatever. <b>\u201cAlright. Well\u2026 guess you couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</b> He seemed to be a little grossed out by how the two of you smelled, but he tried not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you finally trek away from town, a few people cheering as you walk by, knowing you\u2019ve rescued the settlement from being completely terrorized. While the king may not be happy with you, you\u2019ve won some favor with the people. Still, you unfortunately had to journey far, far away from civilization, into the darkest, most tainted lands of Armello, near the king\u2019s castle. Late that evening, your little travelling party finally makes it; nearby, you can spot an ancient fortress built atop a stone hill, with huge cracks in the ground emanating with dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at Felbear Keep! These dungeons were the sources of the rot. If a bane was anywhere, they\u2019d be here. One thing concerned you, though. <b>\u201cYou think, if we need to be revived, all this rot might\u2026 \u2018interfere\u2019 with our clan\u2019s magic?\u201d</b> You asked. Magna only grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMost definitely,\u201d</span> she said, grimly. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWe\u2019ve never faced a creature as foul and wretched as a Bane before. We must tread cautiously. If it defeats us here, I fear it will have\u2026 permanent consequences.\u201d</span> You sigh, realizing the truth of her words. Apparently, three other heroes are already permanently imprisoned here; this may be the end of the line for you, too. You go through the gear you\u2019ve obtained, trying to think of something that can help you. Eventually, now that your magic\u2019s been restored, you decide to dabble in the Dark Influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThink you can help me cast this?\u201d</b> You show the scroll to Moof Grebble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shudders at the sight, realizing what you\u2019re asking him to do. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cT-that\u2019s dark magic!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him, blankly. <b>\u201cMhmm. I am aware.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked very hesitant and frightened\u2026 but since you were kind enough to recruit him, he supposes he can\u2019t turn you down. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cO-okay. I\u2019ll give it a shot\u2026\u201d</span> He seems uncomfortable, but together, you perform the ritual. He really did make it easier on you; it was an exhausting process, and you doubt you would\u2019ve been able to perform this spell on your own. Eventually, though, it was completely\u2026 and you let out a gasp and a shudder as dark energy flowed through your veins! Your eyes became darker, and your stench intensified until you were as smelly as Magna was! The pig had to pinch his nose, gagging at the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your paws, feeling\u2026 powerful. Energized. Horny. Before you could deal with all that, though, you notice another scroll seemingly be torn from the dark rift of some other dimension. Reading it, you noticed its title - Rotten Fog. Apparently, it allows you to pool 2 points of rot into a single fart, creating a cloud of gas so foul it can kill, and so pervasive it can spread for miles. You cackled at the thought! An impressive spell indeed\u2026 but not one that would be useful right now. You tuck it away in your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it was back to planning your assault. Magna seemed to have a strange amount of knowledge on the Keep. The way she sees it, you can either head up the hill to the main entrance, where the Bane might be living\u2026 or head through one of the many other entrances scattered around, which lead down into the sprawling underground catacombs. Both will probably end up leading you to the Bane, but the different paths may hold different treasures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 2/3<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+3</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 (</span><span class=\"cred\">-2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 0<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nPrestige: 4<br>\r\nRot: 3</span></span></div></div>",

I say we search the catacombs for a weapon of some sort before going to confront it.\"</b> Magna doesn't disagree with you, Scarlet can't disagree with you, and Moof knows he doesn't have enough clout in this group yet to sway your decisions. So with that, the three of you set off into one of the side paths leading into the catacombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you step inside, the four of you wrinkle your noses, and Moof nearly falls over. It reeks in here! No doubt, the Bane is definitely calling this place home! You only hope that this isn't a huge risk for no reason, and that Thane really is one of the Heroes who's been captured by this thing. As you all venture inside the place, you keep your eyes peeled for any sort of treasure. You manage to snag yourself a few gold pieces, (+3 Gold) but for the most part, this place appears to be picked clean! Hell, the looting job is so thorough that you are now certain that at least one of the Heroes trapped in here is the famous treasure hunter from the Rabbit Clan, Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to give up on finding anything when the four of you come across an unopened chest. Closer inspection reveals a soft, purple glow coming from inside it. There's no lock, but you can't seem to pry it open! Magna tries as well, but even she can't force the chest to open up! <b>\"Hm...It's probably sealed by magic. Any ideas, Moof?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig looks very nervous about that chest, <span class=\"cpink\">\"A-aside from you leaving it alone? Whatever is inside is clearly a Rot relic. You'll need sufficient rot to open it, so...maybe have your fox touch it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet seems very happy that Moof referred to her as your fox, and she also seems eager to help! You shrug and motion her over. It couldn't hurt to at least try! Lo and behold, the instant Scarlet touches the box, you hear a click from inside! The chest opens up to reveal a pair of faintly glowing boots inside. Moof gulps and takes a step back. <span class=\"cpink\">\"T-those are Rotboots. They make your paws reek like crazy! A-and every twelve hours you wear them builds up a smell basically equal to two Rot points!\"</span> That sounds useful! Though it won't be much help in the current scenario.

By the four clans, just taking a single whiff of its stench, even from this distance, was offensive to your nostrils! You all shuddered a bit, realizing just how foul the beast itself must be, but nevertheless hide in the various corners of the catacombs and ready your weapons. What comes lumbering down the hall chills you to your core. It seemed like a huge, anthropomorphic skunk. Its glew bright purple, and most of its body was obscured by a swirling cloud of dark power. It was snarling like an untamed beast, its eyes betraying the fact that the only thoughts that went through its head was how to better spread chaos and rot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly one of the most abominable creatures you laid eyes on. Worse, its stench was atrocious, even from a distance! You could hardly imagine what it would be like for someone pinned under its butt or something. You all tried not to gag and reveal your positions as it wandered by, evidently searching for you judging by the way it sniffed along the ground. You and Magna look at eachother, and decide to attack while it was still unaware of your presence. With that, you quietly readied your bow\u2026 but the bane was alerted by the sound of you pulled back the string. Just as it turned its head, however, you fired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast howled a chilling roar as the arrow plunged into its side. Instead of blood, a big puff of a strange, noxious purple smoke gusted out of the wound. Once it recovered from the pain, it turned to you, snarling, rearing back and preparing to attack\u2026 only for Magna to suddenly rush forward, bashing it in the side with her shield! It was knocked back, its claws tearing cracks in the floor, as it tries not to lose its balance\u2026 but eventually, it comes to a stop. It snarls as it looks between you and Manga, as if trying to decide who to destroy first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna could easily deflect any conventional attack\u2026 but the Bane\u2019s attacks were anything but conventional! In a moment, the giant skunk flipped around and lifted its tail, and Manga only had half a second to brace herself before she was suddenly consumed by a noxious blast of purple gas. It was the most foul smell she\u2019d ever endured in her life, by far! She immediately shuddered to the ground, her shield completely useless against its flatulence. Now that she\u2019s stunned, the skunk can easily whip around and slap her with its tail, sending her flying into the nearby concrete wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagna falls to the floor, her body leaving a big imprint in the concrete wall. She was dazed, but not yet defeated. Still, she had taken a lot more damage than you would\u2019ve expected from that single hit. Quickly, you realized that it wasn\u2019t just that hit; the beast\u2019s flatulence was so foul, it actually managed to do damage to her! You were horrified at the possibility of your life being ended by a single, vile fart. Luckily, the beast seemed to have taken some damage already, so just a couple more attacks will fell it. With a grimace, you aim your bow again, and fire it into the skunk\u2019s other side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk roars as it turns its attention away from Magna, towards you. Your blood ran cold when it turned and lifted its tail again. You don\u2019t have time to flee before a devastatingly loud and powerful burst of gas jiggled it cheeks as it broke free, absolutely devastating your nostrils! This stench was so foul, it was actually physically agonizing! You\u2019ve been stabbed in the gut before, and that was less painful than the feeling of the Bane\u2019s stench worming its way up through the nostrils, seemingly into your skull. You were stunned for a moment, stumbling backwards, as if you had just sustained a mortal blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t take another hit! You were too weak! But the Bane seemed dead set on destroying you, so all that was left was to flee. It was much faster than you, though, sprinting on all fours on incredible speed. You thought you were dead meat\u2026 until Scarlet suddenly jumps inbetween you! <span class=\"corange\">\u201cH-hey! Leave her alone, you mongrel!\u201d</span> She said, waving her sword around. Her mesmerization made her too weak to actually do any damage to the skunk, but it was certainly enough to distract him for a while! With an unamused glare, the Bane simply knocked her onto the ground with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified! You had gotten somewhat attached to Scarlet after last night, and didn\u2019t want her getting hurt! Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t have a chance to call her back before the skunk turned around and plopped its big butt right on top of her. It stuck its tongue out, enjoying her squirms as it unleashes a torrent of the foulest gas in Armello onto the squirming fox. You couldn\u2019t imagine how absolutely hellish it must be beneath it! She wouldn\u2019t last long under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, at this point, you only had to attack the bane once more to defeat it. You reach for your bow\u2026 only to realize you dropped it while you were fleeing from the bane! You could go and grab it again, but it would quicker to just go stab the skunk with your sword! That would be the riskier option, of course, but you had no idea how much time Scarlet had left under there. The Bane didn\u2019t seem the have the slightest sense of mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 1/3<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+3</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 (</span><span class=\"cred\">-2</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 0<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nPrestige: 4<br>\r\nRot: 3</span></span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, your assault isn't quite fast enough. The skunk sees you coming and manages to leap off of Scarlet and out of the way. Scarlet has been spared, but now the Bane is focused on you. You get ready to swing again, only for the Bane to spin around, smacking you against the wall with its tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drop to your knees after that hit, you look up just in time to see a horrifying sight.

The Bane is entirely focused on her too, so she can't catch it off guard either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, both Magna and the Bane have failed to notice that Scarlet had been freed from the spell.

The moment her sword touches the bane, draining it of the last of its health, you\u2019re freed from the Bane\u2019s hypnosis\u2026 but on the other hand, you still have 0 health. So\u2026 you die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn death, you are rocked by spiritual visions of the Wyld. You can\u2019t really interpret what any of it means, but some of it seems to be oddly prophetic. It not only shows you glimpses of the heroes you\u2019ve met so far, but those you\u2019ll meet in the future, along with foreshadowing which you\u2019re going to befriend and which you\u2019re going to end up slaying. You don\u2019t know if this was truly a Wyld vision, though, or just some sort of surreal fever dream. There was no point in trying to interpret these prophecies, anyway. Whatever happens, happens\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, you feel your spirit get pulled from the astral plane and sucked back into a physical form. It was unpleasant, really, like being pulled from a huge, free field, and locked away in a tight little cell. You\u2019d almost rather stay dead. But whatever, you had a job to do. The moment you\u2019re plopped back into your old form, you gasp loudly, your eyes flying open to find yourself naked in bed, in some kind of hospital room. Compared to the dungeon, it was nice to have a little fresh air. You can only wonder how Magna and Scarlet are doing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around, looking through a window to see doctors wearing\u2026 gas masks? Suddenly, you realize how absolutely powerful your stench was now. It must fill the entire room! You climb up groggily out of bed, stumbling over a mirror, and looked into your eyes. You were immediately a little alarmed. Your iris was\u2026 pure black! You part some fur on your arms, looking at your corrupted veins. They were pumping with glowing purple, dark energy! There was no doubt about it; you\u2019ve been completely corrupted by the rot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, one of the doctors steps into the room\u2026 only to find you completely missing! He can still smell you in here, but he can\u2019t see you, no matter where he looks\u2026 until eventually, you suddenly drop down on him from the ceiling, pinning him to the floor! He let's out a muffled yelp, looking up at your crazed, horny eyes. You were corrupted by the rot, now, and the wolf knew your darkest impulses had considerable sway over you. <b>\u201cMm! Hey there, handsome!\u201d</b> You said, straddling him on the floor, wrapping your arms behind your head. He was dressed in thick armor and a mask; you are as naked as the day you were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s silent beneath you, feeling a strange mixture of turned on and terrified. <b>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re the strong, silent type, huh? I like that!\u201d</b> You taunted. It was like you were a completely different person! Before, you were stoic and emotionless; now, you were overcome by the passion of the rot. <b>\u201cSo you\u2019re a doctor? Well, doc, I think I\u2019m coming down with the most horrible of maladies; excessive thirst!\u201d</b> While you pinned him to the ground, you started undoing his shirt. <b>\u201cThe only cure is some big, strong alpha wolf bending me over the bed and rutting me like his bitch. Thing you might be up to the task?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can faintly see his eyes peering up at you from beneath his mask\u2019s goggles. He was an odd mix of terrified and aroused. On one hand, one of the most beautiful and legendary heroes in the clan was lusting after him. On the other, she was only doing it because she was overcome by the Rot! Then again, his dick\u2019s argument seemed more eloquent than his brain\u2019s, so he really had no choice. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cS-sure,\u201d</span> he muttered, unable to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you suddenly tear his clothes to shreds with your claws, leaving bits of fabric scattered all over the ground! <b>\u201cFannntastic, then!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, another doctor walks into the room, glancing at a clipboard and doing some routine checks\u2026 only to find his colleague bending you over the bed, his balls slapping against your ass as he rutted you like mad! The room was soundproof, so he hadn\u2019t heard your loud, shameless screams and moans as the other canine pounded into you. The other doctor immediately froze in shock, his clipboard falling from his hands and loudly clanging against the ground. This caught your attention, and you glanced over at him with a smirk on your face, still panting as the other wolf dominated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh! Feeling jealous, big boy? Don\u2019t worry, you can go next~\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the hospital bed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, drowsily, to see one of the wolf doctors looming over you, checking your vital. Your heart immediately leaped in your chest, remembering the previous events. <b>\u201cW-what happened?\u201d</b> You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cYou got up, saw yourself in the mirror, and immediately fainted,\u201d</span> the wolf shrugged his shoulders, nonchalantly. You consider how this was possible for a moment\u2026 before letting out a sigh of relief! You hadn\u2019t really banged every single doctor here! That had all been a dream! The hottest dream you\u2019ve ever had, sure, but still just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the night with the doctors, re-orienting yourself to your new body. Using the Wyld, they crafted a whole new body for you every time you perished; and since you\u2019ve signed your soul over to your clan, they were able to just plop it into your new body whenever you needed it. They got you fitted with another ranger outfit, and early that morning, they let you get back to work. You stumbled out of the clan grounds, thinking about everything that\u2019s happened. Well, might as well get your head in the game. You were basically back to where you started, except this time, you had much better stats, gear, and a much better knowledge of how Armello worked nowadays. You were intending to make the most of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the distance, you spot that damn squirrel walking up to you. <b>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d</b> You muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he waddles up to you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, hey, hey! Good to see you again, River!\u201d</span> He gives you a big, toothy grin. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI just wanted you to know that you are-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019m entitled to provisions,\u201d</b> you say, <b>\u201cbut right now, I think I\u2019d rather have an EXPLANATION for how you keep finding me!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares up at you, blankly, as if not knowing that you\u2019re so concerned about. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUm\u2026 just by coincidence?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him. <b>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, if something\u2019s coincidental enough, it\u2019s, like, indistinguishable from magic!\u201d</span> He shrugged with a little chuckle. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cGood job with that Bane, anyway! Those three heroes you rescued have been returned to their clan grounds, safe and sound.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, taking a sit on a nearby tree stump. The squirrel\u2019s secrecy was\u2026 frustrated, but you suppose he\u2019s an ally. <b>\u201c... was Thane among them?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThat, I cannot tell you,\u201d</span> he wags a finger, before excitedly presenting his bag. He jiggles it around a bit, and it noisily jostles with its contents. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat I CAN do is offer you two new provisions!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+5</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nPrestige: 4<br>\r\nRot: 5</span></span></div></div>",

At least, not without Scarlet to help carry it, but given that she isn't here, you figure that time hadn't run out before you were beaten. Speaking of, you see a short pig man scurry up to you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Miss River! Miss River! I hope you weren't planning on leaving without me! Right after your fox stabbed that skunk thing, there was this big flash of light and I was suddenly surrounded by wolves! I thought I was going to be eaten for sure! But then the showed me to a room and let me stay while they brought you back! There was another wolf they were restoring too. He left about...two hours ago? He and I talked a bit when he found out I was with you. He wanted me to tell you that he owes you, Miss Magna, and your fox a favor each!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, so Thane is okay after all. You're about to ask if he knows what became of Scarlet and Magna, but the courier clears his throat. <b>\"Oh! Right. Moof, we'll speak in a moment. This man is on a bit of a tight schedule...I think?\"</b> The squirrel nods, and you think back on what you want. You suppose it couldn't hurt to TRY a trickery or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courier can practically read your mind, and he holds out two documents. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Here you are! Hand this document with a bit of gold to the nearest city official, and you can knock some prestige off the Hero of your choice! The other is a Thieves' Guild document. Show that in the right place, and you can hire a thief to snag an item off another Hero!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pocket the documents. They seem a bit underhanded, but at this point, how much more stained can your honor get? That prestige lowering one could prove invaluable...if you can figure out who the current Prestige Leader is. Speaking of... <b>\"By the way...last time we spoke, you mentioned that there WAS a price I could pay for information on Heroes, but that my nose wouldn't handle it. Well, as you see...I'm corrupted now.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel looks you over and strokes his chin, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oh yeah, you only had two points of Rot last time we met! Well...I still don't think you're ready to pay the price for that kind of information, buuut...\"</span> He leans in close and whispers to you, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"You've basically gotta be my stink slave for half a day. And well...let's just say that if I didn't have a ring that works like Scarlet's necklace...you'd be wishing you were still snout deep in that skunk monster's ass.

You doubt he\u2019s even smelled a Bane before. He may have some exceptional powers, but you doubt stench is among them. Besides, the more Rot that flows through your veins, the more your nostrils are desensitized to foul smells. Overall, you weren\u2019t intimidated by him in the slightest. Your only hesitation was that being his slave would waste half of a precious day. However, if you were able to knock the prestige leader down a peg, it would be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, strange little rodent,\u201d</b> you said, taking a knee in front of him, completely unafraid. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll take your wager.\u201d</b> He looks quite excited to finally find someone who says \u2018yes\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAlright, miss River! Just know that there\u2019s no turning back now\u2026\u201d</span> He says, almost giddy with excitement as he lifts up a paw and pulls off his ring. Just a half second after he slides it off, you are suddenly assaulted by an unbelievably vile stench! Black magic runs through his veins, and his eyes turn black and glowing purple as a sinister smile dawns on his face. By the four clans, he was more rotten than you could\u2019ve ever imagined! He must have at least 10 points in Rot! You were about to protest, but the squirrel snapped his fingers, and suddenly your hands were tied behind your back, and some tape appeared over your mouth! He must have some kind of spell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll start ya off slow!\u201d</span> He giggled, amused by the sight of the noble hero restrained before him. He plopped himself down, propping his feet up. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t ya start by sniffing my boots?\u201d</span> You sigh, knowing that, since you agreed to be his slave, by Armello\u2019s law you had little other choice. You hesitated, before leaning forwards and taking the tiniest sniff. Ugh! Even though he had his boots on, the smell of his paws still seared your nostrils, making you gasp and gag in pain and disgust! You couldn\u2019t even imagine what they smelled like when he took his boots off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou call that a sniff? C\u2019mon, you\u2019re supposed to be a warrior! You can do better than that!\u201d</span> He teased, wriggling his paws a bit. You growl, gritting your teeth, before leaning forward and taking another, bigger sniff. This one fried your brain just as hard, but you were able to bear it now. He didn\u2019t seem satisfied, so you just kept sniffing, always feeling like you were on the verge of throwing up as your nose was assault by the muffled stench of his sweaty paw pads. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh! It\u2019s nice to be the one getting pampered for a change. Man, being a courier\u2019s hard work. It gives you a lot of funny stories to tell, though! In fact, just last Thursday I\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a ridiculous amount of time having you worship his smelly boots, while he droned on and on about all the adventures he\u2019s had as a courier. Most of his stories were fairly boring and mundane, and whenever they were interested, his disorganizing and rambling way of speaking left you confused. Eventually, you just tuned him out and focused on your task. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey! Have you even been listening?\u201d</span> The squirrel eventually pouted, and you looked up at him, caught off-guard. He shook his head, crossing his arms. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSuch a disrespectful slave. In fact\u2026 why don\u2019t you take a whiff of this?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, and suddenly yanked his boots off! You held your breath, staring hesitantly at his bare, sweaty little paws. Even though you weren\u2019t breathing, you could feel the stench coming off of them. The squirrel had a disturbing grin on his face as he excitedly anticipating you taking a sniff. With extreme hesitation, you leaned forward and sniffed his paw pads\u2026 only to practically cry out of in pain! He was right; his paws made that bane\u2019s ass smell like febreze in comparison! The stench worked its way up to your brain, and you were gasped and panting in agony as it felt like it melted away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, the squirrel slipped his boots back on. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cY\u2019see why I wear boots, now?\u201d</span> He taunted you, as you slowly calmed down, trying to meditate your way through the pain. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTired of sniffing my paws, huh? Well, you should probably have a lie-down. Sitting on the ground\u2019s getting a little uncomfortable.\u201d</span> You sigh in relief, thinking he was giving you a break. You lied on your back on the ground, still tied up, but enjoying the fresh air\u2026 only to open your eyes and see the squirrel\u2019s butt hovering above your face! In that terrifying instant, you suddenly realized what he had meant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yelp as he plopped his butt down on your face. Squirrels were small, but bottom-heavy, so your face was pretty thoroughly smothered beneath his rear. Luckily, he had his trousers on, or you assume his butt would kill you in seconds, just like his paws would. Still, it smelled absolutely terrible beneath him, and you couldn\u2019t but whimper and squirm as he wriggled his big butt on your face, getting comfortable. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHuh! You actually make a pretty comfy chair! I\u2019m impressed,\u201d</span> he says. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, I gotta take notes of all the provisions handed out today, so we may be here a while\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he pulls out a little journal and starts writing. Meanwhile, you were pinned beneath him, forced to breath in the stale air beneath his sweaty, fluffy butt. It was gross, but at least it wasn\u2019t painful. At least, not yet, anyway! Eventually, your entire body shuddered when the squirrel passed a bit of gas! It just the tiniest, quietest fart, and still it stunk just as foul as his paws did, even through his jeans! <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOops! Excuse me!\u201d</span> He giggled as your yells of pain were muffled beneath his rump. With that, he went back to writing, using you as a glorified chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you spent the next few hours being used a chair or paw worshipper, occasionally getting farted on, or worse, having to sniff his paws with his boots off. You could tell that he could kill you with his stench in an instant if he wanted to, but he was usually holding back. Even still, you could slowly feel your consciousness slip away, as his stench does more and more damage to your addled mind. You were quite rotten yourself, which was the only thing saving you so far. Still, as noon approaches, you wonder if you\u2019ll be able to survive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 1/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+5</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nPrestige: 4<br>\r\nRot: 5</span></span></div></div>",

You know you were woefully under-prepared for this challenge. He could kill you in an instant, and yet...he isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticks on...only five minutes left!

Then again, being the prestige leader might attract unsavory attention from other heroes attempting a prestige victory\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just a risk you had to take. You turned in the document as well as a couple gold coins to an official, essentially bribing him to spread nasty rumors about Griotte. That would surely knock her down a peg\u2026 but you still probably aren\u2019t the prestige leader. You had to focus on gaining a ton of prestige today! Then, you could choose tomorrow's declaration, so you didn\u2019t have to keep dealing with the fallouts of the other hero\u2019s choices. Speaking of which, just why is Mercurio on Wolf Clan territory? You don\u2019t want his greedy fingers anywhere near your clan. He must be up to something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you knew these grounds like the back of your paw, so you knew just who to go to to find out the latest rumors. Apparently, Mercurio is here representing the rat clan for some kind of\u2026 charity event? You heard that there were talks nearby, so you decided to stop by the charity and event and see what\u2019s going on. When it was time to say his piece, the audience immediately seemed to be charmed by his demeanor, handsome and refined appearance, and alluring accent. You didn\u2019t understand it, though. To you, he seemed like most rats; smug, smarmy and untrustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out of the event without hearing any evidence that he\u2019s committing any wrong-doing however, so you decide you might as well not bother him. Later, just as you\u2019re about to walk into one of your favorite old bakeries, though, you notice him walking out. Much unlike how he appeared at the charity event, Mercurio now had an entourage of wolf girls following him around, all giggling whenever he made even the most innocuous of comments, infatuating by him. You rolled your eyes as you stepped in, to see the old baker, Ari. <b>\u201cGood afternoon, Ari,\u201d</b> you said, taking a seat at the stool across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump old wolf seemed to be in a good mood over something, and smiled at you when you walked. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh! Why, it\u2019s wonderful to see you again, River!\u201d</span> She smiled. Luckily, here, your stench was drowned out by the sheer delicious scent of the she-wolf\u2019s cooking. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh, I just met with the most wonderful official from the Rat clan! I used to not think very highly of that clan, but I\u2019ll tell ya, River, he sure convinced me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a brow. <b>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</b> You ask, noticing just how enthusiastic she seemed to be. <b>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like he had anything to eat. What did he walk in here for?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI think he just came in to take my finest brooch! Precious family heirloom, that was. Probably going to fetch a pretty penny,\u201d</span> she said, tapping her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTook it?\u201d</b> You asked, confused. <b>\u201cLike, you sold it to him, or\u2026?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh, no. He stole it! Slipped out right out of my pockets while were chatting. Such a clever young man, he is!\u201d</span> She giggled, cheerfully. You were taken aback! She was stolen from, and she didn\u2019t even care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</b> You tilt your head. <b>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be upset?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, holding up a paw. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cNah! I mean, usually I would be. But he didn\u2019t act like a thief or anything! He acted like he just really, really needed that brooch,\u201d</span> she nodded. <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cI\u2019m sure he stole it for a good reason!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were\u2026 disturbed. You knew that the rat was manipulative, but he was even able to trick people into being happy that they got their stuff stolen? Just what kind of trickster was this guy? <b>\u201c... mhmm,\u201d</b> you nodded, trying to act calm even though you felt a rage brewing in your chest. Eventually, you drop off your stool. <b>\u201cUh, sorry, Ari, but I think I\u2019m going to have to come back\u2026\u201d</b> Before she could say a word, you disappeared out the door, eager to catch up to Mercurio before he could disappear. A few other wolves gave you weird looks when you got down on all fours, tracking the scent of his entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you\u2019re a little confused when you discover their trail leads down an alleyway, for some reason. Feeling a little worried for the fates of his little entourage, you journey down the alleyway\u2026 only to be a little shocked by what you find. Tucked away in the most remote corner of the clan grounds, Mercurio is huddled up with the wolf girls, his fancy outfit unbuttoned to reveal his chest. Most were simply giggling and running their paws over his vaguely muscular form, but one was making out with him, and another was on her knees between the rat\u2019s legs, her long tongue lapping at something unseen - it didn\u2019t take a genius to guess what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all seemed to be having fun\u2026 until one of them spotted you! <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHey! What the hell? Mind your own business!\u201d</span> One of them yelled at you. Before you knew it, all the wolves were jealously trying to drive you away, as if defending their man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could get too angry, though, Mercurio calmly raised a hand, silencing them all instantly. With a sly chuckle, he stood up, his frankly impressively large, pink manhood still fully rigid as he greeted you, still wet with the wolf\u2019s saliva. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNow, now, girls, calm down. There\u2019s more than enough for everyone!\u201d</span> He teased, before turning to you. You noticed he, too, was wearing one of those amulets that cancelled the stench of the rot. You should get one of those someday. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAh! Well, if it isn\u2019t the legendary ranger, River! I have heard of your incredible exploits. Now, doll, I know you rangers are trained to suppress such feelings, but if you were interested in me, you could\u2019ve just said so\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i> call me \u2018doll\u2019,\u201d</b> you growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly realized that the usual flattery and flirtation he tried with most girls wasn\u2019t about to work on you, so he quickly changed tactics. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cO-of course! My sincerest apologies! I meant no offense, truly,\u201d</span> he apologized. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2026 take it you didn\u2019t come back here for - as you wolves say - a \u2018roll in the hay\u2019?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m here because you stole a precious family heirloom from that bakery back there,\u201d</b> you said, crossing your arms, <b>\u201cand I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve stolen around here.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, no, no, no! You misunderstand! What I did was not <i>stealing</i>!\u201d</span> He held up two paws, shaking his head. You hated how condescendingly he seemed to speak, as if you were some kind of moron simply because you were a wolf. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThey were simply unintentionally and unknowingly donating to my cause!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat cause?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cImagine an Armello where there is no poor! No sick! No injustice or inequality! And an Armello where, if I may be so frank, such a brave and noble warrior like yourself will be well at home! <i>That\u2019s</i> the future I\u2019m envisioning! <i>That\u2019s</i> Armello under Mercurio!\u201d</span> He smiled proudly, placing a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re unimpressed. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re running a charity that just funds your own quest for power?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, nominally, the charity funds are supposed to go to local orphanages,\u201d</span> he shrugs, <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cbut surely, no one would mind me \u2018redirecting\u2019 some of those funds to an even higher cause!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped. Not only was he stealing things, but he was misappropriating charity funds? Funds that were supposed to go to orphaned pups, no less? <b>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it!\u201d</b> You say, reaching for your sword\u2026 only to realize it\u2019s not there anymore! <b>\u201cHey! What the\u2026?\u201d</b> You glance around, a little stunned\u2026 only to notice Mercurio proudly holding up your sword, taunting you with it. You freeze  in place, realizing that the rodent had somehow managed to steal your weapon while you were distracted. You try not to make any sudden movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI would like to thank you for your charitable donation! Why, this is a fine piece of craftsmanship, indeed!\u201d</span> He said, admiring the shiny sword in his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGive. Me. Back. My. Sword,\u201d</b> you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked up at you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMake me,\u201d</span> he muttered. You were about to just shoot him with your bow\u2026 but on second thought, you noticed the wolf girls in Mercurio\u2019s entourage pulling out small daggers, steely looks on their once giggly faces. Apparently, they were willing to defend the rat to the death. You didn\u2019t want to kill them, though; they were innocent young women who had simply been manipulated by the rodent. But how else were you going to disarm this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 3/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+6</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 3<br>\r\nPrestige: 4<br>\r\nRot: 6</span></span></div></div>",

In fact, most of them already look ready to fall over from your stench! Wait...your boots! You've only had them for a little over twelve hours, meaning they should puff out a cloud of only 2 Rot or so! That'll be plenty to knock out the girls while leaving Mercurio to deal with in a far less friendly fashion! You feign fear at the sight of the wolves drawing weapons and hold your hands out in front of you. <b>\"Er...w-what I meant to say is...why would you want a used sword like that?

A lesson on why you should never, EVER steal from the Wolf Clan!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other wolves all shriek in revulsion as the explosion of foot stench hits their noses. Even Mercurio has to hold his nose and take a step back! You quickly jam your filthy paws back in your boots before the stench of your bare feet gets out and you accidentally kill someone! With a triumphant smirk, you stand up and make your way over to Mercurio. <b>\"I think a valuable lesson like that is worth a fair amount in trade.

Where you once felt only hatred for Mercurio, your heart was now filled with nothing but devotion and desire. Every single part of him seemed absolutely perfect; his sly smile, his charming accent, his fashionable suit, and most importantly, his surprisingly big, throbbing cock. When he presses it up against your lips, where you would normally feel revulsion, you were instead filled with excitement! It felt like an IMMENSE honor to be allowed to taste the cock of such a godlike figure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly slipped most of his length between your lips, eagerly sucking him off. You had no experience in this sort of thing, but luckily, Mercurio had you wrapped around his finger, having an almost psychic level of control over your actions, allowing him to \u2018guide\u2019 you to pleasure him in exactly the way he prefers. Soon, you, a once chaste and noble warrior, were sucking a smarmy rat\u2019s dick like a champion, letting him place a paw on the back of your head and roughly plunge your head back and forth. Apparently, Mercurio liked the thought of turning brave warriors into obedient little slaves\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back with a satisfied cackle, whispering to you about how much of a slut you are, and how you don\u2019t even deserve to worship his cock. Eventually, he decides to kick things up a notch. He glances around, noticing that his entourage was still knocked out by your stench\u2026 so, he slowly pulled his amulet off! Your nostrils were suddenly overwhelmed by his sheer musk as he unleashed his powerful rot! The stench was agonizing, especially when your nose is buried in his crotch\u2026 but the fact that it emanated from Mercurio meant you gleefully sniffed up his stench! Even his stench, as terrible as it was, was worth worshipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he forced you to suck him off and tortured you with his stench, you were still ecstatic, feeling like he was simply being generous. Letting a useless slut like you worship his perfect, unrivalled cock? Why, was that anything but proof of his sheer, perfect grace and generosity. You practically had hearts in your eyes as you looked up at him, admiring the mischievous look on his face. By this point, he was plunging his length in and out of your maw completely, forcing it partially down your throat. Its thickness created a noticeable bulge in your neck every time he thrusted forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you cooed in glee as you felt him pump his warm cum down your throat as he thrusts forwards one last time, chuckling as you eagerly swallow down every last drop. You both bask in the afterglow for a few moments, letting his dick rest in your warm maw while you looked lovingly up at him. Eventually, though, the rest of his entourage seemed to be waking up, so he quickly slipped his amulet back on, denying your nostrils the scent of his overwhelming musk. They all sat up, giggling to see that you were now on your knees, Mercurio\u2019s cock firmly wedged between your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAs you can see, girls, our little ranger here finally came to her senses,\u201d</span> he said, finally slipping his cock free from your lips. The other wolf girls moved in, surrounding you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give her a makeover?\u201d</span> They all grabbed you at once, and you willingly let them completely change your look, tearing your ranger outfit off of you and replacing it with \u2018more\u2019 modern clothing. You realized that, soon, you were going to look just like them! You didn\u2019t exactly like their look\u2026 but if it made Mercurio happy, you were more than willing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you looked indistinguishable from the other wolf girls in his entourage. Instead of your ranger outfit, you were wearing a black cardigan, a red crop top, a black miniskirt, all complete with fishnet stockings. Then, they did your makeup, seemingly completely changing your appearance with liberal use of eyeliner and eye shadow, complete with them smearing your lips with thick red lipstick and painting your claws a similar hue. Eventually, you didn\u2019t even look recognizable anymore; you looked more like a common harlot than a noble ranger. Even your closest friends wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish you from the rest of Mercurio\u2019s entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, he paraded you around town along with the other girls, with the five of you giggling at all his jokes and helping him steal more and more loot from the oblivious villagers.

At the same time, Scarlet strutted up to, unsheathing her cutlass and pressing it up against your throat, silencing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cMercurio sent you to lure me into a trap, didn\u2019t he? Probably expects me to be one of his harlots. Bastard\u2026\u201d</span> She frowns. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cListen, River. I\u2019m gonna need you to tell me where he\u2019s hiding. Nothin\u2019 personal or anything, but we really can\u2019t let this continue\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d</b> You lie, nervously, trying not to blow your master\u2019s cover. <b>\u201cI just wanted to h-have a little fun, ya know?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cEither you die, or Mercurio dies. Either way, you\u2019ll be freed from your hypnosis,\u201d</span> she threatens. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cTake your pick.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to come up with some kind of lie to get out of this situation\u2026 but eventually, you\u2019re overcome with simple rage! <b>\u201cN-never!\u201d</b> You yell, angrily. <b>\u201cI\u2019d rather die then turn him over to the likes of you!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet chuckles. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cIf you say so. I\u2019d never say no to free prestige!\u201d</span> She takes a big, dramatic swing of your sword, and suddenly, you\u2019re looking up at the sky, and you feel like you\u2019re falling. It\u2019s a strange sensation. Quickly, to your horror, you realize you\u2019ve been beheaded! The moment your head hits the ground, everything goes black\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 and you wake up in the hospital again! <b>\u201cDamn it!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t believe that that putrid, no-good excuse for a rat would have the gall to even attempt something so appalling! And forcing you, a chaste and noble ranger, to suck his\u2026 ugh! You were filled with more rage than you\u2019d ever experienced in your life! <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cNow, now! Calm down, River. You\u2019re still getting acquainted with your new body\u2026\u201d</span> You hear Moof trying to calm you, and notice him standing by your bed. With a groan, you realize he\u2019s right. You\u2019ve just been revived, and you still feel dizzy and nauseous. At least all that blasted makeup's not on you anymore. With a sigh, you lie back in bed, getting some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation out there, Moof?\u201d</b> You ask him, inbetween nauseous pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cIt\u2019s not looking good, River!\u201d</span> He frowns, explaining frantically. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cScarlet\u2019s been enslaved, and now Sylas is at war with that confounded rat! They\u2019ve been chasing eachother all over the clan grounds.\u201d</span> He lays a hoof on his head, sweating. Apparently, he\u2019s been stressed out. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cWorst of all, the people seem to supporting Mercurio! It\u2019s a good thing you woke up when you did. Maybe you\u2019ll be able to put things right.\u201d</span> You glanced out the window, and notice it\u2019s noon. You\u2019ve wasted half a day. Not only that, but you\u2019ve lost a point of prestige! The only way for you to become prestige leader now would be to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</b> You say, clenching your first. <b>\u201cALL of them need to learn what happens when they tread on wolf territory\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoof gives you a weird look as you slowly sit up, shaking as you climb out of the hospital bed. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at him, your mind obviously made up. <b>\u201cThey\u2019ve been at war all day, right? Well, they must\u2019ve landed some potshots on eachother. I imagine they\u2019re all at pretty low health,\u201d</b> you explain. <b>\u201cSo it won\u2019t take much to finish them. All three of them. Send them back to their own clan grounds, never to return.\u201d</b> He didn\u2019t seem to think that plan was a very good idea, but before he could protest, you raised a paw. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to stay here, though. Things might get a little\u2026 smelly.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank the doctors for crafting a new body for you, and collect a new ranger uniform. As you walk out, you glance down at one of your cards. Rotten Fog. If you used it, you wouldn\u2019t be as smelly anymore\u2026 but it would be worth it to drive these three from the wolf territory once and for all. You couldn\u2019t use it on the clan grounds, though; the stench would massacre the villagers! You needed to lure Mercurio and his newly enslaved fox into the forest somehow; Sylas will definitely pursue, thinking you\u2019re setting the stage for their \u2018final showdown\u2019. When in fact, all you\u2019ll be doing is gassing the entire forest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lantern would help guide to where Mercurio is hiding. The only question is, how were you going to lure him into the forest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+6</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 3<br>\r\nPrestige: 3<br>\r\nRot: 6</span></span></div></div>",

On the bright side, by the time you get back to the village, it should be decently late, meaning that you can probably gas the three and then just wait a bit for your magic to replenish! Perfect! You make your way out of the hospital and see that people are actively staying far away from you. Anyone who gets too close ends up unconscious from the intense stench emanating from your body. Ugh...you'd forgotten just how awful you smell now. Ah well...you've done it for a good reason. As you exit the gates, you can see the settlement from atop the mountain. You'll have to hurry, or you may miss your chance to get all three of them at once! You sprint down to the small wolf settlement, and sure enough, Scarlet doesn't appear on your lantern, but the other two do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shield7.png\" alt=\"*Shield7*\" title=\"Shield7\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Mercurio</b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>Prestige:2 | Rot: 4</i></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shield2.png\" alt=\"*Shield2*\" title=\"Shield2\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Sylas</b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>Prestige:0 | Rot: 5</i></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're practically on opposite sides of town, but where Sylas is isn't much of a concern at the moment. You need to get Mercurio and Scarlet out into the nearby forest pronto! You head over to where the lantern tells you he's hiding...a jewelry store of course. You can see a few of the wolf harlots out front, and...oh by the Wyld! One of them literally has her hand up her skirt and nobody passing by is batting an eye! Has the Rot really gotten that bad? Whatever, you'll have to worry about the degrading sense of decency in Armello later. You walk up to the door, and one of the harlots beams at you...after holding her nose shut of course. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh heeeey! We were wondering where you went, gorgeous! Come to get back into uniform and serve Mercurio?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, <b>\"O-of course! He's so dreamy...\"</b> The wolf girls giggle and let you head on in. Once inside, you can hear slurping and moaning sounds coming from the back room. Sure enough, Mercurio is back there being serviced by his sluts, one of whom looks to be distinctly vulpine. Damn...she...actually looks really hot in that outfit. Did you look that good? Huh...anyways, the fox is currently in a nudging match with three wolves as they each try to lick Mercurio's cock. The rat hardly even seems to be paying attention to them. He's reading...a journal of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Eight whole points of Rot...Impressive, Scarlet. Though it won't do you any good now. You seem to write about the ranger an awful lot...maybe Hypnosis has a lasting effect on a target? Or...does the once fearsome Bandit King have a little crush? Or...you had one anyways. After all, I'm the only one you love now.\"</span> Scarlet nods and starts pushing harder to get her licks in.

I want to feel that way again...after I help you slip away from Silas.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercurio looks you over and chuckles, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Well pardon me if I seem a bit suspicious. But...if your desire is genuine, I'll gladly show you that I don't need some magic dust to make you feel that way. Now...how exactly do you propose I escape that damn demon otter?\"</span> You smile and hold up a card. One you've had for a fair bit of time. A Ranger Cloak. Mercurio's eyes light up, and he gives a wide grin. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Well, that certainly will help. But, I do want to make sure you are genuine in your desires, Miss River. So, to prove yourself to me, first you must get back in the proper attire. Then...\"</span></span></div></div>",

Of course, you had to hold in a sigh as you\u2019re dragged off by the giggling wolf girls for another \u2018makeover\u2019. This time, they leave you looking even sluttier than last time, wearing a fishnet top, a micro-skirt that barely covers your ass, and literally nothing else. And, of course, let\u2019s not forget another serving of gaudy makeup. By the end, you looked particularly promiscuous even compared to the rest of the rat\u2019s entourage. Being dressed in such a demeaning fashion was humiliating, but\u2026 you\u2019d be lying if you said it was entirely unpleasant. Maybe hypnosis does have lasting effects after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused and satisfied, Mercurio donned his cloak and retreated into the forest. With that cloak, he would be completely impossible to find in the dense bushes; but that wouldn\u2019t matter once you gassed the entire place. He left his entourage behind - their incessant giggling would blow his cover - but he brought along Scarlet, muttering something about \u2018claiming\u2019 her. You shuddered at the thought of what that must mean. In the meantime, you hung out with the rest of his entourage, as they all babble incessantly about how great and handsome and perfect Mercurio is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep up with their conversation, trying not to blow your cover, but you keep an eye out for any opportunities to escape. You were planning on subduing them all with your stench again, and then fleeing into the forest while they were gagging and coughing. Instead, though, just as you were about to execute your plan, you turned to see one of the smiling wolf girls\u2026 only to watch her get impaled through the back by a massive harpoon! The smile on her face was replaced by horror as the harpoon was withdrawn, and she fell to the ground, lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylas stepped forward, threatening the rest of the entourage with his now blood-soaked harpoon. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cI\u2019m done playing games,\u201d</span> he muttered, in a deep and intimidating voice. He was a man of few words, but when he did say something, he made it count. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cTell me where the rat is, or you all die.\u201d</span> You were stunned by how easily he was willing to take a life! You suppose he\u2019s the most feared killer in the entire Bandit clan for a reason\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other wolf girls realized that Mercurio had left them for dead! They were loving, but they weren\u2019t hypnotized, so after such a betrayal, and in the face of mortal peril, their loyalty immediately faltered. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cH-he went into the forest!\u201d</span> The other wolf girls immediately ratted Mercurio out, pointing deep into the words. They seemed genuine, so with a huff, Sylas stomped into the forest with murder in his eyes. The rest of the entourage watched in awe and fear as the otter chased after their beloved rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to one of them. <b>\u201cGive me your dagger,\u201d</b> you mutter. Still shaking visibly, the wolf girl pulls out her dagger and hands it to you, obviously not willing to follow Mercurio\u2019s orders anymore. With that, you rushed into the forest after Sylas, determined to strike while your targets were all in the same place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were deep in the forest, you looked down at your card; Rotten Fog. They were all probably low on health, so this might even finish them off; if not, they would be weak enough that your dagger would do the trick. With a sigh, you performed the incantation on the card, feeling the rot dissipate from your body slightly. Your eyes were no longer tainted black by the rot, and your head felt a lot clearer and freer of licentious fantasies. Before you can really enjoy this, though, you felt an unbelievably intense pressure in your bowels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice but to let loose. What followed was a torrent of gas so powerful, it was almost like a powerful earthquake was blowing through the area. The ground was shaking, trees were falling over, and there was a loud, chilling rumbling from between your cheeks. A truly incredible amount of visible, wafting flatulence was fired from your backside, until, over the course of a few entire minutes, you\u2019ve filled the whole forest with a foul, noxious yellow fog! It stung even your nostrils, doing a bit of damage, but not much. Eventually, the pressure finally subsided, and you let out a loud sigh of release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there, exhausted, before finally standing up. The forest now smelled absolutely foul, and it was difficult to even see through the thick clouds of \u2018fog\u2019. It was terrible for you; you can only imagine how foul it must be for the others. Speaking of which, you grit your teeth and tried to bear the stench as you started hunting down your targets, wanting to make sure none of them are left on wolf territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Mercurio wandering through the fog, disoriented. His cloak did him no favors when he was coughing and gagging as loudly as he was. You reveal yourself to him, and he looks on at you in horror. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cY-you\u2026?\u201d</span> He muttered. With that, you threw the dagger through the air, and it dug itself right into his forehead! As it impaled his brain, he fell to the ground with one last cough, before disappearing in a flash of light as his soul was taken back to the Rat Clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to retrieve your dagger\u2026 only to feel an immense harpoon dig into your side! You turn around, to find Sylas looming over you, his eyes filled with a murderous rage. However, from his heavy breathing and slow lumbering, you could tell he was on his last legs. His grip on his harpoon was weak\u2026 and with a yell of sheer effort, you manage to tug it from your side and turn it around on him, stabbing it into his neck! With that, he, too, disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your wandering, and hear a familiar, feminine voice coughing in the distance. You stumble over to find Scarlet lying there, seemingly half-conscious and severely damaged. Now that Mercurio had been killed, the hypnosis wore off, and she looked up at you with a hint of cognisance in her eyes. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cR-River\u2026?\u201d</span> She whispered, realizing that you were the one who had saved her from the rat\u2019s clutches, just in the nick of time before he could \u2018claim\u2019 her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t feel nearly as enthusiastic about this one. She wasn\u2019t as bad as the lying rat or the murdering otter\u2026 but she was a bandit intruding on wolf territory, and for that, there was only one penalty. <b>\u201cYou should\u2019ve never come here, Bandit King,\u201d</b> you frown. With that, you plunge the dagger into the vixen, and she too disappeared in a flash of light. Her soul returns to the Bandit Clan so that she may be reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you stumble out of the forest, your lungs still burning from the stench of the rotten fog. It was almost night-time, so there was little left to do today, other than find somewhere to rest. The villagers seem to stare at you in awe, realizing what you had done. Tales of you slaying these three heroes would spread through Armello\u2026 but would it be enough to make you the prestige leader?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 2/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+4</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 3<br>\r\nGold: 6<br>\r\nPrestige: 7<br>\r\nRot: 4</span></span></div></div>",

Most of the things Mercurio had stolen were stored in the jewelry store, but he did seem to have made off with your sword as well as your cloak.

For now, you're just going to kick back and relax for a bit. No need to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the inn creaks open, and everyone goes quiet.

Besides, while it had its ups and downs, you think you pretty much had a productive enough day. Becoming the prestige leader may draw some unsavory attention, though, you fear. Now, you were on the hit list of every single hero who was aiming for a prestige victory - including that baroness, Griote. You definitely didn\u2019t want to know what it was like within that rat\u2019s gluttonous belly, so you were going to have to be cautious for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were also going to have to consider your options. You originally figured you were going to smite the king with the power of the rot, but today, you\u2019ve given up a sizeable chunk of your rot up in exchange for prestige. So you know you\u2019re definitely on track for a prestige victory, at least. You\u2019ve heard a few heroes are pursuing a third type of victory; attempting to overthrow the king and destroy the rot using the power of the spirit stones. You had no idea if such a thing was possible, however, if the \u2018power of the spirit stones\u2019 was simple myth. Wouldn\u2019t want to waste valuable time collecting the damn things only to find out they might be useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, you were beginning to like the rot, in some ways. Whenever somebody\u2019s face scrunched up when they got a whiff of your stench as you were passing by, you got a little excited. You don\u2019t know if this was simply due to its corruption, but for some reason, you think you\u2019d consider losing the rot to be quite tragic.Then again, the rot victory might just ensure that Armello trades one mad, violent ruler for another. If you were going to delve into the rot, you were going to have to maintain a clear head and a powerful will, lest you go mad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts plagued your head all night, even as you and Moof relaxed around the inn. Eventually, you decided that you were going to simply focus on increasing both your prestige and your rot whenever you had the opportunity. Thus, if you fell behind in one, you could fall back on the other. Soon, you and Moof curled up together in the room\u2019s single, solitary bed. Unlike Scarlet, your rest wasn\u2019t nearly as cuddly; in fact, the two of you slept on the opposite sides of the bed, as Moof seemed to have trouble sleeping when he\u2019s constantly barraged by your stench. <b>\u201cI hope my smell does not bother you,\u201d</b> you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t too much! I mean\u2026 it\u2019s tolerable,\u201d</span> he insists. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cAnything\u2019s worth travelling with a legendary hero!\u201d</span> With that thought, you finally drift off to sleep, leaving Moof to try and do the same. Unfortunately for him, it seems you often pass gas in your sleep. The poor pig was in for a looong night\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you were awoken by a powerful, familiar stench. You looked up, only to lock eyes on a squirrel\u2019s puckered tailhole! You can\u2019t even let out a yelp before his butt drops down on your face, and your smothered beneath him as he wriggles around trying to get comfortable. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, River! Heard you killed three other heroes last afternoon. Pretty impressive,\u201d</span> he smiled. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOf course, not impressive enough to prove you\u2019re a real hero! Sooo\u2026\u201d</span> You didn\u2019t have the chance to brace yourself before that tailhole slid open, unleashing a torrent of the foulest gas directly into your nostrils! The squirrel had no mercy, and within seconds, you were fully unconscious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up somewhere unfamiliar, but the stone floors, ornate architecture and royal decorations betrayed the fact that you were somewhere in the palace. Looking around, you noticed there were some cards by your feet, presumably left by the squirrel. Picking them up, you felt a slight chill when you read the titles - Plague Bearers, Roxy's Recruiting and Bastard Sword. You heard someone quickly approaching, though, so you tucked the card away in your pocket. Looking up, you see that jackal again. You couldn\u2019t help but think she looked rather attractive. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cRiver. Good to see you have awoken. You would not want to keep his majesty waiting,\u201d</span> she nodded at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stood up, she handed you a shiny nose clip, enchanted to resist the magical effects of the rot. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cHere. You\u2019re going to want to keep these in at all times,\u201d</span> she said, and you obliged, clipping it over your nostrils, squeezing them closed. You followed along with her down the ornate halls, admiring the palace\u2019s beauty. <span class=\"cplum\">\u201cWhen in the king\u2019s quarters, remain quiet and respectful. Do not say a word unless his majesty asks you a question. Do you understand?\u201d</span> You nod, feeling increasingly nervous as you step into the king\u2019s chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was, hunched over in his throne, looking down so a shadow is cast across his face, obscuring his eyes. He is definitely no longer the good king you once knew. His fur looked matted and unwashed, his clothing torn and ragged. His veins were visible and pumping with black, tar-like rot. His pupils were completely black, and his eyes were very red and veiny, giving him a very frightening appearance as he looked up at you. You stopped in your tracks, overcome by the sense of dread just being around the lion. How were you ever going to be strong enough to face him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king just stares at you for a long, long time. He had an almost lustful look in his eye as he sized you up. Eventually, he spoke. He said. He spoke surprisingly eloquently, but you knew that if you tempted his temper, he would unleash his true madness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t try to be secretive with me, River.

After all, with a name like that, you can only assume this has something to do with your cards. You select the scroll, and one of the hooded figures hands it to the King. The King takes the scroll, unfurls it, and scoffs. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cred\"> \"A woman who'd sacrifice her own ends for the safety of the people, hm?

No doubt the other Heroes have lost their items as well. Well...at least everyone will be on an even level for today. By the time the King's roar has finished echoing, he's already left the room. The Jackal turns to you and smiles. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Well done. I haven't ever seen him that impressed by a Hero before.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was him when he's impressed!? You sigh and reply, <b>\"then I'd hate to see how he acts when a Hero disappoints him.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a soft chuckle at that, <span class=\"cplum\">\"More or less the same, really. As the King's diplomatic advisor, I've learned to read the small changes in his expression.\"</span> Wait...so this woman advises the King!? You're about to question how she can allow all this madness to just continue, but she stops you with a raised hand. <span class=\"cplum\">\"I only handle international affairs, and visiting dignitaries. I daresay I've done a decent job given that Armello hasn't been invaded or embargoed in attempts to contain the Rot. Speaking of visiting dignitaries...I normally have to render you Heroes unconscious before bringing you here. The ah...court mage does not enjoy being seen. However, you were already out when we arrived.

Well, then you're lucky that you still have your free will. Breaking a courier's rules is typically something you can only do once. Though I say you're a fool if you attempt to do it a second time just because you're able to. Now...you are free to explore the castle for one hour. After that, I will come to collect you, and I can show you firsthand why the King has given me one of these Rot suppressing rings. For now, let's just say...the Rot tends to make conversations extremely short. About one word to be precise.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Jackal woman wanders off, and a small Rabbit girl walks up to you. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Hello, I've been ordered to escort you around the castle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It would probably be best if you used this time to gain new equipment from the blacksmith, or learn strange trickerys from the spymaster. Something about the jackal, though, was alluring to you. You just couldn\u2019t get her out of your mind. Eventually, your curiosity and intrigue overwhelms you, and you can\u2019t help but ask the rabbit to take you to her. You find the jackal with a pair of reading glasses one, hunched over a typewriter with a concerned look on her face, busily typing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever passion she had for her job has slowly been chipped away by the years, ever since the king began his descent into madness. It must be exhausting trying to hold a kingdom like this together, and the jackal looks like she never sleeps. She\u2019s certainly not as \u2018charismatic\u2019 as you expected one who entertains foreign dignitaries to be, but the look in her eyes betrayed an almost scary degree of wit and intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face remained expressionless when she looked up at you. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cAh, River. I did not expect to see you again so soon,\u201d</span> she says. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cIs there something you require of me?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly stand in the door of her messy, cluttered office. <b>\u201cPerhaps you could offer some\u2026 information?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs, pushing her office chair back and standing up. She obviously didn\u2019t want to stop what she was doing, but you were brought here by the king himself, so she didn\u2019t have any choice but to follow your every request. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI may not be able to provide you with provisions like many of the others, but I believe I can answer some of your questions. Come, let us retreat to my study.\u201d</span> She walked out of the room, gesturing with a paw for you to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOkay. Thank you for your time,\u201d</b> you nodded, following her down the hall. Eventually, you retreat into a cozy little study, the walls lined completely with books about politics, economics and related subjects. A great, big grandfather clock ticks constantly in the background, as the two of you take your seats in big, comfy leather chairs. You sigh in relaxation as you get settled in, while the jackal stares at you expectantly, anticipating a question. You try and make one up on the spot. The way she said \u2018provisions\u2019 earlier reminded you of someone... <b>\u201cThat courier\u2026 who is he? How does he always know where I am?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWell, first of all, you should note that the king has spies everywhere. In every town, in every forest, in every swamp. Nothing escapes his gaze,\u201d</span> she says. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cAnyway, the squirrel is named Brabble. The rot, combined with his considerable cleverness, has afforded him very useful powers. He\u2019s capable of a degree of precognition and teleportation, among other things. If he was more ambitious, he would make for an unstoppable warrior. But for some reason, he is content being a courier.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother concern strikes you. <b>\u201cNo offense, but\u2026 once I\u2019m done making a declaration, does it really benefit me to be spending much time around here?\u201d</b> You say, trying not to sound too upset. <b>\u201cI mean, there\u2019s already so little time in the day. I don\u2019t want to fall behind\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWe noticed you tend to sleep for exactly eight hours a night. Wolves have very fine-tuned internal clocks, you see. We simple woke you up here earlier than you would've normally woken up, and the court mage cast a simple spell on you that made up for the difference in sleep,\u201d</span> she explains. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cTo put it simply\u2026 no. You will be sent back to your inn at exactly the same time you would\u2019ve normally woken up. You won\u2019t fall behind the other heroes.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother concern. <b>\u201cDo you think Griotte will\u2026 come after me?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cGriotte was the wife of one of the most prolific barons in Armello. She has spent her entire life in the lap of luxury, and prefers to keep it that way. Her morning trips to the palace seem to be the highlight of her days,\u201d</span> the jackal warns. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI think that, yes, once she realizes that you\u2019re the new prestige leader, she will be aggressively hunting you down. I suggest you keep your lantern close at hand, and remain cautious. She can be deceptively sneaky for a woman of her \u2018size\u2019.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis next question, well, you weren\u2019t sure if it was a good idea to ask. But you figure you might as well try\u2026 <b>\u201cThe king already knows what I\u2019m planning, so\u2026 would you mind if I asked you for advice on how to, say, \u2018seize power\u2019?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cDo not be fooled by the size of his blade. He can swing it with incredible speed. Like a true predator, every time you miss or fumble an attack, he will take advantage of it. Thus, I recommend you bring along gear that negates misses,\u201d</span> she explains without hesitation. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cDespite the fact that he has a lot of health, you should not focus on offense too much. Defense is just as important, if not more so. Remember that even if you manage to defeat the king, you still will not be revived if you die on palace grounds, so if you both mortally wound eachother, the crown will simply go to the prestige leader.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty taken aback that she was at liberty to tell you all that! You guess the king must really not mind you planning to overthrow him. Apparently, he\u2019s amused by the whole thing. <b>\u201cWell\u2026 I guess you should tell me about yourself. What kind of thing do you do around here?\u201d</b> She didn\u2019t seem to like to talk about herself, but obediently, she obliged. She went into all the various, boring details of her job, and described how she came to her position in the first place. You perked up when she described serving the \u2018carnal needs\u2019 of foreign dignitaries, if they so request. <b>\u201cW-wait, so\u2026 you offer those sorts of \u2018services\u2019?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cMm, yes. And from your tone, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re interested.\u201d</span> You immediately blushed and stared down at the ground in embarrassment, trying not to be titillated any further by her beautiful, amber eyes. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cNo need to be embarrassed, River. I know you wolf clan warriors take vows of chastity, but I know first-hand just how powerful the licentious impulses symptomatic of the rot are. It is considered unhealthy to keep them repressed. Instead, experts suggest you find ways to release this \u2018tension\u2019 in a healthy manner.\u201d</span> With that, she stands up, and takes a knee before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cJust lie back and relax, ranger,\u201d</span> she says. You were a bit stunned by how quickly she agreed to such a scandalous thing\u2026 but you found yourself unable to turn her down! All you could do was bite your lip and silently urge her on as she pulled off your skirt, revealing your pusssy to the cold, open air.  She dug her head up inbetween your thighs, and the experience that followed was\u2026 interesting. She certainly didn\u2019t have as much passion as the vixen did, instead eating you out in the most formal of manners, as if it was an obligation. You could not deny the sheer ecstasy of feeling her glide her long, smooth tongue along your clit, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your second time with a woman, so now you sort of knew what you wanted. Thus, you felt comfortable whispering instructions to her, telling her when to slow down and speed up, and exactly how you wanted her to lick you. She quickly grew accustomed to your desires, and soon, this was rivalling even the night with Scarlet in terms of sheer ecstasy. You tried your best not to make too much noise and alert the other staff of the palace, but with the jackal\u2019s expert tongue exploring your sex, it was difficult. Eventually, you squeak out a little warning, before tensing up in your chair, loudly gasping and whimpering as your body was wracked by climax. You only barely managed to resist howling at the sensation\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you went limp on the chair, panting softly. By the four clans, after everything you\u2019ve been put through over the past couple days, this was exactly what you needed. You spent the rest of the hour speaking with the jackal, even asking her to \u2018service\u2019 you once more before your time was up. Eventually, although you wish you could enjoy her company forever, the big grandfather clock started to loudly ring, signifying that your time here was over. Suddenly, her demeanor changed, and she tore you from your chair, throwing you onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, stunned in horror, as she slid her boot off and stood up. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cTimes up,\u201d</span> she said, emotionless, as she presses her paw against your nostrils and takes off her ring. Your entire body immediately tenses up as the smell assaults your nostrils! You wriggle underneath her, but her paw has your head firmly pinned to the ground, and your screams were almost completely muffled by her sweaty paw pads. Eventually, you slip into unconsciousness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 only to wake up back in your inn room, with a considerable headache. Lying next to you was Moof, still comfortably slumbering like nothing had happened. The only evidence of your trip to the palace was the fact that all of your items were gone. You lie there in bed for a while, thinking about the events of this morning. Scarlet, the jackal\u2026 you had never been all too interested in men. Perhaps your preferences lied in women, instead? Before the rot, such a thought would be inconceivable for a ranger\u2026 but now, the thought of settling down with some beautiful vixen or she-wolf was oddly exciting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, preparing for another big day. You hoped to finally be able to leave this village\u2026 but you sighed when you noticed the lantern start to glow again. Someone else was here. Great. You check to see who else dares to tread on the territory of the wolf clan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+4</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 4<br>\r\nGold: 6<br>\r\nPrestige: 7<br>\r\nRot: 4</span></span></div></div>",

Unless the Rabbit Clan disowns her or something. You haven't kept up with clan-wide politics enough to know. Regardless, the Chief of the Wolf Clan is allowed to be here, treaty or no. Even if you wish you could come up with some excuse to attack him. Well, hopefully you can just skip town without having to interact with him...after you and Moof get some breakfast of course. The two of you head downstairs, and after you order some eggs, it becomes clear that Thane is looking for you. He's been heading straight towards the inn ever since the Lantern picked him up. With a groan, you merely sit down with your plate of eggs and wait for him to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Thane walks into the inn and immediately approaches you.

He was an incompetent ruler, and you believe he\u2019s been using his position of authority simply as a way to garner attention and fund elaborate parties. More than once, he\u2019s been found drunk and/or sleeping with some random tavern wrench. Even before the rot, his conduct was entirely unbecoming of a proper wolf. Part of the reason you embarked on this journey in the first place was to make sure Thane couldn\u2019t get his hands on the crown. Still, you had a feeling that the damage Fang has done to the wolf clan must be immense. You also get the feeling that if you\u2019re going for a Rot victory, the rogue wolf was going to be a close contender\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright. I am willing to assist you, Thane,\u201d</b> you nodded. He seemed a little surprised and relieved that you said \u2018yes\u2019. He always seemed to be rather interested in you; both in your legendary feats, and in your, ahem, more \u2018physical\u2019 features. His attraction to you only seemed to have intensified now that he\u2019s been afflicted with the rot. <b>\u201cBut I\u2019ve heard tell of Fang being slain in the past, and somehow being revived. If this is true, we\u2019re going to have to come up with a way of permanently dispatching of him.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, like I said, my Hypnotist\u2019s Pendulum card got burned up this morning,\u201d</span> he shrugs. You sigh. You had always considered hypnotizing foes to be merciful compared to simply killing them. After all, those who are hypnotized simply live out the rest of their lives in an unparalleled state of bliss and satisfaction. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a Deathstench ring in that bag of yours, do you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNo, nothing of the sort. And our rot isn\u2019t high enough to interfere with his revivals. Hmm\u2026\u201d</b> You place a paw against your chin, trying to cook up a plan. What other ways are there to permanently slay a hero? Eventually, remembering the events of the past few days, you come up with an idea. <b>\u201cThe Bane\u2019s Deep is near here. Perhaps if we lure him there, and wound him, a bane will be happy to\u2026 'take care' of him for us?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shudders. He knew first-hand just how awful it was to be a bane slave\u2026 but desperate times call for desperate measures. Besides, who could say how many people Fang has killed with his powerful, rotten stench? <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 gruesome idea, but I guess we don\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d</span> he nodded. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow are we going to find him, though?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cFinding him should be easy. We\u2019ll simply use you as bait,\u201d</b> you said, almost giving the faintest glimpse of a wry smirk. Before he could say anything, you walked out of the building, and he silently followed. He really was not liking the sound of this plan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, cryers were journeying through the wilderness of the wolf territory. You\u2019d hired them to wander and yell at the top of their lungs about how Thane was going to be staying at the Bane\u2019s Deep before permanently retiring. You hoped that this would make Fang believe this would be his last chance to get revenge on his old brother, forcing his hand. Fang may still be rather intelligent, though, and may be able to tell that this is some sort of trap. You just had to be cautious and prepared for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bane\u2019s Deep only had a single, large entrance. You didn\u2019t see any signs of a bane, but you knew that if you delved into the endless labyrinths every Dungeon seems to boast, you\u2019ll find one eventually. With that, you and Thane spent half of the day waiting on the dungeon\u2019s steps, hoping that Fang would eventually show himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nFight 5 (</span><span class=\"cviolet\">+4</span><span class=\"clgrey\">) | Body 5 | Wits 4 | Spirit 4<br>\r\nMagic: 4<br>\r\nGold: 6<br>\r\nPrestige: 7<br>\r\nRot: 4</span></span></div></div>",

So instead, the two of you simply wait outside the massive structure. Just after sundown though, an absolutely horrific stink bores into your nostrils, making you retch and stumble back! The Lantern doesn't even respond for another half minute, and the stink just gets worse with every passing second! Thane is having it even worse than you with his lower Rot level. He looks about ready to faint on the spot!

He could actually kill Thane permanently if he catches him! There's a strange...tinge to the stink though. Your knees shake a bit and your nethers feel warm...is this from a spell!? An item!? It...feels good...and that just makes this more dangerous! <b>\"THANE! RUN!\"</b> You shout, but he doesn't seem to respond. What in th...oh by the Four Clans! He has a boner! You roughly grab him by the arm, shaking the wolf out of his trance. <b>\"If he catches you, you are GOING to die! Run you moron!\"</b> Thane yelps and sprints off into the dungeon. You're about to follow when you're briefly stopped by another ping of your lantern. Gaaah! You don't have time to look at who it is! Unfortunately, by the time you look back up, Thane has already slipped away. And these dungeons seem to interfere with more than just revival magic. You can tell he's inside, but his location is being bounced all over the place! You shake your head and sprint inside before Fang's stench overwhelms you too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell inside the dungeon...isn't really too much better frankly. You wouldn't be surprised if multiple Banes live here. And...if Fang kills two of them...he could end your life too. Shit. In the main entryway, you can at least discern from the shed skins that at least one Bane in this place is some sort of giant snake. Well...hopefully this goes better than your last encounter with a Bane. You also hope it goes a LOT better than Thane's last encounter. You can't sit here and contemplate long, lest you let Fang catch up. The main hall branches into about six pathways, and with no way to know off the top of your head which way Thane went, and no time to track him, you just sprint down the one on the far left. The whole place is a labyrinth...you lose your way rather quickly in your frantic sprint away from the entrance. However, after a while, you do come across something in these seemingly endless tunnels.

Maybe you\u2019d find some kind of weapon, or something that would block Fang\u2019s powerful stench! Instead, though, on a pedestal in the middle of the room was some sort of\u2026 claw? It seemed to be humming with ancient power, so it was obviously used for something, but\u2026 what, exactly? There were a few candles resting in its paw, but taking them off doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect on it. Analyzing it closer, you realize it reeked with the familiar stench of a bane! Why would a bane\u2019s claw just be lying around in a dungeon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity was interrupted, however, by the sound of a loud slithering approaching down the hall behind you! Your blood immediately ran cold as you turned around to spot an immense serpent looming over you! It was huge, looking like it could devour you in one bite, and its body pulsed with the powers of the Rot. This thing made that skunk you fought last time look weak in comparison. It gazed at you, almost as if curious, but you felt like it was readying itself to strike at any moment. You keep a paw on the handle your bastard sword, preparing to defend yourself at any moment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bane stares at you for a few moments, occasionally flicking its tongue and getting some stinky saliva on you, but other then that doing no harm. Eventually, it lost interest in you, and started to slither away. You were shocked. You thought banes were all mindless killing machines, dedicated to destroying anything weaker than them on sight! However, this serpent seemed wholly disinterested in you. You look down at the claw you were holding, and a realization strikes you. Maybe this claw makes the banes\u2026 passive towards you? Excitement welled up in your chest. This was perfect for the plan you had in mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the serpent slithered away, you decide to test your luck. <b>\u201cHey! Serpent!\u201d</b> You yell, waving your arms and trying to get its attention. It turns to you, as if half-interested in what you have to say. It may not be hostile anymore, but it was still certainly no ally of yours. Still, perhaps it could be used to your advantage. <b>\u201cNow that we\u2019re 'pals' and all, I should let you know; there\u2019s another hero who\u2019s trespassing in your dungeon\u2026\u201d</b> At the mention of another hero, the bane immediately perked up, interested. You chuckled, knowing you had a captive audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMy lantern will lead us right to \u2018em. Follow me\u2026\u201d</b> You said, turning and walking down the hall; and to your surprise, the bane followed, intrigued. While you walked, you tried to come up with some sort of plan. You, Thane, and the bane might be able to defeat Fang together, but you weren\u2019t confident about it. You hope you manage to find another bane along the way to even the odds. Then, there was also the fact that the banes might just attack Thane, too. They may be passive towards you now, but they definitely weren\u2019t going to follow your orders if you tried to call them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as you approached, you heard movement down the hall. You perk up, hoping it\u2019s another bane.

Hell, two might not even be enough, honestly, so you call out to the equine before it can get too far away. <b>\"Hold on! We need your help.

The snake lets out a hiss that causes you to stumble a bit thanks to its horrendous breath, and the horse gives a slight nod. Guess that means he's on your side now.

It was even more overpopulated than the rabbit clan\u2026 but many would consider that a strength. Every rodent around only cared about their own business, trying to focus on their own little world in an effort to ignore just how small they were in the grand scheme of things, as they trudged along the street beneath a gloomy, ominously red night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the surrounding rats were all roused from their stupors at the same of a nearby casino entrance being loudly smashed open. A familiar rat, Mercurio, was sent flying out the doors as if thrown, landing with a yelp on the concrete below\u2026 and following soon after was a furious-looking wolf, all muscle and fury, looming slowly down the stairs towards him. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cGive me the fuckin\u2019 gold back, you cheating bastard!\u201d</span> The powerful, muscular wolf shouted angrily at Mercurio, as he lay there on the ground. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cFirst you steal my girl\u2026 then you steal my last bit of gold? Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you were marking cards!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, Mercurio tried to lift himself to his feet, muttering a bit as he was still wracked with pain from the throw. <b>\u201cP-preposterous!\u201d</b> He managed to choke out, clutching his side as he sat up on his knees, one hand braced against the ground. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m a man of class! I would never- mph!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out another muffled yelp as the wolf suddenly grabbed him by the throat, easily lifting him up off his feet with incredible strength. Mercurio was forced to look into those furious, glowing eyes as the wolf digs his claw into the fur of his belly, threatening to disembowel him. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cTell me where you hid MY gold or I\u2019ll gut you like a fish.\u201d</span> He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMarkus, Markus! Old friend! No need to resort to violence!\u201d</b> He gave a sheepish smile, giving it one last attempt to talk the wolf down. <b>\u201cTell you what\u2026 how about a rematch? If you win, you can have all your gold back and more!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes narrowed as he held him close. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo. More. Games.\u201d</span> From the sound of it, he was, indeed, probably a hair\u2019s breadth away from just cutting Mercurio open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercurio was a tiny bit frightened for the first time in a while, seeing that the wolf was definitely serious about this. He definitely wasn\u2019t just gonna talk his way out of this one. <b>\u201cF-fine! Fine! Don\u2019t kill me! You can have your gold back!\u201d</b> He relented, holding up his hands, before slowly reaching into one of the pockets of his vest. <b>\u201cIn fact, I have it right here in my pocket- HIYAH!\u201d</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf suddenly tensed up when Mercurio suddenly produced a concealed dagger from his pocket, taken by surprise as the rat plunged the blade into his chest! <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAugh!\u201d</span> The wolf stumbled back, releasing his hold on Mercurio\u2026 but the rat kept a hold of his paw. With every bit of his strength, Mercurio grabbed the dazed and pained wolf\u2026 and practically roared as he reared back, sending the wolf flying right over the edge of the nearby docks! The wolf let out one last yelp as he was flung into the lake below\u2026 and that was the last anyone saw of him, the water around turning scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, with adrenaline still rushing though his veins, Mercurio turned back to the crowd, all gawking at the display. <b>\u201cYou all saw \u2018im! He was out of his mind! It was self-defense, you see?\u201d</b> He called out, and a few of the towns members just gave approving nods, before they all continued on their way. Nobody really paid what had just happened much mind. Not like such acts of violence were rare around these parts. In the end, the wolf was just yet another body clogging up the city\u2019s river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, that definitely wasn\u2019t how he was expecting his night to play out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least he got his fair share of gold\u2026 and he finally got that unpredictable wolf, Markus out of his hair. All he wanted to do now was to retreat to his apartment and just relax with a nice, cool drink\u2026 but as he made his way there and stumbled inside, his nose twitched as he smelled something. Something\u2026 well, quite foul. He stood there, sniffing the air, before he finally recognized it. <b>\u201c... I can smell you, you know. You\u2019re not being sneaky.\u201d</b> He said, simply, to whoever was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, a panther woman emerged from the shadows with a smug little grin on her face. She was one of the most beautiful women in this town\u2026 which only made it more tragic to Mercurio that she\u2019s recently begun to experiment with the Rot, and thus, she now smelled absolutely dreadful. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBy the blood on your vest, I see you haven\u2019t changed a bit, Mercurio\u2026\u201d</span> She purred. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cStill out there getting into trouble?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped his dagger off a bit with a little grumble, annoyed by the panther\u2019s tendency to let herself into his apartment whenever she pleased. <b>\u201cOh, Agatha, darling. You used to be so\u2026 ladylike,\u201d</b> he sighed, looking at her now mangy fur, as he grimaced a bit at the stench he could smell even from across the room. <b>\u201cWhy did you get tangled up in all that\u2026 that rot?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThe <i>power</i>,\u201d</span> she breathed, holding up a fist with a smug grin on her face. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAll the power in the world. Far more than even you\u2019ve been able to command. And you\u2019ll need that sort of power\u2026 if you\u2019re going to capture the throne.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, remembering his vow to claim the throne of Armello in the name of the rat clan. He sort of forgot about that recently. <b>\u201cI don\u2019t need to resort to dark magics just to capture that accursed throne. I\u2019ve already worked out a deal with the local barons. They\u2019re putting together several levies-\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how many armies you put together when a warrior of the rot can knock them out with a single fart!\u201d</span> She laughs, interrupting him. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cTrust me, Mercurio\u2026 you\u2019ll give in, one way or another. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</span> She was about to step closer, but he lifted a hand up, signifying that he didn\u2019t want the smelly feline anywhere near him. With a giggle, she kicked a small bundle of papers across the floor over to him, which he curiously picked up and read over. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI know I don\u2019t work for you anymore, but\u2026 I put together some new contracts for you anyway. It was almost sad to see how lazy you got when I wasn\u2019t there ordering your around\u2026 hah! You know what they say about idle paws\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026 he supposes he hasn\u2019t really been doing much serious, productive work ever since Agatha left. He frowned as he looked through the contracts she\u2019s brought him, eyeing each one over carefully. Couldn\u2019t hurt to get one of them done in the morning. <b>\u201cAlright. Thank you, Agatha. But remember, I don\u2019t require your services any longer.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhatever you say~\u201d</span> She cooed, as she stepped out. With that, the rat sat down to look over the notes, and decide which contract he should embark on in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his eye was some sort of <span class=\"clblue\">Wits Challenge</span>, involving some sort of rogue baron from another clan threatening to have a loyal member of the Rat Clan executed... then some sort of <span class=\"ctan\">Fights Challenge</span>, involving a ruler of some village nearby who's reportedly been pillaging any trade wagon that dares pass into his town... and finally, some sort of <span class=\"cteal\">Spirit Challenge</span>, involving rumors of some sort 'spirit stone' in the wilderness bordering rat clan territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nMagic: 2<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nRot: 0</span></span></div></div>",

After all, he only knew of three other Rat Clan members this baron could be speaking about. Griotte was also a baroness, so he clearly wouldn't have the clout or standing to execute her. That left two possible choices, both of whom Mercurio frankly found it hard to believe had been captured. After all, what person would dare execute the wisest and most omniscient fortuneteller in all of Armello? Or the blood-soaked hand of the Night Mother? It honestly sounded impossible. He needed to get more information on this! Of course, he likely wouldn't find more than mere rumors here. He needed to venture to the town under this moronic baron's jurisdiction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith daggers in hand, Mercurio set out towards the nearby settlement. Sure, he most likely didn't NEED to intervene. Sargon could foresee anything, and likely already had his escape assured...then again, maybe that would only happen BECAUSE Mercurio intervened. Then again, if he didn't, then the...gah! Whatever! Meanwhile, there was no way Zosha would just get captured like that. Surely she had a plan. However, Mercurio certainly wasn't just doing this out of the goodness of his heart. He rarely did things out of the goodness of his heart. Agatha's words haunted him...sure, the Rot was revolting, but he'd seen what infected rats could do. If other, weaker minded heroes chose to succumb to it, he was going to need all the help he could get. And both Zosha and Sargon were VERY good people to have owe him a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to the nearby town was thankfully relatively peaceful. Sure, Mercurio kept a hand on his blade when traveling even before the Rot showed up, but only since then did leaving the clan grounds ever actually feel so unsafe! Perhaps that was why he wanted to take the crown, to make Armello safe again. Honestly, the rat's mind had so many twists and turns that it was sometimes difficult for even him to decipher the truth. Either way, he was glad to have made it without having to hide from a giant purple monster for once. Now, to find out what this baron was up to-oh. Well...this was an unexpected turn. He had apparently arrived just in time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of rats was gathered around a stage where the baron in question stood, and so did a tied up Zosha, but there was no executioner oddly enough. As Mercurio worked his way through the crowd, he was astonished to see purple markings on the assassin's face! The smug, fat baron stepped forward and bellowed to the crowd, <span class=\"ctan\">\"People of the Rat Clan! I have gathered you all here to make an example of this would-be assassin! This so called \"hero\" of our people has accepted the Rot, and sullied our name! And for that, a fate worse than death awaits this traitor!\"</span> The man grins wide as he pulls out a small pouch. <span class=\"ctan\">\"One whiff of this, and you will be begging to serve the people you betrayed!\"</span> The crowd starts to cheer. Hmph, it's pretty clear that this baron has no intention of having Zosha serve anyone other than him. Mercurio couldn't help but chuckle. The stupid man hadn't even noticed that Zosha was already nearly out of her bonds! Of course, she'll still have a baron and his guards on her the instant she gets free...you should probably help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Health: 5/5<br>\r\nMagic: 2<br>\r\nGold: 5<br>\r\nRot: 0</span></span></div></div>",

One member of this clan was busy preparing herself for her departure. The Baroness Griotte, who assuredly did NOT have anything to do with the mysterious disappearances of the serfs within her Barony, had kept herself up to date with the affairs of the kingdom. Everything from the King falling to the Rot, to his edict which declared foulness and hedonism as laws of the land, to rumors of members of the other clans plotting to take the throne from the corrupted King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had given Griotte an idea; She'd take the throne from the king herself! Certainly the Rat Clan would support her, as her success would be their success, and no one from any of the other clans would dare dispute that the rule of anyone not infected by the Rot would be better for all of the Kingdom. Yes, she'd do nicely as Queen Griotte, and she bet that she'd look great in a crown too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she couldn't just run into the Palace and try her hand at taking the throne anytime soon. She'd need to get support, increase her prestige, and get herself some much better equipment for a fight. Griotte rummages around her room, before finding what she had been looking for. Ever since she had gotten the idea to take the throne, she had started taking heed of rumors and quests, and had collected some she thought that she may benefit from doing. <span class=\"crose\">\"Hmmm... These three will do.\"</span> Griotte said. There was a <span class=\"cborange\">Fights Challenge</span> related to some ruler of a village harming trade by pillaging any caravans that went through, then there was some manner of <span class=\"cppink\">Body Challenge</span> about a traitorous captain who was dealing in slaves, and a <span class=\"clteal\">Spirit Challenge</span> having to do with finding a Spirit Stone near Rat Clan territory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll be taking this then~</span> Griotte would say, as she walked up to the chest and took out the weapon inside. It was a long, silver lance, perfect for piercing defenses and combat on plains. <span class=\"crose\">Yes, this will do nicely duing my quest~\"</span> She said, giving it a few practice thrusts. Satisfied with her ability to use the weapon, she'd depart the dungeon, glad to leave it and it's foul smell behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away from the dungeon, she could see the Traitor's Haven forest. The sight of it put a frown on her face, and she instantly became weary. She wasn't going to be caught off guard by anything so close to her destination, and especially not after she got through the dungeon unharmed. She would begin walking towards it, looking around herself as she searched for the location of the spirit stone. Eventually, she'd find what looked to be the place. An old, and strangely enough abandoned, temple. Griotte had no idea why there would be a spirit stone here, but there was one on an altar, glowing brightly with the Wyld's energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">What a quaint place...

Griotte knew that there was a Stone Circle nearby, and that the Bear was probably hanging around there if she really as in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte, now hurt a little by some of the more mundane threats in the Graverot Marshlands, would leave them behind her. Once out of smelling range, she'd give her own body a sniff, wondering what exactly she'd smell like now that she had a bit of the Rot. And if she didn't have it, she'd probably regret doing this, as she had a sour, vinegary smell to her. Less pungent than the smell of the Rabbit Girl, but still something that would make anyone around her wrinkle their nose or even gag a bit. The worse thing though was that a part of her <i>wanted</i> to keep sniffing away at the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Ugh... Such a foul odor! E-Even if... its... No! It's a horrid stench. Hopefully that Bear Clan girl can handle it though, it would be a shame to send her gagging just from being next to her.\"</span> Griotte says to herself, as she passed through a plains and to the Stone Circle. When she got there, she saw that there was a Bear Clan woman standing there, praying to the Wyld. She was a brown bear with a simple green cloak and a wooden staff, and she was rather large compared to Griotte. She had rather generous assets, both in the front and the back, that made Griotte a little envious... And that made her want to touch them, though that was probably just the Rot talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Griotte walked up to the Stone Circle, the Bear Girl stopped praying and turned towards her, looking weary as she held her staff in a defensive manner. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Who are you, Rat, and why do you come to this place while the Rot is with you?</span> She asks. She could clearly smell you, judging by how her nose twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Who am I? I am the Baroness Griotte!

Of course things wouldn't be so simple. But at least she could sit down, relax, and enjoy the rejuvenating energy that surrounded these Stone Circles... And she could admire the Bear Girl's beautiful curves. <span class=\"crose\">\"Unfortunate.\"</span> Griotte would comment. <span class=\"crose\">\"What's your name, anyway? I don't think you've said it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh! You're right, forgive me for forgetting my manners like that. My name is Sana, it's a pleasure to meet you.\"</span> The Bear Girl, or rather, Sana, said. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"By the way, this little Squirrel came by earlier before you got here. He said that he thought you'd be here, and that he had some things to give you. But since you weren't here, told me to keep some stuff for you just in case you stopped by.\"</span> Sana said. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Some items, some trickeries, and some spells.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte thought for a bit, before nodding. <span class=\"crose\">\"Well then, may I take two spells, an item, and two trickeries?\"</span> Griotte asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSana nodded, looking through what the squirrel left her before handing what Griotte requested to her. Griotte got a Tower Shield, a spell called... Malice Rising, which would summon a bane... Just lovely, and the Mirror Image spell. She'd also get the Sharpshooter and Pickpocket Trickeries. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"The Squirrel told me that would cost three gold to equip, just so you know.\"</span> Sana says, nodding to the Tower Shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte would groan, and would pay the cost of equipping the Tower Shield. At least it was worth it for the protection it offered. Though now that she didn't have anything to do but sit around and rest, she couldn't help but have her thoughts go back to her stench, or to Sana's attractiveness. Each time that happened, she tried to drag her thoughts back to more important things like dealing with the Baron, but it was difficult to keep her thoughts on such a thing, and she'd almost always just end up thinking about giving her armpit a few sniffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte and Sana stayed there until nightfall, making idle chatter as they did. They made sure to stay away from Rot related topics, and Griotte tried to ignore the fact that it was a hot day out, which made her sweaty, which only increased her stench and her desire to start sniffing herself. But at last nightfall would arrive, which cooled her down and stopped her from having to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHealth: 4/4<br>\r\nMagic: 3/4<br>\r\nGold: 3<br>\r\nRot: 1</span></div></div>",

That outburst did a good job of taking her thoughts away from Sana or smelling her stinky body at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte passed through one section of the woods and into the next, before leaving the forests entirely as she came across the town she was looking for. It seemed she was just in time too, as there was a big congregation in the center of town, and a makeshift gallows set up on a stage just for the execution. A rather corpulent pig stood up there, dressed in fancy clothes. Well, that was the Baron alright, but who was it that going to die tonight if she doesn't intervene? Well, who else but a Squirrel lady dressed in dark robes and some actual armor. Her eyes glowed purple and she showed signs of corruption from the Rot. This was the Rat Clan loyalist who Griotte was to save? What a strange thing to have to do... And it looked like she was working on her escape, not that the Baron noticed her attempt to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriotte was having second thoughts about the affair, but she knew that she couldn't just watch. After all, that would mean failing this quest, and if she were to fail, she would be coming out of it empty handed. Anyway, being able to spite this oaf of a Baron was enough of a reward to make up for the fact that she would be saving what looked to be a Warlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had time to make a decision on what to do, since it seemed like the Baron was taking his time rambling on before things started. Probably trying to delay while he waited for whatever thug he hired to act as executioner to arrive at the stage.</span></div></div>",

Griotte finally reached the front of the crowd, and stares up at the Baron with a frown. <span class=\"crose\">\"Well well well, what do we have here?

To them, it was completely reasonable for the Baron to be doing this as an attempt to garner good publicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, there were cries of outrage and accusations coming from all over the crowd, and Griotte smirked as she walked up the stage to go and free the Warlock. No one would stop her, as the Baron was busy trying to regain control of the situation with the villagers, and the Villagers were all clearly on her side in the situation here. She cut the ropes which bound the warlock using her Butcher's knife, something she always kept on her just in case she'd need to use it as a weapon or tool. Up this close she could smell the Rot which corrupted the Squirrel. A rotten miasma that smelled of rotten, centuries old cheese and fish. A smell which made Griotte want to gag. <span class=\"crose\">\"Well, it looks like you're free to go now. But why don't you join up with me?

Though now that you've recruited the Warlock, you could feel the corrupting influence of the Rot truly take hold within you.

Thus, in their desperation to stomp out the rot, the elders have convinced Ghor to make an attempt on the crown, despite his desire for isolation and severe aversion to politics, and indeed, conversations in general...</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shield10.png\" alt=\"*Shield10*\" title=\"Shield10\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Yordana</b><br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Fight: 2 | Body: 5 | Wits: 4 | Spirit: 5<br>\r\nA cackling crone whose sheer skill at magic and mastery over fate has allowed her a seat among the elders of the clan, despite the hesitations of the rest of the council.

Her curses are legendary, and feared across the kingdom even by those who typically do not believe in the influence of the Wyld. This has made her prospects of grabbing the crown of Armello surprisingly likely, a fact which both intrigues and terrifies her peers in the bear clan...</font></i></div></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So, for those of you who aren't familiar, Armello is a strategy game that takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals. In each game, four heroes, from a current roster of 20 (only 8 of whom are in the base game), compete to be the first to slay, purify, absorb, or succeed a king who has been corrupted by the Rot. The Rot is a sort of mystical disease that twists the mind and the body. It drives people mad and also destroys their body while at the same time giving the host otherworldly power. If you've got 20 bucks to burn, it's a decent time sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's the normal version of Armello. This interactive will, of course, be far more sexual and stench-kink oriented in nature. (You can all thank the Rotten Fog spell card for giving me this idea.) As such, I will be scratching the Kingslayer victory path, unless people can think up a decent way to implement it. Basically, instead of doom, gloom, destruction, and madness, the Rot instead makes you smell AWFUL. It also gives a major spike to your sex drive and sexual openness. Banes are still a thing though! And they can take the form of more animals than just crows! So, when the king contracted the Rot, he declared stench and hedonism to be the new law of the land, giving some people new ways to obtain power, and others a reason to set out and put a stop to the madness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now, this isn't going to be a simple strategy-game type thing. You actually can, and probably will, adventure through places, talk to people, and take on quests and the like. There also won't be a limit to quests like there is in Armello, so stats will not have a cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on to the various possible endings both for victory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit Stone: The prude's way to win. Collecting four stones will fill you with Wyld energy. When filled with this, anything you touch will be cleansed of Rot. Corrupted Heroes will return to normal, Banes will melt at your touch, and the king can be restored to his former self. Be warned though, a single point of rot gained by a spell, or other means, will bring you out of the Spirit Walker state, and you'll have to find another stone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrestige: Victory through fame, fortune, and fucking! Upon gaining 20 Prestige Points, you will be able to approach the king and ask for his hand. So long as you have the necessary points, he will accept, and you will rule at his side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRot: Usurp the king by using his own laws against him! If you can defeat the king in combat while your Rot score is 10 points higher than his, or while wearing one of two special items I will discuss later, you can kill him and take the throne for yourself, ensuring that rot will rule!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose three conditions are how you can win and get a happy ending. Now here's all the ways you can get a bad ending~ Keep in mind that, unless one of these conditions is met, any hero killed will resurrect at their Clan Grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeat to the Punch: If someone else claims a Prestige or Rot victory before you, you, along with any still living Heroes will be enslaved by the victor. If the Victor wins via Spirit Stone, everyone just kinda...goes home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnslaved: This can come from a variety of sources. Hypnotized for a whole day by another Hero without you, or said other hero dying and being returned to clan grounds, thus breaking the spell; being beaten by slavers during a quest or peril; fulfilling the conditions of certain rare treasures, or by losing to another Hero in combat when said hero has more than 5, but less than 10, more Rot points than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoyal Execution: The rot runs deep in the palace, and it interferes with the magic that keeps heroes alive. If the king manages to beat you, you will not resurrect back at the Clan Grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane Slave: Similar to the palace, Bane infested dungeons also will not allow resurrections. If a Hero is beaten by a Bane in a dungeon, and has at least 1 point of Rot, the Bane will enslave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane Kill: Similar to the above, but if a Pure hero is beaten, they will not survive the Bane's stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHero Kill: If a Hero beats another Hero while their Rot score is 10 points higher than the Hero they beat, the stench, and corruption of rot will kill the other Hero, and they will not resurrect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on to the various stats Heroes have! They can be increased by spells, items, or quests. Rot and Prestige can also be increased through other means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFight: Your general martial prowess. There's no dice in this, so it's mostly just there to show how hard someone is to beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody: How durable you are, and your maximum Health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWits: Your cunning and Intelligence. Higher Wits make it easier to convince people to impede other Heroes, or assist you, for gold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit: Your magical attunement. Every night, if your magic is below this number, it will be replenished to this amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRot: How corrupted you are. Every point of rot is an effective +1 to fight. Go above 4, and you become Corrupted. At this point, Spirit walkers and Stone Circles can hurt you or kill you very easily. It's at this point, your stink can start to kill, but to permanently end someone, there must be a difference of 10. Can be increased by quests, losing to Banes, beating Banes after becoming Corrupted, defeating a Rot infected Hero while being infected yourself, using dark magics, or using tainted treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrestige: Your renown across the world. It can be increased through questing, bribery, or by spreading your legs and letting word get around about how good of a lay you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic: How many spells you can cast a day. More powerful spells cost more to cast, but dark magic generally increases Rot instead of consuming Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold: How much money you have to buy equipment, hire people do do your dirty work, or spend on other pursuits. It's gained through quests or dungeoneering mostly. There's no owning settlements in this, but they can still be fortified, making other Heroes have to take longer to pass through them. Settlements can also still be terrorized by wandering Banes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpells, Trickeries, Followers and Items will be left up to writer discretion! Though as stated earlier, I do have two items I wish to just put here for writer knowledge. One is the Succubus Pendant, if you make someone cum while wearing this, you can take their soul and either crush it to permanently kill them, or absorb it to enslave them. The other is the Deathstench Ring, wearing this confers an immediate 5 Rot, and treats every victory as though you beat your opponent with 10 more Rot than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow a few kinks other than stench torture, but please be reasonable. Scat and urine are off limits as always, and while yes, there can be gore in fights, it should in no way be overdetailed or fetishized. </td>",
