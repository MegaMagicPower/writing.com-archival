This was not the case for Jeannine had a terrible childhood full of chores and discipline these were things that a mother should never have subjected upon her daughter but it did teach Jeannine one major thing and that is hard work and to get what you want you to need to be willing to do whatever it takes. This was true in her line of work as a fashion model and designer, she was actually really good at what she does for a living but as the years rolled on and two pregnancies, and two daughters later, Jeannine began to doubt her looks as she stared at her youngest daughter playing in the living room with her white and pink rocking horse that was given as a gift from her husband's brother Frank. The apple of her father's eye was Alice she was a perfect daughter when she was just born, she never made any noise while in her crib and when she had her first birthday party just six months ago everyone complimented on how beautiful a daughter Alice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jeannine begun to make her daughter a little lunch as her daughter played on the horse, as she always did, sucking on her pacifier as always, it seemed to be a normal day in the Wolfe house. Looking upon her daughter  as she made herself a sandwich and a thing of peaches for her darling, Alice was defiantly a weird child as she was the only child that her mother knew of that hated chocolate and candy apparently, she wigged out when she first tasted chocolate, while chopping up some lettuce  Jeannine stared at her daughter stating to herself \"look at Alice so vibrant, so young, the perfect little daughter, it's sickening\", for the longest time Jeannine begun to really feel old and underappreciated as her husband begun hanging more time as a family than with her, thinking it was all the fault of her daughters she wanted to devise a plan to take care of them possibly not make them not as active as they are at this moment. The thing was is not one of her children would stay still for even a second, it was nerve-wracking and quite annoying to Jeannine for she was the kind of girl who wanted time to herself, while looking upon the table at the mini TV she uses for cooking shows she saw one of those crappy TV talk show freak fest but what really made Jeannine interested was the kids and how they didn't do much of anything other than eat, thanks to how obese they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wheels began to turn in Jeannine's head as she thought and stared at Alice, as the young, thin, vibrant blond toddler was still playing with her horse while watching little Einstein, trying to form words. As an evil smile begun to form upon her mother's face as she picked up the little blonde for lunchtime and placed her in her high chair kissing her forehead and then going into the closet to get some zip ties just in case she struggled while Jeannine hummed softly to herself, placing the half of cake that was left over from last night's party in front of Alice as soon as Alice smelled the chocolate she began to freak out. Jeannine had the zip ties ready and begun to apply them to her daughter's feet and wrists, as she whispered into her daughter's ear \"be a good girl and just eat because of you're not going to have a choice\". </span></div></div>",

While trying to make Alice eat her second piece of cake the first one was quite tiny but getting it in her daughters stomach was not a small feat for Alice was being nothing but fussy to the point of trying to bite off the zip ties that were placed upon her feet and wrists \"now dear don't be so fussy its for your own good, now be a good piggy and eat your cake.\" Alice avoided her food that was given to her a ring of the doorbell had distracted Jeaninne from what she was doing \"what could it be now, I'm busy with my little princess\", as she opened the door to find that there was a new neighbor in the neighborhood this neighbor was a twenty-something mom with a two-year-old, as cute the girl was blond like Alice wore a pink dress and pigtails, with one look of how exhausted the mother looked, she came up with a plan to help this poor girl with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jeannine was formulating a plan to help the young girl said 'hi, we are your new neighbors I thought it would be polite to say hi' 'please come in take a load off'jeannie said as she let the woman in her home, while the woman sat down Jeanine went into the kitchen to tidy up and untie her daughter from her highchair, alice's face was covered in chocolate still sobbing about being force fed chocolate cake, as jeannine begun to clean off alice's face she started to say to her daughter, \"dont worry it will all be worth it I promise when your finally be less mobile and less of a bother when your to fat to move like you should be\" finally cleaned up alice and jeanine finally greeted the new neighbors \"so what brings you to alabama\"the young mother seemed peppy she responded with \"well with this little one so full of energy my husband thought it would be best to leave new york and so we are here\" seeing how tired the girl seemed jeaninne decided to suggest somthing to the young mother \"you know wo there is somthing you can do to make her less active and mobile\" the mother asked naively \"really what?\", you could always fatten her up, I mean uhh whats your daughters name?\" Jeanine asked as the mother said \"Ashley, and I don't know about that I don't know if she would like that\", \"well if you change your mind give me a call\" Jeanine said as she wrote down her number and shooed the mother home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeanine quickly shushed her pig with cake as she was feeding her making sure that there was enough in her mouth to force her to swallow. Eventually Jeanine managed to fit the whole cake in piglet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly deciding it was enough, for now, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood job piggy, you managed the whole cake, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you rest for now but that, of course, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting off that seat, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you burning any calories now could we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice was too stuffed to even breathe comfortably so she stayed silent, but one look at her and you could tell where a moderate portion of cake went, her face was covered because of how much she struggled. Taking note of this Jeanine reminds herself to use more zip-ties, so her piglet won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to struggle, or move, at all. Her thoughts were interrupted when the phone rang, not recognizing the number after she picked it up she questioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, who is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In response, she heard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mary, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve decided to take you up on the offer you mentioned about Ashley, *sighs* I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just so tired with her running around everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jeanine is ecstatic, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do more than just fatten Alice, now there was Ashley too. Remembering she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the phone she asks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo when will you get her over here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a short silence as Mary thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout 10-15 min., does that work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jeanine replied in the affirmative, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that works great, also I have some more questions to ask you when you get here if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alright\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mary sighed in what seemed to be relief, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, I just want some time alone, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you understand what I mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After saying their goodbyes Jeanine hung up and went to tell Alice the news, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have wonderful news piggy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a piggish friend of your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice was still too stuffed to understand and even if she did she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what her mother was talking about, as she hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed the girl who had come before. By the time Mary had arrived, Jeanine saw that her pig had digested enough for her to pack in some later. Seeing Ashley, Jeanine asked Mary her questions the most important being, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want to take her home each day after the feeding or leave her here for me to fatten?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mary said \u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

See if you want to come over every so often, either to watch or stuff her yourself?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of internal debate, Mary assented, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why not? I am wondering what it\u2019s like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, get Ashley onto one of the chairs and use the zip ties to make sure she can\u2019t escape. There should be some more cakes in the fridge or cupboards, if there\u2019s enough grab two, I still have Clara to feed anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her friend for a moment while she went out to the yard to grab her other daughter, a disgustingly athletic little girl with an odd love for exercise, even now the tot was having fun running around in the grass. Not caring much of the girl\u2019s opinion, Jeanine deftly picked her up and headed back inside to the kitchen, once there Clara was quickly placed in and secured to one of the unoccupied chairs, startled by the abruptness that this absurd situation had, the girl started to tear up, then soon started crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis added to the return of her friend led Mary to break out of her reverie, stopping her desire fueled barrage of baked good and giving her daughter a chance to breathe or     if she was in any state to     cry, fortunately for the mothers\u2019 ears, it seemed Ashley was in no state to manage anything other than a soft whimper. Clara was another story, deciding she\u2019d rather enjoy shutting her twig of a daughter up, Jeanine unceremoniously shoved a handful of cake into the young athlete\u2019s weeping face, filling the girl\u2019s mouth enough to nearly cause her to choke, she didn\u2019t, though she still tried to escape, which of course was futile     her mother had learned from what Alice attempted, now even the girl\u2019s hair was secured between the gaps in the chair\u2019s back, effectively immobilizing her     and only managed to increase her discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cake was methodically being pressed down the tot\u2019s throat, Jeanine started thinking over why she was doing this, and the more she thought about it, the less sure she was of her own motive. Was she actually enjoying her revenge itself this much? Or was it something more? Was it really her daughters that she hated, or only their sizes? The answer to these questions wasn\u2019t known, at least not now, but Jeanine didn\u2019t terribly care, no matter the reason, she\u2019d still fatten her daughters to probable immobility. Grabbing another handful, she got back to feeding\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coming back to her senses, Mary thought about what she\u2019d just done, not to mention just how much she\u2019d enjoyed the twisted activity. Honestly, she had doubts about whether or not she could hide this from her husband. Thankfully it shouldn\u2019t prove much of a problem, the man was always away at work after all. As for the victim of her recent action, Ashley was utterly incapacitated by the swollen lump that had occupied her lithe middle. Though as could be expected, the perpetrator wasn\u2019t feeling remorse, rather trying to think of a way to fit even more into the overfilled toddler. It took a bit of pondering, but the newly obsessed mother soon realized what she could do; liquids, she could fill any remaining room with fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, she promptly started to look for a decently sized funnel, and eventually found one in a kitchen drawer. After she pushed its end into the unfortunate child\u2019s mouth, Mary went over to look through Jeanine\u2019s fridge. She found something promising easily enough, a carton of heavy cream. Once she\u2019d grabbed it, the fluid was soon poured into poor Ashley\u2019s mouth, finding its way inside her stomach and soaking into the densely packed contents. Watching the spectacle, one could only pity the child. It was obvious that this would soon become a regular occurrence given her mother\u2019s infatuation with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanine, who\u2019d since finished feeding her daughter, saw what her friend was doing and felt a twisted sort of pride, having watched and encouraged the young mother from mild curiosity to the current potential obsession. The newly stuffed Clara, now having a chance to breathe, winced as it led her stomach\u2019s contents to shift, the food threatening to escape. Stubbornly though, the three-year-old held it in, if only out of fear for what might happen if she didn\u2019t. Once she\u2019d managed to retain her middle\u2019s occupants, the unfortunate girl soon fell into a food coma, falling limp in her restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, Jeanine noticed that Mary had finished feeding Ashley, the girl left doing little more than breathing, raggedly at that. Moving toward her new friend and accomplice, she mused, \u201cWhat do you want to do now? Can\u2019t expect to fit much more into them, at least not for a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we could watch some television or something\u2026 Maybe I could tell you more about myself. Since I don\u2019t remember saying much about me, and given what just happened, I\u2019m wondering whether we share anything else in common.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? And do you want anything to eat, since there should still be some food in the fridge or cupboards?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I could go for some lunch after that. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything special, but I wouldn\u2019t mind getting a taste of your cooking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Jeanine replied, \u201cAlright, you go ahead and get settled in the living room or somewhere. I\u2019ll have it ready in a minute.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, after a short ten minutes, the mother brought her friend a simple plate of leftovers, specifically, some of the remaining roast from the night before. Still, it wasn\u2019t as if reheating food did much to the quality, giving her no qualms about handing it to her guest. Though there was only a moment before she tried to spark the conversation, \u201cWell, fire away, what was it you wanted to ask me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters, I guess; What\u2019s your job? If you have one, that is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m a model, though I\u2019m starting to put more attention toward my fashion line.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Wait,\" She started, \"so that\u2019s why you looked vaguely familiar. Why aren\u2019t you modeling as much now, though?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been feeling like I\u2019ve lost my touch, two kids would take their toll after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it means anything, you haven\u2019t changed at all, in my opinion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s explained that to me. Even my competition was adamant about that. Still, for one reason or another, some of my confidence is gone, or maybe I subconsciously want to retire, among other things. But what about you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much to say really, I\u2019m a housewife, had to keep little Ashley out of trouble all the time, after all, part of why I\u2019ll be glad if she ends up too large to move around much. Though I\u2019ll still have to take care of her obviously, not as if she\u2019ll be able to manage anything independently once I\u2019m done.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling from what she\u2019d heard, Jeanine added her piece to the conversation, \u201cWell, my husband is similar with his work schedule, but he\u2019s the type of man to try and get as many family days as reasonably possible, sometimes more. Which, while being one of the things I love about him, makes it awkward to try and fatten up our daughters without his notice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess it\u2019s good, for this scenario at least, that his hours are the way they are. It\u2019d be even more difficult to force your children into obesity if he was home every night, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it probably won\u2019t go over well. So, to try and keep the most problematic events from happening, I\u2019ll just have to break them before Greg manages to notice anything going on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two went, gossiping about who-and-who or such-and-such until one of them finally noticed the time, realizing that it was time to head home, but maybe it\u2019d be better to stuff them again first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Violently so to a point, jerking her body and limbs in desperate, worthless attempts to deny her mother\u2019s intentions. Not that it did much, both her legs already restrained, yet it was annoying none the less, enough so to provoke more than a simple demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that would you?\u201d Jeannine started, having gotten a hold on both of the one-year-old's arms, \u201cI guess I was wrong to hope you\u2019d try eating by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the statement, the pair of limbs were pulled behind their owner\u2019s back, soon bound together despite their tugs toward freedom.

Unfortunately, it seemed her mother didn\u2019t care, all but ignoring the toddler\u2019s plight as she continued, giving a hint as to what refusal will accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d It came, along with the first forkful being brought near her lips, \u201cI\u2019m expecting you to eat what I feed you, though honestly, it may go faster if you resist.

Though, even despite that, the young girl couldn\u2019t help herself from letting out a \u201cNo!\u201d once she was given the chance, earning no more than a glare from her mother and a second forkful, momentarily stifling any complaints. Still, Jeannine was a tad bored, wanting the result more so than the process, so she decided to see if her daughter would do anything helpful to pass the time given the chance. So, pausing in her actions for the moment, she waited to see if any entertainment might come out of the uncooperative mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, after a few more, yet equally useless \u201cHuh\u201ds, \u201cNo\u201ds, \u201cStop\u201ds, and other such pleas, there was finally something that might relieve a touch of the parent\u2019s ennui; \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, alongside the smile growing on her face, Jeannine explained the simple, somewhat childish reason, \u201cWhy am I doing this? Well, sweetie, it\u2019s because of you and your sister, both of you running around and playing forces daddy to focus on you rather than mommy. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d Sounded the expected plea, falling, like every other, on deafened ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow understanding the girl's unspoken claim, it continued, \u201cBut then what will daddy think? And what would stop you from telling daddy about me threatening you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I good. Please.\u201d Continued the attempts, the words simply meaning nothing despite their honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, don\u2019t bother, just eat. You and I both know you\u2019d tell daddy the first chance you got, now wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t, but there\u2019s no reason for me not to make extra sure, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Jeannine teased, finally bringing another bite to her youngest\u2019s lips, making sure they were chewing before she continued, \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to be mean and leave you in suspense, so give me a moment and I\u2019ll show you an example of how big you\u2019ll be getting. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the toddler there, though it was closer to dropping Alice\u2019s head into the cake in hopes of her eating a few more bites by herself, the woman moved into the kitchen, getting out a bit more food before picking up the previously paused tv. So, carrying the device with her, the mother returned to her one-and-a-half-year-old, setting the machine in front of her before remembering what should\u2019ve been obvious, her other child, Pheobe, would be coming home shortly, the nine-year-old was only at school after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne might expect that with that, Jeannine might find a change of heart, born from the worrying possibility of being unable to involve the third-grader in her plans. Not to mention the questions she might be asked if the child suddenly grew obese throughout a single school year, what with her known love of soccer. Oddly though, if potentially caused by a bit of short-sightedness from the mother, she didn\u2019t seem to care, only pondering how hard it\u2019ll be to make her fill out, as she lacked the convenience Alice had, the toddler never leaving the house without her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn\u2019t dwell on it, na\u00efve as that decision may be, instead finishing what she\u2019d meant to do in the first place. So, finally pulling her unfortunate daughter\u2019s face from the baked good, the tormentor directed the poor girl\u2019s gaze to the television, briefly rewinding the program before it started, making sure that every moment of the footage found its way into their mind. And, if Alice\u2019s resumed squirming was any indication, it was doing that quite well, the toddler overwhelmed as she already was by the feeding itself, was left to her own, useless devices as she unwilling watched what she knew was intended to be a premonition of her future. Not to mention, her mother\u2019s commentary wasn\u2019t helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, honey, don\u2019t you like how big Jordan is?\u201d One of them came, picking and choosing between any of the episode\u2019s centerpieces, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it look fun to be so large you could barely fit on an average couch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what about Lucy? I doubt that little whale ever actually learned to walk, now, how long do you think there\u2019ll be until you can\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! And then there\u2019s Ashlynn, poor girl, she was so big before that surgery. But don\u2019t worry, you can be sure I\u2019ll never force such a thing on you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, along with all of that, Alice simply began to cry, the tears only continuing to flow when her eyed were delicately wiped, her mother brushing the droplets away. Not from the good of her heart mind you, no, it was plainly because Jeannine refused to let her child miss any part of the talk show, thinking it might help them, if nothing else, come to terms with what their future would look like. Nonetheless, the show had to end at some point, and when it did, the one-and-a-half-year-old quickly found her mouth prompted with a bite, her parent yet unsatisfied with her consumption.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a  happy girl with an athletic body. She also at only four years old had a great sense of fashion. She also always wore a flat brown with a black band around the hat that looked pretty cool at her. She loved playing with friends, dancing, taking walks and playing football. She also wanted to camp but her parents told her she was a bit too young for that. She also liked playing with Kiekie. Kiekie was her little 6-month-old sister. She didn't look like her sister. Kiekie was blond, totally not into sports and kind of fat. Probably because her mother put a bit of extra fatty sweeteners in her milk. Rebecca saw her mother do it but didn't think anything of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reason her mother (her name was Jennifer) put the fatty sweetener stuff in the milk because she always loved fat girls. She was a fat girl herself years ago and loved it, but her mother forced her to diet and she did. She lost a lot of weight. But even while her mother and she never agreed about the weight they still loved each other and she had very good contact with her mother her whole life. Even when she went living on her own, got married and went to live with her friend. But since she saw her mother very often she never gained weight because she knew her mother would be against it. But two years ago she died. Of course, Jennifer was sad but she realized she could now gain as much weight as she wanted but she soon realized that she would like it even more if her kids would be fat. Be surrounded by girls with big huge round bellies was a dream of her.<br>\r\nKiekie was no problem. She always sucked her bottle dry with all the fatty and sweetener stuff till the last drop. It seemed like she even liked being fat. But Rebecca was a different story. Rebecca always had been thin and what also was kind of strange was she loved fruit and vegetables. While other parents had trouble getting their kids to eat the smallest piece of vegetables. Not that she didn't eat meat or grains. She did but she loved fruit and vegetables more. With a diet mostly filled with fruit and vegetables, you didn't gain much. Jennifer wanted both her daughters fat. She tried to get Rebecca to stop moving so much and eat greasier food but it didn't work. Finally, she decided that Rebecca wouldn't gain one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca! Could you come in here please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca walked in with sweating with a red face what made her look like a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw the table was full of food. She walked closer to it. But before she could ask anything her mother took a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca please sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca trusted her mother so she went sitting down wondering what her mother wanted to do. Suddenly her mother took a rope and tied her wrists to the armrests and the middle to the backseat. Just to be sure she also tied her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on?\" Rebecca asked a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you see all this delicious food?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it all to end up in your belly,\" Jennifer said with an evil grin       </span></div></div>",

Rebecca was somewhat scared, as her mother begun scooping up Jell-O upon a spoon and started to push it towards Rebecca's mouth many things begun to run through her little head, one thing, in particular, is why is mother doing this to her, she was the perfect daughter that she thought she could be so why now would she do this? In truth the main reason why her mother was doing this was out of sheer bliss of having an obese daughter, in light of her recent pregnancy she began to indulge in the fact that it was too late for her to gain any weight or the fact that she thought it would be cuter to have immobile daughter to pamper it was mostly her dream to so if she had to be a little forceful with her daughters then she would be, as a good mother does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While humming a song that her mother sung to her when she was just a child, this is supposed to be a bonding moment for the two of them at least that's how she saw it as she cooed to Rebecca while patting her flat stomach \"my, my what a disappointing belly this is what will other mothers think of me if your not big and beautiful, they will think I'm a terrible mother, but I will fix that with some delicious chocolate pudding. Still struggling to get free Rebecca began to sob stating to her mother \"no mommy why are you doing this I don't want to be big\" with tears running down her face and ropes not getting and looser she begun to hope that something would make her mother busy as she thought this thought her mother was loving feeding her daughter chocolate pudding as her taught stomach began to bloat. With almost all the pudding gone, she was interrupted by something, but by what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, interrupt something did, as for what, the audible knocking for a room over was a good enough indicator. The noise bringing the previously lost smile back onto Rebecca\u2019s face, whoever was at the door would help her, surely. They\u2019d make her mother stop her strange actions and go back to how she\u2019d been before, kind, loving, well, motherly. Though, there was a slight hiccup in those expectations, what with Jennifer\u2019s face being nothing like the sort one might have if they were confused, rather, the grin plastered on her face was much like one of happiness instead. If of the sort that fed on another\u2019s despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, as could be predicted, the mother only gave a short, \u201cOne moment dear.\u201d as she went over to the door, not forgetting to shove another spoonful in her child\u2019s mouth before she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the four-year-old was left to ponder, not being capable of much else given her bindings, and possibly worry about just who it was at the door. Though it was obvious that it was nothing good, she\u2019d have been set free in any other case after all, yet still, just who could it be at the door, none of her mother\u2019s friends were like this, as far as Rebecca knew of course, but then who was left? Well, admittedly it didn\u2019t really matter, the poor four-year-old wasn\u2019t likely to be freed or help by anyone her captor went to see with such a pleased attitude. Mentally grumbling about her horrid situation, she waited, dreaded, for her parent\u2019s return, all the more anxious about who the new arrival would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the toddler was stuck facing that person in only a few minutes, the light conversation between the two friends momentarily coming to an end, the pair did need to get on with what they planned to. For what that happened to be, it wasn\u2019t too different from what had been preceding the arrival, it still involved stuffing the girls they had nearby as much as would prove doable, not to mention as often as they could manage to do it, stomach capacities permitting of course. Still, there should be some introduction of who that collaborator was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, they, she, was a woman, one roughly around Jennifer\u2019s age at that, if possibly a tad younger. She didn\u2019t stand on ceremony though, explaining her presence to the girl after a short chat with her partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there dearie, I\u2019m Rachel, a friend of your mom\u2019s. And just like her, I\u2019m disappointed by how little meat you have on your bones, just look at you. You can barely even fill such a small chair, but don\u2019t worry your little head about it, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to fix that up quickly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I like how I am.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear,\u201d the woman continued, soon losing her friendliness, \u201cthough I guess I should remind you. We never asked for your opinion, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean why? You\u2019ll look so much cuter when we\u2019re done. For the moment though, we\u2019ll have to work on your eating. And please, don\u2019t bother trying to wiggle away, alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpectably, the intended victim wasn\u2019t about to just simply agree, though really, that implies the toddler was even given a chance to. Rather than the reality of a slice of cake being pushed against, and into, her mouth, having been taken from the frosted good sitting in the middle of the table. To her credit, Rebecca still did as expected, trying to twist her head and mouth away from the food, but there were issues with that, as anyone could anticipate. One of those problems was Rachel\u2019s seeming... experience with the activity, odd that may be. For where that conclusion came from, it would be the unexpectedly practiced nature of the woman\u2019s actions, either where she gripped her victim\u2019s chin when they attempted to turn away, or the immediate decisions to pinch the child\u2019s side whenever the next bite was refused. Uncaring toward the discomfort it plainly brought the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what the girl\u2019s mother had occupied herself with, it was simply her youngest, the purely cooperative baby more than happy to chug down the bottle she was fed. Not that the situation was anything new for Kiekie, she\u2019d been enjoying it ever since the activity had started happening, even if she had no reason to remember when exactly that was. Still, at least one of the two daughters relished in the experience, though Jennifer knew that was probably in part due to purely how young the girl was, it was easy to love something when never shown an alternative after all. And the woman knew that it\u2019d stay that way, her parenting plans for her precious piglet obviously didn\u2019t involve any physical activity, aside from eating and a potential bit of affectionate bonding of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the situation went on for somewhat of a while, Jennifer satisfying one of her daughters while her friend filled the other. On that note, the mother might\u2019ve felt worried if not for where she\u2019d found Rachel, but with the documentation of her experience, she felt no reason to doubt the other\u2019s sense, she was, first and foremost, the amateur for the moment. Regardless, both of them were enjoying their time, the new addition still having her fun poking and prodding Rebecca\u2019s sensitive flesh, even though the child was past the point of being too full to resist, left merely sitting there, bound at the limbs as evermore food was pushed down her throat, merely moaning as the resulting ache only increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly though, it all had to stop at some point, a restriction led by the disappointingly small amount that constituted the max capacity of the two girls, with even Kiekie having to stop eating after a decent while. Now, the other two women left unoccupied, they decided to get on with their next intention, the two girls\u2019 home lives were about to change quite a bit after all.</span></div></div>",

She remembered she once saw a cartoon were a thin slender woman was able to slide under her ropes. But she doubted she was able to do that. Besides he couldn't since her hands were tied to the armrests. But there had been way out of this. But since her arms were tied she couldn't reach anything.<br>\r\nThen the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who decided to join us.\" Rebecca's mother said she carried Kiekie and put her in her high chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at Kiekie. She became very fat in the past months. She only wore a diaper and a T-shirt. Since it was very warm inside it didn't matter much. Her T-shirt was a bit too small to cover her whole belly and the diaper showed a nice muffin top. Also, her thighs seemed kind of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we will continue after I gave Kiekie her milk.\" Her mother cooed to Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, why are you doing this to me?\" Rebecca asked tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see honey I think you're way too skinny. You are I mean just look at yourself. Just skin and bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn't understand it. No one ever said this to her. Other mothers and relatives were proud at her slender body. She also looked very pretty. A teenager daughter from one of her friends said to her then when she would be older boy's would be throwing themselves at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm too skinny. I feel fine. Honest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rebecca trust me. You're just four years old.\" She said while she handed Kiekie her bottle with the extra fatty sweeteners. \"I do know what's best for you. Don't worry. You just need to fatten up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella looked interested. Her young mind only knew that the big person there took care of her and the other person was nice to her.

For my age and height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the right weight according to age and height is for everyone different. That guy is only a doctor. I'm a mother I know those things.

Meanwhile downstairs Kiekie was still in her high chair looking around for her mother, this upset the little girl for she never was left truly alone for more than five minutes this was hard to comprehend to a girl her age so while her mother put Rebecca to bed her mother started to hear wines and crying from the kitchen, \"shoot Kiekie I almost forgot she's still in her high chair she must still be hungry if she isn't then she better be when I return\".

She wasn't thirsty anymore but she did want some food. Her teeth were slowly appearing and she nibbled on anything she could find. Everything that got in reach of her tiny hands went straight into her mouth to see if it was edible. If it wasn't she looked if it was fun to play and if not she tossed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie! Mommy is here. Are you done with your bottle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie decided to make it easy for her mother and tossed the empty bottle through the kitchen. After that, she made sad whimpering sounds knowing that her mother then would feed her if she made that sound. Cause she was hungry and for one reason her mother seemed to be very happy when she was hungry and could feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right so you're done with your bottle.\" Her mother said while she picked up the bottle and hen took a few jars of baby food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie smiled widely. She was aware that there was tasty food in those jars. She happy smacked with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute honey.\" Her mother said while she picked a spoon, and zip tied Kiekie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie didn't matter as long if she would be fed. She saw how her mother opened the first jar and put a spoon in it and stuck it out to Kiekie who opened her mouth widely with a happy look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca in the meantime was still in bed moaning. Her belly hurt from being so full with food. She was really overstuffed. She didn't understand one thing. Why did her mother do this to her? She was in a lot of pain now but her mother said it was better for her if she would gain. She didn't understand that. She thought she looked good. She always thought she was a good eater. There wasn't much food she didn't liked and she always cleaned her plate. compared to other kids she always ate a normal amount of food. At least she thought until today. Was she really to thin. Her mother always loved her and Kiekie and never tried o hurt them. Was this really better for her? She believed her mother but she couldn't believe that the pain she felt now was good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auw! Oh, my poor tummy. I don't think I never before ate so much in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rubbed her belly and the pain slowly got less. Still, she wondered, if her mother continued feeding her like this she soon would be fat. But it seemed like this was what her mother wanted. She had seen enough fat kids at the playground or at daycare. She never had any trouble with them but she never hung out too much with them either. Not that they weren't nice but more because they were fast out of breath and weren't so good at running climbing or any other exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that my mother doesn't stuff me again like this. I didn't liked it and I hope she never does it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she drifted off to sleep she didn't knew how wrong she was.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she\u2019d woken up, it didn\u2019t take long for Rebecca to notice that something was wrong. Having found herself in the kitchen, zip-tied to a chair no less, any hope she held of the experience being a bad dream died. Soon having replaced itself with a mixture of dread and fear. The cause of which was happily humming while toiling over the stove. Making sure there was an excessive number of calories ready and waiting to be stuffed down her daughter\u2019s gullet. Having heard the child\u2019s initial shuffling, Jennifer walked over and whispered in the terrified girl\u2019s ear, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother resisting, regardless of how much you try stopping it you\u2019re going to end up the blob I want you to be. So, make it easier for yourself, try to enjoy it... and don\u2019t worry about exercise. I\u2019m not expecting you to move except for moving to the bathroom and back, be sure to expect more food if you decide to try exercising otherwise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her daughter there with that revelation. Jennifer left the room to go get Kiekie from her crib, picking up the chubby six-month-old and enjoying how the girl\u2019s body squished in her arms. Being such a deep sleeper, the pudgy baby only woke up once the scent of food reached her nose. Before starting to whine and reach toward it, desperate to begin eating. Unlike her all too willing sister, Rebecca was still dumbfounded by what her mother had promised her. All the more with the realization that there was nothing she could do to keep it from becoming her reality. The poor girl only managed to stare blankly as Jennifer set out the spread of food she\u2019d cooked for her piglets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the food was set out, Kiekie was quickly sated with a large bottle of formula and heavy cream. Rebecca, on the other hand, was still unresponsive but came back to reality once her mother started pushing food into her mouth. Being reminded of how soon the future she\u2019d been promised was to be. Other than the start, the feeding wasn\u2019t terribly remarkable, being merely the pattern of, grab food, feed, repeat, and only stopped once Rebecca had fallen into a food coma. As one might now expect from Jennifer, the first thing she checked wasn\u2019t if her daughter was okay. Instead, it was the amount of food that she\u2019d managed to fit into her eldest\u2019s stomach. Said organ was tinted an unpleasant red, straining itself to hold the excessive amount of densely caloric mass that had been forced into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rebecca now incapacitated, the girls\u2019 mother could now focus on her youngest, Kiekie, not that she needed to do much. The girl conveniently took every opportunity to stuff herself, wanting only to please her mother and satisfy her own gluttony. Regardless, once her daughter finished her appetizer, Jennifer started grabbing food from what remained of the pile on the table. After collecting a decent portion of the spread, she started pressing it into the baby\u2019s waiting face. Happily watching the girl blissfully consume any and all food put in front of her maw. All too willing to fulfill the role her mother meant for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the moment was somewhat bittersweet, given how well her youngest fit into her desires, for what reason did Rebecca so adamantly refuse? Even though she\u2019d understand some resistance on the girl\u2019s part to gaining weight, she couldn\u2019t think of a reason for her to do so with such vehemence. If Rebecca was older and more focused on popularity or the \u201cThin is in\u201d lifestyle, it\u2019d be understandable. But there shouldn\u2019t be any reason for a four-year-old to resist her mother so desperately. Musing, Jennifer thought that if there was anything good to come from that, it would be how simple she expected it to be to break the girl. One thorough dose of helplessness should prove enough, if not, then there was all the more fun to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sometimes heard women say that they were surprised how much Kiekie ate for her age. But being bit bigger at Kiekie's age wasn't so bad. Besides, it was probably baby fat what would go away in some time. Before that huge dinner, Rebecca thought she didn't have any baby fat thanks to her exercise.<br>\r\nHer mother walked to the kitchen and returned with two bags of soft candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were hungry Kiekie. Here is something I know you gonna like. Candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured some candy on the blanket Kiekie was sitting on. Curious the fat little girl looked at the candy.

Sighing to herself Rebecca began to contemplate at how weird her family was it seemed like her whole family was a couple of odd balls, her mother was the biggest oddball of them all. Not wanting to mope around all day Rebecca decided to snoop around, something her parents told her to never do but she just had an urge to do it was like a calling to her to just peek around her parents room, her mother was acting quite strange and if that wasn't reason enough her father wouldn't be around for a couple weeks for his business had called upon him for a trip to meet some delegates of a different company so his company can happily work together with these new people so he was out and about for a couple weeks or months depending on the  negotiations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca still bloated from the meal that was forced down her throat tried to fix her pretty dress as she thought with disdain of what her mother was doing to her body and her sister's body as well, with no avail Rebecca began to doubt that there would be any evidence that could lay her mother's plans out for her around. This was most unsettling to Rebecca for if there weren't any plans around to show another adult of what her mother was doing to her children then who would believe a child of four years old, her own crazy mother thinks she  is doing what is best for her child, even if it isn't the best thing for Rebecca. \"what do I do now that I don't have any proof of my mother's weirdness?\" Rebecca asked herself as she begun to pace her parent's room with a distraught look upon her face. Just as Rebecca was about to head back to her room to hide from her mother's feedings she heard something downstairs that piqued her interest, it was the ringing of the downstairs phone, this was most unusual that the phone was reading since it was only ten o' clock in the morning and none of her mother's friends were all either out shopping or dropping off their kids daycare or something of the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"oh hey Richard how is it going hows everything going big brother Jennifer said over the phone as she talked more and more with her brother the more and more of a grin appeared upon her face, it was quite creepy to see her mother smiling so much that it started to hurt her face. \"so you and Janet want to go on your anniversary, so you want to leave Christine here until you get back from your vacation to Africa?\" Jennifer asked still smiling with her creepy grin. \"that is correct sister, it won't be long I don't think a couple months tops\" Richard said, not knowing what peril his daughter was in now, Rebecca remembers Christine she is about two years younger than her barely able to talk, long platinum blond hair and ocean blue eyes to boot, she was thin for her age, no baby fat upon her body. The thought of seeing her cousin discomforted Rebecca for she didn't like her cousin, with her chipper attitude it was sicking but with her mother acting weird as she was she didn't know if Christine would be safe here. Trying to think about what to do for the past fifteen minutes and not coming up with anything she knew that she was running out of time, just as she said that to herself a Knock was heard at her door, it was her uncle and cousin, Rebecca was out of time and it was time to say hi to her uncle and her cousin.</span></div></div>",

Hi Christine!\"Come in.\" She said trying to sound as happy if she could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then her mother walked to the front door while carrying Kiekie in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sis.\" Uncle Richard said. \"It's so nice you could watch Christine for us. She's adorable but taking her a few months through Africa didn't seem such a good idea and since you already have two healthy kids we thought you wouldn't mind taking care of her. Ah and this is Kiekie. Seems like she has a healthy appetite.\" He said friendly while he pointed at Kiekie's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps you can fatten up Christine a bit. She's very thin. I would love it if she would gain some pounds. Like my grandmother always said a big belly is a happy belly.\" Her aunt said while she slapped her chubby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well We're gonna go look for some wild animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take me with you! Can I come with you?\" Rebecca yelled suddenly. \"I also wanna see wild animals. I wanna see monkey's and panthers and lions and all those other animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn't lie. She had seen a lot of drawings and photo's in books. But she would like to see all those animals for real and she was very adventures. But most important she wanted to be away for her mother before she would explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry Rebecca. We would love to take you but I don't think you mother agrees to that. But we will take pictures you can watch when we come back.\" Uncle Richard said. After that, he gave Jennifer a list with some rules and things for Cathrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca leaned against the wall and pulled her hat a bit lower so her eyes were hidden in the shade. Now she had to deal with her mother who wanted to turn her in a fat pig and a chipper cousin who could barely talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later her uncle and aunt left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. I think it's eating time.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca moaned but followed her mother to the kitchen. He mother made a bottle for Kiekie and Rebecca looked at the table full of food. She looked with a painful look at her mother who handed Kiekie her bottle what she tightly held between her hands and greedily started to suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I can't possibly eat all of that.\" Rebecca said carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not sweetie. But we have a guest now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at Cathrine. Seemed like her mother planned to fatten her too. That was perfect. Christine would become fat and then after her parents picked her up they would perhaps do something about her mother. But of course, that might take a few months. Angry she clicked with her tongue.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All right girls it's eating time. Well, I'm gonna feed you, Christine. Don't worry those ropes are just for safety. Rebecca do I need to tie you too or are you finally gonna eat like a good big girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at the food. She didn't want to eat it all but she knew her mother would else force it down her throat. Perhaps she could then better eat it. She looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting for an answer Rebecca. Do you eat like a good girl or do I need to force you?\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was quite a gamble she could come out unscathed or so full she wouldn't be able to move correctly, \"um, mom I can eat like a big girl since you have to take care of Christine now huh?\" Rebecca said as she tried to place her plan into action, by taking nibbles at the food and not really eating it she thought she could trick her mother into thinking that she was eating a lot when in reality she was eating just enough to feel semi full. \"kay dear I am trusting you to eat like a big girl for your cousin needs my utmost attention right now she is just so thin, she might even be thinner than you Rebecca\" Her mother said with a sigh of disappointment, she didn't like a girl so young being so thin, girls of her age should be fat and adorable, she didn't care if her way of thinking was right, she only knew is that is was her way of thinking and her's alone, right or wrong she only knew is that she knew in her heart that she was right with her thinking, even if she had to tie her niece and daughter up they will become fat. Humming a happy song as Jennifer took the rope that she had in her hand and started to wrap it around her Niece's wrists attaching her to her high chair, trying to form words to tell her aunt \"no or what is happening to her\" she didn't quite understand what was happening all she knew s that she didn't like it. \"My, my Christine you are quite the fussy one aren't you no wonder why your parents had such a hard time fatten you up, but don't worry auntie will fix that right up\" Jennifer stated with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca just watched as her mother tied up her cousin with a gentle nature, it appeared as if her mother was too preoccupied with her cousin to be bothered with Rebecca slow eating, her plan was actually working, she felt bad that she had to use her cousin as a sacrificial lamb of sorts but it was the only thing she could think of to do so that her mother would lay off of trying to fatten up her and switch to her cousin. What Rebecca didn't know if her mother was actually watching her daughter closely as  and wasn't happy with the pace of eating her daughter was going at it was quite a poor sight to see as you could mistake Rebecca for a squirrel by the way she was eating, thinking in her head Jennifer said \"well looks like I'll need to tie her down as well, she wondered why her daughter was so difficult, she had to know that sooner or later she would be the blob her mother wished for so why fight it and accept it like her other daughter has accepted it was just a matter of time. Christine was scared she didn't know what was happening and she missed her mommy and daddy, the girl just turned two and was the sight of perfection, she loved pink and blues, with long platinum blonde hair, pale skin, and ocean blue eyes she would become a heart breaker when she got older, and her aunt knew this which is why she would do anything to make sure that this girl would be the fattest two-year-old in the world chocolate chip cookies and cakes and pies all smelled good to Christine but it was hard to reach them with her hands bound so she didn't know what to do, so she sobbed the only thing she could think of to do was sob. Just then as Rebecca was still nibbling on her cake she asked her mother, \"Mommy, why do you want us fat don't you want us healthy?\" all her mother could do was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at her young, though surprisingly inquisitive, daughter Jennifer realized that she might as well tell her, not as if her desires were a secret at this point. Anyway, if she heard her reasoning, the girl might give up the resistance which, though futile, was annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019s not much to say really, one assumption you could make is that it\u2019s because I don\u2019t care, yet that\u2019s not quite true. Instead, It\u2019s because I believe that happiness is more important than health, and therefore, my happiness is more important than your health. Not that I want you to get hurt, of course, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it. Is that a good enough answer, Rebecca? Or not quite the response you were hoping for?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Rebecca could do little more than stare back in shock. She\u2019d hoped that her mother just hadn\u2019t realized and would stop as soon as she learned that it would hurt her daughters, she\u2019d put an end to it. Instead, she got, well what did she get? There wasn\u2019t much other than a depressing, seemingly concrete statement. Regardless of its effects, they would be as fat as their captor could make them. But honestly, what could she, a four-year-old, do about it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could fight it to the best of her ability, but to what end? It wasn\u2019t as if the girl still expected her mother to suddenly flip and apologize, so what did she expect her resistance to accomplish? Perhaps a helpful stranger to tell her mother off and take them to freedom? Unfortunately, the more she thought and tried to hope, the more certain her fate seemed. The only hope she had left was that her mother stopped before they were too afflicted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, she hadn\u2019t taken a bite while she\u2019d thought and despaired, yet it wasn\u2019t as if her mother hadn\u2019t noticed. Already having set down her nearly comatose niece as she moved closer to her daughter. Possibly because of the shock, Rebecca didn\u2019t resist much of the feeding at first, chewing and swallowing whatever pressed against her mouth. But as her stomach filled, she slowly started to struggle, likely prompted by the pain of overfullness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the resistance, the toddler was now posing, one couldn\u2019t honestly expect Jennifer to stop because of something so feeble. The only thing the girl\u2019s actions actually did was bring a little bit of amusement for her mother. Introducing a slight spice to the otherwise somewhat monotonous activity of feeding. Still, despite how much the two children had been made to eat, plenty was left on the table. Food which would hopefully make its way into, then onto, the children\u2019s bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, at some point Rebecca again gave up, meekly opening her mouth when prompted, then swallowing the mouthful of food. So far, she\u2019d managed to choke down a good portion of a cake, but it wasn\u2019t as if that was all Jennifer planned to force into the girl. Though regardless of what she wanted, there was only so much room in her daughter\u2019s stomach.  Now starting to tint pink from how much it presently carried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mere minutes later that Rebecca had been thoroughly stuffed, middle stretched to the point of shining, yet her mother still wasn\u2019t satisfied. Nevertheless, she stopped, she\u2019d known how much patience this would require, though it was hard to resist when it was so close to being realized. Sighing, the woman wistfully imagined the future she was wholeheartedly working toward, the young harem of flab that she could feed, dominate, and do God knew what else to. Yet that would take time, she hoped not too long, though as the saying went, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Se knew that it was probably wrong to hate her mother but she was also sure it was wrong what her mother did. She knew mommy normally wants the best for their children but she knew for sure this wasn't the best. The next moment her mother stuffed some food in her mouth. She needed to chew and swallow it or she would choke. While she chewed she saw her mother feeding Cathrine who seemed to like the food and didn't mind the feeding. Sure she didn't like it to be tied up at first but now she was fed and she liked that. This way she didn't have to do anything herself. So she just lazy lied back and let her aunt feed her. Jennifer took turns feeding each girl. Planning to fatten them up both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on open up my little piggy,\" Jennifer said sweetly holding a big piece of pie in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pi... \" Was all Jennifer could say before the pie was forced into her mouth.

She still had some milk in her bottle left and until it was empty there was no reason to ask her mommy to feed her, and if she was still busy feeding the girls when her bottle was empty... She could wait some time, and else she could always throw her bottle across the kitchen. That always got her mother's attention. Jennifer at the moment didn't notice Kiekie and totally focused on Rebecca and her cousin. Rebecca was obvious, not happy with the eating, but Cathrine seemed to enjoy it. Rebecca thought this was another reason to hate her cousin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was an as strange way of thinking but it was Jennifer's way of thinking it was decided long ago that she would fatten up her daughters and that is what she would do.

Watching how her sister was stuffed was fun to watch but now Rebecca was gone the fun was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my poor girl. You must be starving.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Christine. She fed Christine some food not too long ago. Perhaps it was better to feed Kiekie for now then Christine could eat more afterward. But then she needs to keep Christine tied to the chair this whole time. This wasn't easy. For a moment she thought to let Rebecca feed Christine but knew she would never do that. Let her eat was already difficult so let her feed someone else was a lost cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Christine but Kiekie asks my attention first!\" Jennifer said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine hadn't really understood what she said but knew when adults said something so loud you could better keep your mouth shut. So she looked interested at her aunt who walked to the cupboard to get jars. Suddenly she stopped and got just one jar while Kiekie normally ate several jars. She went to the fridge and got out some liquid butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Perhaps Kiekie likes this too.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie got a bit impatient but suddenly Jennifer pushed a big spoon full of liquid butter in her mouth.

Jennifer smiled while she fed her youngest all of the remaining liquid butter.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca in the meantime watched T.V but couldn't really concentrate.

Or at least not this many. She belched loudly and tried to focus on the T.V. Dora was also a bit chubby. At some moments you could see her belly between her pants and shirt.

Rebecca wasn't liking watching her little sister while trying to process the full gut that she had right now her stomach hard as a rock her pants that the had on were opened and her zipper down so that Rebecca could breathe more comfortable since it was quite hard as she was now it as she had a food baby on the way, \"so full\" Rebecca said blushing a bit at how it felt sort of good being so full, not that she would tell her mother that for she would probably force more food upon hapless Rebecca if she ever found out that she found it enjoyable to be stuffed beyond normal extents.  While Kiekie played with her blocks and her sister rested her poor belly, their cousin was still at the table tied up, her eyes welling up with tears as her aunt was tending to her youngest placing her in front of the television and some of her favorite toys like her blocks and little piano.

That was beside the point, it was feeding time for Christine no matter if she wanted it or not, as it appeared that Christine didn't as she moved her head around the chocolate cake trying to avoid her aunts movements of trying to get the cake into her mouth this was finally proven futile as chocolate stained Christine's mouth and face, while most of the slice of cake was resting happily inside Christine's body Jennifer then stated to her niece while reaching for another slice of cake, \"don't worry my dear Christine soon you will become...\"</span></div></div>",

Once those words crossed her ears though, nothing changed, aside from her confusion, steadily converting itself into dread that is. The poor girl\u2019s mental state was already a none too happy cocktail of fear and befuddlement, in no small part due to the cake which had been shoved down her throat. Truly, Jennifer had no reason to be surprised by the inevitable retaliation, or the attempt at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what that was, it should seem obvious to anyone who\u2019s had to care for a young child, sibling, or such. In simple terms, little Christine had decided that trying to scream would be the answer. Unfortunately, the reverse held, at least if one went by how quickly the tot\u2019s aunt shoved another clump of cake into the conveniently open mouth. Filling it with more of the frosted dough, though a decent portion of the icing missed its mark, smearing across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, Jennifer ran into an unsurprising obstacle; the girl was full. Not to say that stopped her, nothing of the sort, instead she was encouraged by it, knowing that every extra morsel she managed to get her niece to eat was another stretching her stomach. Still, she thought it was time enough for her to start the day\u2019s work of breaking the girl in, she had her role to play of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning closer to the toddler\u2019s ear, she whispered her first demands, \u201cSqueal my piglet, go on. Let\u2019s keep you oinking until it\u2019s all that you can manage, and don\u2019t think about refusing, I\u2019m sure you can think of a few reasons not to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the aunt lifted her overstuffed niece from her chair, adjusting the rope to bind her hands, of course.  And, for whatever the reason, proceeded to set her onto the kitchen floor. The explanation came soon enough, Jennifer moving a pet bowl, a memento of their old pet, filled with food to the ground in front of the girl, obviously meaning for her to consume it. Still, it took a moment, and a forceful \u201cEat!\u201d before the toddler began, forced to feed directly from the saucer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t to say Rebecca had no qualms about what was happening to her cousin, but what could she expect to do? Nothing seemed to be the answer. It wasn\u2019t helped by her seeming inability to move from her seat on the couch, forced to watch the unnervingly dehumanizing scene from a safe distance away. And a spectacle it was; little Christine hadn\u2019t exactly had any moments to calm down from her sobbing, let alone time to do it now, which lead to the possible metaphor of eating her tears, they\u2019d all started falling into her new bow after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the middle of this, Rebecca had dropped her gaze, unable to comprehend what she\u2019d witnessed. For Jennifer, though, she wasn\u2019t going to make this any more pleasant for her niece, affectionately stroking the distraught toddler's back while she ate, petting her in a sense. Looking down at Christine, she muses over how far she wants to go, helpfully, the two-year-old spoke, not that anybody would understand them, but it was more than enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroaking out from the child came the oh so expectable question of \u201cWhy?\u201d though it sounded more like a high-pitched grunt than a word, being the reasonable woman she was, Jennifer gave her another chance; \u201cWhat was that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking down her current mouthful, Christine piped up again though her tears, \u201cWhy? Please stop!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that... speech? Did you already forget what you were told?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you,\u201d The aunt started with a small sigh, \u201cWell, guess I\u2019ll have to repeat it: You don\u2019t need to know how to speak anymore, let alone do it. So, now, do as you\u2019re meant to and act like the swine I want you to be.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the look on the child\u2019s face, she amends, \u201cI won\u2019t repeat it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oink?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl. Now, keep eating. We wouldn\u2019t want any of your food to go to waste, now would we?\u201d She finished, calmly forcing Christine\u2019s head back to where it should be, eating from her bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Rebecca, the toddler had begun to realize she should be counting her blessings if you could call them that. As it was undeniable that she was treated better than her cousin, she was treated like a human being, after all, allowed to talk and eat at the table instead of a pet dish. Still, the spectacle planted fear in her mind, \u201cWill... no. How long until I\u2019m treated like that?\u201d But a coinciding question terrified her all the more, \u201cWhy am I... curious?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Jennifer hadn\u2019t noticed her daughter watching, let alone the intrigue budding in the girl\u2019s mind, so, for now, she was safe if you could call it that. So, like anyone trying to put something out of their mind, the four-year-old sought to distract herself. Focusing on the cartoon playing across the screen, she pushed thoughts of the future out of her mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tears rolled down her face as the last morsel of soggy chocolate cake was forced into her mouth, hoping that this would be the end of her torture a sigh of relief escaped her mouth thinking that this nightmare was just a cruel prank that was sprung on her by her cousins. Jennifer, on the other hand, was in love with every minute of the humiliation that Christine endured only enhanced Jennifer\u2019s own arousal and desire to make the tot hers and hers alone. Nibbling on the ear of Christine while she at the last of the cake Jennifer made it no secret to all who were watching that she lusted for this girl and Christine was going to learn her place and nothing but the piglet for Jennifer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebecca couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off the two it was somewhat endearing to watch how much her mother loved Christine in her own twisted way of showing it but at the same token Rebecca did feel somewhat sorry for the girl who was forced to be considered nothing but a pet now, it wasn\u2019t something that Rebecca wanted to join the thought of her having to be on all fours getting fatter and fatter all for the pleasure of her mother made her shiver by just the thought of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, why are you making Christine at like a pig?\u201d She stuttered out of her mouth not really wanting to know.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell you see your cousin is very different from you or your sister, ever since your uncle first brought her by to meet us I fell in love with her and knew I wanted to make her mine.\u201d  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGoing in for another kiss of the chocolate covered lips of her lover, Christine, of course, fought her aunt but there was nothing she could do that would cause Jennifer to the sweet decadence of chocolate and the saltiness of the tears that once streamed down Christine\u2019s face made it all the more delectably sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your not going to make me or Kiekie into piglets too, I was worried you were\u201d Rebecca sighed with relief that her mother wasn\u2019t so cruel to impose this new lifestyle on everyone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still wasn\u2019t fair to Christine, being taken care of by Jennifer who wanted nothing more than to turn the little girl into a sow for her own pleasure. Jennifer leads the overfilled girl around the living room making her crawl on all fours and ever so often Christine would oink not really understanding how she got into this predicament in the first place. Not wanting do any of the things that she was forced to do Christine couldn\u2019t think of a way out of this she was just so full and exhausted at the moment to think of a good way to get out and having her aunt or she should say master always behind her made it worse for her. Jennifer, on the other hand, was having the time of her life but she knew that Christine wasn\u2019t broken, not in the slightest, she would have to keep this up for a while until the girl finally calls her master for the first time. Thinking about how she will communicate with her slave was something that was on her mind thinking that she guess a few human words would be okay enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot I knew I was forgetting something, I forgot we were almost out of food that wouldn\u2019t be good for dinner while Nancy grabs the girls I\u2019ll grab the piglet\u201d swiftly picking up Christine and placing her on her hip undoing the rope that was making Christine have to crawl they were out the door. Christine didn\u2019t know what was happening to her but she did know that the nightmare of being a piglet was over for now. Nancy couldn\u2019t even react to what was happening knowing how impulsive her friend was all she had time to was pick up the obese baby and the chubby five-year-old and start walking out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhere are we going Jennifer this was quite fast I hope we have enough diapers in the bad, I know food is important for these growing girls but, we could have done this better\u201d Nancy sighed trying to catch her breath after buckling Kiekie in her snug car seat and Rebecca into hers. Before Nancy could even focus they were already of to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCalm down for a moment, Nancy, we\u2019ll get groceries after this. I just need to buy a few things for my growing piglet first, she\u2019s going to be treated a bit differently from now on.\u201d The woman reassured her friend, her voice surprisingly stable despite her excitement. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJennifer?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI told you to calm down. Just do your job and keep Kiekie fed. Questioning me isn\u2019t part of that.\u201d Jennifer reminded, rudely shutting down any unasked questions. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith that, the mother looked out the rear as she backed out of the driveway, setting off for a place that would likely bring a smile to most people\u2019s faces; a pet store. Jennifer didn\u2019t keep that a secret from them, knowing that Rebecca always enjoyed seeing all the birdies, bunnies, kitties, and puppies that the store had to offer. And still, the certainty may force Christine to accept it easier, not that she had any choice in the matter either way. So, focusing on the road, the woman spoke to those behind her, <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright, girls, this might be a slight surprise, but we\u2019re stopping by a pet store. And no promises, so don\u2019t get attached while you\u2019re there, but the possibility of bringing home a new friend exists as long as Rebecca agrees to some conditions.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Came the given reply, the child expecting a much more cooperative answer than what she was given. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for me to decide. I might mention some while we\u2019re there, but that doesn\u2019t make those the only ones.\u201d Pausing as her daughter listened, \u201cI\u2019m sure you can predict a few of them though, it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be anything contradicting what you\u2019ve experienced so far.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter that, a slightly awkward silence filled the car, with the only human noise coming from Jennifer an ecstatic humming that did little to ease the younger riders\u2019 nerves. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t have to worry for unbearably long in that regard, as their destination wasn\u2019t very far in the first place, promising that they arrived within a half-hour. Once they had, Nancy was quickly forced to watch both Rebecca and her little sister, their mother, already rushing off with Christine in arm. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo, for the time being, the pair and trio went their somewhat separate ways, though Nancy had to admit she didn\u2019t mind the surroundings herself. Still, it was obvious that her friend was the one enjoying herself the most, excitedly looking at the selection as she carried her niece around. Occasionally, she pulled one of the collars of their rack to check how it\u2019d look against her slave. Sometimes the aunt even entertained the thought of forcing Christine to stay in a full harness through the day, thinking it might help her learn her new, temporary method of movement. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebecca and co were having fun for entirely different reasons. The five-year-old was ecstatic at the change of scenery, happily playing with the available gerbils, rabbits, and even being momentarily amazed by the large tortoise the store had wandering around. For the time being, the child was almost in her own little paradise, especially with the drastic shift involving the spectacle from less than an hour ago. All the while, she was slightly failing her mother\u2019s advice about not getting too attached, as she, like all children, wanted to bring the entire inventory back home. Finally, though, once Nancy had begun to tire from pushing Kiekie\u2019s stroller around, the elder child showed an interest in the other animals that lined the wall, the puppies. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she started to pester their guardian to let them play with one, her mother was personally having a bit of her own fun with Christine. For an explanation of what was happening, it was likely that without any other customers in the aisle, Jennifer didn\u2019t see a reason for restraint. Letting her force the two-year-old to try out some of the accessories before making a decision. At the moment, the aunt was walking the child up and down part of the lane. Sternly pulling her forward by the leash and collar that had been hooked around the toddler\u2019s neck, coercing the girl into cooperation under the threat of choking. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe child\u2019s feelings were much what anyone would expect, especially once they noticed the tears beginning to dot tiles beneath her. Christine, as she had most of the time since being dropped into her tormentor\u2019s care, was solidly hating the ordeal, as even her attempts to resist did nothing but choke her for a few moments. Her rage wasn\u2019t permanent. Rather, as the toddler was strangled, again and again, it was converted into despair and solid fear. Though even as she thought, she soon felt another yank forward <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShifting back to Nancy and her two girls, the giggling gave a good hint to what Rebecca had decided to do, though whether she remembered the conditions involved was another story. For the moment though, the five-year-old didn\u2019t even care, having all too much fun playing with the puppy they\u2019d borrowed. And as you\u2019d expect, the little St. Bernard was enjoying themselves as well, letting out an \u201cArf!\u201d every so often as it rolled, tugged, and played in the cubicle. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt some point, enough time had passed for Jennifer to be ready to leave, a couple sizes of collars in hand for while her piglet stayed mobile, along with a leash for when she wanted to have some more entertainment. Said piglet had been again held in her arm, but her squirming had led to her being set down, allowing Christine a slightly greater freedom if a pointless one. But along with that came the mother\u2019s ultimatum, knocking on the space\u2019s wall to gather her daughter\u2019s attention, she asked what she\u2019d been waiting to, <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, Rebecca? Have you decided? Do you want the dog, unspoken conditions and all, or are you fine without, even despite how happy you looked playing around?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the St. Bernard, Rebecca had a bit of a quandary about what she should do. Loving the little puppy Rebecca wanted nothing more than to keep the dog, though she didn\u2019t want to find out what the cost was going to be knowing how conniving her mother was it could have been anything. Though it would seem for the time being her mother had forgotten about little old her when it came to force-feeding and moved to her cousin Rebecca knew better than to let her guard down around her mother. Mulling it over in her head Rebecca had finally concluded what she should do and what her answer to her mother was going to be, Jennifer had already known the girl\u2019s answer as she knew her daughter and how she could be when it came to anything cute that she could have. Though it might be a big regret to give this dog to a girl who might not be mobile by the year\u2019s end it was the only thing Jennifer could really think of doing when it came to Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the puppy mommy, her name is Basil and I love her I\u2019ll do what you want if I can have Basil\u201d Rebecca begrudgingly accepted her mother\u2019s offer, patting her new companion\u2019s head as Rebecca looked for reassurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a good girl, don\u2019t look so glum dear daughter its nothing too serious just a little help with the sow is all\u201d Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but chuckle she knew that her once disobedient daughter was going to have to listen to her for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn\u2019t like the sound of that, she was a bit surprised that her mother hadn\u2019t forced her to eat under her own volition it was quite strange but it was also a relief, to say the least. Looking at her new ward Rebecca finally saw the thing that was hanging around Christine\u2019s neck it was something that looked to be pink and adorned with rhinestones. The more she looked at it the more she realized what it was, it was a dogs collar, Rebecca was quite confused with why Christine was wearing it and why there were so many leashes her mother\u2019s hand. Though Rebecca couldn\u2019t figure out why Christine wore this it was a different story with Jennifer, she was reveling in her own choices to further dehumanize her pet, loving every moment she had with her new collared lover. Jennifer was on a mission to make the girl in her arms into the perfect girlfriend, Jennifer not caring if anyone saw or if they disagreed with her, that wasn\u2019t the point of why she was going to do this not at all. Though Nancy didn\u2019t mind the display that Jennifer was putting on for everyone in the surrounding area, she could tell that the fattest girl in the bunch, the one that she was taking care of was getting hungry. Kiekie still didn\u2019t know how to talk yet or how to voice her thoughts all Kiekie knew was she was famished and needed food now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think its time we go get some lunch Jennifer Kiekie is getting antsy and we still need to stock up anyways\u201d Nancy was the only level headed one about this, having more concern for the whale in the stroller than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rebecca clutching the puppy in her arms like it was a freshly caught rabbit, only made Nancy sigh even louder. Nancy could see the reason why they went here was justified but it didn\u2019t take away that the scenario she was given as keeper of the whale was tiresome. Jennifer did think her friend was right with her assumption of saying that it was time to leave, so many people had the group in their sights though Jennifer didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the now unwarranted attention she didn\u2019t want to more pressure on Nancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly buying enough dog food for a few months, the dog and a few collars and leashes and toys for Christine and Basil the St.benard the group was out of the pet store to go and get lunch. Thinking about where to go wasn\u2019t too hard to think about it, there were multiple places that they could go as they were a big group it was best for them according to Nancy and Jennifer if they went to a hibachi grill. Being in a quaint looking plaza Jennifer drove into a spot that was close enough that it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a hassle to get Kiekie through the doors, Jennifer did have her concerns with that but her attention snapped right back to Christine. Christine was her prize and she was going to make the girl bend to her will and learn to love Jennifer as much as Jennifer loved her little sow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou girls go ahead me and Christine will be in just a bit, I\u2019m just grabbing something from the back and making sure that Basil is comfortable\u201d waving the other three off Jennifer had a large grin upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in the back, shuffling through the bags before stumbling on the pink leash she had bought just for Christine, though she got looks for it she didn\u2019t care Christine was her property and she was going to make sure everyone knew it. Placing Christine on the ground before attaching the leash to the collar, it was a feeling that Christine didn\u2019t like at all but something that she had to get used to. Choking the poor girl forward Jennifer led her sow into the establishment where Christine would eat until she couldn\u2019t anymore no matter if she wanted to or not. Christine had no option but to move forward though she didn\u2019t want to be in here the smells of the various foods were tempting to her senses she knew that she had to ready her self to disobey her master and not eat at all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short while later, Jennifer had joined them at their table, the mother having dallied a bit while walking Christine through the room, wanting to make sure a good portion of the other customers\u2019 attention was on her. As for the little piglet, she was still feeling the effects of resistance, her neck slightly bruised from her collar straining against it. Still, that was only part of how she\u2019d be treated in the future. For now, Christine was sat between her aunt and elder cousin, not yet realizing the implications. Before she could learn of them, though, Nancy brought up the more immediate decision to make; what were they eating? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. While you were making a spectacle of yourself, we figured out what we were ordering, so before anything else, could you decide? No reason to make this little land whale wait is there?\u201d She asked, patting the baby in question\u2019s stomach for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, I guess I\u2019ll just find something that looks good, and Christine will be having a good portion of the menu after all.\u201d Jennifer mused before turning over to Rebecca, \u201cNot to rush you, but once the food is finished, you should try and eat quickly. You can watch the show, but once it\u2019s done, make sure you eat. Since if you finish it after I\u2019ve shown you your new task, it\u2019ll probably have gotten cold. Is that all right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I guess, not that I really have much of a choice, do I?\u201d The five-year-old half mumbled in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, assuming you still want that puppy.\u201d Came the goaded reply, followed by their chef arriving at the table and starting a few tricks on the stove as he asked each of their orders, though he had to pause at the shock of how much they were ordering, not wanting to drop any of the food. All the more once the unlucky man saw that it was for a baby who couldn\u2019t even talk, and began desperately ignoring the eyes the other woman had as she looked at another of the toddlers. Sadly, as the poor employee shortly realized, this wasn\u2019t the half of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, though, he just did his job and was glad that at least the oldest of the children seemed to enjoy it. The child\u2019s intent stare as he shifted the food around, making whatever shape or pattern, even a sort of egg volcano over a pile of ingredients, was enough to push her mother\u2019s gaze out of his mind. It wasn\u2019t very long before some of the food was ready, its maker pushing the plates toward their recipients, unknowingly forcing his young fan to shift her attention. Still, he had to pause for a moment before continuing, making sure it was alright to be paid before finishing the rest of the food, an understandable notion if you understood how much Jennifer ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the trouble, but could you pay for your food now rather than after your meal? I mean no offense, but I'm sure you can understand my concern.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother did, but that didn't keep her from feeling slightly insulted, did she really look like someone who wouldn't pay for their food? Yet, she agreed, there wasn't any reason for her to refuse after all. So, handing over her card and signing the receipt with the provided pen, she only said a short \"It's perfectly fine.\" in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, the chef continued his work, finally starting on the both largest and most deplorable of the orders. Feeling sick to his stomach as he cooked. The customers had a different experience, Nancy stuffing Kiekie with what of her order that\u2019d been finished, and Rebecca herself chowing down with surprising gusto, enjoying both the meal and show. As for the baby, she, in contrast, may not have even registered that something was happening in front of her. Aside from it involving food, of course. Finally, regarding Jennifer and her own pet, the woman was getting a kick out of the server\u2019s squirming, especially since he had no way of avoiding it. Running her hands around the poor child\u2019s body and even choking her by the collar she was wearing whenever she tried to escape. It only got worse once the unlucky worker started serving them portions of their order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplaining how was simple, the mother called Rebecca over to her as soon as the child was done with her food. Beginning to instruct her on what to do. Things like \u201cJust force as much food into her mouth as you can, if she can resist, she can eat,\u201d and \u201cIf she resists, just do this for a little while,\u201d before pulling the collar tight, choking the toddler for a short while with no motive outside of explanation. After that, it was the five-year-old\u2019s free reign, though she was informed there\u2019d be punishment if she gave her cousin an easy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, having moved her chair closer to her cousin\u2019s, Rebecca got started, picking a plate as she let out a shaking order, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make this any harder than it has to be. Eat!\u201d Attempting to shove a forkful of the dish into Christine\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempt being the key word, as Christine, despite her terribly demeaning designation, did not have the all-consuming hunger the namesake was known for. So, as the first shaky bite came closer, she simply turned away, even despite the punishment that would be waiting for her. Though the first voice she heard wasn't a complaint from her cousin, rather, it was her aunt\u2019s admonishment of the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, what did I tell you to do now? Show me, so I know you\u2019ve listened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay,\u201d She quivered, bringing her hand to the collar and pulling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarder! Do you think she\u2019ll listen for a light tug?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No...\u201d She tugged again, causing a bit more discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop dawdling and do it. Do you want me to return the dog?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d Silence was the only response as Rebecca finally yanked the band as she was demanded, reviving some of the strangled coughing from the younger girl, all while feeling her own stomach turn with her actions. The cheery compliments from her mother only making it worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re such a good listener. Now, make sure you feed her with some force as well, not that I\u2019ll stop you if you feel like choking her until she eats it willingly. All I want is for you to have fun with this, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d Again, no acknowledgment came from the five-year-old, the poor, tormented girl left to once more lift a forkful, missing one last time before she was instructed to just pull the pig\u2019s hair in place, in addition to the collar of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it continued, even Nancy was none too willing to look at it, Rebecca was pained to find that it slowly started to get a little easier in routine. Her arms began to go a bit faster, pushing more food into her victim\u2019s mouth at a greater speed than initially. Even beginning to fall back onto strangling as an all-encompassing method of getting Christine to eat, pulling the band at progressively less provocation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jennifer, she was more than pleased by the entertainment, even if she was poised to stop her daughter if she started to act out of hand. Still, she was too engrossed in the show to notice much else, even eating some of her pet swine\u2019s meal in replacement of popcorn. The mother didn\u2019t even realize that there might soon be a problem, as their chef was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The seeds of anger coming from Christine\u2019s heart only turned to sorrow as she didn\u2019t see any way to get out of this situation, was she truly owned by Jennifer? Looking around for someone or something that can help her and seeing nothing, even the chef that was making all the food that was shoved into her mouth was nowhere to be seen. Disappeared of Christine, she felt alone with her master grinning maliciously at Christine only made her feel more trapped than she already felt. Rebecca felt this was as well, not wanting to do what she was doing to her cousin though she no matter how compassionate Rebecca might feel about it she couldn\u2019t deny the gnawing feeling she had of pleasure she got from seeing Christine in this sad state. Acting like the naive girl only doing what her mother told her was what Rebecca told herself as she forced another slice of Chinese cuisine passed the lips of her mother\u2019s pet piglet. Although none of the women was paying attention to what was happening around them it didn\u2019t mean that people weren\u2019t paying attention to them there were a few people who looked on with horror in their eyes seeing a girl who was barely two years old force do crawl around like an animal on the dirty floor and one that was even younger than the one who was force-fed. A blob of a baby who happily gobbled up everything that was in front of her without a second thought, chewing anything and everything that came into contact with her. Most people who looked at this spectacle were entranced by it but others had concerns about it, grabbing their phones they thought the best course would be CPS hoping those dedicated workers could do something about this at least something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026Jennifer, we might have a problem, the chef is gone\u201d Nancy calmly said shoving another mouthful of Ta-Pei into Kiekie \u201cthe might have gotten child services to come here, that could be a big problem\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Nancy don\u2019t worry I already took care of that a before Christine was even brought to the house\u201d quite smug with herself Jennifer reached into her pocketbook bringing out some paper of the utmost importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t know nor did she care what her master was talking about, she was too focused on the food that she had to eat and her sorrow she was feeling toward the one who was forcing her to eat, her cousin. Rebecca also felt the sorrow of what act she was forced to intact though it wasn\u2019t as strong as it used to be, feelings of desire flooded the girl the longer she was forced to do this raising terrifying questions about herself. Did Rebecca enjoy being in control, or maybe she just loved Christine as her mother did, More questions than answers came out of Rebecca\u2019s head, these questions only made her agitated. Not wanting anything to do with what she felt when shoving another piece of food into the unwanting mouth of Christine. This was the price for her love of a dog, though it was quite strange that her mother hadn't made herself more docile instead of whatever this was that wasn\u2019t her nor there all she could do was focus on what she was told to do, though she hated it some of her loved what she was doing wanting nothing more than to feel every growing curve that the piglet gained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was easy to see that people around them were becoming tenser and tenser Jennifer didn\u2019t think anything of it she reveled in what people saw she thought it was quite funny to see how normal people reacted to the scene of a five-year-old force someone younger than her to eat against their will. Sipping a nice white wine as she looked onto the show not even moving an inch from her seat she just took in all the sights and sounds coming from her piglet. The light moans and crying coming from Christine was like music to her ears, only making her feel hotter with each piece of meat shoved into Christine. It was astonishing to see that Jennifer could keep her composure and keep her lust for the tot in check, her face though was a different story, redder than a tomato it was easy to see Jennifer was really into what Rebecca was doing to Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are right over there officer, I don\u2019t know if its child endangerment but I thought I should call you and CPS\u201d rushing through the crowd of people the chef had finally returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t alone though, two people were behind him, this was something that Jennifer was expecting and know what to do to counteract this little disagreement the chef though he had seen. Grabbing her pocketbook, Jennifer was all business she knew what to do in this situation it didn\u2019t rocket science to realize this kind of reaction was going to happen sooner or later. Looking at the officer, she could already tell that this was rookie someone who didn\u2019t know anything about these kinds of situations, by looking at his face it was clear that this wasn\u2019t something her was trained for. The other thought, from his tacky suit to his angered demeanor were the telltale signs of someone who knew the law and would lock her up if Jennifer didn\u2019t have the upper hand on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you people can\u2019t you see that I and my family are having a meal before going shopping\u201d Jennifer calm to the two people who thought it would be best to barge into their meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am I was told by this gentleman you had some quite fat children with you and one was being tugged around by a collar like some kind of pet, is this correct,\u201d the gruff man asked already knowing the answer though as the pet girl was just behind this deranged woman\u2019s leg, another forced to feed the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyes, I do why is that a problem officer\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Jameson, you are violating multiple infractions, I\u2019m going to have to keep your children and bring them somewhere less destructive\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes I am, as I have right here article four, section two signed by a supreme court judge I have control of what I do with my family, do you think you should go against that officer Jameson\u201d Jennifer eloquently stated not even blinking an eye knowing that she had this man where she wanted him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jameson, despite his disagreeable personality, truly wanted what was best for all of the children he could reach. But right now, he recognized a few problems, enough that he couldn't see how any of this spectacle was counted as proper parenting? Two of them were crying for god sakes. But unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t do too much, or anything, about it, not after his mistake last week, accidentally arresting an undercover during a drug bust. Because of that, he was forced to keep from any decisions his superiors would deem rash, even if his own experience knew they were the right ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, none of that would mean he\u2019d stop trying, for now, he decided to use one of his cards, even if he wasn\u2019t certain of the truth of it. \u201cAlright, but if I could say a word of advice, it may be a good idea for you and your family to get an appointment with one of the CPS offices. Since a good opinion with them might keep you from wasting time in situations like this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, Jennifer, after ordering Rebecca to continue with the spectacle, agreed, lying through her teeth of course, \u201cThank you for the suggestion, I\u2019ll be sure to look into it once I\u2019m free. But for now, I\u2019d like to finish the meal with my family, is that alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I just wanted to help. I\u2019ll be on my way now, what was your name again? So I can finish the report.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mistake, full name please.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly irritated from the delay, she repeated herself, \u201cJennifer, Jennifer Hill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll be on my way then.\u201d With that and a plainly apologetic look toward the children, he walked away, pulling his subordinate along with him. Though even as they drove away, he was busy trying to think of how to get back in the higher-ups' good graces, Jameson obviously needed to regain their trust if he was to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily watching them leave, the suspected mother looked over to check on her victims, glad to see her daughter was nearly finished with their piglet, they had to get on with their day after all. But that didn\u2019t mean it was too urgent, the only thing they truly had to do before returning home was to pick up some groceries, another chance she had to tyrannize her niece in public. Smiling, she thought about how she\u2019d be walking the child throughout the store, wondering how many would comment on the leash she was using. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, there was still something she wanted to do where she was, so hefting the overfull child onto her lap, she started enjoying her own share of the toddler. Christine, for what it was, didn\u2019t much care, though that was likely more due to her overfull stupor than pure consent. So Jennifer was free to pinch, rub, and feel her pet\u2019s bloated waist as she pleased, enjoying not just the child\u2019s body, but every other customer\u2019s looks and glances as well. There were still quite a few comments, disbelief at the lack of action on the officers\u2019 part, not to mention at the gall the offender herself had, going right back to her spectacle as soon as the two had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rebecca, she just stood there, the joy of her puppy crushed by the remorse of her actions, not to mention the police. The five-year-old had always heard that the force upheld the law and fought crime, so isn\u2019t the only conclusion left that her mother was in the right doing what she has? What other reason would there be for them to ignore her and her companions\u2019 plight? Of course, the child didn\u2019t know the real reason, but how could she? The officer had made sure there was no indication of what he actually intended to do, and that silence did its part to crush what little hope the girl had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kiekie and her caretaker\u2019s case, the glutton probably hadn\u2019t even realized what was going on, hungrily looking for more food due to the break-in her feeding. And after that, with no more meals being pushed into her wondering face, the girl wasn\u2019t too pleased to find that those meager efforts didn\u2019t change anything, still not getting any food as she continued. Not yet realizing that there simply wasn\u2019t any, though it wasn\u2019t clear whether the baby would care about that problem. And Nancy was stuck searching for an alternative, hoping she\u2019d find one before the one-year-old started crying, making even more of a spectacle than those around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the scene was, for all the other parents still in the building, horrifying. Really, what other response could they be expected to have? Watching the mother force her own daughters to feed each other against their will, and even caressing the body of the one no older than two in an almost sexual way. For a good few of the diners, it was too much, rushing to pay and leave unless they were stuck looking between the group and their own children, most with some variation of shock or disgust on their faces. So, time dragged on, some leaving, some gawking, yet others wondering if the police actually did their jobs, but regardless, something had to happen eventually.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While other Diners were horrified at what they saw, others were the opposite entrance by the bloated stomach of Christine as her master plays with her. Christine, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t registering what was happening around her. In a stupor of some kind, all she knew was she was full and the good feeling she was getting with her stomach being played with after that hearty meal her cousin had made her ingest. Her master pinching and squeezing her stomach was kind of like the reward for being a good girl, also being a little alleviated that she wasn\u2019t on the ground anymore forced to eat and eat. Though she didn\u2019t know what else she could have done to avoid that embarrassing situation, this one wasn\u2019t as bad all Christine wanted to do was embraced being touched by her master. Though Christine was the skinniest out of all of the girls, it wasn\u2019t cause; she was neglected. No, that wasn\u2019t the case; having a late start to gaining was the cause. Having two other fatter girls to compete against was quite a hard thing to win against, Jennifer knew that she would make Christine the winner of this battle with all her heart she will have the perfect slave. Looking at her youngest daughter, it was easy to see that they had some work to do; the girl didn\u2019t even register anything that wasn\u2019t food at this buffet as nothing else mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer kept playing the expanding body of Christine; there was no sense of remorse in her actions; she looked like if she enjoyed what she was doing to the little one that was in her lap. \u201dDon\u2019t worry dear, you\u2019ll catch up to Kiekie in no time, I guarantee it.\u201d Whispering in the ear of her piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jennifer had won; she knew that she was protected, which had only made her victory that much sweeter. \u201cOh Rebecca, don\u2019t forget to get a to-go box for this little piglet, you're gonna need more training when it comes to feeding her; I can tell you're not ready.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, mommy, didn\u2019t I do a good job or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no dear you did great, your just a little unsure, don\u2019t worry I will help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyes, mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was quite unsure about what her mother wanted from her, did she want her to feed the piglet was this a test of some sort it was all confusing. Though Rebecca didn\u2019t quite understand her role in this, she was diligent in her lessons. Rebecca couldn\u2019t deny her mother she had sold herself to her for basil, that wasn\u2019t the worst of it though she didn\u2019t mind too much that her mother was ordering her around what caused Rebecca's fear was the implications of what she was doing. She did feel bad for her cousin there was a part of her that kind of enjoyed what she was doing, there wasn\u2019t a time in her life where Rebecca really had the chance that dominates or force-feed someone, this was a real chance to do that and what she had found out scared her she didn\u2019t think that she would like it as much as she did Rebecca didn\u2019t know what this meant about her. While Rebecca and Jennifer were fawning over their little plaything, Nancy had to cater to the whale beside her. Kiekie was easy enough to take care of most of the time when there was something delicious in front of the blob of a girl, but with the interruption they just had with that detective, Kiekie\u2019s plate was left barren. Though, being so young, Kiekie didn\u2019t understand how this was possible. She was so used to being taken care of, being praised for being a little blob of fat that she didn\u2019t know or understand why the food had ceased. Nor did she know what had happened with that strange man or what that was all about. Kiekie began to bounce up and down in her highchair, causing her body to wobble with each concessive bounce, wobbling and fidgeting in her seat Kiekie doing anything she could to get attention. Mouthing words and tearing up Kiekie demanded to be fed, her mother, on the other hand, was to busy giving each diner an excellent show with their lunch. Pinching and feeling the small potbelly that Christine had kissing the girl\u2019s neck for all to she, unembarrassed in her defiance of the law. Jennifer wanted nothing more for people to know that Christine was hers, a symbol of Jennifer\u2019s lust and depravity. Nancy, on the other hand, didn\u2019t care for the unwanted attention wanting anything more than to leave and continue their escapades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026.Jenn we have to get going, we still have to do some shopping and I think Kiekie needs some new clothes too\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupted from her little makeout session with the realization her friend was correct in this she had unlatched her tongue from the mouth of Christine \u201cOh quite right we do have anything we need to do I guess, we will continue this later my little pet\u201d picking up Christine and using her hip to easier to carry the girl Jennifer paid and begun to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome along Rebecca its time to go, Nancy you have Kiekie right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to get Kiekie out Nancy reiterated to her friend, \u201cYeah, I got the butterball. Don\u2019t worry, just start the car up\u201d before finally getting Kiekie out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally placed into her stroller Nancy was ready to leave, looking at all the horrified faces of parents alike, Nancy did have to say it was funny to see people react this way, in a way. She didn\u2019t think it was something that they needed to worry about, but that detective seemed like it wasn\u2019t a person to give up so easily. Though even if Jennifer did know people in the supreme court was that enough to make sure that no one would touch her, would that piece of paper really help them do whatever they want?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short moment later, everyone, including the now sleeping baby, was in the car, though Nancy wasn\u2019t sure where her friend planned to go. Yes, they needed groceries, but who\u2019s to say Jennifer didn\u2019t have another stop in mind? They did just buy a puppy for whatever the reason, not that she was against seeing Rebecca\u2019s mood brighten a tad as she played with the canine. Still, she had to ask, hoping the response wouldn\u2019t be as rude as it had been the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where are we going now? Groceries? Or have you thought of something else?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGroceries will be in a short while; I want to get our growing pet a few more accessories first, maybe something for Rebecca as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re getting clothes then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, may as well have some variety while I show her off. Still, I\u2019ll have to decide what looks best for our trip to the store. There\u2019ll be plenty of people to see her new outfit after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, and would it be alright if I stay in the car while you three shop? I should watch Kiekie in case she gets up, not to mention, I feel a bit bad for the pup being left in the car alone despite just getting adopted. So, I may as well keep it company for the moment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, it isn\u2019t like they can run off, one\u2019s leashed to me, and the other loves their puppy too much to try any sort of escape.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, well, make sure to call me if you need any help. And don\u2019t forget to grab some clothes for the lump, your daughter\u2019s a bit too gluttonous to fit in anything for long you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will don\u2019t worry.\u201d Was the final response, its speaker soon shifting to a mumble as she tried to decide what she wanted to dress her pet in, \u201c...what to get... a skirt? ...maybe...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it happened, Rebecca hardly noticed the conversation, much too busy hugging and petting the not so little ball of fur. Though whether it was more out of her personal love of the pup, or out of her need to distract herself from what she\u2019d just done and felt was uncertain. But for the moment, the five-year-old just focused on enjoying herself, temporarily pretending she had a regular life, that she had gotten the dog for some normal occasion, instead of as payment to force her cousin full of food whenever her mother ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, though much of the last few months could be described as such, the time girl and pup had together was soon cut short, the car stopping in an open space. With that, Jennifer soon exited the vehicle once she\u2019d parked, opening one of the backdoors to pull out her niece, and made sure her daughter knew she wasn\u2019t being left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca dear, come on out so we can get on with the day. I can come over and open the door for you if you\u2019d like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay with the puppy mom?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can play with them more once we get home, I want to see if we can get any new outfits for you.\u201d Jennifer explained, adding, \u201cOnes that\u2019ll go better with you and your cousin\u2019s new activity.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Disappointed, the toddler unbuckled, hopping out from the now opened door before turning to her mother, \u201cWhat\u2019re we getting?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see when we get inside won\u2019t we, but don\u2019t worry, you can pick out some things you want too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that and it\u2019s slightly more positive tone, Jennifer walked the two girls in the door, making sure she directed the toddlers once they got inside. Now, it wasn\u2019t forceful dragging, well, not for one of them, but it did the job, getting Rebecca to walk while her cousin crawled to their first destination. To anyone, it would be plain to assume that the reason they stopped in that section was for Christine, why wouldn\u2019t the girl\u2019s master want to get them some lingerie? Even if she hadn\u2019t decided whether there\u2019d be any actual clothes for the two-year-old to wear yet. For the moment though, she left her daughter with a single demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Rebecca, look around here and pick out a few you think you like, I give them each a check once I\u2019ve finished with our piglet. Alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the five-year-old gave their begrudging answer as they started the search, \u201cFine...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I\u2019ll give you some time for shirts and such after this, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning down, and lifting her pet into her arms, she continued, \u201cNow, what\u2019ll look best on you? Hmmm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the girl, Jennifer started her browsing, repeatedly forcing her plaything to stand while she compared how the patterns would look on her body. Though, it had to be admitted that the aunt thought most of the possibilities would look enticing, or more so than she already felt the toddler\u2019s body to be. Sadly, Christine, even though she\u2019d digested to a point during the drive, didn\u2019t react as well as her abuser, not understanding the rubbing and squeezing her body got as it was compared to the strange fabric in front of her. Not to mention the breathy whispers that came down the two-year-old's neck, reminding the girl she was most likely doomed to outgrow whatever outfit she was bought within the next few months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Rebecca was enjoying herself a little more than she expected, finding that she actually liked some of the patterns available, even if not so much the idea of showing it off. Still, the child had a few variations put aside, becoming expectably curious about how they\u2019d feel to wear, rather than just look at. That wonderment left a little confusion with it as well, but for the most part, she just focused on ignoring it, not wanting her mother to know her feelings. Shaking it off, the redhead went back to picking, easily finding another one she liked the look of, she just wasn\u2019t sure how long her mother would be taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, the woman was too busy enjoying herself to pay her own daughter much attention, not that Jennifer herself was against moving to the next step. She very much did want to see the two girls try on their selections, almost enough that she forwent the dressing room in regards to the little one in front of her. So, looking again at her selections, the aunt considered which one she wanted to start with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her not even thinking about what happened before was just a bonus. Being alone with her mother and away from Basil was the only thing that ruined this experience for Rebecca, she was like any other girl loving the clothes and fashion to the core. Though she may be a bit plumper than the normal girl that didn\u2019t stop her obsession when it came to clothes, a few different outfits jumping out at Rebecca only made her desire to try them on that much stronger. A lovely purple dress was the one that Rebecca loved the most. Having frilly edges that tied the whole ensemble together was what really drew Rebecca to it,but it wasn\u2019t the only thing that she had grabbed while going down the isles. Finding some daisy dukes and crop-top only made Rebecca feel like a real country girl when putting the cloth against her supple body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, dear, are you almost done with choosing some new clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I got a few already picked out mom.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOkay, good, meet me near the dressing rooms and remember to get different sizes just-in-case; you\u2019re a growing girl. After all.\u201d  Jennifer was quick to remind her daughter of her weight. Telling the tot how much that was going to change in the future.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJennifer could hear the sigh that came from Rebecca; it was a delicious turn of events that made her daughter a pliable pawn in her little games. Christine wasn\u2019t even a pawn, looking down at the leashed toddler who was forced to crawl around like some kind of animal brought a broad grin to her face just by looking at Christine. The small girl\u2019s only look was with despair; she still didn\u2019t understand her role in her aunt\u2019s plans or why she was treated like a piglet, not a human there were many things that she just didn\u2019t understand but wanted to. Her master, on the other hand, didn\u2019t care of the triviality that was Christine\u2019s wants or needs, as all that mattered was that her piglet knew that she was supposed to be the embodiment of her sexual fantasies nothing more. Though she didn\u2019t quite understand this, she was going to learn her place; there was something between her and Jennifer. It was something that she couldn\u2019t put her finger on, but it wasn\u2019t true love or anything so trivial, yet it was clear that her master did care for her and her well being in a sadistic sort of way. None of that mattered to Jennifer; she wanted her piglet to know her place and know that Jennifer was the one in control in this relationship. It would have been a bonus if she could take their love to the next level, but it wasn\u2019t needed, propping up the girl on her feet. Jennifer begun the all-time ritual of trying to match clothes that would look cute on her piglet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChristine only looked at her master with a hint of desperation in her eyes. Jennifer, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t paying much attention to Christine, her eyes were just on the various if not risque-looking clothes that surrounded her. Christine didn\u2019t feel entirely safe her looking around. There were just so many people in this place; it was too hard to take it all in, causing her to have a sort of panic attack. Patting Christine\u2019s back and combing her fingers through her long blonde hair Jennifer put her pet at ease; this might have been the first time that Christine looked up to Jennifer as a protector.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t look at me that way piglet, you know your safe with me and look at all the cute clothes I got you\u201d Jennifer chuckled, lifting a cute pink and white school girl outfit to her piglet's body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChristine couldn\u2019t deny that it did look cute, letting out a little \u201coink\u201d in the content of the choices that her master had made when it came to clothing. Various sizes and styles were draped on Jennifer\u2019s are each one to accentuate Christine\u2019s growing body and beauty if not a little sexy for Jennifer to salivate over. Rebecca\u2019s choices seemed to be a bit more mundane in comparison to her mothers, holding some dressing and frilly things; there weren\u2019t many that couldn\u2019t be considered not suitable for children to wear. That may be the case though, there were some that could be seen as erotic for Rebecca to wear. Though she was proud of her choices wanting to try them on for her mother and cousin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMommy, I\u2019m ready to try on my clothes can we go to the dressing room.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, dear, I think I\u2019m okay too, so let's go, you can show me your choices.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWalking over to the changing room, Jennifer began to carry both her pet and the clothes that she was going to force Christine to wear while Rebecca was skipping and hopping feeling like she was on cloud nine. Her previous trauma of being her mother\u2019s little helper seemed like a distant memory when she was talking about clothes and accessories. While Jennifer spoke with the attendant about various things, Rebecca just got right into the booth. Taking off her blue dress that she had come in with, stopping to look at herself in the mirror. Not wholly admiring herself, Rebecca was more like inspecting the damage that her body had gone through thanks to her mother. She never really had wide hips before, but thanks to her recent force-feedings carried out by her mother, that had changed. Gaining a bit of a pear-shape to her body was the least of her troubles, though far tucked away in her mind, there was always the fear that she would be growing fatter and fatter the more her mother obsessed over her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to put on the crop-top and daisy duke on first, Rebecca began to make her grand entrance, though she may look a little bit like a harlot in this outfit that didn\u2019t stop her she actually enjoyed it, the clothes showed off her body and all the new curves she had acquired. Though her mother may have been right on getting a size or two up, the button that clasped it closed did find a way to impede her movements with her large behind being suffocated by the shorts. Her mother was intently watching seeing her little girl on the catwalk was intriguing, especially when wearing an outfit so revealing as that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As with the first ensemble, the short demonstrations went on, Rebecca going through most manners of normal, and even some mildly questionable attire. But obviously, it wasn\u2019t as if either of the other two involved cared, with one not even paying attention, and the other likely giving a bit too much interest toward the sight. Nonetheless, the five-year-old wasn\u2019t bothered, enjoying the spotlight even with her recent poundage making the outfits a tad tight, sometimes posing a little as she had her fun. Yet, it didn\u2019t last for too long, their guardian soon letting them know it was time for Christine to be walked down the situational catwalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dear, you look lovely in all you\u2019ve tried, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be the same for all the rest we haven\u2019t gotten to yet. But for now, I\u2019ll be having our little piglet show off what I\u2019ve picked out for her. Okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over to her, the growing tot didn\u2019t give much resistance, if there was a bit of disappointment, \u201cWell, okay. I\u2019m kinda curious about how she\u2019ll look too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now come and sit over here while I go get her ready, no need for you to stay standing the whole time.\u201d Jennifer finished, dragging the other young girl over to the dressing room, a few outfits in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that, all but ignoring whether her daughter actually sat down, the aunt pulled her possession into the privacy of the fitting room, taking part of the child\u2019s clothing in hand as she changed her. Though, as she\u2019d shown before, Jennifer couldn\u2019t help herself from just enjoying the toddler\u2019s form, doing her best to feel and squeeze all of her plaything\u2019s now uncovered flesh. But still, she managed to have some self-restraint, she couldn\u2019t be sure whether her form could protect her in that sort of spectacle, unless it was in the privacy of her home of course. Thus, the first set of clothes for the show having been picked, Christine was given one last grope to her stomach before her keeper refocused, moving the girl\u2019s limbs to better fit into the attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, unlike her attitude toward being fed, the piglet did nothing to resist the process, actually seeming a bit happy from the dress-up. It was, if nothing more, a reminder that she was still considered somewhat human, though whether that was true, or if Jennifer was simply trying out some costumes as one would with a poodle wasn\u2019t clear. Nonetheless, the pair did well enough enjoy the results, or the first one at least, with the uniform\u2019s shirt covering her as it was meant to for the most part. Though due to its design, there was quite a bit of visible pudge from the lack of midriff, one that the child\u2019s master capitalized on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Rebecca\u2019s perspective, she couldn\u2019t keep from wondering what was taking them so long, truly, it wouldn\u2019t take such time to simply dress their piglet, as her mother called her. They\u2019d left her alone to the point where the growing five-year-old was somewhat forced to sit down due to her tiring legs, though the reason for that even being a problem wasn\u2019t lost on her. Looking down at the pudge she\u2019d recently scrutinized in the dressing room\u2019s mirror, the girl couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh, having somewhat surrendered to whatever awaited her waistline. But the child wasn\u2019t given too much time to ponder, the two she\u2019d been waiting on had finally decided to show themselves again, even if her gaze was pulled by her cousin more so than Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason was obvious, with the two-year-old clad in what might have been a normal shirt and skirt, if not for their lengths, more aptly, their lack thereof. Truly, the blouse itself seemed to closer fit as a formality than actual sufficient clothing, covering only the minority of the flabby child\u2019s torso, while the rest hung free. As for the outfit\u2019s other half, it seemed likely that time, along with Jennifer\u2019s excessive feeding habits would soon enough make even the toddler\u2019s stomach a more effective covering. And that was even disregarding the plain uncertainty of anything being beneath it, Rebecca, try as she did, couldn\u2019t catch any glimpse of another garment, and from what she\u2019d learned of her mother, it\u2019d be less than surprising to learn that there was nothing to find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, after a time, did get her answer, if from her mother\u2019s watchful eye rather than her own observational ability. Though instead of simply being told of their existence or lack thereof, Jennifer only flipped up her piglet\u2019s skirt, inviting Rebecca to glimpse the truth herself. At that, the five-year-old finally realized what she was doing, embarrassed by the action even aside from her now answered question. Occasionally, as the child watched, she did grow conflicted, acknowledging just how odd it may be for her to be ogling her cousin, yet it wasn\u2019t too strong of a feeling, especially as it was silenced by a stronger urge. A want of, hypocritical as it could seem, more, even the two-year-old's present pudge was starting to be seen as only an omen for the future, by both cousin and master as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was something obvious left undone, Jennifer wasn\u2019t only buying a single outfit for her swelling pet, that would simply be a wasted opportunity. So, deciding to momentarily dismay her daughter, the aunt ushered her toy back behind the curtain, ready to exchange one set for another. Not that there were any restrictions in her other selections, ranging from lingerie to similarly skimpy casual wear. Though even with all of the choices available to her, the aunt had a bit of trouble deciding which one was best, thankfully, Rebecca had started to show interest as well, providing the woman with all the second opinions she might need. Their piglet deserved to be clothed in only the best, all the more on the occasion of a public outing, other people shouldn\u2019t be left without such entertainment after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing her mother presenting her cousin for all to see made Rebecca feel all kinds of things. However, shame wasn\u2019t one of them, being hot and bothered by seeing her cousin in such a position only made Rebecca's growing lust for her cousin that much stronger. Jennifer could only chuckle while she looked at her daughter trying to fight the desires she was feeling, knowing how hard it was for Jennifer it was funny to her to see someone else having the same trouble that she once did. Jennifer entirely focused on making Christine the biggest and most beautiful piglet anyone has seen. Still, it was nice to see her other members of her growing harem see Christine\u2019s potential as well. Rebecca didn\u2019t understand her feelings toward her cousin being a child of only five; neither love or lust was on her mind. It wasn\u2019t the same feelings he had for her mother. No, it was something more primal. Lust was the sin that Rebecca was feeling something that she never really felt before, the feeling was pleasant, to say the least, she wanted nothing more than to see Christine's body more and more. Though it wasn\u2019t sure if this was just Jennifer corrupting or her feelings all Rebecca knew was she just wanted to grope and feel the expanding flesh of her cousin, all of this was quite strange, but Jennifer wasn\u2019t done with Christine, not in the slightest. Tugging on the leash once more, Christine was made to go back into the dressing room. Her master wanted to show Rebecca the other outfits before leaving, though she did know that Kiekie and Nancy were probably becoming quite bored inside the van that was neither here nor there. At the moment, Jennifer wanted to spend time with her piglet and her apprentice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat shall I put on you next?\u201d Jennifer asked herself, kneeling, examining each piece of Christine before coming to a decision.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAh, this one will be perfect for trying on next, I think, it does match you so well after all\u201d She smirked, patting the back of her piglet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t know how to feel about what she was being subjected to, shutting down and accepting her role as a piglet was all she could do. The soft-touch of her master exploring each crevice and fold of flesh did feel nice; the poor girl still felt like she should fight this change, but how? Being stripped once again, as her master took extra time to examine Christine in all of her glory. Taking no time at all, Jennifer began to kiss and grope the naked tot, feeling her lust for Christine take over was a regular thing that she had to combat when not at home. Something that she wasn\u2019t quite good at, when just looking at the poor girl, made her want to do all the naughty things she could think up to her. Becoming enthralled when even mentioning how fat Christine was going to become in the upcoming months\u2014looking over all the clothes that she had lined up for her prized sow, so many to choose from to show her daughter that it was quite tricky to find just one. Though there were a few choices, some were quite large that the couldn\u2019t fit her precious slaver right now they were for later. Many littered the dressing room that Jennifer could have gone with. She had decided to go with one that she thought looked quite cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat about this one piglet? It's quite your style making you look like the princess you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.\u201cOink\u201d Christine solemnly responded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine knew quite well that her feelings toward the outfits that she was to be shoved into weren\u2019t even accounted for. She was just a toy now, and forever, it wasn\u2019t like she had free will anymore. Christine felt like she had to fight this and struggle from becoming nothing more than a sex doll for her master, but, at the same token she, didn\u2019t know if she could keep this up long. Once Christine finally loses her mobility and be fat enough to become immobile, it will be quite hard to deny her master\u2019s request, it was hard now to deny Jennifer\u2019s demands of the young girl. With collar around her neck, there wasn\u2019t much the girl could do at the moment; she knew she had to get away, but right now, that wasn\u2019t something she could do. Enduring her master and the feedings were all she could do, though she had to admit though there were a little more sexual than what she would wear the outfits were cute. Putting her hair in two adorable twin tails, Christine was ready to be dressed. Grabbing something from the rack looking to be another ensemble that over-sexualized her, it was something that she had expected when it came to her master\u2019s tastes. Having some pink booty short and a midriff-bearing shirt made Christine look like she just came off of a Jpop set, with her hair done and dress it was time that Rebecca gets a great look at her newest creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let's go see our little helper and see what she thinks of this outfit,\u201d Jennifer grinned, tugging at the leash to show Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Christine only could \u201coink\u201d like the swine she was, back on hands and feet as they went to go meet Rebecca once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough many people looked at the odd couple with some strange looks, there weren\u2019t many people who were inclined to butt into what the woman who held the leash thought was right for her daughter and pet. With that investigator deterred previously, Jennifer kind of thought she was invincible, it made her feel powerful that wasn\u2019t the thing that she wanted to focus on, though. Getting back to Rebecca hoping to see what the young assistant's reaction would be to this outfit, as it being a tad more revealing than the last one. One not to disappoint Rebecca felt like she should\u2026.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't have been more wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer grabbed the nearest food. Stuck her spoon deep in it and pushed it in her niece's mouth. Christine didn't know what was going on. She didn't like this but her aunt pushed the food in her mouth she had no other choice than to swallow or she would choke for sure. She found out she didn't like her aunt and hoped her parents would return soon. Very soon.<br>\r\nJennifer pushed more food in her mouth but Christine tried to avoid the spoon so hard a lot of the food ended up on her face or on her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was in the meantime rubbing her full belly. It felt hard like a bag of wet cement. She was thinking of what was the best thing to do. Of course, the easiest way was to just eat but did she really wanted that. Her mother would then probably be proud at her. She Always wanted to make her parents proud by doing something but that was just a little thing. Afterward, there wouldn't be anything (or at least not much) different. By this, afterward she would be, or at least after some time, she would be a fat girl. She wasn't sure if she wanted to be fat. She Always used to be athletic and many people thought that was good and we're proud at her for that but not her mother no. She would be proud of her daughter was fat. Did she wanna go so far. Even if she kind of liked the feeling of being full.<br>\r\nA bonking sound woke her up from her thoughts. She looked up and saw Kiekie pushed her tower over again. She liked it to build a tower and then push it over. She also liked it if Rebecca builds a tower she could pushover. How many towers did she pushover in her entire short life? About Thousand. She could even count that far.<br>\r\nShe looked at her sister's belly that looked as round like a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy is proud at you, isn't she. You like being stuffed with food. She doesn't need to tie you up you eat whatever she puts in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie looked up. She noticed Rebecca was talking to her. She didn't understand a single word. Talking was still hard for her. Understanding too. She only knew friendly talking when she did something good, angry talking when she did something bad and normal talking that was normally when other people talked against each other, and not to her so she didn't care about that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that big round belly of yours. I bet you like being a piggy. You would like it to be a piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie looked a bit troubled since she didn't know what to do. Rebecca started to rub Kiekie's belly. Kiekie moaned pleased since it felt very good. But Rebecca was still thinking what to do.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for Rebecca she wasn't in a predicament like her cousin was in, apparently her mother took a shine to the girl and would like nothing more than to tun the young toddler into her blobby princess, Rebecca didn't know if this was a blessing for her  or a nightmare for her cousin all the young girl did know was her cousin felt the same way she did it seemed as the young girl struggled being fed it seemed that all her mother could do was feed the little girl little by little sing her struggling made it hard to feed her, causing most of the food to be on Christine instead on inside her, this was a hindrance for Jennifer as the less food that was made its way to get into her little princess the longer it would take to take this anorexic girl and turn her into as sexy marvel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"what should I do I don't want to be fat but mommy is gonna make me I just know it\" Rebecca stated to herself as she watched more Dora, not even realizing that she was still rubbing her sister's stomach, it is almost like it was becoming second nature to her hands making small circles, tenderly grabbing pieces of fat almost teasing her sister of how fat she was becoming, but Rebecca wasn't noticing any of this she was too focused on her thoughts to notice using Dora as something to stare blankly at while she thought \"what to do what to do, I know that if I fight it I will be tied and fed but at the same time if I don't fight it I will become fatter faster and I don't want that at all\" the more she thought about it the more she dreaded thinking about it for it was just driving her crazy. Kiekie was panting like crazy, her sister playing with her belly  made it hard to concentrate as if felt so good and caused her to moan ever so slightly every time her sister touched her belly it was like a pleasure center for the little one for her stomach has never been so stretched and full that if just felt unreal to her, her moaning was ignored for her sister was still deep in thought, \"this situation is messed up\" Rebecca said to herself not knowing what to do not even a little on what she could do in since her mother was responsible for her and she didn't want to be taken away from her house so she couldn't tell on her mother on what she is doing to her cousin, her sister and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally coming to a decision on what to do Rebecca stopped rubbing Kiekie's belly, which gave the little girl some relief since and looked at her mother who was gushing over her sexy princess, looking at her mother with defiant eyes Rebecca whispered \"I will fight you and I will stay thin if it's the last thing I do, mother\" with a grin she knew her mother didn't hear her statement and that was fine since her mother would probably tie her up again and feed her more if she did hear her, Jennifer was too busy with Christine, or as Rebecca called her \"mother's play toy\" she didn't know how to save her cousin but she did know that it would be a great long show seeing her mother's messy princess grow into a living blob. Just on cue her mother came to her cousin chocolate cake in hand and said to her cousin who was still tied up in a high chair \"who is a good princess\" with no response she fed Christine more food getting some on her dress and face \"aw that's okay princess we will clean you up later but now its time for ...\"</span></div></div>",

Jennifer continued feeding the small bowl of butter but for Christine, it was a way of torture. also, a lot of butter ended on her face or clothes. But finally, the bowl was empty <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what a messy eater are you. Let's get you upstairs to get some clean clothes for you.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She picked her niece up and put her over her shoulder and walked upstairs. Rebecca watched her niece with a: 'I-can't-help-it' look on her face. As soon if Jennifer left the room she went lying on her back with her knees bend in the air and lifting her upper body up. She heard this was a great way to exercise and loose belly fat. She didn't really know how fast she was gaining weight or loose it with this but she heard it was very hard to lose it so she would be doing this for some time. Lucky for her she was pretty sportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer in the meantime undressed Christine and whipped her face clean. Christine felt sick. It wouldn't surprise her if she suddenly needs to throw up. She had done that one or twice in her life and hated that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. You look so bad. Here let me help you.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Christine must say she did't liked her aunt so she doubted she would like what she would do now. But then her aunt started to rub her belly and she must admit that felt good. Very good. After some time of rubbing the pain of a overstuffed tummy went away. She smiled happy to show she felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now let's get you dressed. I thought about something pink. Oh, wait I know something.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe picked up Christine and walked in a room and took out a old box and opened it and took out some pink clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this are old clothes are from Rebecca. I kept them for Kiekie.... However, I doubt she would fit them.\" Jennifer said with a grin \"But you can have them for now. Let's see if you can outgrow them.\"<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

It really wasn't her concern since her auntie and uncle had left Christine in the care of her mother so they should have known something like this would happen or at least Rebecca hoped they did know, if they didn't know that their daughter whom when they last say was a cute thin beauty, skin pale like snow and a smile that could win the heart of people who have ice running in their veins, are going to be in for a treat that was nothing but bittersweet for their daughter was in the hands of a woman who loves fat girls and was making her dreams a reality. This was quite a strange day for Rebecca, for she didn't know why her mother took such a shine to her cousin, she didn't take this much of a liking to Christine before she did act like a regular aunt to Christine before all this happened but nothing this in-depth it was just a particularly normal aunt and niece relationship, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"why am I thinking of this when I could be exercising,\" Rebecca said to herself in a monotone way like she was depressed at how she was thinking at what her mother was doing instead of doing what she should be doing it was all quite confusing. Her sister on the other hand was quite content on what she was doing at the moment her stomach full with goodies and butter, watching her favorite show, Dora the explorer and her sister was nearby to play with her life couldn't be better for her, she did find it strange on how her sister was moving around quite a lot from tumbling to stretching to trying to do gymnastics, all of this was strange and fun to Keikie she wish she could join in but Dora was still on and she didn't want to move at all even though her sister was doing things like jumping jacks and tumbling trying to get this little potbelly Rebecca was staring at her beloved sister in curiosity at what was running through the little girl's mind, how could her little sister be so content on being so chubby, shouldn't a girl be thin and beautiful, Rebecca believed that a girl should be thin and cute, she didn't understand her mother's obsession with fat but it didn't matter as she sweated, as she was exhausted with all the exercise that she was doing an the sweat felt good on her skin for she knew that the more she sweated the less she weighed, as she made her promise to herself that her mother wasn't going to have a easy time fattening her up not as much of an easy time as her cousin would be. Meanwhile upstairs Jennifer was having a ball with Christine, her cute little princess might have been a messy eater but Jennifer didn't mind at all she thought it was quite adorable and that was ideal, Jennifer was actually quite happy that her brother gave her this opportunity to fatten up her niece to nothing more than a blob it was something she was going to accomplish with pride and vigor in her work.  Christine was quite full with food her new pink dress looked very cute upon her but it was very loose on her for it was made for someone that was at least double her age, Jennifer rubbed Christine's stomach it felt very good to Christine as all of her discomfort went away as Jennifer leaned in putting her face next to Christine's she..</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna feed you, and stuff you like a prize-winning piggy. Or like a Christmas Turkey. Or was it Bunny what we ate at Christmas. Maybe both. It doesn't really matter you are becoming fat. You look nice in that outfit to do you know that? Just like a princess. That's what you gonna be, My fat princess. A really fat princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn't understand everything her aunt told her but she knew what a princess was and liked princesses reminding nice drawings from fairy tale books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I believe you ate Turkey at Christmas... or was that thanksgiving? Or perhaps both. But some people also ate bunny at Christmas. She had a uncle who moved too Holland. She never found out why. She had visit him sometimes and Holland seemed pretty boring to her. Lucky for her they were lazy and a lot of cartoons and comedy shows and movies were still spoken in English with dutch subtitles. She they could at least watch T.V. <br>\r\nHowever, he heard a dutch Christmas song he translated it for them. About a boy, and at Christmas day 1964 the cage of his bunny was empty. His dad told him he wast allowed to go into the shed and that he need to go playing and then he would get something nice to eat. He looked for his bunny the whole day but did't find him. When it was time for dinner he finally found out what happened to his bunny, and for the fist time saw his father like a horrible person. The end of the song always had been her favorite part. It was the second day of Christmas 1964. Mother can remember that good my fathers bed was empty, and I told she was't allowed to go in'to the shed and if she went playing she was getting something nice to eat. Of course in that last sentence was on a sadistic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Christine You're all cleaned up and dressed I'm sure you wanna go watch some T.V or play with your toys and with your cousins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked Christine up and walked with her downstairs. Suddenly she heard a lot of noise. She walked in and saw Rebecca doing push ups. That kid was really unbelievable. She need to tie her up to get her to eat and now she was doing exercise to stay thin. She told Rebecca she was too thin but it was hard too forbid her to do exercise since that would build up muscle and would help her gain weight. Just not in the way she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca can you stop doing that. Or else ... eh... your sister and cousin are gonna try to do it too and they're to young for that and they could hurt themselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mommy.\" Rebecca said with a sigh.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rebecca felt worse when it came to her cousin Christine for it seemed like her mother had a special interest in her cousin for some reason Christine was singled out by her mother to become her pet project, Rebecca didn't really know what that meant but she knew it couldn't be good at all since all her mother wanted to do was fatten her cousin, her sister and Rebecca herself up. Jennifer was humming her usually happy song, the song she usually sang to herself when she was cooking, but to Rebecca it was the trouble song cause she knew that it was almost dinner time, she couldn't believe how fast today went by it almost seemed unnaturally short, but that wasn't the thing that made poor Rebecca uncomfortable what made her uncomfortable was that dinner was coming up and that meant it was almost time for her to be tied up once more for her mother's amusement and it was almost time to be fed until she was about to puke again these sensations was some that Rebecca wasn't looking forward to at all it was actually something she was trying to avoid at all cost, she didn't know what to do when all of a sudden her train of thought was interrupted by a crash of some sort, shocked at the sound Rebecca quickly got up, frightened a bit and looked around. The crashing noise she heard was nothing more than Christine and Kiekie playing with the blocks that were put out by her mother for them to play with it was sort of silly to be afraid of blocks but justified for she thought it was her mother getting the ropes ready for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"oh just some silly blocks\" Rebecca said in a sigh of relief as she thought it would be something more threatening to her well being like dinner time, as Rebecca laid back down on the couch a happy grin on her face on how it was just blocking that made the noise of the crashing sound, she begun to zone out once more looking upon the television as Spongebob Squarepants was on doing something silly as always the case with this kind of television show. Just as she was completely zoned out a knock came upon the door which made Rebecca focus again \"who's at the door mommy?\" Rebecca asked as her mother was excited with anticipation on who it was at the door, ignoring Rebecca question she immediacy opened the door to reveal that it was Jennifer's best friend Nancy at the door with a cake in hand, Nancy was a thin woman with rosy cheeks and red hair somewhat of a fashionista look to her. \"hi Nancy thanks for coming for dinner, I'm glad your here\" Jennifer said to her old friend as she grinned and laughed a bit with her friend Nancy finally opened her mouth to say \"so these are the piglets you need help with, my I knew you loved fat girls but they are so young and two are your daughters you sure you want to do this?\" she asked with an inquisitive look upon her face as she talked with her old friend on this touchy subject. \"oh my yes I am quite sure a fat girl is a happy girl but don't worry my daughters won't be the biggest ones that seat is already taken\" Jennifer had a sort of triumphant smile on as she stated this, which made Nancy a big curious on who had this honor, it was plain to see who but Nancy wanted to hear it from Jennifer \"this little one will be the biggest, not even a king sized bed will be able to hold her mass, she's my cute little princess\" Jennifer said which at first surprised Nancy but she then accepted this a truth, \"well then we should get started with feeding her right jenny?\", as Jennifer Kissed Christine on her lips causing the little girl to blush Jennifer said \"indeed it is dinner time after all\"</span></div></div>",

This way she had just a bit more time to digest all the food in her belly then she would be able to eat more food without feeling ready to burst. It also seemed like Nancy was helping her. Rebecca always liked Nancy. She babysat both girls many times and was always nice and Always gave them some snacks. But Rebecca always worked off every single calorie she consumed. <br>\r\nRebecca suddenly realized she really started to hate her mother. Really hate her. What she did was just wrong. But who would listen to a toddler? They probably thought it was just a game or something unimportant like she didn't want to eat her vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Christine was tied up again and the little girl knew what her aunt wanted to do but she tried to turn her head away but still, food was forced into her mouth but also a lot ended on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're such a messy little eater, my cute fat princess. You're gonna be so fat not even a king-sized bed would be able to hold you. You will be morbidly obese. I gonna make you so fat. you will have the weight of a morbidly obese adult person while you're still a little girl and you will get even fatter. My fat princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to Jennifer. I said I wanted to help you fatten those girls up. All three of them. I'm fine with that don't get me wrong. I like doing it... but that girl isn't gonna stay here forever. I'm sure we can fatten her up a lot... but she will go back to her parents after some time. I don't know if we be able to fatten her up so much in such a short time. Another thing is what will her parents say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't worry too much about them. They always thought she was a bit thin. Even if not that won't be your problem. Don't worry about it... but you're right about the second part. How can I keep her long enough here? Do you have an idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Except for hiring a killer. But that's illegal. But let's see how fat we will be able to get her. I can go look for some weight gain stuff if you would like that.\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would really like that. Now open up Christine. You're not gonna leave until you ate all this.\" Jennifer said calmly while she fed her a half bottle of liquid butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After they were done Christine believed that if she would eat anther single bit she would really explode. Or if you hit her with a sharp object she would explode like a balloon. She felt really sick like if she could throw up any second. She heard all kinds of gurgling noises in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Christine you can go play but we soon need to clean you up later.\" Jennifer said while  she untied the ropes and took her to the living room. Kiekie already made whining sounds to let her mother know she wanted to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do want to be fed first Kiekie. Well fine, I guess. Rebecca. Keep an eye on your cousin all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom. What ever.\" Rebecca mumbled happy she got some more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer entered the kitchen with Kiekie in her arms and put her in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tie her up. Kiekie does it willingly.\" Jennifer said. \"Oh, she such a good little piggy. You like to eat don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie showed that she liked to and ate every thing what was brought to her. Especially the other half bottle of liquid butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she likes liquid butter. You know this one would be way easier to fatten up to become the fattest. She's pretty fat already so she has a head start. Nancy said.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But I want that other one to be the fattest, she might be number two.

She could understand if Jennifer only fattened up her and Kiekie even while she hadn't a clue why on earth her mother would want to do that, but why fattening up her niece. It wasn't her child. Her parents would pick her up sooner or later. She should know that. She really hated her mother and looked at her while she squinted so much with her eyes it was just tiny cracks filled with hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so mean at your mother!\" Nancy yelled. \"In my time children learned how to behave to their parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah like I told you she's a real troublemaker.

More and more things disappear off the table and ended up into her stomach her mother hummed with glee as her daughter ate and ate the food off the table it was a good day  for her and in the months ahead it will come even better Jennifer believed that she could make her daughters and niece into cute blobs no matter how frustrating two of them were when it came to feeding them and frustrating was an understatement as Christine didn't know any better than her aunt was doing this so that she could be more adorable and out of love, Rebecca did know better and should just accept her mother's love without question but the four-year-old was heart set on fighting her mother without a second thought in the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer daughter wasn't making it easy but Jennifer and Nancy persevered and pulled ahead in what they were doing it was actually gratifying to Nancy to help her friend create a little girl blobby harem of sorts, but at the same time she understood why and at the same time she didn't understand why Jennifer was so attracted to Christine. She wondered if she would be in trouble with Jennifer when Christine's parent's come back from Africa but that was something that would have to be decided once her parents get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t At the moment however she had to deal with Rebecca as she was still as fussy as ever, her stomach bloated with all the goodies that were stuffed into her little body it was unimaginable how much food was inside this little girl's body, Rebecca could believe it as her stomach hurt as she felt like she was going to burst with all the food that was inside her, sitting in there chair as if she was in a food coma, as the ropes came off and her dress stretched slightly  her mother was quite pleased with the development of her daughter, \"okay Rebecca you can go to bed now I will be up shortly I have to change the messy princess's dress first\" Jennifer said with glee, Rebecca struggled up the stairs but finally got into bed but she couldn't think straight right now all she wanted was sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week went by. For two girls it had been the worst time of their entire short lives. Christine and Rebecca were tied up every time when it was time to eat and were stuffed until their bellies hurt. However, Kiekie had the time of her life. She always used to have a big appetite and she seemed to have a taste for greasy, fattening food and ate everything they handed her. Jennifer was proud at Kiekie and she was noticeably fatter than the other two and gaining more than the other two and seemed to like it. Christine slowly got used to the feeding mostly she started to eat when it started but after some time she had enough and then Jennifer and Nancy still forced more food in her mouth. However, the biggest problem was Rebecca. She tried to refuse the food every time. Jennifer also saw Rebbeca doing exercise every now and then. she also gained less than the other two. She of course also had more body for the fat to spread... but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca sat on the couch watching her little sister and cousin play together. They liked playing with each other. She looked at her sister and could clearly see her sister belly poking out between her shirt and pants. Kiekie was really getting fat. She also saw her cousin's belly got a bugle and no matter how hard she tried to lose weight she knew she had also gained some pounds and she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\nKiekie and Christine did share their toys nicely and Christine often talked to Kiekie and Kiekie listened while she shouldn't be able to understand. Also, Rebecca tried to learn her to walk but Kiekie's legs still weren't able to hold her, and with her weight gain it might take a long time before she would be able to walk. But at least she could crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seeing how this goes after some time her belly will drag over the floor while she crawls,\" Rebecca said to herself irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She must admit she felt a bit alone sometimes. Fine, she had Kiekie but Kiekie was so much younger than her. She wished she had someone close to her own age. Someone she could talk with. She couldn't do that to Kiekie. She knew her mother was fattening up all three of them but she couldn't figure out why. Was she a witch liked in that story of Hansel and Gretel. No her mother didn't live in a gingerbread house, she perhaps wasn't a beauty but not ugly like a witch, she didn't have a broom, but did have a vacuum cleaner, and she never ever seemed to have eaten any other children. Besides Hansel and Gretel was a fairytale and grandma who told them those stories always said that they weren't true. It was just stories that where there to learn a lesson. Like the story of Hansel and Gretel was to learn that not everyone is as nice as they seem at first, and also that you need to be careful to trust people you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that stories don't tell you what to do if your mother is a wicked woman who tries to fatten up her two daughters and their cousin and has her crazy friend helping her,\" Rebecca mumbled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nancy lived in their house now for about a week and Rebecca didn't really like her. She also seemed to like it to fatten them up. But why? If she knew that she maybe could find a way to stop this. Maybe. As ls long if she didn't know why she couldn't do anything.<br>\r\nShe hoped to find a solution for this fast or else she would end up like one of those overweight kids in some talk shows. She didn't want that.  <br>\r\nKiekie and Christine just were ready building a tower from blocks and pushed it over both loudly laughing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Could you two try to be a little quieter. I'm trying to think here.\" She said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reason could her mother have? She needed to find an answer fast. All her clothes were getting tight lately and it was almost lunchtime.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This wasn't a happy experience for Rebecca not in the least it was scary and nerve-wracking to see what her mother was doing, slowly she crept to the kitchen to see what Jennifer and Nancy were up to, what they were doing was quite a shock to Rebecca, they weren't getting lunch ready or anything they were just sitting at the kitchen table having a nice cup of coffee and chatting up a storm. This was awkward for Rebecca for she was dreading the worst, that once she looked into the Kitchen she would be picked up and placed into a chair and force fed but that wasn't the case, yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"so is it really that bad\" Nancy asked sipping her coffee as she waited to hear her friend's reply on the situation that was unfolding itself, \"yes it seems that my brother's wife contracted some sort of viral infection and she is being moved to a hospital, I am quite worried about it I couldn't sleep at night just thinking about what is happening over in Africa?\" shakily Jennifer took a sip of her coffee looking like she was quite distraught over the whole affair that was happening to her brother and his wife. Hearing about what happened to her aunt Rebecca was not feeling so worried about lunch anymore and more worried about her aunt's condition and if she is doing alright, what will happen and when will they come home, questions like these were swirling through the young girl's head as fear began to set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \"so  Jennifer what are you going to do with your niece and how are you gonna break it to her that her mommy is in the hospital?\" Nancy asked with an inquisitive look on her face on what Jennifer would do,  Jennifer wondered this herself as she didn't know how to tell people bad news she never could but she thought about if she gave her cousin some cute clothes and kissed her it would be alright, \"Nancy can you feed the girls lunch except Christine I got a party in mind for her, so I will back just have to do some shopping is all\" Jennifer ran off before Nancy could say anything to her friend but she knew that she could take care of it before Jennifer would come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeeing what time it was Nancy say that is was lunch time already and started to make some tasty fattening snacks for the two girls, Nancy started to feel like an actual mother this made her proud to be apart of making blobby girls with her friend it was something that she kind of like to do but she didn't know about  the tying down and feeding them it was kind of foreign to her. As she made a big plate of burgers with fries for lunch she called Rebecca and Kiekie for lunch, it took Rebecca a while but she was too depressed about her aunt to actually fight so even though she was force-fed she ate with no questions, it was too depressing to think about her aunt but she couldn't stop thinking about it. Christine was hungry too so she crawled over to Nancy, she was a little wobbly with walking on her own, but she is learning as she got over to Nancy and asked for a little something to eat the woman said  \"sorry Christine your gonna have to wait your aunt has a surprise for you\" not really understanding what Nancy said Christine sobbed a bit.

But the Jennifer came in with a huge cake, pink collar, and pink clothes. Rebecca looked at them wondering what was her mother's plan. Even Kiekie forgot her food for a moment. Jennifer put Christine in her high chair and went sitting across her with a worried look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up sweetie I have some terrible news. Something happened to your mother and she became very sick, and she's in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer hoped Christine understand enough to know what was going on.

Mommy might get better. Look what I have for you a pink dress with a matching collar. Just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca couldn't believe how fast her cousin was distracted. Like most young girls Christine loved everything pink. Even while a thought in her head kept having worries about her mom she wanted to try the pink dress and collar on. Kiekie didn't care so much for clothes and focused on her food again. But Rebecca noticed the eyes that looked tiny in her sister's fat face looked greedy at the cake.<br>\r\nRebecca belched loudly hoping it would make her feel less stuffed. But it didn't help much. She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can go,\" Nancy said and untied Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca slowly waddled to the living room and went sitting on the couch. She lifted her shirt and could see her belly started to hang over her waistband creating a nice muffin top. Since she used to be thin and tried to lose the weight she became only chubby but she couldn't deny she was gaining. But on the other hand, her cousin gained more. But Kiekie gained the most and wasn't chubby but just fat. Her sister was doomed but seemed to enjoy it. <br>\r\nShe knew her cousin would be forced to eat the entire cake. However, she must admit the cake looked delicious and she wouldn't mind having a small piece of it.<br>\r\n She still worried about her aunt. But her aunt was in the hospital, If her aunt died, what would happen to Christine?<br>\r\nRebecca shivered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mother was preoccupied with Christine at the moment to trifle with such things as what Rebecca was doing or if it was actually time for her piglets to sleep, the couch was quite comfy anyways so Rebecca didn't feel like moving at this second, she she was stuffed like a turkey and it didn't feel good for all that food to be in her little system all she wanted to do was relax and sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer chubby muffin top still digging  into her jeans it was a uncomfortable experience for Rebecca, as it would be for anyone in her position, she was at least she was counting her blessings that she didn't look as big as her sister yet Kiekie had no shirts that fitted her as well anymore most were tight on her and some what cutting off the circulation to her arms as the soft flesh of fat was making her arms pillowly and big, but she had the biggest gut of all three it would seem but this was a contest that Kiekie would for her mother had plans, interesting plans that made her mother giddy just thinking about it. Rebecca's fat went more towards her belly than anywhere else something that she didn't like at all it made her feel weird and her stomach was always digging into her pants or whatever she was wearing for that day, it was quite uncomfortable for her to deal with it, she knew in her mind that it was only going to get worse the farther down the line they got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n`\tChristine's body had more of a pear shape to it, as most fat  went to her belly, hips and thighs, but that isn't to say her arms didn't look bigger also, Yawning at how late it was for her and Kiekie, she hoped that she would be allowed to go to bed soon for if not Rebecca contemplated to go to sleep right there on the couch,it was so very comfortable it was putting her to sleep very quickly. As if it was a god send message that these little girls were tired, Nancy came to show Kiekie and Rebecca off to bed while Jennifer had her alone time with Christine trying to comfort her and pamper her, as she knew that her sister in law was in critical condition it would be bad if Christine starts thinking about her mother and doesn't eat so to make the girl as happy as possible, which wasn't going to be very, for this girl was still fighting the process to become a immovable mass of flesh, but her pear figure was very enticing to Jennifer and looked quite well on the two year old dressed in pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially if it was all for her but now seeing the cake knowing it was all for her made her moaning. Strange that some things look so good, but when you have them they appear to be not so good if you thought at first. Christine moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you moan young lady.

Meanwhile downstairs Jennifer was having a nice chat with Nancy about her sister in law, as it was still relevant topic that was bugging Nancy for Jennifer was set on making her brother's daughter  into the biggest two year old the world, no one knew this but Jennifer\u2019s brother told her that one of his dreams is to actually have a daughter of shear size that she would be nothing more than a blob, now he was just joking around with her little sister but at the time Jennifer didn't realize this and to this day still doesn't know that he was joking with her, so she will do everything in her power to help her big brother's dream come true Christine will be the fattest two year old he has ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cso Jennifer what do you have planned today I mean we have been feeding them all week, I think today is a day to just relax for one afternoon, don't you think\u201d Jennifer begun to contemplated at what her friend was saying and knowing that Nancy was right in her assumption if the girls didn\u2019t have a little fun, it would be harder to feed them, since they were fussy as it was Jennifer had a feeling if she fed them more often it would only make them more fussy, so to combat this she thought a nice day out in the community and maybe going to the mall would lift everyone's spirits and make the girls less fussy to feed in the long run. As Nancy woke up and dressed all the girls for the upcoming adventure that they were going to partake in Kiekie got a nice blue jeans and a blue shirt that let her big belly breath as bit, Rebecca put on her signature brown hat with a red shirt and her play overalls that she wore when ever she was going outside for she didn't want to get her nice clothes dirty, but it seemed it was a little hard to get on thanks to her recent weight gain. Christine was put in a nice pink dress that her aunt bought for her it was a cute dress but it was some what tight on her growing belly as her pear shape was just beginning to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJennifer was getting the carriage ready for their quest outside of the house hoping that she had everything that she needed to have a great day with her friend and the kids as well and just encase, she brought a few zip ties with her, hoping that they will eat like good little girls, but she wasn't going to chance anything as they headed off to the mall. Christine has never been to the mall as her mother has never taken her to one, as she was excited to see this mystical place she also wondered what do people do at the mall anyways? As the car got to the mall her anticipation was killing her, bouncing up and down in her seat wondering what she was about to see. What the girls didn't know that their first top was actually the food court as a public force feeding session with Rebecca and Christine is something Nancy wanted to do and she knew that this mall would be the perfect place to do it, as they got closer and closer to the food court Nancy got happier and happier, coyly looking at her friend as Jennifer was sitting with the three girls seeing that the place was filled with people she thought this would be a great opportunity to see how much of a messy girl Christine is.</span></div></div>",

She could't be planning to force feed them here. There were a lot of people around. They could all see it. Fine they all three were fat but a lot of other kids around here too so no one could really made a mean comment about that, but tie them up and force feeding they could't do that on a place were everyone could see them, some would see that those kids were in a lot of pain.

Rebecca looked in disbelief how much food Nancy bought for them. It was full with all kinds of fattening food. Rebecca looked a bit jealous of Kiekie. With a mother like Jennifer and her friend Nancy it was perhaps better if you liked eating and getting fatter Just like Kiekie. Be a fat girl that got fatter liked it and had't a care in the world except when she would get food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I got some delicious food for them. I hope you two eat good since I have to feed Christine first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie's fingers already found the first fattening piece of food and wolfed it down. Rebecca started eating.

Nancy was rubbing\u00a0 Christine's stomach in a motherly fashion \"looks like our special little girl is becoming quite a magnificent blobby princess\" Nancy was smiling like a Cheshire cat, meanwhile Jennifer was up to the counter at getting some delicious pizza for her very thin daughter Rebecca. \"Hmm let\u2019s see, can I get two large peperoni and sausage\" Jennifer asked the teen behind the counter in a loving kind of way, that the kid thought nothing suspicious about it. Before returning to the table where a stuffed Christine desperate to escape the feeding forced upon her, her dress ripped in half exposing her pink panties to the public, this was somewhat embarrassing to her, with a light moan\u00a0and burp\u00a0she felt a lot better, as she stared at her cousin, she herself had an fear that what was happening to her\u00a0 was also going to happen to her, the fear of becoming nothing more than a blob was always in Rebecca mind as she looked at her cousin with saddened eyes, Nancy was humming a merry tune, as she looked up to Jennifer holding three meat lover's pizza for Rebecca.<br>\r\n\u201cNancy can you burp Kiekie for me and tie up Rebecca while I get a nice plate for the princess\u201dJennifer asked with a grin upon her face, \u201cof course Jennifer\u201d Nancy said while picking up Kiekie, Kiekie was a good little eater no fuss or need to force her to eat unlike her sister or cousin those two on the other hand were quite a hand full,but sooner or later they will be obedient little blobs like Kiekie, a light burp came from the little girl as she giggled and yawned a bit, smiling at her cousin who was bloated from her previous meal. Mean while her mother was placing pieces of pizza on a plate for her sister, Rebecca struggled as Nancy tied her hangs to the well crafted chair that was at the food court, pizza was stuffed on her mouth making her open her mouth or choke to death from the tasty pizza, \u201cthat\u2019s a good girl\u201d her mother said with a girl, Rebecca was wondering what laid for her in the future as it looked bleak for her well more for her cousin than her but she didn't want to think about that right now as five slices were shoved in her mouth her burps even smelt like pizza and sausage it was quite disturbing to her still that no one took notice to them at all. A snipe echoed through out the food court, looking down feeling like she was going throw up, Rebecca noticed that her favorite brown belt snapped off from her feeding, \u201cdoesn't that feel good precious\u201d Jennifer asked while she wiped off Rebecca face and rubbed her belly through her dress. Placing Christine and Kiekie in the stroller and Nancy carried Rebecca, the two women continued shopping.</span></div></div>",

Or little princess needs a queen sized bed for when she becomes queen sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca knew that if no one stopped her mother and Nancy Christine would be queen sized at the age of 10. Or maybe even before. She wondered what she did too deserve this. She thought she always had been a good girl. Fine she broke the CD player when she was two but that was on purpose. How was she suppose to know that thing could break of? But most of the time she had been pretty nice.<br>\r\nShe also did't make her mother proud but she could't imagine that stuffing yourself fat was the right way to please your mother.

Why could't her mother be like them. <br>\r\nShe suddenly noticed they were in a bed store and saw what her mother want for Christine.<br>\r\nRebecca only wanted one thing.

Christine and Kiekie looked up to Rebecca as the big sister she was and the problems they were in had made her job as big sister much harder than it once was. Slumping on the side of a wall holding on to her hat in fear of what was going to happen to them, Rebecca was trying to be strong but her mother was really getting into feeding the girls to make them into nothing but her adorable blobs. This was quite the problem for Rebecca for this wasn\u2019t the life she wanted to live she would rather be a fashion designer than her mother\u2019s personal play toy and she knew that in her heart, her cousin and sister felt the same way, even if they couldn't talk in complete sentences yet.

Getting to the car as Jennifer and Nancy carried two over stuffed girls towards the car Rebecca still pondered at what has her life become, but with a big yawn and a big stretch revealing her growing chubby body, she was officially tired. Seeing the girls were defiantly sleepy it seemed a nap for them would be a great idea, since in a while the movers will be coming to the house anyways to deliver the bed Jennifer had purchase all the sleepy girls were gently put in the car buckled up and off to the house for a nap<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to that sport I was able to defend myself to that jerk that tried to rape me. I showed him. But what I mean is girls should listen to their mother, or their aunt for Christine's matter. What's wrong with kids those day. They don't seem to listen anymore.\" Nancy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's wrong with those kids. I did my best to raise them to become good little gainers. Kiekie is. But Rebecca not. Christine is also not gaining willingly. But perhaps she'll change. Hopefully.

Little kids many times imitate their older siblings or cousin.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Perhaps you're right. Maybe we should focus also a bit more on Rebecca.

That nap had been a good idea. She went sitting up straight but felt something on her lap. Surprised she looked down and saw it was a roll of fat.

But what could she do about it.?<br>\r\nShe could walk away but she knew kids who walked away were mostly found and brought back home. Besides she was just a toddler. There was't a change she could survive on her own.

As quiet as she could she begun to make her way to the bathroom it was a trek that she wasn\u2019t looking forward too but one that was necessary no the less, creaking the bedroom door open and examining the outside for others in the hallway was just the first of many dangers that laid before the young Rebecca. Slowly Rebecca crept from room to room hoping that not a soul would pot her, with all her might she prayed that no one would spot her as she became increasingly paranoid as she got closer and closer to the edge of the stairs. After much uncertainty she finally made it to the bathroom, it was a beautiful bathroom, that had a nice jungle motif, \u201cnow wasn\u2019t the time to admire the bathroom\u201d Rebecca said to herself while quickly drinking her water to get back to the room. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000A large thud came from downstairs and some grumbling of voices she couldn\u2019t hear quite well, curious about what was happening downstairs Rebecca, despite her better judgment began her decent to downstairs where her mother and Nancy were, this decision was one that the poor Rebecca thought couldn\u2019t be any worse, yet she still pressed onward. Hearing the grumbling of movers made Rebecca more secure to go downstairs, a heavy aroma of food began to tickle the nose of potatoes, meats, sweets, and stews, all these delicious smells was coming from the kitchen. Rebecca just had to investigate these enticing smells and what she was up against exactly and how to avoid the up coming force feed, inspecting the kitchen so no one could see her was quite tricky indeed but no one seemed to notice her poking her head in the kitchen. Looking around in a puzzled way as to what the adults were talking about, it seemed to be nothing that concerned her  but she just had to listen in even if it was just boring adult talk, listening and looking at how much food that was being prepared was something that worried her. Worried and paranoid that all that food was going to end up in her chubby belly Rebecca hid in the once computer room but now was just storage slowly she turned the nob to see nothing but a pink princess wonderland, \u201cguess this is Christine will be living\u201d she said to herself, looking around she heard the distinct sounds of the movers leaving and this frightened poor Rebecca, scurrying to find a hiding spot she hid under the giant pile of toys where no one would find her.

What happened to them, she wondered to herself, stomach full of food and worry plastered across her face, what was to become of her, her aunt comforting her was quite nice and soothing too be comforted like she was,but she was still afraid of what was to become of her it was a fear that was quite justified by the feelings she had in her mind at this minute.Meanwhile upstairs Rebecca crept and slithered about not making too much noise to alert her guardians of her whereabouts, she crept to the edge of the room hoping to peer out to the world that she was so far from yet so close, she could almost touch the mid summer air that was blowing in from outside, how she longed to play outside again and become a happy family with her mother and father, how she missed her father and always wondered what was happening to her mother to make it so she acted the way she was now, the heart break that came with the death of her husband was too great and this fat obsessed shell was what was left.she wanted to see what her mother was doing downstairs with her sister and cousin but it was such a risk that she didn\u2019t know if it was worth it or not, debating weather to go down stairs or stay upstairs was still in her mind but her body was so curious at what was happening that is was moving on its own. Silently she walked down the stairs seeing that her sister was in the living room playing with some blocks and just watching television while her cousin was still at the table squirming wondering what was going to happen to her</span></div></div>",

Do you?\" Rebecca whispered to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie looked at her with a puzzled look on her face. Se had't a clue what her sister was telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen in the meantime Christine felt like she was in the worst place ever. If she knew what the word hell meant she would be sure this was it. her belly was stuffed. She felt like if she would eat just one other bite she would burst open. Just like that animal in one of her storybooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine. Look what I have here for you.\" Jennifer said. \"I have something delicious for you. A pie. All for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked with big eyes at the pie. Normally she loved pie. But right now the thought of pie made her feel like throwing up. All she wanted was to be out of here back with her parents. She would moved heaven and hell for that. Softly she started to cry. long and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second Jennifer. I'm not sure we need to continue now. I mean she's crying. If we feed her now is't there a chance she chokes. I mean I'm fine with fattening those kids up, but choking is another story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm sure she will be fine. She won't choke. She knows when she has too swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut out a piece of pie. Put it on a fork and brought it to Chritine's face. But the little girl turned her face away from the piece of pie and closed her mouth so tight you could't even open it with a crowbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use Jennifer. This one won't eat anymore. At least not for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Christine. What do I need to do with you. You make about just as much trouble if Rebecca. Now just eat the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to run down Christines face. She opened her mouth again to cry. That was a mistake. As soon if she had opened her mouth Jennifer pushed in a piece of pie. Christine knew she could only shew and swallow or choke. At this moment choke did't seem such a bad idea but surviving instinct told her the chew and swallow it. So she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking about Rebecca where  is that little rebel? You did't saw her upstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when I was there. I can look again for her. Should I look again for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah do that. She also needs to eat to become a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was sitting next too Kiekie. But went she heard to door open she hide under the couch and hold still. She did't made a sound and waited and saw the feet of Nancy going upstairs. She wondered what would happen if they did't found her.<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

This fact defiantly scared the little girl this must be why she hid from her mother and Nancy but this didn\u2019t rattle Nancy she knew that this would happen this hasn\u2019t been her first feeding a toddler and it defiantly will not be her last. Meanwhile a very full Christine sat in a highchair right next to her cousin as they both were at the table of a decimated table not a crumb was left for Rebecca to munch on, Jennifer wasn\u2019t happy that she couldn\u2019t feed her oldest but this wasn\u2019t so bad since Christine fell in love with her niece. Jennifer knew that she was just her niece and one day when her brother comes back she will have to give her back but she\u2019s hoping when that day comes it will be when little Christine become so big that king sized bed in her room will be too small for her this was her dream for her niece, she was hoping her piglet would become an obedient little girl and a gift for her brother. This was her plan but it seemed that Christine was never going to give her control of her willing this will have to do while she broke poor Christine\u2019s spirit, sighing Jennifer patted her daughter Keikei\u2019s stomach it was much larger than Christine\u2019s she knew that she wanted to keep a record of the girl\u2019s growth but all she needed was a camera and Rebecca. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Yawning the two girls were quite sleepy due to them not being able to stay awake for very long and due to the food being digested by them a dinner for five, comprised of sweets wast quite a beating for their little stomachs Jennifer begun to put Christine into her new room like a princess she was placed into the giant king sized bed. Smiling at the little girl in the giant bed she looked like nothing but a speck on the massive bed it was quite and abysmal thought by saying that this girl would soon envelop this giant bed by herself in shear size, grinning at this thought Jennifer lightly kissed Christine on the lips and whispered into her ear \u201cgoodnight little princess you will soon be your father\u2019s prize sow\u201d lightly closing the door behind her. Now was the hard part Putting her obese baby Kiekie into bed, her large globe was massive for her size, just by seeing her a pig out made her mother hopeful for the future of Kiekie and her decent into immobility, heaving the large sleeping girl wasn\u2019t an easy task as the not waking her or dropping the chubby girl was a very hard balancing act. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Climbing the stairs was such a haul but she made it and not once did she wake the little girl, in the crib next to her sister\u2019s this was more harder than it seemed but, when finally tucked in and kissed was done it was time to find and discipline her oldest daughter, searching and searching they had finally found the camera, yet not Rebecca they still didn\u2019t know where she was, this panicked Jennifer tossing the pile of stuffed animals they had finally found young Rebecca hiding among them, yet she still try to run away from the two women yelling at her mother \u201cno I don\u2019t want to be fat\u201d Rebecca scream as her mother caught her and placed her in bed next to her fat sister, \u201cyour gonna be punished for your actions I don\u2019t care what you want its what your gonna get\u201d your grounded Missy\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was now Sunday. The two women had been stuffing the three girls incessantly, and it had certainly had an effect. The order of fat was still maintained, with Rebecca still the thinnest despite the best efforts of the two mothers to break her, but that order had grown, well, wider. Rebecca was still the thinnest, and as her desire to resist grew more with each passing day she came up with new ways to keep her mouth shut, new places to hide, new ways to distract her sadistic mother from her. Unfortunately for the poor girl's conscience, this meant that Christine, her mother's current favorite, had finally been broken. Where before the two-year-old would cry and scream, now she simply took it, tears running down her face and seeping into whichever princess outfit her horrible aunt had seen fit to stick her in. She had certainly gained the fastest, and her gut was almost permanently stuffed to the brim with food. However, Kiekie was still on the top of the pyramid, gluttonously consuming everything her mother fed her and then more if she could. Kiekie had actually outgrown all of her clothes, and had become large enough to impede her slightly; she was now getting tired simply from playing with her blocks. This was almost a siren call to her fat-loving mother, who only saw it as adorable and a sign to feed her more. And so it was on that Sunday. Kiekie was happily gulping down a sixth jar of applesauce, Christine was tearfully eating the same thing, and Rebecca was bitterly fighting Nancy's efforts to get her tied up and fed. All was normal, if not well. And then the phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was so surprised about hearing the phone ring that she dropped her spoon into the boiling pot of pasta she was making. Nobody had called the house for quite some time, not since her husband left, so why...? She considered leaving it, but decided against it and, with great trepidation, picked up the phone and went out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" came back the voice of a cheerful woman. \"This is Sarah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! Don't you remember? I'm Bethany's mother! From the playgroup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh.\" Back when Jennifer's family was whole, she had done the proper mother thing and brought Rebecca to a playgroup at the local Baptist church. For a while, she had actually enjoyed it; after it all went to hell she stopped attending. \"What's this about?\" she asked the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah appeared hesitant. \"W-Well, when we had the playgroup I remember Bethany liking Rebecca very much, and- and I was wondering if, if you were busy, maybe I could take Rebecca to play with us? Bethany would really like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was about to snap at the woman, but then she took a moment to look back into the kitchen. Nancy was doing her best to feed Rebecca a piece of toast, but every time her hand drew near Rebecca snapped at it, scraping the chair along the ground as she did so. <i>Come to think of it, I don't know why I'm wasting so much effort on the little brat.</i> she thought. <i>If she wants to be sad and thin for the rest of her life, why should I care?</i> \"Why?\" she accidentally asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" Sarah asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I got distracted,\" Jennifer said. And then, </span></div></div>",

After giving up on the bread, Nancy had turned to peanut butter on a spoon to protect her hands. A godsend for Rebecca, as she was able to clamp down on the spoon as soon as it entered her mouth, which not only prevented more food but also gave her something to concentrate her force on. For her, though, it looked like that was about to go badly, as Nancy was about to wrench the spoon from her mouth. Rebecca closed her eyes-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- and her mother shouted, \"Nancy, untie her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy looked at Jennifer in shock. Rebecca opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no good, the ungrateful little brat will never give.\" she said, untying Rebecca. \"If she doesn't want to get fed, she won't.\" She pulled her daughter roughly to her feet. \"Get ready. You have a playdate in ten minutes.\" Rebecca, shocked and elated, raced off for the stairs, but before she could get up them her mother said, \"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stopped and turned around, fear showing in her little face. Jennifer squatted before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've won now, Rebecca. You've shown how much you want to be thin, and I will allow you to be that. But once you realize how happy those two will be, once you understand how lonely you've made yourself...\" she paused, allowing her words to sink in, \"...don't expect a place at the table.\" And with that, Jennifer returned to the kitchen, where she could be heard further cooing at Kiekie. Rebecca turned, slowly, and walked up the stairs.</span></div></div>",

To untie Rebecca wasn\u2019t just the way to gain this goal, this change in Jennifer even surprised the young little Rebecca it was quite the change afraid of this just being a trap or something more mischievous that what her mother was usually known for her pale white stomach stuck out from all the food she knew that her slender body was at least ten pounds heavier the weight of her pudgy belly begun to feel like a bag of sand, weighing her down as she walked her momentum became increasingly more sluggish. Trying to get used to her weight she it felt all foreign to her her once slim stomach had a slight pooch to it, it stuck out like she was always full but she knew that there wasn\u2019t anything in there that could make her this full, the fat that bunched up around her body her butt got most the brunt of making her have a pear shape to her it was embarrassing to her as she never been so chubby before and this was a new experience to her, one that she didn\u2019t like for at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Slowly walking past her sister in a sort of walk of shame she could see that her sister was becoming quite the porker, almost sneering in disgust at what what was happening to Kiekie it was quite a shock to the system to see her sister\u2019s fat face gobble up that was placed in front of the greedy girl\u2019s mouth, it was mesmerizing and appalling all at the same time, she never knew how much her sister could eat and she was a little afraid to find out what Keikei\u2019s stopping point would. Making her way upstairs to her room to get ready for her play date with one of her preschool friends, there was something that she couldn\u2019t quite grasp happening to her emotions, she was quite happy having that ability to play with one of her friends that she have not seen since the month before due to Lucky Duck Preschool being closed for the time being as a major leakage has put the place out of commission.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000 making it to her bedroom to get dressed into her play clothes an ensemble that Rebecca liked quite well, grinning with joy to play with someone whom wasn't her cousin or her sister made all the force feeding experiences seemingly melt away with happiness and joy. Putting on the baby blue star stockings first was a problem for Rebecca, as her new girth had made her once beautiful outfit all stretched and distorted, the stars warped with her new flub, being less symmetrical, her butt tightly fit into the stockings any movement felt like to Rebecca that her favorite outfit would be torn to shreds, even her favorite blue star shirt didn\u2019t feel quite right. This didn\u2019t stop Rebecca from going on her play date, it only encouraged the young girl to leave more quickly, saying goodbye to her mother for now was one of the happiest yet saddest times for Rebecca, for as she left Christine waking up from her nap cried awake.</span></div></div>",

That was a good thing. But Rebecca was't stupid. She knew for sure her mother was't just being nice to her. There was something about it. She did't knew what but decided to worry later about that. First she had a play date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer in the meantime took Christine out of her bed. Christine did't looked happy or sad. Her will power was broken.

She could't fight it any more. She just opened her mouth and ate whatever came her way. She ate, and ate, and ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and Rebecca ran downstairs and opened the front door to see her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rebacca are you... wow! What happened to you?

Christine\u2019s parents seemed to always be busy for the Animal magazine that she saw them less and less, so it made Christine feel wanted by and she was happy being around her cousins and aunt, Christine never had any siblings so playing with her cousins was always enjoyable to her, Rebecca was older than Christine but they always had fun playing house and princess. When Kiekie was born it was like another playmate for Christine, which made her a little less lonely due to having more people to play with her, Kiekie was not as active as her sister not even knowing how to walk but she loved the company that Kiekie provided for Christine. Looking over at the bloated Kiekie shoving more food into her mouth was something that was a show to behold all manners of food was smeared upon her body, light burps escaped her mouth and when ever she moved her body jiggled ever so suddenly, Christine knew that this was her fate to be a blob, to what end the little princess wondered to herself while she blankly peered at Kiekie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000She wondered why her aunt wanted her to be her\u2019s so badly she wanted to just be with her parents and have a normal family once again, she wondered about the condition of her mother and why they haven\u2019t come back to her yet, not even realizing auntie Jenny placing a generous sample of the chocolate cake upon a large plate for Christine to consume for the amusement of her Aunt, Nancy looked at the little princess and also wondered why didn\u2019t Jennifer focus on her other daughter she didn\u2019t realize the plan that was set in motion and why she kept on focusing on some one whom wasn\u2019t even her own child. Nancy wondered why Jennifer allowed Rebecca to go on a play date while she was still much too thin for anything, Christine has been broken as far as eating she was much to pliable than Rebecca, with one or two hiccups in the middle of changing this girl into an obedient piglet, Nancy knows how to take the rebellion that festered in Christine\u2019s soul if she was allowed too, Jennifer thought it was adorable that Christine still thought that she still had a chance to be a normal girl and not just her aunt\u2019s play thing.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000The third and final slice of cake started its way into Christine\u2019s gullet it felt like a rock when it finally was into her stomach, trying not to throw up as her feeding seemed to be over or she hoped it was since she couldn\u2019t fit anything more into her stomach, she thought she did a good job, Jennifer patted and kissed Christine\u2019s stomach, lightly whispering into Christine\u2019s ear \u201cdon\u2019t worry my dear soon you\u2019ll eat like your cousin\u201d like a serenade it tickled her ear drum with promises that Christine knew they would be fulfilled, that she could count one, unhooking the two from their high chairs so they can play while their next meal was prepared, While Kiekie was placed into the living room to watch some Disney movies, Christine was taken some where else with Jennifer. \u201cNancy can you take care of Kiekie for a bit I need some alone time with my adorable Neice\u201d with not even getting two words in Jennifer and Christine was gone.</span></div></div>",

I think you are feeling pretty full seeing that belly of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her niece's shirt and rubbed and stroked Christine's swollen belly. Christine must admit she liked this and let out a few soft burps. She moaned a bit but noticed she felt also a bit less stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see how much you weigh.\" Jennifer said and put Christine on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers blinked and showed clearly 40 pounds.

She did the same with her thighs and upper arms and wrote all the numbers down. The she turned the video camera of. <br>\r\nChristine wondered if this was it. This was't so bad. Any way better then get food forced down your throat. She then looked at Jennifer. She had a normal camera. She took a few pictures at Christine from each side. She the let her stand on her foot and took more pictures. <br>\r\nJennifer let Christine stand in different positions and then took several photo's from her. <br>\r\nFinally she put the camera down and picked Christine up and carried her downstairs and put her next too Kiekie who was busy watching the Disney movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing?\" Nancy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just making a wonderful memory.\" Jennifer said and went back to the kitchen to prepare more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy looked doubtful at the two children. She felt remorse that she did't had children of her own. At the other hand she was still young. Who knew. Perhaps she would get them once. But she could't wait too long.<br>\r\nShe looked at Kiekie and could't help thinking of a walrus. She had seen them once. They were incredibly fat. However they were all fat so there was probably a good reason for those animals to be so fat. Probably protection to the cold. But Kiekie did't need that. Christine was downright fat. She was't the thin girl that came here some time ago. But however she was thinner then then her younger cousin. Kiekie was younger but also fatter. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why was it her burden to become nothing more than a toy for her aunt to play with and kiss, all the attention to Christine and Kiekie was quite enjoyable for the two girls, at the same time it was making Christine uncomfortable around her aunt, for every time she was in the room with auntie Jenny she was touched and kissed in always sensual ways that only confused Christine even more. The brutality of the feedings that was giving to Rebecca and Christine demonized Jennifer in the two girls eyes it made them hate what ever was put in front of them, even with Christine\u2019s spirit recovering from all the feedings and the telling of how she was meant to become a blob by Nancy and Jennifer, there was still some fight left in this girl and even though she loved being her aunt\u2019s favorite she was going to fight. In the back of her mind Christine also hoped that these sudden outbursts would make Jennifer want to be with Christine the princess even more as a longing to be fondled by Jennifer was deep in her psyche, she wanted to be kissed and rubbed, she would never admit it to anyone but the feeling that she was missing the feeling of being wanted was always present. Christine looked at her growing body she missed bring a stick like she was before she got here barley two years old and already chubby if not fat, she has gained a good ten pounds while in the care of her auntie what was once a slim and trim body was now covered with flub , the little bikini that she now wore for the photo shoot that she was forced to become a part of was a little tight on her, where if her porcelain skin was as thin as she was when she first got to Jennifer\u2019s house it wold have fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Her stomach had a little roll to it, not as much as her little cousin had to her, even though she was still only barely a year old and not able to talk yet, she was much fatter than Christine for her age, the biggest part of the little Kiekie was actually her stomach, jutting out from the rest of her body it seemed to always be filled with any kind of goodies that the little one could get her greedy paws on, various food stains from her other food conquests littered her shirt, a big glob of chocolate had landed directly on the face of Elsa from every little girls favorite Disney film, Frozen, Jennifer didn\u2019t like the movie that much but it kept little Kiekie distracted enough. Nancy watched as Christine came out of her auntie\u2019s bedroom still wearing nothing but the bikini upon her body she looked still so slim to Nancy dismissing the presence of Christine almost immediately to only give Kiekie another candy bar to which Kiekie took without even a second thought. Jennifer was in the kitchen again as it was almost dinner and she still had two mouth\u2019s two feed and tonight looked to be full of Asian delights for the tots, making a nice big chicken dumplings and pot stickers all for their tasty mouths to enjoy. \u201cshoot I forgot to give Kiekie the \u201cphoto shoot treatment as well, she has been a good girl so far I almost forget about her some times\u201d rushing into the living room with a gusto Jennifer Picked up Kiekie with great effort and brought her into the photo room. Almost out of breath due to the shear weight of Kiekie, Jennifer Gasped to Nancy \u201chuff... Huff... Watch the princess Nancy and don\u2019t have too much fun\u201d she winked at her friend, quickly she shut the door behind her to \u201cmake memories\u201d with Kiekie. A grin that was brimming with malice and ill intent stretched across Nancy\u2019s face like her face was made of putty, Christine became worried and felt like she wasn\u2019t going to like this alone time, she wanted her auntie back, but she knew that Nancy was there to take care of her, but Christine was gonna fight what ever Nancy had up her sleeve.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps this mend she would get some delicious food, and lots of it. She just loved eating. Her young mind realized she was getting bigger but did't mind it at all. Her mother seemed to like that. Of course at her age she did't worried about much except eating, drinking, sleeping and getting a clean diaper. She did't have to be worried about eating or drinking.

She then Took Kiekie's hands and pulled her on her feet what was way harder then you would expect with a child of her age. Kiekie was getting very heavy. Soon she would't be able too carry her anymore. But now she helped Kiekie doing her first waddling slow steps. <br>\r\nThen she took a new notebook. She did the same like she did with Christine's. Weighed Kiekie and wrote that down and measured her belly and thighs. After that she took the photo camera.Kiekie smiled a lot. Jennifer smiled. fattening up Kiekie was gonna be a piece of cake. She hoped Kiekie's eating habits would rub of at Christine and even more important Rebecca. She really needed to eat more. But she had some tricks up her sleeve for her rebel daughter.<br>\r\nShe also took Christine's notebook and compared it with Kiekie's and frowned. Kiekie weight was higher and she was wider then her older cousin.

Kiekie loved food there was no stopping her growth, but Christine still had time and if she was there then she could have supported the young girl into rebelling against her mother and being independent against the two adults, instead she chose to get away from her over abrasive mother and instead decided to go to her friend\u2019s house a friend she has made when she went to preschool, a cute little brunette named Emily, immediately thy became best friends from the day they met at preschool, Emily was a bit of a wild child and this was something that Rebecca liked about Emily they instantly became friends. \u201ccome up to my room Rebecca I got some new my little pony stuff we can play with\u201d Emily shrieked excited to have her friend over, it has been some time since the two actually seen each other, since preschool was on vacation and neither mother really liked each other for them to get together for a play date, if only Emily mother could see what Jennifer was doing now it would make the young mother revolt with disgust as Jennifer made the little one\u2019s become nothing more than her playthings. Rebecca didn\u2019t want to think about it right now, if she did think about how she left her sister and cousin back to be played with like little barbie dolls, was excruciating on her own psyche.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Finally they got up to Emily\u2019s room and it was nothing but my little pony, it seemed as if, Emily lived and breathed my little pony, it was everywhere. \u201cso I didn\u2019t really want to ask you Rebecca but you seem a little wider than I last saw you it was a little startling seeing you this way\u201d Emily said concerned for the now chubby Rebecca as she was once as skinny as Emily and now presenting a full figure of a pear shape her butt and hips much wider than the would love to actually admit them to this was all thanks to what her mother wanted to do to the three little piglets that she now had in her care. Not comfortable admitting this to her best friend she just wanted to pass it off as she was going through a growth spurt but it seemed as if this wasn\u2019t going to fly with Emily as she stared down Rebecca her eyes darted around Rebecca\u2019s body like she was nothing more than a piece of meat to her, \u201cmy mom thinks I would be more happier being nothing more that a blob\u201d she spurted out to the little girl, Rebecca knew she wanted to tell some one but she didn\u2019t know it would come out like that, so embarrassed with how she stated her worries she didn\u2019t know what to do, Emily just looked at Rebecca with a cold hard look of shock. Not knowing what was going to come out of Emily\u2019s mouth there was just a giant cloud of anticipation that just hovered around the two girls it seemed so thick a knife could cut through it.</span></div></div>",

They need someone to feed them. Like a feeder. Those two are a perfect combination. One person who loves to eat and likes being fat, and the other likes to feed and likes her fat.

Some people like it when other people are fat, and they can be happy together. Fine. She could understand that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she couldn't understand is <i>how</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Rebecca was very, very young, Rebecca had learned some things about fat. One, that it was <b>bad</b>. TV shows, Barbie dolls, even the commercials made for adults that she didn't entirely understand all hammered the message home that being fat was very bad- that it made you ugly, stupid, wrong. Rebecca simply could not believe that anybody could love it outside of a sick, twisted manner like her mother did. That was the second thing- her mother. Over the past few weeks she had taught Rebecca that eating was a terrible thing, one that imparted no joy and no happiness into anybody but her sick mother and her twisted friend (perhaps Kiekie too, but she was too young to ask.) So, to Rebecca, food was bad, eating was bad, fat was bad (but somehow good, as her mother liked it) and there was no love in fattening- only force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Emily, her new, best, and only friend, was saying something completely different; that fat was pretty, and food did not need to be forced, and that people could love and respect each other at any size without pain or suffering. Rebecca wanted to believe this. Oh, she wanted to. She wanted Emily to be her friend, and like her, and maybe love her, and perhaps even get fat for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was scared. A large part of Rebecca's brain was telling her that it was a lie, it <i>must</i> be a lie, that if your mother didn't even love you then of <i>course</i> nobody else could, that fat was bad and it always will be bad and nobody will ever care about you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca gasped and looked up at Emily again, expecting to see her mad- she had been thinking, of course, and not at all paying attention to her new friend. But Emily was not mad, not at all. In fact, she was smiling, a big, broad smile that stretched across her little face and seemed almost to extend off the edges of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'ya wanna go get a snack?

She once heard about those anorexia girls who were terribly skinny that you could count their ribs. That was also unhealthy. Just as unhealthy as being obese was. But this would't be forced. It would't be a big snack. Just a small one would't harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, why not. I would't mind gaining for you. You don't force me to eat food and get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait here. I'll be right back.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca waited and looked around. How may ponies did Emily had. There were shelves full of them. She did't mind my little pony that much, however she found the animations not that good. However Emily also once showed her an older version of it and those animations were pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I never thought Emily would like fat. But she seems to be happy she could tell me. If I would really fell in love with a man and he wanted me too gain would I do that? Well not if he forces me!  Perhaps I would gain... a bit. Not that it get's unhealthy but that I just would be a bit fatter. I won't have to become a shapeless blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on the other person.\" Emily said while she walked back in with a tray with two cups of cola and two bowls of chips. \"Some like it that the other gets so fat that they can do nothing more then lie in bed all day eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's too big for me.\" Rebecca said. \"Gaining for somebody else I can understand. But force them to be fat I don't understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unless with those anorexia persons. If they don't eat they'll die. It's perhaps better to force them. Better force feed them then letting them die right.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Rebecca said while she put a chip in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Rebecca... could I... feed you? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at her friend with a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please? I never told anybody else I liked fattening up people, except my mom. I told you big secret and everything what you needed to know. Now please. Let me have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca taught for a moment. She did't like being forced to eat but she was hungry. Besides it was just a bowl of chips and Emily would't force her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't force you. I'll promise. I'll stop if you don't like it. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca went lying on her back. She opened her mouth and pushed some chips in it. Rebecca chewed and swallowed. She suddenly found out this was't so bad. It was kind of fun. Just getting food fed too you when you were hungry was fine. It also tasted fine. Eating was't a bad thing. It was just bad if you were forced to eat while you were full. It was easy to just open you mouth chew and swallow. Every now and then Emily poured some cola in her mouth. This was fun an d Emily liked it. But suddenly it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you stop. I thought you liked this?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do but I fed you all the chips. Your bowl and mine bowl. But I don't mind I fed your mine since I liked doing it.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Lovingly Jennifer looked at her youngest whom was playing with her blocks with her cousin who seemed to be in nothing more than a daze, Christine was trying to figure out with her feelings about submitting to her aunt. Christine didn\u2019t want to give up her freedom to her auntie Jennifer but with her other friend  Nancy she didn\u2019t know if she would be ever see her parents again or if she will ever be able to work all this weight off anyways, her once thin body was now retaining quite a healthy eating physique with all the the stuffing and cuddling that Jennifer forced upon the little girl was enough to make her sick and since her big cousin has abandoned her to be fed to her mother and had to endure the forcing of chocolate down her throat. Christine didn\u2019t mind being fawned over like a princess or a supermodel but all the food that has been shoved in her face was too much for her to take in. She didn\u2019t want to be fat she wants to dance and play like a normal girl again, Christine knew that this wasn\u2019t going to come to pass due to Nancy and Jennifer always being near Kiekie and her.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Jennifer was so proud of the gaining that Kiekie has done that she thought the little ones could deserve a day out in the community it has been a while since they have been to the mall or have done anything too fun of out going since it was going to be with out the fussiest one of the bunch Rebecca will be away from the two more obedience ones of the bunch, the only thing that has concerned Jennifer was Christine as she still wasn\u2019t as obedience as Kiekie was she was defiantly going to be a problem in the area but it was something that she wanted to experiment with, maybe a nice dinner after a day the beach. Nancy was just just enjoying feeling the new flub that has accumulated around the two girls bellies, she wondered what will these two girls will look like in a year or even six months, but for now it was dinner time which Christine wasn\u2019t going to like very much, a large baked ham sat upon the table glistening with pineapple and cherries.Many sides were made for this humble dinner which were made especially for Kiekie her favorites were anything that had to do with cheese, macaroni and cheese, some Au gratin potatoes laid upon the the table. Kiekie and Christine were picked up by Nancy and Jennifer took the girls into the dinner room to begin the feast. Just as Christine saw all the food that was upon the table made her freak out, trying to getaway made Jennifer hold upon Christine even tighter.</span></div></div>",

Her expresssion suddenly changed. She started to cram the food in her mouth with both hands. It was so delicious! She was eating so fast Nancy was almost afraid she would choke. But She did't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nancy. Some help over here. Christine is trying to get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy put another large part of the au gratin potatoes on Kiekie's plate and walked over too Jennifer and Christine. Christine was still trying to escape. Wiggling trying to get away but Jennifer hold her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like she does't want to eat.\" Nancy mumbled. \"Why does't she want to listen. I have a little niece but at least she eats healthy. She's five and can eat a large pizza all by herself and can still eat some more after that. She is such a good liittle piggy. She bareley does anything besides eating, sleeping, and watching T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect child. A bit like Kiekie. But now I'm worried about my niece. Can you hold her. Be carefull she puts up a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy hold Christine tight. Jennifer cut of a piece of the ham and brought it over to Christine's face. She turned away but Jennifer followed her. Christine tried to scream and that was a big mistake. As soon as she opened her mouth Jennifer pushed th pice of ham in her mouth. Christine wanted to spiy it out but the look on Jennifer's face told her that would be a big mistaked she she chewed and swallowed it.<br>\r\nThe next moment were the forst moments of Cathrine's entitre short life. Nany fed her more and more of the ham. Cathrine struggled, wiggled, tried to scream an turned her face away but is was useless. Her aunt was anywhere. <br>\r\nKiekie looked at the other end of the table to the au gratin potatoes. She wanted more of them and if you saw how sad she looked you should think they did't fed her. But if you how fat she it was clearly she got enough food. She was really a bottomless pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she such a rebel. I thoughtrebecca was the rebel of the three but now she seems to rebel too.\" Jennifer mubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this.\" Nancy said slowly. \"I mean feeding her this is hard. We can feed her more at dinner. But at this rate it gonna take forever to get that ham in her tummy. Just wait a bit. She eats when she's hungry. By the way I had a nice idea. How about we take those two little piglets out in public. Too the beach or the mall. After that a nice dinner. How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice. I think we should do that.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Christine who was still struggling. perhaps Nancy was right and she could try to feed Cristine more during dinner. But at the other hand She also never stopped if Rebbeca did't want to eat more.  <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u3000\u3000Jennifer never before let anyone of her little piglets have a break from their special feeding, it was so contradicting from what she was doing with the other girls but Christine was simply not complying with her feeding and it seemed as if the nice weather had affected the thinking of Jennifer it seemed as it it called her to do little public humiliation with her little princess she wanted to make sure Christine still knew that she was still hers and sooner or later she will have to bow to her aunt\u2019s will no matter how long it took. It excited Jennifer having Christine fight tooth and nail to keep her thin body the way it was, it made it the more pleasurable for her when Christine is sobbing and is nothing more than Jennifer\u2019s personal Play toy. \u201cWell, well little Christine it looks like you got your wish for now, you little brat you may think you have won for now\u201d Stated Jennifer angered by Christine\u2019s behavior as it was very unladylike like of her to be acting in such a way which is something that bothered her as she wanted her pet to at least be some what dignified. \u201cNancy get the girls ready for the beach while I\u2019m down stairs for I need to get a few things for our little girls before we go\u201d Jennifer stated in a quite authoritative manner which was something that Nancy wasn\u2019t suspecting from her friend as she was usually nicer to the one who was helping her turn these little ones into massive balls of fat, yet it seems as if the little rebel got to Jennifer or something that was pent up in her conscious for a very long time. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Making her way down to the basement wasn\u2019t a easy step as it was home of many things that Jennifer had collected over the years, in  her twenties she was quite the adventuring type, this is actually how she met her love of fat children. She was visiting the many exotic areas that dotted the Caribbean when they met on the little island of St.Mary it was quite small not even noticeable from a map, the people who lived there were almost undisturbed by modern customs, as they Caribbean isles were so far and few between each Isle had its own rules to deal with foreigners, the people here were quite fond of people from other countries as it was a their main way of import, this is how the country ran, Jennifer was so excited to get to this island for it was one she had only heard about with rumors from other isles in the surrounding area, it was quite different from all the other isles but no one knew why it was different, this was what really interested Jennifer. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Spending her time at this isle was pleasing to her she met with the natives who were quite pleased to have her company yet nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary for a small island dwelling village, sure the people who had their main export to be fishing were quite pale for their profession. Each member of the island had skin like porcelain which was quite odd but not enough for the mystery that surrounded the island. The island had seen fades come and go but the most recent one has improved the lives of the people on the island as they have been hit with some urban development due to outside sources but nothing was different like she was hoping, nothing exciting or even dangerous was to be seen in this small community of natives. Enjoying herself with a large smoked boar an other foods were at this small cookout, there was so much exotic treats to dine on it made her wonder why was there so much food there was enough to feed an army yet there wasn\u2019t an army to feed. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Jennifer wondered what the food was for, looking at the Natives she noticed one thing that was quite strange all the girls who were ten and under looked to be dreading something or something bad was going to happen that they didn't want to talk about, Jennifer could only wonder what that was for only a few moments as the girls begun to be forced fed by their mothers. The abrupt feeding only made Jennifer look become more interested in the rituals of this small country. All of the sobbed in a sweet chorus of feeding that only made Jennifer love this island even more as more and more food was forced into the girls mouth none of the adults has even touched the food that laid upon them, it seemed this food was all for these little girls and their growing physiques, Jennifer couldn\u2019t explain how she felt it was just being turned on with the thought of these girls becoming nothing than eating machines, but it was like it was her purpose to have children to follow the foot steps of these people. <br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Seeing how thin the mothers were of these children whom were turned into pigs, she wondered if these women also went through out this process and if so how beautiful they have become, each one was of stunning beauty of a regal nature. Tearing could be heard ringing like a symphony of distress as the young girls clothes strained to hold their beauty as they grew. Enjoying her stay in this strange yet enchanting island Jennifer didn\u2019t even notice that there was something large coming to the feast she couldn\u2019t tell what it was but all she knew was the people called it pl\u00f2t</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn\u2019t take long for Jennifer to see who or what pl\u00f2t was, as they soon arrived. At the sight of the girl, she gasped, again feeling a combination of amazement and arousal; looking over the youthful pile, she felt more than a desire, but a need, as if she\u2019d never be satisfied, not without this, this living monument of youth and unwilling decadence. There was a slight hitch in her plans as she remembered that she couldn\u2019t exactly take this girl back home with her, but soon enough she remembered the obvious, who, other than the legal system, was keeping her from doing this to her own flesh and blood daughter?  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one, no one was stopping her, Jennifer doubted that anyone would even know, since as Clinton said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d. Now the only thing in the way of her desire was, well, the current lack of someone else\u2019s, she obviously couldn\u2019t just will herself pregnant. Regardless, those thoughts weren\u2019t important, not compared  to the monolithic beauty in front of her, said beauty was currently having chunks of roast held near her face, while reluctantly taking bites, not from fear but utter need, as could be seen from the tears on the young girl\u2019s face, she didn\u2019t enjoy her predicament any more than the other girls did theirs\u2019. Again, Jennifer realized something, she didn\u2019t only want an immense, expectedly immobile daughter, she wanted said daughter to understand her condition and despair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd so, the rest of her stay at St. Mary\u2019s was much the same, her going around the island during the day, then barely keeping her composure once the nightly banquet began, for the most part at least. There was an incident if only one, it happened on the last night of her stay, the chief mentioned her over as if he had something important to say. Somewhat surprisingly, it was an invitation, summarizing it, the chief had seen just how much Jennifer was enjoying their ritual and decided to ask if she\u2019d like to stay, saying that regardless of her answer the tribe would welcome her whenever she visited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs is obvious, she ended up declining the deal, at least temporarily. If asked for a reason, there was only that she wasn\u2019t quite ready to settle down, there was still more of the world to see and that\u2019s what she planned to do. Though now, having since married and birthed two daughters, she was starting to think about going back, she expected Nancy would enjoy the trip too. Having found what she\u2019d needed, Jennifer went back upstairs, planning to ask her friend\u2019s opinion on the move. </span></div></div>",

Let's get those two little piggies and ourselves in their bikini's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were chancing cubicle's.Jennifer took one and helped herself and after that first Jennifer an the Kiekie in their bikini's what was getting pretty hard wit Kiekie. Her bikini was awfully tight on her. Almost cutting the little girl in half. It was't visible from the front since her belly covered it. You would almost think she was't wearing a bottom piece. <br>\r\nThe bikini's clearly showed how fat both girls had become. Even more people started to whisper. Jennifer enjoyed this. It was a good idea from Nancy to go to a public place like the beach. <br>\r\nShe put Kiekie next to her towel she she could crawl a bit. She liked it how Kiekie's belly hand down reaching for the ground. Some more feeding and her belly would drag over the floor if Kiekie crawled. If she crawled since she became pretty lazy lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is't this nice.\" Nancy said. \"It's perfect beach weather. Look, now that's a hunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I want some more!\" Jennifer suddenly heard and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Cynthia. You had more then enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a little but very fat six year old trying to get some more food what her mother did't wanted to give her.

She's just a few foot tall. How far could she have gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she can walk so further then Kiekie.\" Jennifer said who kept an eye at her youngest child. \"We have to find her.

Somehow, Christine, who was only two and by all rights should be slow and easy to catch, especially since she was significantly fatter than she should be, had not only run away- she had entirely escaped, having slipped into the crowd and fled their section of the beach for parts unknown. <i>First Rebecca, and now Christine...</i> she thought to herself. Granted, Rebecca's reprive was only supposed to be temporary, and she had full confidence that Christine would be found again, but it still stung. <i>At least I have ONE daughter I can rely on, though,</i> she thought, looking back at Kiekie, who, despite eating a huge quantity of snacks in the van, was straining for the cooler, both hungry for more and too lazy to actually start crawling for it. Jennifer smiled a twisted smile and began to feed Kiekie even more, dreaming of the day when Kiekie would hit immobility. At the rate she was eating, that day didn't seem too far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand burned Christine's young and underused feet. She was not a particularly strong girl, per se, but anger can do wonders for one's energy. So, when she realized that her awful aunt and horrendous helper were utterly distracted by some other, flabbier girl, she saw her chance and took it, toddling off into the crowd as fast as her fat legs could carry her. That desire for freedom had carried her as far as the edge of the beach, but now, weighted down with more than a hundred extra pounds, her resolve was beginning to fail her. A few steps further, and further, and further...finally, spent and exhausted, she climbed up onto a bench and sat, desperate to catch her breath. Upon looking around, though, energy came flooding back into her swollen frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had reached the boardwalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular beach didn't have the nicest of boardwalks, but to the little Christine, it looked like heaven. She had come out right next to the ice cream parlor, and the glittering of signs, sounds of people, and smells of salt air and food comforted her, and made her realize she was very, very far away from her terrible caregivers. Now, she was free to go to the police (who her parents had taught her of) and escape her aunt once and for all. With that in mind, she hopped off the bench and toddled off to look for an officer. But, in retrospect, the ice cream parlor was <i>right</i> next to her...and it <i>was</i> a very hot day...</span></div></div>",

Like a sweet kiss brushing her cheek,the food called to her sweetly it was like she had to follow those enticing smells that made her mouth water at the brink of giving into her conditioning that was placed upon her by her aunt, in the back of her mind she knew that if she gave in she would seal her fate of being nothing more that her auntie\u2019s pet piglet she wondered what was going to become of her if she did decide to enter the ice cream shop of her own free will.stopping at the thresh hold that divided the ice cream shop from all of her senses was on getting a piece of that delicious frozen treat, dangling in front of her nose like a carrot for a rabbit she wanted it so bad but didn\u2019t know how to obtain it for herself. It was all like a dream that she had to wake up from she knew that if she stayed around her aunt she wouldn\u2019t be thin ever again, pounds upon pounds would pile upon  her little frame neither to escape or move again.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000She knew that all she needed to do was she find a police officer and all of her troubles would be over that was caused from her caretakers, her sixty pounds of flub didn\u2019t want to move, she wanted food and was going to do anything to get it. Taking all of her will power she ran away from the ice cream shop with all her might, she knew that her only salvation would be if she finds a police officer. Looking around the boardwalk she saw many people of all shapes and sizes, but none seemed to fit the things her parents, no one was wearing a badge or even wearing blue, Christine begun to worry that she was either going to be found or lost forever. Sobbing at the sight of returning to her horrid aunt Christine could only sit down on the wood that made up the boardwalk, as she sobbed and sobbed someone came up to her \u201cyou okay my dear, are you lost, do you need  help\u201d asked a very helpful woman, only looking at the woman\u2019s nice dress shoes and blue pants, Christine refused to look up as she didn\u2019t know this person and she just was afraid it was just her aunt. \u201cI was trying to find a police officer to help me call my daddy, I want to go home with my daddy, I don\u2019t want to be auntie jenny\u2019s pet\u201d Christine sobbed as she didn\u2019t know that the person that she was talking to was a police office, grinning at the pure ignorance of this young girl. \u201cDon\u2019t worry young lady, I am a police officer and I will help you call your daddy and talk to your aunt, Christine\u2019s face lit up, she found the person that she was looking for, hoping to see her dad soon and hoping that she will finally go home and be thin again, looking at her chubby body one last time she couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved that her she could be thin again. Examining the damage that has been done to her body, her stomach hung lower overlapping the band that was connecting to the bottom of her bikini it might have been the biggest part of her body, her thighs and butt were obviously was the best of her body her porcelain-like skin reflected this fact. Taking the hand of the officer the walked for quite some time so far that they were back at the beach where she started at, worried that the police officer was just going to give her back to her evil aunt, Christine looked for all exits just in case things went south fast. \u201chere we are\u201d the woman police officer said as they were in front of...</span></div></div>",

But, thanks to her training, she could apply what she\u2019d do for somewhat similar circumstances, first and foremost being to contact the child\u2019s guardian or parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you two, but I have to make sure this little girl isn\u2019t distraught for a good reason. Is that alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding her annoyance, Jennifer graciously replied, \u201cOf course, what would you like to know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for understanding. Which of you is her mother?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be me, though, in reality, I\u2019m her aunt. I\u2019m taking care of her while her parents enjoy their vacation to Africa.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well, would it be alright to call them? You can check the time to make sure it isn\u2019t anything unreasonable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, one moment,\u201d The mother assented, calmly finding how appropriate it\u2019d be to call, \u201cIt\u2019d be quite late, but there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll answer. Call them then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialing the number, Jennifer waited through the tones, surprised when someone actually picked up, a tired \u201cHello?\u201d coming through the speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, sorry to call you this late, but there was a small issue with Christine. Now, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s fine, she just wandered off while we were at the beach and a nice policewoman found her. Is it alright if I hand her the phone so you can certify that your daughter is in my care?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, an \u201cOkay.\u201d came in response from the device, though it wasn't without a hint of worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the offered phone, Carmen politely got to the point, \u201cHello there, I\u2019m Carmen, an average police officer. I wanted to talk to you about your daughter, she seems terrified of your sister, do you know of any reason why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...No, nothing comes to mind. Could it be because she doesn\u2019t want to be away from us for so long?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but she said something about her aunt fattening her up, as absurd as it sounds.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d He started, suddenly glad there was a phone between him and the officer, he couldn\u2019t bluff his way out of his smile after all. \u201cI think I know what that\u2019s about, she said something similar once while she was with us. She just doesn\u2019t understand that eating so much leads her to gain weight, so after satisfying her appetite for a few days or weeks she suddenly notices she\u2019s not as thin as before, usually we keep her on a stricter meal plan to avoid the hassle, but I guess I forgot to remind my sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Carmen couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of relief, anyone would be happy to believe the whole thing was a misunderstanding after all. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d She mentioned as she handed the phone back to Jennifer, turning to the toddler before she left, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, your parents will be back before you know it, they\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re back to normal in an instant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving a brief goodbye, the officer left, leaving Christine to the whims of her now oh so irritated aunt. Thankfully, the woman was still occupied for the moment. As for what, it was obviously the phone call, Jennifer waiting for her brother to finish whatever he was doing on his end before she started speaking, \u201cWell, how's your vacation been?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great so far, the scenery and culture are as interesting as you\u2019d expect, and the people are surprisingly hospitable. How about you? How large have you gotten her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, she teased, \u201cStraight to the point, aren\u2019t we? Well, admittedly, we haven\u2019t weighed them in a while, but she should be around ninety pounds, give or take a few. I\u2019m not planning to stop with her, though, that wouldn\u2019t be fair to my own daughters after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I wouldn\u2019t mind her larger. Could you send me a picture, though? My imagination isn\u2019t its best at my age.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, do you care about whether she\u2019s crying or such? Since she isn\u2019t exactly enjoying the process.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take it now, don\u2019t hang up once I\u2019ve put you on hold though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Richard agreed, happy to see what\u2019s been done to his daughter while he\u2019s been away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her phone to fit all of Christine in the frame, Jennifer proudly took the picture. Not to mention another of her daughter, Kiekie, as a bit of a bonus for her sibling. Sending the photos, she returned to talking with Robert, complaining about how much of a problem her other daughter was being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you should get them within the next few minutes, assuming you haven\u2019t gotten them already, that is. But unfortunately, it isn\u2019t all going well, with Rebecca refusing to cooperate at every chance. Honestly, I\u2019m starting to wonder whether I should just keep her bound for however many days it takes for her to break, but would you have any other ideas?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ve arrived, thanks for the pleasant surprise tonight. As for your daughter, do whatever you feel is best, I just want you to remember that we don\u2019t want our \u2018little\u2019 Christine to have any chance of getting anywhere on her own.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a surprisingly feminine giggle at the remark, Jennifer agreed, omitting the mention of her own, more twisted methods. \u201cOf course I know that, and really, she should be broken by the end of the month, today\u2019s incident put quite a strain on her after all. But I do have to get back to them after all. So despite how pleasant it is to talk with you, I have to go. Feel free to call whenever you want an update.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, and thanks for doing all this in the first place. Bye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone needed, I should be thanking you for the opportunity. I\u2019ll call again by the end of the week to mention our progress.\u201d Ending the call, Jennifer turned back to her companions, giving Christine a glare that made her regret even thinking about running away, let alone how she felt about actually trying to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did't you know I was worried sick about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did her best to hide behind woman police officer. She looked doubtful at the two woman and obese baby. It seemed like this woman was in care of this kid. However the girl really seemed to be scared and really wanted her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... you're her aunt?\" She asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. Her parents are on vacation so I'm looking after her until they're back. But she ran away. I'm so happy you found her and brought her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm here for miss. But she really wants to talk to her father. What's up with that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well her father is on vacation. Pretty far away It's night over there now. She's too young to understand that yet. So we had a little miss understanding. You know how toddlers blow things up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman police officer looked at them. She still was't sure. She knew toddlers could throw super tantrums about small things and sometimes made look thing a lot worse then it really was, but at the other hand suppose this woman really was a bit mean to her niece. But still, she had't proof the woman did anything wrong. If she did was the aunt of this girl it made perfect sense that she took care of her niece while her parents were away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to call daddy!\" Christine cried. \"I want to go home with my daddy. I don't want to be a little piglet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little piglet?\" The woman police officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just a nickname. Don't you have nickname for your... kids or nieces or well you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand it. However I would like  to have you address.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\"Jennifer asked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps nothing miss. But she seems to be really scared. If a kid is scared we still need to check if everything is fine at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer friendly told her address with a bright smile, while she took Christine tight by the wrist. But as son if the woman police officer left she look at Christine with a very angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine how did you dare to do that? Making so much trouble at eating is one thing but running away and calling the police is going to far. Don't I take good care of you? I bought beautiful dresses for you. I fed you the most delicious kinds of food. I even had photo sessions with you, and this is how you repay me? I'm really angry at you. Now that police woman is going to my home. I don't like that! Do you understand that? Do you know what I do if I get angry? I'm try to do something I like. I like feeding somebody. Any idea who that somebody might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine knew where this was going too and got a painful look at her face. Her cousin at the other hand was kind of angry she still had no food since both woman were too much occupied with Christine and the police.   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fearing at what was about to happen once they got back to the house, Christine wondered what would Rebecca do, being back in the care of her horrid aunt was like a sentence to death for Christine\u2019s slim figure her chubby body will get bigger and bigger no matter how much she begged her aunt to stop the madness that Jennifer creates. Jennifer kept a close eye upon the little blond headed girl as all four of them made their ways back to the beach area, Knowing that the cop will become a problem Jennifer, just knew that sooner or later she will have to be careful when it came to her plans for her little piglets. Jennifer wondered why this girl was being so difficult she was a more handful than Rebecca whom at this moment was on respite from her feeding but she didn\u2019t know what to do with Christine, she wasn\u2019t going to fatten up easily, this was not good for Jennifer\u2019s plans for Christine to be nothing more than an obedient play toy for her use. Tightening her grip on the little girl\u2019s arm for fear that she would run away again she didn\u2019t want her fun to be ruined in any way and both Christine and Kiekie looked so enticing in their new bikinis. Jennifer was quite proud of what she was creating in looking at her youngest daughter quite lovingly, with a grin on her face she had Nancy who was preoccupied with trying to carry the obese baby in her arms,even though the load that was Kiekie was quite taxing on her strength the feeling of her supple skin made it all worth while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the cute little outfit that Jennifer had Christine wore was just so adorable upon the little toddlers body she knew that sooner or later it wouldn\u2019t fit young Christine anymore, that made Nancy quite happy when it finally tears off of Christine\u2019s body as her body is more of a shapeless ball of fat that a little girl.trying her earnest to get away from her aunt with no avail of freedom, Christine begun to beg and sob all the way back to the nice picnic blanket that was laid out for a nice hearty lunch all for Christine to eat. This was going to be her penance for acting out in front of a police officer she wanted to know how much worse it can get instead of being just a rebel, she could to learn to love her aunt the way her aunt loves her. \u201cNow we are all going to have a nice meal, or should I say Christine will have a nice meal\u201d Jennifer chuckled, she knew that it was going to be fun and sexy time in the sun. Nancy almost felt bad for little Christine as she was seemingly dragged all the way to the picnic blanket where her aunt had many things planned for the little one, scurrying right behind Jennifer tried her best to keep up with the two as she wanted to see where this was going, yet knowing that keeping up with them was impossible with the heavy load that was sleeping in her arms. Looking at Keikie she noticed just how huge and adorable this little girl was, only a mere ninety pounds was on the small frame of Kiekie but it was enough for this girl whom wasn\u2019t even one yet to look massive and all the more adorable, it made Nancy sick to just think of how thin Christine was not even a mere sixty was on her frame, a doctor of any profession would just call it baby weight and it should come off when she gets older. This was such a travesty to see Christine only gain fifteen pounds in a month. Rebecca was just as bad as Christine, she barely gained anything and if she did gain it only went to her bottom only, it seemed that girl will always be a pear. this wasn\u2019t any way for girls to act and knowing how her old high school friend was this wasn\u2019t going to be acceptable, No matter what Christine was going to be Jennifer\u2019s plaything, to be fed kissed and loved. One way or another Jennifer got the chubby girl to the picnic for the fun to begin, \u201cNow, now my dear don\u2019t fuss\u201d your mine now and I will pamper you whenever you're a good girl now eat my pet\u201d coyly said, Jennifer. Not even a budge came from the girl whom Jennifer tried to make eat, just sitting there not making a peep or movement realizing that there was no escape from being her aunt\u2019s plaything and she guessed girlfriend, all she could do was sit there and not make a peep, Not liking this turn of events Jennifer decided to...</span></div></div>",

What's best for may not always seem it is best for you.\" Jennifer said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Jennifer grabbed a spoon and started to fed Christine. Christine did't want too eat but knew that after what she did her aunt was kind of angry at her and she did't want to make her aunt even more angry. The only way to do that was too eat. So she opened her mouth and ate everything what her aunt fed too her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy finally could put Kiekie down. How could such a young kid be so heavy. However a few seconds after she put Kiekie down she woke up thanks to the smell of the food Jennifer was feeding to Christine. Kiekie had been gotten very lazy the past days. She barely crawled but since it involved food this time she tried to get in a crawl position however her belly touched the floor. Then she started to crawl over to where the food was with her belly dragging over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer. I think your own daughter also wants some food.\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer saw Kiekie looking with her small piggy eyes at the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nancy can you be a dear and feed Kiekie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy took some food and a spoon. When the spoon came near Kikie's face she wolfed down the food on it. She really was a little, but fat (more morbidly obese) eating machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Christine I don't know why you make so much trouble.\" Jennifer said. \"I love you. You're my little piglet. Just like your cousins Kiekie and Rebec... Well... Kiekie is a little piglet but Rebecca is't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm worried if we are ever able to let that girl gain. She does't want to gain, she does't gain much, and what she gains end up in her bottom. She's gonna be a pear shaped girl. Without a doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but those two beautiful piglets gain nicely all over. Is't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they sure do. However Kiekie gains all over, but a bit more in the belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the belly is a beautiful part of the female body.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine had a painful look on her face. Nancy was feeding her a stick of butter. But no matter how much she hated this and was eating between tears she had a bit of hope. That woman of the police had the idea something might be wrong. Perhaps she would be saved soon. But for now she need to eat what her aunt gave her. She did't liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long if your parents are gone you're my little pet. My play toy. My piggy. You are the one I love and feed. You know that sweetie. I sure hope you gonna like it like Kiekie. At least she's cooperation. She eats and gains and likes it. You should do. But nooooo. You make trouble and go to the police. Now she comes by to my house and checks if I take good care of you. I do, but she might think I don't. Then she might take the two of you away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female police officer was back on her regular spot. Still thinking about that little girl that seemed to be afraid of her aunt. She seemed to be terrified. However she seemed to want to go to her father. There were more kids who got upset if their parents were away. That was normal. But that woman called her a little piggy. She must admit that girl was kind of fat. Also that girl in the arms of the other was morbidly obese. She should really make sure those kids were okay.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Being full on almost all the food that was brought on their little picnic was the least of her worries, knowing that here was more food in her future, she looked at her younger cousin whom had to be at least seventy pounds of pure fat, yet she looked like she wanted more food into her own gullet trying to get more from what was being fed to Christine by her mother. Looking at her own daughter\u2019s own growth over the past few weeks was miraculous, there again with Rebecca not eating and Christine being just as fussy as her cousin Rebecca this wouldn\u2019t do for the plans she had for the little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the fat that had accumulated around her more pronounced stuffed belly, rubbing the globe that was Christine\u2019s stomach if felt good to have her stomach rubbed even by the one who made it so full in the first place, little burps began to escape Christine\u2019s mouth, her pink bikini stretched to accommodate her growing physique. It stretched and tightened around the globe of porcelain-like skin that Christine had, she just enjoyed the attention she was given and that there was no feeding going on, Jennifer loved her darling piglet she wondered why she never acted this content always she was so fussy with becoming so huge and blobby. Jennifer Wondered if this was just normal for the little girl or was the just influence that was coming from Rebecca, she noticed that there was falter in Christine\u2019s outburst and she began to accept her place as just a slave to Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the weekend almost over on this perfect beach day, there was one thing that Jennifer wondered about, how was her fussy daughter enjoying her respite for her world was going to come crashing down when Monday morning came around, nothing but big macs and fries for her gullet on Monday.As Jennifer thought of what was to come on Monday a shiver ran down the young red heads body, she was so preoccupied with being with Emily, Rebecca was just quite interested and smitten with the young brunette, she seemingly cared for Rebecca and didn\u2019t see her as a play toy to be used for her own personal gain. Her mother was this way and it was something that irked her about the one she had to call mother. Christine was the sacrificial lamb for the perverse wants that applauded Jennifer\u2019s mind, the more Rebecca thought about what was to become of Christine, imagining the Ball of fat that used to be the tiny Christine, did actually seem cute to Rebecca, as long as Emily wanted Rebecca and her growing butt, she was happy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Rebecca a little stone doll. It looked a lot like a very fat women. With a lot of extra fat on her thighs and butt. A huge belly and two big fat loaded boobs. Rebecca looked long at it while her fingers slid over the stone figure. She must admit it looked kind of nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Venus of Milo. She's the mother. Something the people believed in long before god. Somewhere in the stone age. When people still lived in caves and wore animal skin. This was their goddess. The mother of all. All living things, human and animal came out of her womb... or at least... that's what people believed. Back then they did't knew that you need a man and a woman to get a kid. As far if they know, only woman's got kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Rebecca asked. \"And how does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly.\" Emily said. \"But I knew you need men and woman for it.

Please.\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have no problem with that. But we have to ask her mother first.\" Emily's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the phone and dialed the number of Jennifer. Emily and Rebecca waited trying to understand what was going on exactly. After two minutes Emily's mother hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Rebecca and Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. Rebecca can stay for dinner. Good thing too. I always make way too much for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls ran back to Emily's room. Emily smiled. She liked seeing Rebecca eating. She would like it to feed Rebecca lots of food to make that big ass of her even bigger. But she would never do that to her friend. Except if Rebecca would be fine with it. Who knew, one day she might be. But her mother tried to fatten her up so she would probably get a chance to see her best friend morbidly obese. She was just a bit sad for the way why she had become this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could stay here.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me I would love too. But I can't. I have to return to my mother. Also to my force feeding sessions. Don't get me wrong. It was fun with you...but it was't fun with my mother. It's painful with my mother. There is a lot of force. By you it's willingly and... fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like it if you came to life here. A niece of me came to live by her best friend. A foster home or something like that. Kids can be placed in a foster home if their parents can't take good care or don't take good care of their kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's eyes flew wide open.

Rebecca opened her mouth and Emily fed her the potatoes. While Rebecca chewed Emily fast took a bit of her own food but after a bite she took Rebecca;s fork again to feed her more.<br>\r\nEmily's mom noticed this. She knew that her daughter was a feeder. Except for Rebecca her mom was the only person that knew her daughters strange fetish. She thought it was a little strange, but there were much worse ways that people liked to do with their partner. As long if both sides agreed on it there was nothing wrong with it. Besides it was't like Rebecca was overweight or had any heath problems connected to her weight. Her mother did't said anything about a diet so it was no problem if Emily fed her. At least Rebecca seemed to be fine with it. So she decided to let her daughter and friend... or maybe even girlfriend have their fun. However she must admit that Rebecca seemed a bit heavier then the last time she saw her.<br>\r\nIn the meantime both girls had fun. Rebecca and Emily. Rebecca used to hate eating because it was forced in her throat but just eat without force, especially if you were a bit hungry, there was no harm in that. She even liked it. She did't mind to put on weight for her friend.<br>\r\nEmily liked it to feed Rebecca. It was fun having a girlfriend. She felt butterflies in her belly. She just hoped Rebecca felt the same. However she was allowed to feed her. That was a good start. Even if Rebecca was't in love with her she liked feeding her. At least she had fun doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you girls enjoy my cooking.\" Emily's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do.

I hope this is't some kind of silly game. The police is a serious case. Not for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rebecca started to cry. Emily's mother was a bit shocked. Emily rushed over to her friend and put her arms around her and hold her to her chest. After some time Rebecca got herself under control and looked at Emily's mother.

She forces us to become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she really force you? Or does she just want you to clean your plate. You need to eat enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about to force a little girl to eat a entire chocolate cake? Is that enough? She ties us up and forces us to eat, even when we're full and don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mother dropped her fork for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca... is this absolutely true. Are you not over reacting? You need to be 100% sure about this. Is your mother really doing this.\" Emily's mother asked and looked Rebecca straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... it's... true.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mother saw that the girl was telling the truth.

Stopping for just a moment to think about how to tell the her young neice that she loves her more than an aunt should love a neice and she doesn\u2019t know how to explain it but when ever she is a good piglet she and accepts her roll to be nothing more that her plaything it gives Jennifer butterflies and she just doesn\u2019t know how to tell Christine.

Her friend, or tentative lover, did the same, though part of the girl wondered if this was why she loved what she did because her mother felt the same. Regardless of this, the girls were corralled into the threatening home, the pleasant, in Grace\u2019s opinion, sounds of Christine\u2019s torture filling their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that wasn\u2019t to say nothing else was said or done, a good bit of small talk happened between the conspirators before the third finished her work, carrying her engorged niece in her arms. Seeing the new arrival, and her own friend's nod, Jennifer greeted the woman, smiling at the reason she was there, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you, but welcome to my home, I see Rebecca told you what we were doing here...?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace. And yes, but I\u2019m not here to try and take her away from that. Rather, I\u2019d like to help you continue it. Would you let me take care of feeding Rebecca? At least for some of the time?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, the parent didn\u2019t see much of a downside to the arrangement, understanding that the only thing it really did was let her put more time into fattening her seeming favorite of the bunch, namely, the blond in her arms. So, not having any reason to decline, she assented to the woman\u2019s request, \u201cSure, you can keep her for a while starting from now if you want, there isn\u2019t any reason to waste time after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Then I\u2019ll have to take you up on that. We\u2019ll stay for the moment, though. I do remember Rebecca saying something about her sister? Could I see her?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Kiekie? Of course, you can see her,\u201d pausing a moment as she turned to the other woman, \u201cCould you please go grab her Nancy? As you can see, my hands are a little full at the moment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be back in a moment with the \u2018little\u2019 pig.\u201d She assented, getting up from her seat to go get the baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, a minute or two later, Grace had the flab coated girl sitting on her lap, the child doing little other than giggling as her folds and bulges were curiously squeezed. That wasn\u2019t to say she kept the baby all to herself, though. She also tried to coax her daughter into experiencing the girl\u2019s size, hoping to convince Emily to help fatten her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she succeeded, her daughter unable to resist touching the fattened girl, and she found a darker part of herself wanting to see Rebecca this way regardless of the other\u2019s feelings. It only wanted a cute, spoiled fatty for her to take care of, and Emily was hard-pressed to deny it. Her demons whispering crooked promises of \u201cAre you sure her personality is so important?\u201d \u201cWhy should you restrain yourself if she asks? You know what\u2019s best for her.\u201d and \u201cDoesn\u2019t it sound fun to take, and make, what you want through force?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, for Rebecca, the girl\u2019s willpower could only deny so much, and that limit was nowhere near the extent of Emily\u2019s daydream, the delusion including an immobile form of her crush, begging for more all the while. Now, the thoroughly corrupted look of the child terrified their previously hopeful companion. Instigating the revelation that not only were the adults forcing her larger, but even the girl who\u2019d supposedly fallen in love with her, a girl her age trying was their hardest to make it impossible for her to live any semblance of an average life. Dejected, she realized moments later that after a while, this would be her normal life, managing little other than to die a little inside, the four-year-old waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace and Jennifer were happy to see that they both had similar interests, As Jennifer at first, feared the outcome thinking that if Emily would talk to what was transpiring would spell doom for Jennifer and what she was trying to accomplish of a harem of little girls to fatten like the little piglets they are. Grace was much more understanding that Jennifer would first think. Rebecca feared what was to come for her thinking that it would be fun to visit Emily\u2019s house was now only met with dread, thinking that she could get away from her demented mother by sneaking away with Emily\u2019s mother had all been dashed. Emily couldn\u2019t help but feel bad about the situation that Rebecca was in hoping to be freed of. Grace was smiling ear to ear, Kiekie no understanding what was happening as she had just gotten up for her nap and was still a little woozy from all that was happening around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it would be great to have some free time, its always a hassle to trying to feed this one\u201d Jennifer chuckled as she stroking Christine\u2019s hair absentmindedly \u201cKiekie is also another problem child but its the reverse, she just eats so much that is its hard to feed Christine to overcome the size of Kiekie\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I can try to get this girl bigger too if you want, our house is quite secluded, my husband and I  wouldn\u2019t mind fattening up this little one for you as well so you can spend more time with the one in your arms\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grace stated her intentions quite bluntly pointing at Christine with a smile on her face making sure Jennifer knew that she wasn\u2019t going to take away her favorite piglet away from her and only wanted to help fatten up the rest. Jennifer was debating if this was going to be the correct course of action as she didn\u2019t mind that other people wanted to help with her ultimate plan of having a little girl harem started, but there were risks when it came to letting people into her ideas as Grace being a rival of Jennifer\u2019s ideas, unlike Nancy who became more like a helper and supporter than someone who she had to fight for control of the girls. Jennifer didn\u2019t want to allow Grace to get so much power over these girls, allowing Rebecca to go off on her own was alright as she knew her place already, not poising a threat to the balance just freeing up time for Jennifer to train the little sow that she held in her arms was a great trade-off. All three women begun to prepare the trip for Rebecca to visit Emily at her house knowing that she was going to be in good hands for the week with grace forcing every kind of morsel into Rebecca\u2019s mouth, the women talked more and more about their shared interest of girls filled Rebecca and Emily with dread not knowing what to make of this, Emily, in particular, was wondering if her feelings to the world of fat was somehow influenced her way of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about you taking Kiekie I mean its quite hard to move the pig as it is, I wouldn\u2019t put that pressure on another mother\u201d Jennifer shaking her head smug look could be seen on her face, as she denied Grace another child to take care of \u201cRebecca will love to go to your house, I mean my daughter is quite infatuated with your daughter as it is\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling knowing that she won the battle of will, Grace didn\u2019t have any say when it came to Kiekie and Jennifer knew that. If she did give into the demands of Grace then it would give Jennifer more time with her prized piglet but knowing how conniving people can be she wasn\u2019t going to give Grace the chance to overthrow her as Master to her harem. Rebecca was between herself as she looked at Emily then to her mother, her hope began to fleet as she realized that her mother\u2019s view on children wasn\u2019t just hers there were many adults like her in the world, there was nowhere to escape to she was just trapped in by circumstance. Looking to Emily for support wasn\u2019t going to work either as the once strong girl seemed to be in a trance placed on her by her own mother\u2019s ambitions, feeling every piece of flesh that Kiekie had to on her, feeling the plushness that came with the obese baby made Emily shiver, her head filled with lewd ideas of her own to do with Rebecca. Nancy was already getting things ready for Rebecca\u2019s little trip to Emily\u2019s house as the women talked about their prized creations, Grace with Emily and Jennifer with Christine, both women continued chatting as the stroked Emily\u2019s and Christine\u2019s hair respectively. Bags packs, lists made, Nancy made sure everything was set for Rebecca\u2019s little trip away from Jennifer and into the arms of Grace.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell I see that she is all packed, we must get going as there is a dinner I must make for Rebecca\u2019s welcoming\u201d Grace chuckled, lifting off her lap and placing Kiekie on the ground to let the little tot sleep as she seemed to be tired from all the action of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I guess we have to go well don\u2019t worry Rebecca you're going to like my house\u201d Emily wasn\u2019t quite sure about this knowing now that her mother wasn\u2019t going to take it easy on Rebecca like Emily first thought when letting Grace know about Jennifer and her relationship with Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiving Rebecca off to her week with Grace and Emily, Jennifer was quite contempt with the situation she was offered, the dozing girl in her arms had no idea what was going on around her or what was yet to come, unaware the danger she was in from her master. Jennifer acting like a giddy school girl began to plan all the things she needed to get done with Christine before she had to cater to three girls again, Christine wasn\u2019t so hard to figure out as, unlike Rebecca she knew her place a little better than her cousin did. twiddling with the collar Christine wore and smile constantly on her face as she thought about the plans she had in her head about tomorrow. Christine knowing her place as nothing more than a piglet, was a big help for Jennifer but even she knew that Christine didn\u2019t know her new role that much still talking and walking around on two feet when Jennifer isn\u2019t watching, this was just one of the things she thought of knowing she could allow Christine to fully embrace her master natural beauty as well by treating Christine to a few dinner dates as well there was much Jennifer wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

This seemed not to be the case as there was another person with them that seemed to be nothing but business attitude, dressed in a officer uniform and with badge at the ready, this man who was at the door seemed to be in his late forties, grizzled by the many years he has worked upon the forced, his blank expression seemed to express no indication of emotions his glossed over eyes of heavy drinking were any indication of a troubled soul, this was it. \u201ccan I help you, sir,?\u201d Nancy asked in a timid manner, not knowing who or what this person wanted was quite unsettling for her as she knew what trouble people who didn\u2019t know know what they were trying to create could cause for the project Nancy and Jennifer were trying to make. The man was quite brash in his reasoning of being at the home of Jennifer, \u201cthis woman claims that there is some child abuse going on in the house please step aside madam\u201d in his own drunken stupor the cop begun his investigation  of the home. His bloodshot eyes surveyed the surrounding area for anything that seemed to point to there being any cause for concern in  the home that could pinpoint why this woman was so concerned for the children that were in the care of these two women, it made no sense to the detective.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking over the house nothing really stuck out as an hazard for the children none were undernourished or neglected in any manner of the word, \"sir you can't just barge in, it is quite rude of you\" Nancy exclaimed to the hardened detective as he sifted throughout the house taking to account of everything he could, Rebecca was hoping with the help of Emily that she would finally would get rid of her mother and her evil ways. Holding on to Emily tightly she was hoping to with all her heart that this detective would be able to help the situation that was brought upon by her mother\u2019s choices. Being interrupted by the shuffling of this booze hound of a detective was something that Jennifer didn\u2019t care for at all, quickly she untied Christine\u2019s wrists, and picked her up kissing her gently on the cheek after their feeding session it was just time for bed for the little girl, yawning and rubbing her eyes Christine felt very sleepy and quite full, seeing this man in her aunt\u2019s quite startled her as she didn\u2019t know who or what this person wanted in the house. \u201ccan I help you sir, may I ask what is going on this late at night?\u201d Jennifer asked suspicions of what this man wanted with her. \u201cI apologize for the intrusion madam, but we recently had a complaint of child abuse at this address and we have to investigate no matter if how false the claim is, but there seems to be no reason for me to be here\u201d slurring his words as the detective tried to explain his reasoning to be there, as he left to investigate another room.<br>\r\nTrying to put on a face of why this detective was here, Emily\u2019s mother entered the home with Rebecca in tow \u201cJennifer you home, I\u2019m here to drop off Rebecca\u201d she stated shakily as not to give the woman any indication that is was her who called this policeman to come to her house, it was at the request of the young red head that she should call the police, but had she knew that they would do such a poor job at investigating this woman of her abuse then she wouldn\u2019t have bothered. This man didn\u2019t even try to look at everything he was just going through the paces of his investigation trying not to yell at the cop was taking all of her strength not to, \u201cWell I have all for my report, thank you madam\u201d stated the detective, while leaving the premise. Shocked at the lack of evidence of abuse Emily\u2019s mom didn\u2019t know if she could deal with what lack of work this cop actually did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always did this if she was nervous.<br>\r\nEmily's mother still thought something here was't right. Not only because the police did't looked at everything. At her home Rebecca did't seem to act. It seemed like she really got force fed. But it seemed wiser if she did't let Jennifer know that. So she acted like the mother that understood she did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about what happened. But Rebecca acted like there was some really child abusing. Guess she has a very strong imagination. Perhaps she watched a bit too much television.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.\" Jennifer said. \"You were doing the right thing. Suppose I was doing some sort of child abuse.

Calling the police. Accusing me of child abuse. Suppose  they did think that? Then what? You and Kiekie would be in a foster home. Is that what you want? Live with parents you don't even know. Because that's what's gonna happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at her mother with a hard look on her face. This thing has gone too far. Now she was ready to stop this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A foster home. Well please do. At least they don't try to stuff me until I look like a overfed pig! That's what you are doing. You want to fatten up me, Christine and Kiekie. You want us to become fat... well In Kiekie's case fatter. But that's what you want, is't it? You want us to become immobile blobs! Why do you want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I love you. Rebecca. You, your sister and cousin would look so much better fatter. You will look even more adorable. I want you to be happy. Fine I forced you to become fat but I did it with the best interest. I was sure you will thank me later. That I made beautiful fat girls from you. I'm sure it's for the best. I never want to hurt you three. I love you three.\"     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You have a strange way of showing it. That you want us to gain weight fine. I can go with that. That you give us a lot of fattening food I could even go with that. But the force feeding is what's going to far! You can't do that to kids! You feed us more then we can handle. We got stuffed to the brim and after that we still need to eat more. It was forced in our throats. And that's where that idea of making us fat is going wrong. Christine I don't think she wants to be fat. As for me... Well I guess I won't mind it to gain more weight. Becoming a nice pear shaped beauty with a nice round butt. Since I think that's gonna happen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer blinked with her eyes for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I did go a bit too fat with this fattening thing. So you don't mind gaining more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... more but not too much. Is that fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me too eat well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't force me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stuck out her hand and Jennifer shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wanted to leave when Rebecca asked her one more thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! Is it strange if a girl loves another girl?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not. Perhaps it does't happen often but it's not strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

All these new feelings she was getting made her own decisions a little wonky at times, ever since Emily\u2019s own confession into liking girls who are much bigger than Rebecca is and was, only made the girl want to please Emily. This new for Jennifer as well she never thought that both her daughters would be come big beauties without any force on them, Christine on the other hand she has always been a handful ever since she was born, even thought Jennifer thought her being like Rebecca and Kiekie would be a nice change of pace from her latest escapades with the woman cop at the beach, yet Jennifer liked the challenge that her favorite piglet opposed upon her, she was just waiting for Christine to break it was only a matter of time before that would happen. <br>\r\nWhile her precious angels slept off all of their meal Jennifer knew that she had to tell Nancy the amazing turn of events that had unfolded while Rebecca was in the tender care of Emily and her mother, she never could have speculated that Rebecca would have been turned on to the fact of becoming a girl of large aspirations so to say. Not knowing if this was just a joke on that Rebecca was planning upon her mother. All she knew was the only one she would have to force to become a big girl any more was Christine and not knowing how this made her feel in the long run was confusing to her to no known ends, all she knew was she must tell her very dear friend Nancy of this new revelation that was brought about by Rebecca\u2019s proclamation of trying to gain weight on her own. Jennifer would love to force her daughter to become nothing more than a blob, but if this is the path Rebecca would choose then there was no need to fatten her up by force. Heading into the kitchen to find where Nancy was, smelling a waft of something delicious it was a shock to the system, delicious pancakes, bacon and many other sweet treats littered the counter she knew the devious look upon Nancy\u2019s face all too well as all the girls were quite small the biggest of them all was also the youngest, this didn\u2019t bode well for the woman as he hard earn work seemed to be all for naught although Kiekie loved her delicious meals it seemed as if Rebecca and the prized piglet Christine would rather be thin than eat, this did not sit well with Nancy as she enjoyed fattening up little children as much as she loved her stories.<br>\r\nNot wanting to disturb the genius that was Nancy\u2019s cooking but she knew that she had to due to the unforeseeable events that had transpired over at Rebecca\u2019s friend\u2019s house something that was strange on all fronts, even though this will put a damper on Nancy\u2019s mood she and Jennifer loved to see the girls cry and be force to become nothing but their little piglet\u2019s but since the rebellious cousin that they had would be more fun then Rebecca ever was, Jennifer had many plans for the little sow but for now she had to tell the woman whom was furiously cooking for the girls in the morning the good news about Rebecca. \u201cMy, my you really know how to cook don\u2019t you Nancy?\u201d Jennifer chuckled as she tried to ease into this long an tedious conversation with a little complement, Jennifer didn\u2019t know how to tell Nancy, for telling news like this was odd and hard to get started, after a few jokes and ideas over coffee as the carrot cake that was being made in the oven begun to rise a deep silence washed over the two women. Staring deep into her coffee Jennifer acted as if she forgotten the whole reason for the conversation and blurted out \u201coh yeah it looks like Rebecca doesn\u2019t need to be forced to eat anymore she want to gain on her own\u201d Not even paying attention Nancy only responded with unaware \u201cthat's good\u201d as she begun to bake even more fattening treats, grabbing for the carrot cake from the oven, it finally hit her of what Jennifer stated all she could muster was a \u201cwait what\u201d</span></div></div>",

No! Why do you ask such a stupid question? Why would you want to kick me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to kick you so long until you finally enjoy being kicked.\" Rebecca said like a woman who explained two plus two is four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think I ever enjoy... oh... you mean... and Cristine will... yeah. But I mean... You'll also learned to enjoy it. So why would't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my reason.\" Rebecca said sounding way mature then she was. \"She does't have any reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Rebecca was looking in a comic. She could't read yet but the enjoyed looking at the images. After all in a comic the images were the most important. Rebecca wished she could read when she suddenly saw Jennifer who went sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca I wanna talk to you about what you said yesterday in bed.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"I don't see why you wanna talk about. We had an agreement. You can't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that. That other part. The part you asked me just before you went to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rebecca remembered that she asked Jennifer if it was strange if two girls fell in love. She  wondered what her mother was gonna say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that man can fell in love woman... and the other way around. Like me and your father. That happens very often, but sometimes it happens that man don't like woman but another man. Those are called gay, and sometimes a woman loves other woman and you call that a lesbian. Some like man and woman and that called bi but let's focus on the lesbian. Because I did't think you asked me that question yesterday just suddenly. Am I right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty. I think I Like Emily. Well more then just like I'm... I'm... smitten!\" Rebecca said and looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand... How about Emily. Is she also... smitten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think she is. But what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think...</span></div></div>",

You with Emily and I with Christine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca gave her mother a strange look. She knew very well what a double date was. She liked it to have a date with Emily since she loved Emily. But did her mom love Christine. Especially since Christine was way younger then her and family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love Christine like a niece. You also love me but not in the way you love Emily now do you. You feel love for your parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, nieces neffe's, aunts, uncles, boyfriends, girlfriends. But the way how you do love them is different. You understand that right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca thought of this. Sure she loved her parents and grandparents but in a different way then how she loved Emily. So her mom loved Christine. And why not. She had enough aunts who also loved her. Nothing strange about that. But Rebecca was't sure Christine liked her mother but she decided not to say that. It would't make any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm gonna call Emily for a play date, and a sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stretched herself. She wore some dungarees. These would't make marks around her tummy. She knew that if she would get really fat her suspenders would snap but for that she needed to gain a lot of weight. She decided to watch some T.V until Emily came over. <br>\r\nKiekie was on the couch watching some silly kid show. Kiekie seemed very happy being almost immobile. Now Kiekie never had been very active but ever since the feeding started she became pretty lazy. Her huge belly was hanging clearly far over her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later Emily came in. When Rebecca saw her her hart made a triple somersault. She realized how smitten she was at this sweet girl. Her mother also walked in and Jennifer took her too the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. It's about what happened yesterday...\" Emily's mother started.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No, no. It's not. But I talked with Rebecca. It seems she... is smitten at Emily. I understand Emily likes her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I must admit I suspected something like that. At the way they acted. So what are we gonna do with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would't worry about that. They're too young to know anything about sex so it will be just cuddling and kissing. That can't do any harm. Just let them have fun with each other. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Good I see you tomorrow too pick up Emily.\" Emily's mother said and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was an unprecedented turn of events as she didn\u2019t believe that even with all the things that happened in Jennifer\u2019s home she never even suspected that Rebecca would ever sell her out like she did. It was quite a shock to her yet with the guff old detective not even properly doing his job, there was nothing for him to find sure their room was messy and Kiekie was a blubbery bundle of joy, but these things weren\u2019t anything to get the police involved with her doings. But knowing how rambunctious her girls were she knew that the only thing she could do was allow Rebecca to be entranced by this Emily girl, and for Christine she knew that this kind of girl only knew one thing and that was having some one in control this was the only this girl will learn her place in Jennifer\u2019s prized possession. Emily\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t help but apologize for all the trouble she has caused Nancy and Jennifer, the trouble that Rebecca caused by her tall tales of how that they were forcing her to eat and gain weight was something that wasn\u2019t heard of when it came to the house of Jennifer it was common knowledge in the small community that was in in the town of Whitefield that when it came to Jennifer, being eccentric was her forte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe girls begun to play with one another, both were quite smitten with one another, holding each others hand as they giggled like a couple of school girls they were just so enthralled to be in each others company they weren\u2019t even paying attention to the discussion that was happening just be hing them, Emily was in a beautiful purple fairy tale dress, that completely accentuated her slender frame and her crisp green eyes that were just piercing, like they looked into your very soul, they reminded Rebecca of her younger cousin\u2019s blue eyes the also had the same affect with her blue eyes, Christine always reminded of her of a doll than a person with her porcelain skin and her blonde hair, maybe this is way Jennifer was always so protective of her prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the living room where both Kiekie and Christine were playing with one another they were not even paying attention to the two love birds that came into the room, they were quite busy with just playing with each other, absorbed with the blocks that they were playing with, Kiekie wobbled around the best she could with her small overweight body, Kiekie was indeed the biggest of the three girls, even though she was the youngest sure she was still mobile it was some what of a chore for her to walk around so she didn\u2019t she was her precious obese baby, sure she was almost obese teetering from it just being baby at to actually being fat, not that it cared to her, she was happy and taken care of. Unlike for Christine the smallest of the three she was plump indeed her body used to be nothing but skin and bones, you could even see the young girls ribs poking out, no problem.  since her time with her aunt her ribs that once could be seen now begun to disappear, beginning to envelop with fat. She was Jennifer\u2019s princess, no matter the cost Christine will become a obedient little piglet, and learn to love her master. Not even realizing that Emily and Rebecca entered the living room to play with the girls, when Emily saw the two girl she said with such enthusiasm \"looks like your not the fattest, huh\"</span></div></div>",

But my mother fattens her up anyway. But Kiekie is a totally different story. She's like a little eating machine. She eats everything edible what she can get her hands on. She wolfs everything down our mother gives her and she still wants more. She just eats and gains and she just wants to get fatter. She does't matter now but I worry if she might worry when she gets older. She's a bit too young to make choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That she's young does't want to say she makes bad choices. It was your choice to become friends with me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hit you on your head with a rattle on mt first day at daycare.\" Rebecca said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it worked. I mean we did became good friends after wards.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went sitting next to Kiekie and could't help herself. She stuck out her hands and touched Kiekie's belly. Softly started kneading, pushing and pulling at it. Kiekie seemed to like it because she was giggling like crazy. Christine was looking with a confused look on her face. Why did this new girl seem to like Kiekie's fat. Why did Kiekie seem to like it. Was she really having fun. Perhaps it was't so bad to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she's the fattest of the three of us. She also likes it to become fatter. But I wonder... she's my sister. So we do share the same genes. What does that wanna say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry about it. You don't look anything like your sister. Just look at your hair. Red and curly is a big difference with blond and straight. Besides that... when I see this little butterball I can clearly see she gains weight all over her body. I see her arms. thighs, butt face all got fatter. But it;s obvious that her belly got the most of the weight. You clearly see her belly is way bigger. So she's like a so called apple shape. You on the other hand seem to gain in you lower half. Your butt and thighs. Also a bit in your belly. That makes you a pear shape. A thin upper part but a fat underside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'm defiantly a pear. Kiekie is clearly an apple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emily was still playing with Kiekie's fat.<br>\r\nSuddenly Nancy walked over to them and picked Kiekie up. It was clearly pretty hard to pick up the morbidly obese baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I and Kiekie go out to eat tonight so it's just you with Emily and Your mother with Christine.\" Nancy said and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she mean by that?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca took her by the shoulders and looked her right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a double date... because Emily... I'm... I'm smitten at you!\" She yelled and kissed Emily on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You silly! I'm smitten at you to! I thought I made that pretty clear yesterday.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did suspect that. But I was't 100% sure but now I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have a date. Wit your mother and Christine. A bit strange to call a dinner between a aunt and her niece a date. Also strange to have a double date wit your mom and niece but all right.

This strange thing didn't bother Emily that much it was just something that was quite odd as she never seen this pair up before, although she had to admit they were somewhat cute with each other, like a queen and her growing princess.  All of that didn't matter right now all she wanted to do was be with Rebecca right now, but it still was quite strange for her to be going on a double date with Rebecca's mother  and her young yet chubby cousin Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rebecca's mother,was the same as her, smitten with another individual that she could see herself with this person, it was something that perplexes Emily to no ends this was something that might just gnaw at the back of her mind. Rebecca was playing with her cousin who seemed somewhat sad how her parents have been on one of their long journey's again, it was quite hard for her, her parents worked for an animal magazine that usually kept them away from their daughter. Rebecca knew that Christine missed them but knowing her aunt and uncle they wouldn't forget about their daughter, knowing about the poisoning that her aunt had gotten while photographing a nest of scorpions for a piece on their nesting habits this frightened the whole family when the news came about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This is one thing that makes everyone worry about them, it was uncertain about the situation that had befallen Christine parents, it was something that was bothering to Jennifer and the children as it has already been a month with no word from them, not that Jennifer was complaining at all she loved her brother and all, but if he knew that she felt so deeply about wanting to turn his daughter into nothing more that her piglet he would have a fit over the whole thing  it was quite weird for a woman of her age to be so smitten with a girl who was born into this world barely two years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Making a large feast for the four of them but she hoped that most would end up in Christine's belly, she was very proud of her daughters growing appetites and Emily was such a great influence on Rebecca and her disobedience towards growing had all but subsided. Wanting to check on the three of the little ones whom were still in the living room Christine seemed to  be playing alone she was just stacking blocks, she was building a little city, her once toned body now jiggled ever so slightly with every movement that her once thin body, now cover with fat, her angelic face now was flabby thanks to her mistress, she knew that sooner or later her life will only consist of eating and being her aunt's plaything. Meanwhile, the two lovers were all alone with each other smitten with one another, on the big red couch that laid in the middle of the living room, they were peacefully laid each other arms for the precious time they had to be with together.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had tried to built up an appetite for tonight and must admit she was very hungry. She also looked forward to it. <br>\r\nJennifer picked up Christine what was getting harder each day. Christine maybe did't want to become fat.

When she was younger she had seen a few freak shows. People with extra limbs or who missed a few limbs. The girl with two heads and the boy with scales. Also the freak who bit of the heads of chickens (however she never really liked that part) The bearded woman but her favorite was always the fat lady. Later it became the fat lady and her fat daughter. Those fat lady's left a deep impression on her. Perhaps partly the reason why she wanted her own daughters and cousin to become fat. <br>\r\nShe put Christine in her high chair and put her bib on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are you waiting for? I'm feed Christine but I'm not gonna feed you two. You have to do that by yourself or... let one feed the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca started to grin wide. Rebecca piled her plate full with food. Emily took just a small amount. Emily took one bite and while she was chewing she took the fork of Rebecca. Put some food on it and brought it too Rebecca's mouth. Rebecca opened her mouth wide and Emily pushed the food inside. This went on for some time. Emily took on bite herself and then fed Rebecca. After Emily cleaned her plate she kept feeding Rebecca who must admit she liked this. She liked being fed by her girlfriend. She also must admit that the food tasted pretty good<br>\r\nChristine suspected a lot of pain and suffering but for some reason her aunt seemed to act pretty nice to her. She wondered if this was a trick. But anyway she must admit she was hungry and you need to eat right. So she opened her mouth and must admit that the food tasted good and her aunt seemed to act less ruff. Perhaps her aunt would be nicer to her from now on. Perhaps she could gain a few pounds. She was a growing girl after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was so lost in the pleasure of eating and being fed by her girlfriend she did't notice how much she ate. After her plate was empty Emily soon filled it again. Rebecca did't noticed or did't care. She just kept on eating. Not noticing how tight her clothes got or how much food was going too her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It was quite a shock to the system for Christine, thinking that her cousin and herself were like-minded individuals on the ways when it comes to being fattened up, this was although as her time with her aunt and cousins became longer and longer it became more and more of a problem for Christine to she began to see the love for her from her master. This was a strange inexperienced area that ever since she began her visit with her aunt, there were things in the world that she didn\u2019t quite understand on her own. She knew that she began to learn her place in her aunts' harem as her prized possession, yet at the same time that she begun to learn her purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing someone\u2019s pet was something so foreign to her, somewhat otherworldly to her, not even knowing how to process these new feelings of the love she was being shown was a whole new experience for Christine.

While deep in thought about these aspects about what was going on with her tiny existence and trying to figure out why being some one\u2019s plaything and having an actual girlfriend might make her feel, sure it was her aunt that loved her and wanted her to be nothing more than her massive pet, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel the to be wanted, that was burning in her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for the couple that was just across the table from her, Rebecca scarfing down all the food that was given to her from the loving hands of Emily, the two girls were quite interested in each other it was something that Christine felt when looking upon her aunt, aunt wasn\u2019t such a great term for her sure it was correct to call her but ever since she became her master\u2019s pet she didn\u2019t know how she felt, the situation left Christine questioning herself and why she enjoyed being owned like a dog. Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but smile at the progress that Emily enticed upon her oldest daughter, becoming almost akin to a mindless eating machine, this was actually quite pleasing to see, almost mesmerized to see her daughter slurp up everything that was put in front of her, from chicken to pork, sweets to sides, anything Emily placed in front of Rebecca it was eaten in a matter of minutes. This is something that Jennifer wished her piglet would do as it was no easy feat to feed young Christine, she was such a rebel when it came to food it, Jenifer loved her little pet so much but she needed to learn that she was in control and that what Jennifer says goes. Remembering that she was on a date with her pet as well, running into the kitchen to acquire the zip ties for Christine\u2019s arms and legs, Jennifer tied up her little pet to start the feeding</span></div></div>",

Jennifer tried to push he spoon inside but Christine kept her mouth shut. Christine thought it might help if she would say: \"I love you master.\" to Jennifer. The plan was't bad but still... talking was a bit hard for Christine. Her parents never pushed her. They always said she would talk when she's ready. Now she wished her parent would have pushed her a bit more. But she would try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Rebecca had closed her eyes while Emily fed her everything. It did't matter what it was Rebecca ate it all, and she enjoyed it. She really liked this. Eating had been a struggle lately since Jennifer forced the food down her throat but being fed by a girl you were smitten about was something totally different. She was really smitten at Emily. <br>\r\nShe heard before on T.V once that sometimes man loved man and woman loved woman. Before she did't knew that people of the same gender could fall in love with each other and now she was in love with a girl. It seemed so right.<br>\r\nShe also found out she liked it to eat. Being fed was fun. This way you could enjoy food. Rebecca loved this so she was a bit disappointed when it stopped. She opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily why did you stop? I really enjoyed this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would like to continue but... you ate everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Everything all ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at the table and saw all the food was gone. The only food left was on the plate of Christine. Had she really eaten everything else. Suddenly she noticed how stuffed she was. She was enjoying the feeding so much she did't noticed how much she ate. Rebecca stretched herself once. That was a mistake. The next moment her pants button flew off, missed Jennifer by less that a inch and ended in the corner of the kitchen. At the same moment her shirt ripped in the front until her chest. Rebecca blushed bright red. She looked at her belly now not longer pushed inside by her clothes. It looked pretty big. How was it possible she did't noticed how much she ate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine still tried to refuse the food. But now she tried to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lowve you maser.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she said something like: I love you master.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Christine sweetie I love you too.\" Jennifer said and kissed her niece on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily I love you too!\" Rebecca said and hugged and kissed Emily who happily returned it.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t understand why Jennifer wanted to be on a date with Christine but she wanted to learn of the relationship the two of them had with each other it seemed like Christine loved her aunt in a ways that wasn\u2019t just from being family, it was just something that she wanted to understand the reasoning for the actions that Jennifer was taking when it came to Christine, she didn\u2019t know why she was just so dominating when it came to Christine. Rebecca was so full thanks to eating enough food for a girl twice her size, it was almost invigorating to see how much she could eat, especially when it came to being fed with the cutest girl she would ever know, Emily. Little burps escaped the mouth of Rebecca as she tried to ease the discomfort that came along with the food that was so sensually place in mouth. Emily looked upon her chubby girlfriend with such love that she couldn\u2019t help but to admire what transformation that Rebecca was going through, it almost excited young Emily to see Rebecca change and grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer could just see the discomfort that Rebecca was in from being stuffed to the gills, it was a look that Rebecca had loved to see upon Christine\u2019s face but since Rebecca was eating on her own she forgoes her normal duties of shoving more food into Rebecca\u2019s face and instead left her piglet alone for just a moment as she carried her daughter to the couch so she could lay down and digest the meal that she had just endured. Rebecca could see how motherly Jennifer was being, it was something that she hadn\u2019t seen in a couple of months since she became so obsessed with feeding them. Her brutality and domination was only reserved for her pet Christine, it was something that Rebecca couldn\u2019t wrap her head around, why did Jennifer love Christine the way she did, it wasn\u2019t like an aunt loving a Neice, more like how Rebecca felt about Emily. To stuffed at the moment for her to properly investigate these questions, she hoped that as she digested the food Emily would be up to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily knew that Rebecca needed to rest and wouldn\u2019t be up to play yet so she just stuck around the table, to see the interesting blossoming relationship that was between Christine and Jennifer. It was strange to say the least as one was a fully grown adult ant the other was just a toddler, Jennifer wanted to feed Christine all the remaining food that was placed upon the table, she wanted her piglet to grow massive. Christine was in turmoil of what she wanted her parents had all but abandoned her in this land where she was nothing more than a play toy for her aunt. Even though this was the case of her life, she never felt like she was not loved. Her growing body was the thing that had attracted Jennifer to Christine, something that Christine wanted to keep to a minimum yet being controlled by her aunt in such a way was making her feel like she belonged, being her master\u2019s doll made her happy. Not knowing how to start this kind of conversation Emily just blurted out what she was thinking, \u201cso um what kind of relationship is this anyways?\u2019 embarrassed in what she just asked to Jennifer she turned red. All Jennifer could do was chuckle while she made a plate of all of Christine\u2019s favorite foods, turning to Emily ever so suddenly Jennifer responded with a calm and collective \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you keep it a secret\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked bored at her aunt. Jennifer sighed and put the spoon on her plate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's very easy you see. I'm a mother. I gave birth to two beautiful girls. First Rebecca and after that Kiekie. By the way believe me getting them in is easier then getting them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get them in in the first place?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh.... I will tell you some other time. But the nine months pregnancy are also pretty difficult. The first months are fine but when your belly starts to expand. When the baby starts kicking because you're not moving, or when it's jumping up and down in your womb. You feel all those things. When you give birth to it it's just so... special. Getting such a poor helpless beautiful living human in your arms. Something you made... with your partner. It's beautiful. It's a love you can't understand... yet. Perhaps once you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get kids?\" Rebecca asked. \"I mean since we're both girls and all. I thought you needed a man and a woman for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are tricks and things and other stuff people use. They still invent new things. Who knows perhaps they even find a way to make girls pregnant from another girl. But we're drifting away from the subject. The part is... a baby is very weak and can't do much. He or she needs you. Especially in the first years. You get very attached to somebody that needs you so much. Christine also needs me. She can't dress or wash herself. She can't even tie her own shoelaces. I need to take care of her because she needs me. I did't give birth to her but... you also have grandparents that love you. And aunts and uncles also love you. Sometimes the babysit you... but mostly they do that for a few hours. I do it twenty-four-seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca even while she was stuffed listened carefully to this. It sounded very logical. Of course you started love somebody if she depended on you. Also the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love her.\" Jennifer continued. \"She means a lot to me. I need to take care of her. Just like Rebecca and Kiekie. caring for somebody that much makes a connection. one that's strong and hard to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like wolfs!\" Emily said. \"The mommy and daddy live with several cubs. They call that a pack. A pack looks out for each other. The connection from the pack is strong and unbreakable. They're very social and intelligent animals. There nothing like the wolf in little red riding hood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine still refused to eat even while she also heard her aunt loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you both love each other... then why the zip ties?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like Rebecca. You're smitten, but do you like everything she likes?'\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeellll, I must admit I don't like Spiderman so much.\" Emily confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Spiderman is cool!\" Rebecca said and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Even if you're smitten there are still things that can be different. Just like Emily and I have a different opinion about eating and weight gain.\" Jennifer said and tried to force the spoon between Christine's lips again.<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Being forced to please her aunt in any way shape or form that Jennifer demanded of her. Jennifer wasn\u2019t even paying attention to Christine due to the fact that Emily seemed enthralled with the young girl, Christine knew better of the reason why her master was sparking up a conversation with this young girl, trying her best to keep the young one to see that they weren't so different was part of her plan to gain the trust of little Emily on her side, she needed Emily to accept the fact that Jennifer only wanted what's best for Christine and that her life was with Jennifer to be fed, pampered and kissed.<br>\r\nEmily saw the implications that came with this kind of relationship that was presented in this one, Christine seemed somewhat complacent with what was given to her yet, she always looked for a way to get away from her master. Jennifer always wondered if she was being somewhat lenient on Christine for being her precious princess, sure Christine grew a bit from her experiences that were living with Jennifer and her ways of fattening up Christine had an effect on her but it wasn't to Christine's liking. She was once so thin and gorgeous that she was the talk of the town but ever since she Rebecca has chosen her for bigger and better things, her place was with her master. Emily looked at Christine with such pride and she seemed to take a liking to Christine or the family, she somewhat understood the relationship that Christine had with Rebecca\u2019s mother it was in the middle line of strange and beautiful all at the same time, having so many questions when it was with this relationship that it just baffled her mind in the most visceral way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine felt a wash of embarrassment as this girl just stared at her chubby self with amazement and wonder, she seemed to content with just staring at her with an eerie kind of smile that made Christine somewhat uncomfortable with Emily. \u201cumm so how come she doesn\u2019t like to eat Rebecca\u2019s mom\u201d Emily piqued up and said, Jennifer could only chuckle at the question that Emily asked with such intent of getting an answer It was almost cute to see this girl so naive to the obvious, \u201cwell you see most girls love to be thin they think its appropriate for them to be apart of the social norms of being of a healthy weight that no one will think them sexy if they are nothing more that eating machines, but you and me know better right\u201d Jennifer winked at Emily as both were kindred spirits when it came to knowing what true sexiness was. Christine was just listening to her master talk about what she thought was sexy she wasn\u2019t even paying attention to guard her mouth against any food that would be tried to be forced in, Seizing this opportunity to feed her precious piglet, Jennifer took some delicious mashed potatoes and shoved it into Christine's mouth, this naturally caused the toddler to weep. Emily still was still trying to ponder the reasoning behind Jennifer\u2019s brutality so again she asked her girlfriends mother \u201cwhy do you force her to eat if she doesn\u2019t want to grow\u201d this abysmal question that Emily asked could only make her laugh a bit, \u201cshe actually does enjoy it my dear, she loves being a brat just to be put in her place.\u201d Shocked at Christine just heard Jennifer just said to Emily, was she right did she enjoy being forced to eat and fattened?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also kind of liked Kiekie's fat. She looked pretty good. Also being dressed like a princess was fine with her. Also the photo shoot was all right. To be honest... except for the food being forced down her throat she liked everything else here. Also playing with her cousins. Being a only child, she was sometimes a bit lonely. Sure she did't have to share and had her parents all to herself but she did't had anyone to play with.<br>\r\nShe started to chew. She did't even noticed she was chewing and eating for some time. She was so caught up in her thoughts she did't noticed Jennifer fed her.<br>\r\nShe stopped refusing. Perhaps she did like this? After all if she wanted to get fat she needed to eat. Did she wanted to get fat? Well she did want to make her aunt happy. Her aunt was happy if she was eating and getting fat. But it also hurt.

For now at least.\" Jennifer said and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so stuffed.\" Rebecca mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbuttoned her pant so her belly had a bit more room. She rubbed her belly and suddenly let out a huge belch that sounded way too loud for such a little girl. But Emily just smiled and put her hands on Rebecca's belly and started to rub. Rebecca closed her eyes and mad moaning sounds in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She does like that does't she?\" Jennifer said. \"She's a nice pear right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But Kiekie is more a apple shape. While Christine is more... is more... all over. Her fat seems to spread over her entire body. While Rebecca's fat goes straight to her butt and thighs while most of Kiekie's weight goes to her belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know body shapes. Also heard about the hourglass shape?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That means: Big thighs, small waist big boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I remember a girl at high school. Renee Roberts. She had huge boobs. Even at young age. It seems that every ounce she gained went straight to her boobs. And all guys were squirming around her. Drooling over her huge tits. They're guy magnets. But you also had Daisy Kersten. She also seemed to have big boobs but when we once went too the swimming pool we found out that she did't have big boobs. She stuffed her bra witch chicken filet's. It appeared she had very small breasts. So small she did't even need a bra. What do you think about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily did't really know what to think about this. They were still very young and did't really thought about boobs. Sure they knew they would get them when they were older but they were't really thinking about them now. <br>\r\nChristine at the other hand was still eating. She must admit the food tasted pretty good. Now it was fine. She was't stuffed yet. The question was would her aunt keep stuffing her even after she was full. However Rebecca had taken care of most of the food so perhaps she was safe. She sure hoped so. <br>\r\nBut what about the fat. She kind of liked that fat on her body. She decided liked becoming fat. Her aunt wanted her to become fat so she would also become fat to please her. Even if that meant that food need to be forced down her throat. <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

It was just boring for her that she could peacefully eat with Jennifer just over watching her in a loving manner, something that she wasn\u2019t used to when it came to Christine, she always one to dominate and force Christine into her own way of thinking sure when it came to her own children it was different for they weren\u2019t her little plaything like what was expected of Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was just amazed at how beautiful Christine was, as she made her girlfriend feel better with some intimate belly rubs trying to let all the food that she just finished eating in a frenzy. Emily looked lovingly at Rebecca while she just lied down just to digest the feeling of Emily rubbing her stomach was some of the best feelings that she had had in a long time the tightness of her stomach and the soft touch that was a reaction to Emily constant rubbing, it was a euphoric feeling that came with the groping. It was a nice feeling, Rebecca started to become sleepy by the rhythmic rubbing by Emily. Jennifer had seen that Christine has finished all that her small stomach could handle, it wasn\u2019t enough for Jennifer she wanted to make Christine massive and at this rate of eating she will never get to the size that she was destined to become. Jennifer knew that she had to force more food into Christine whether she liked it or not, Emily was the only one around to see what was about to unfold. Believing that Emily was more entranced with the act of what was about to happen, feeling so full with all the meat and pasta that she had ingested within the small time frame that this date had started in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine could do nothing but relax as all the food that she just ate made her quite full, a solemness of the situation that she was placed in, she didn\u2019t know how to react to how not aggressive Jennifer was towards her, it made her life much easier yet it was less interesting as well. she didn\u2019t know what to do as she thought that if she just obeyed and ate it would be easier, she didn\u2019t take account that she might actually like being force fed by Jennifer, this was something she just couldn\u2019t get out of her head it seemed as if it was fact as she just felt unfulfilled when was treated like a human being and not a pet. Her own conscious was wondering what she is doing with herself, while she was deep in thought Jennifer was slowly examined Christine\u2019s progress with the threat of being force fed in-toe. Looking at her princess small stomach compared to the massive weight that was her own daughter Rebecca quite displeased Jennifer to no ends, knowing the potential that her piglet had Jennifer took no time at all to add the zip ties to the young girls feet and arms, unable to move from where she was and accept the food that was going to be placed into her mouth she was in bliss. Emily could see Christine struggling to escape from her spot trying to get away from Jennifer in a way that made no real sense to Emily it was almost as if Christine didn\u2019t want to get away at all but want to put up a fight for the pure pleasure of it all, Emily could only watch as an aroused Christine begun her struggle to not be fed, Emily just looked at Jennifer and with wide eyes \u201cso how big do you want Christine to get\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Covered in pounds and pounds of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young feeder looked at Christine. Sure Emily was smitten at Rebecca and that was't about to change, but that did't want to say she did't liked to see other fat people. Image how Christine looked when she would be massive was a picture she wanted to remember. According to Jennifer she liked this too. So Everyone wins. She looked at Rebecca and noticed she had her eyes closed and was softly breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It looks like Rebecca fell asleep.\" Emily said. \"That's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Rebecca's round, bloated belly and could't resist it. She slowly bend down and put her ear on her belly sinking a bit in her fat. She enjoyed that too but now she listened carefully. Inside she heard all the sloshing and gurgling sounds of digesting. She enjoyed hearing those sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Emily you and I are kindred spirits.\"Jennifer said. \"We both like people to be fat but the world thinks different. They think girls need to look like toothpicks. Like those stupid barbie dolls. Girl with not a single pound of fat on them. If I would make those dolls I would make them fat. But perhaps that would't sell good. We life in the wrong time. In the past fat girls were seen as beautiful. Look at those paintings from Botero or Rubens. Even in the stone age they had tiny sculptures of a fat woman. With a huge round hanging belly, big boobs on top of it, big thighs and a large but with extra fat on it. Those sculptures resembled the mother. Something like god. Back then they believed that all animals human and other living things came out of the womb of the mother. Fat woman were a sign of health and beauty who would give birth to many children. Too bad those times are over. Now many people prefer a thin girl instead of a fat one. However... there are still people who think that fat people are beautiful. But most don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. I love Rebecca but I'm not sure if I wanna say that out loud. Not that I'm ashamed of her. It's more that I'm a girl and she's a girl. We're both girls. Some other people might find that a bit strange and don't accept it. So I think it's better to keep it a secret for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. I have no problem with it but in some countries they kill people who fall in love with somebody else with the same gender. Can you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly enough... yes I can.\" Emily squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way do you have a size in mind for my daughter?\" Jennifer suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no. Not really. I guess that's partly up to her. But I will follow and help her the entire way. You can count on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good too hear that.\" Jennifer said and looked at her gaining daughter Rebecca with love in her eyes. She was finally turning into the fat girl she wanted.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time that Emily had finished speaking to Jennifer about being kindred spirits when it came to loving someone who is nothing more that a blob of fat the door had swung open in a loud fashion. It was Nancy and Kiekie who was at the door, Nancy was heaving a very bloated very full baby through the door, it was quite a difficult task for Nancy to carry Kiekie a whom was already obese for her age, it was astonishing to Emily just the sheer size o the little girl. Emily could not help but drool over the soft fat that covered her body, Kiekie just seemed content her face covered in what seemed to be some sort of frosting from an unknown Dessert that has ended up inside the child\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh it's eight already, Well Emily its time to but these two sisters to bed, since you\u2019re a little older you can stay up and help me with this little naughty girl,\u201d Jennifer stated bluntly with a wide grin patting Christine\u2019s head causing her to blush in unintended ways, Christine love the feeling of Jennifer\u2019s gentle hands upon her head just felt right to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had helped Nancy put Kiekie to bed, it was not too hard of a task for it was only one baby that needed to go to bed, the weight of Kiekie was different from what was expected of a baby of her age. \u201cthis girl was made to gain don\u2019t you think Jennifer\u201d Nancy begun to say while she just couldn\u2019t help but rub the massive belly that was connected to this girl, it was like svelte to the touch, so heavy and massive and it was only going to get bigger as time goes forward. Like a sleeping blob it was adorable Kiekie in her overly tight bed time Pj\u2019s, Jennifer and Nancy just look at each other in pure glee at what they were creating when it came to Kiekie, since she had lost control of what Rebecca will turn out to be since she had not her own personal feeder in Emily. Emily was just looking at Christine she wondering this girl will look by the end of the year and if she even like the lifestyle that was given to her, it was a strange lifestyle to have that was for certain as she has become no more than an eating machine. \u201cburp\u2026 so full, why does master have to feed me so much?\u201d Christine asked herself without even noticing the brown haired girl looking at her with so much happy that Christine has found love as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily could only gaze at the swollen gut that was a part of Christine it looked as if she was filled to gills with food, she looked to be almost content with all the food that Jennifer has been giving her as of late. Emily looked like somewhat angelic with the blonde hair and piercing blue eyes that came with Christine, Emily couldn\u2019t just look away from her it was almost creepy on how Emily just stared at Jennifer\u2019s pet, Christine had many things that to think about when it came to her budding romance, sure it wasn\u2019t as traditional as most but she could always feel the love that always radiated from her master, even the slightest touch from Jennifer\u2019s hands made Christine blush with feelings of passion. \u201cdo I love being punished, and fed by master\u201d Christine pondered in her head many times over, she knew this couldn\u2019t be true and yet somewhere it was feeling more and more like it was so. Hearing the creaks that were coming from the old stairs that lead to the upper floors of the house Christine knew her master was coming back, for what was the question \u201cI hope master will spend time with me?\u201d Christine said aloud, not even realizing that Emily was right next to her. Emily with a wide grin on her face begun to ask Jennifer\u2019s pet the most difficult question that was to be asked \u201cYou love Rebecca\u2019s mom don\u2019t you?\u201d not knowing if she should tell the truth or not Christine could only\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew Jennifer told her that Christine liked it, but now it seemed she really did like it. Well Kiekie was a mindless eating machine with one goal in mind: eat everything that came in reach of her mouth. Rebecca liked it as long if she fed her. Christine also liked it so there was no harm in all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do like it? So Jennifer was right. Well I look forward to see you after a year of fattening up. How will Rebecca look then? How will Kiekie look? That kid can only think about food. She also has an endless appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waited while she looked at Christines belly. Finally Jennifer returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So those two are in bed. I put Rebecca in the guest room. It's a big bed so there's room enough for you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was't worried. Rebecca and Emily were both pretty young who did't knew much about sex yet. They did't even knew what it exactly was. Besides she did't think they would do anything strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Christine... are you still hungry?\" Jennifer asked on a sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine shook her head but Jennifer pushed again some food inside. Christine knew it was choke or swallow. She picked swallow. No matter how much it hurt, part of her also liked it She did't understand why or how.<br>\r\nEmily looked with her chin on her hands. She liked seeing this. But she could't explain not even to herself why she liked it so much.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Jennifer was done. Christine's belly was swollen like a balloon. Emily was convinced if you would touch it with something sharp it would explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this little piggy is full. I think it's time for you to go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Emily said and walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what will I do with you now?\" Jennifer asked and looked at Christine.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It would seem as if the time that she spent with Jennifer made Christine\u2019s own morals and desires changed with the domination that has been forced upon her was something that should have never happened, her mother and father were still on their sabbatical in Africa for work and left their only child to be taken care of Jennifer. Christine was happily munching away still in her high chair, the only one that was around her was her master Jennifer who lovingly looked at Christine as she ate the sweets that were shoved into her mouth, chocolate smeared across her face as it was hard enough to get that much food into her tiny frame, Jennifer looked at Christine with such pride as she finally began to learn her place in this world. Christine didn\u2019t understand why she felt this way the only thing that she wanted was to please her master in any way that she could, if that meant bending to her master\u2019s will then she would, being fed without a fight was just so bland to her though she got excited when food was shoved down her throat and called a piglet, she knew that all she was a sow to get fatter and cause her master pleasure by swaying her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clooks like we are all alone my dear piglet, seems as if it's almost time for us to get to bed as well you\u2019ve been an almost good piglet, don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not made we will just have to stuff you silly tomorrow, whether you want to eat or not for my dear you will become so massive soon and every inch will be love\u201d Jennifer stated to Christine whom hinged on ever word that her master spouted from her plump lips, this only excited Christine more she wanted to always know what her master meant, belly kisses were nice and always made it feel as if her face was on fire, wondered what else she could do. Jennifer begun to clean her piglet to get ready for bed, it was harder for Jennifer to carry her slave upstairs it excited Jennifer on how much of a chore it was becoming to carry Christine, she was growing beautifully in every sense of the word. Her pale white skin had no seen stretch marks on her gorgeous body, every roll and fold only accentuated her growing body more, it just made it a pleasure for Jennifer to carry Christine upstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upstairs with her master alone in the princess room Jennifer picked out some cute bedtime clothes for Christine some nice pink pj\u2019s with her favorite show my little pony upon them, they seemed to be a bit ill-fitting for Christine, it was tight for her it stretched around her body to try to fit itself around her but it just couldn\u2019t she Jennifer was just amazed at how the thread of Christine\u2019s pajamas were keeping together. With every move Christine jiggles ever so slightly as the energetic child was led to a scale by her master, \u201cbut master I\u2019m tired and hungry, I wanna go to bed and have some cake\u201d Christine stated to Jennifer rubbing her eye not really wanting to walk, \u201ccome one just this and I\u2019ll give you the a nice reward tonight and tomorrow\u201d wink Jennifer leading Christine on the scale to read out\u2026</span></div></div>",

She produced a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I really need some pictures of this.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Christine sighed. Sure she wanted to make her master happy but she was almost falling asleep right were she was. She just wanted to go to sleep and digest her huge meal. She put her hands on her belly. It was bloated and swollen. It also hurt but in a good way. She never knew hurt could feel good but know she found out it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now try to smile a bit my little piglet.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine smiled weakly but Jennifer was pleased. She let Christine took several poses and made pictures from front, sides, back, standing sitting and even some were she raised her shirt and you could clearly see her belly.<br>\r\nSuddenly Christine opened her mouth but what came out was a huge belch. Jennifer was surprised that such a loud noise came from such a little girl. She sure hoped she did't woke up Rebecca and Kiekie. Emily was probably still awake. She walked too the hallway but heard no noise except a few soft breathings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. You surprised me Cathrine. I did't knew you could belch that loud. You knew my brother used to do that too. Together with his friends. The rest of the family found it disgusting. But I must admit I liked it when they did that. It did't say that or told that too anyone but I always listened to them when they held a belching contest. But you could probably beat them with that belch of yours. The loudest I ever heard. That's really true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did't had a clue where Jennifer was talking about. She let just fall herself on the bed and fell  asleep. Jennifer looked a bit disappointed. She did want to measure Christine but she did't want to wake her. She decided she could take measurements the next morning. At least then the food was digested and spread over her body. She crawled in the bed next too Christine. Kissed her and soon fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emily couldn\u2019t do nothing but think of what bliss she was in so many cute fatties were around her it just seemed to be a dream to her it was just unbelievable her luck seemed to be for her, Rebecca was the the one she wanted to see become the biggest out of all the three, but with Jennifer on a war path for her slave to be so massive that Jennifer can lie upon Christine it was something that she always wanted. Looking over to the left of her she couldn\u2019t do nothing but smile at her girlfriend who was sleeping soundly next to her she didn\u2019t even wake up by the shifting weight of the bed from Emily's constant movement for her to get comfortable, comfortably wrapping her arms around the flub that covered her girlfriends body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was in bliss as she was cuddled with her obese girl friend she was bigger than most girls her age it didn\u2019t really show around her body as her body had the tendency to only make Rebecca\u2019s butt grow the most, she looked like she was the most bottom heavy of the bunch as she grew more and more Emily hoped that more would go to Rebecca\u2019s stomach as Emily wanted more to just grab on to when kissing her growing girlfriend. This was something that made Emily think almost as much as the relationship Christine was in but it was something that would need to be brought up in the morning Emily\u2019s eyes begun to grow weary from all the thinking she was doing when it came to her life and the life she was trying to make with Rebecca. It seemed that Rebecca was becoming the fattest of the three just looking at all three girls it was obvious that Rebecca and Kiekie were neck and neck with each other they were fighting for dominance in the house, yet it was hard for Rebecca to over take her sister as she wasn\u2019t made the same way as Kiekie who was just an eating machine, Kiekie took pleasure from eating like a pig it was something that only she could do with such gusto that it make her mother feel proud to have birthed such a magnificence creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jennifer begun to get into bed with Christine as well, it was a late night for them both, crawling into bed with her slave was something that was like a dream as she just lied next to Christine in pure bliss. It was enjoyable for Jennifer to see that Christine had accepted her place as Jennifer\u2019s play thing even if the girl was strange in liking being tied up and forced to eat so much food, sure it excited both of them but it was a grueling process that doesn't get much results, if it was the only way that Christine was going to become the blob of Jennifer\u2019s dreams then so be it. Looking over Christine\u2019s body, it was clear to see that the girl was a born eater all she needed was the needed push in the right direction, she was indeed the smallest of the three but in the morning Jennifer was going to make that change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally arriving in the country buffet for breakfast for the group, smelling the aroma that was wafting in the air by the various foods around the area giving the place such great smell, the open area that let people of all ages gather around the buffet and get their much desired grub on. Jennifer looked at the three girl\u2019s in her care and couldn\u2019t help but feel pride, sure all three were growing magnificently under her supervision but it was just amazing to see how much bigger they were getting, Christine had a bit of a slow start to her gaining, but she was at a respectable hundred and twenty-five pounds for her weight, this made Jennifer feel proud of what she was turning Christine into all she would want to do was to pamper Christine force feeding the young girl while she laid upon her massive frame. Nancy was winning the fight for dominance when it came to fattening up Kiekie she was the biggest of all three of the girls that much was clear by just looking at her, her chubby body was cover in fat from Nancy\u2019s frequent feedings of the poor girl. Kiekie was more like a little glutton than any of the other girls as she just lived to eat, this of course was fine with the two women who enjoyed watching the little girl get bigger and bigger with each day was something that Nancy and Jennifer loved to see, Kiekie was just going to get larger any way so why not have fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older one of the two sisters had found love in the form of Emily, showing promise in this budding relationship between the two girls Rebecca had accepted her mothers own perversions of thinking by trying to get fatter for the woman she loved. It was working for Rebecca as she pushed passed the two-year-old weight and was around ten pounds heavier that young Christine, this was something that was astounding as all Rebecca did beforehand was fight with her mother and her feedings, in one fell sweep Emily had changed the mind of Rebecca to enjoy the life of being a fat girl it just amazing the power of love had on people it was almost the same way Christine thought about her mistress. Coming to the greeter to the county buffet, a young girl in her late teens was there to greet the group and lead them to their seats to enjoy a great meal together in each others company, \u201cwelcome to county buffet, how many people for this morning?\u201d she asked without even looking at Jennifer, Nancy or even the kids. \u201cSix please and some where not too crowded please\u201d Jennifer politely asked the girl who was too enthralled with her computer to even look at them, \u201csure that is no problem mam we have lot of space this morning is something by the window to you liking?\u201d the girl asked finally looking at Jennifer in the face for the first time since they got there. Shocked at what she saw it was only natural that obese people usually came here for the most bang out of the buck, but three of the children to be this big was just a shock to the young girl she couldn\u2019t wrap her head around this little conundrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way mam, your table is in this corner right next to the window\u201d the girl said gently, on the inside she was freaking out seeing children being this overweight was something that she wished not to get involved with, \u201cjust place them in their seat and get back to your job\u201d she softly whispered to her self while placing all five in boot and getting a wooden ill fitted high chair for the biggest baby she had ever had laid her eyes upon. Almost running the girl got as far away from that table as she could without making a scene, it was almost abysmal on how calm the other women were when it came to the size of their children almost sickening to think anyone could be okay with their children being this overweight. \u201call right girls go on and fill up those plates to your hearts contents just no wasting food here, you pick it up you eat it\u201d Jennifer stated to the children so the could learn how this place worked and all of its tandem, Jennifer couldn't wait to force ever small morsel down the throat of her piglet, grabbing to plates she begun to place all the food she could on then, all for Christine to enjoy, whether she wanted to or not.</span></div></div>",

This chair was too small for her and Nancy thought there was a chance Kiekie would break it because of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Rebecca could you keep an eye at Kiekie while I go get some food.\" Nancy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... sure nor problem.\" Rebecca answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie already noticed there was a lot of food not too far away. She wanted to eat. But she could't reach the food. She could't crawl and she surly coud't walk. And with all of her extra weight and no signs of slowing she would probably never will. She could move just a little bit by wiggling with her body. But she would be never able to reach the food from here. She looked with hungry eyes at her big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hungry are't you. No wonder you're always hungry are't you. You just can't wait to eat everything they have over there. Don't worry. I'm sure Nancy will get a lot of food for you and feed it to you. Emily is getting food for herself and me. She wants me to get bigger just Nancy wants you bigger. However you get and even bigger belly,\" Rebecca said and patted Kiekie's belly \"While I gather my weight here.\" She said and patted her thighs and butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie did't had a clue what her sister mend. All she cared about was getting food. But no matter what her sister said, it sounded comforting. She looked with big eyes and wished she would be able to understand more words. She stretched herself once. How could she make her sister understand she just wanted the food. She tried to bend her fatty arms towards the food. But Rebecca did't moved and just kept talking at her.<br>\r\nShe was just about to throw a tantrum when suddenly Nancy returned with a plate filled with food. She put it down at the table and Kiekie reached out with her roly-poly arms to the food. Nancy picked up a fork and brought some food to Kiekie's face. As soon if it came in reach of her greedy mouth she ate it. <br>\r\nRebecca was surprised how fast Kiekie ate. She ate so fast she barely had time to chew. Perhaps she did't chew at all. <br>\r\nIt did't matter what it was. Grains, vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, potatoes. As long if it was edible Kiekie ate it as soon if it came in reach of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I did't knew anyone could eat so fast.\" Emily mumbled impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she's a fast little eating machine is't she.\" Rebecca said and took a bite from her food, and looked at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Rebecca.\" Emily said. \"Just let me first eat my own breakfast then I will feed you till your bursting point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this girl has a bursting point.\" Nancy said who was still busy feeding Kiekie who had shown no signs of getting full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie seemed to really be a bottomless pit.    </span></div></div>",

The girl who was still in her pajamas as is was almost futile to put the girl in anything that wasn\u2019t stretchy as her body was trying to accommodate the bloating Kiekie was experiencing with the food she was placing into her stomach her, her short messy hair wasn\u2019t even properly combed, they just came here as soon as they changed Kiekie\u2019s diaper. Emily and Rebecca were just amazing at the efficiency and speed Kiekie had eaten at least two full plates of food from Nancy\u2019s willing hands, stuffed to the gills on all the foods Kiekie loved to stuff into her mouth, mouths gaping Emily and Rebecca couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around the plates that Kiekie had just polished off all by herself. Emily and Rebecca wanted to enjoy the food for themselves getting up from their seats hands collapsed into one another\u2019s, both blushed gently at each other their faces beaming with love, it was easy to see why these two like each other in this manner, a perfect complement to each other in ways that themselves didn\u2019t really understand why they were enamored with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Looking at all the many foods that spread across many tables that filled the halls of this establishment, Rebecca begun to salivate from her mouth just thinking about the food that was going to be shoved into her gullet by Emily, hoping to beat her little sisters record of two large plates of food Rebecca tugged at Emily's hand gently, she was determined to eat until she was too full to move. \u201clets get you something for that growling stomach\u201d Emily softly whispered into the ear of Rebecca as she placed a hand on her meaty thighs, giving them just enough of a pinch for Rebecca know how devious Emily was going to be with her at this buffet date. Looking at all the choices that were there for the taking Emily begun to just pile food upon the plate she had brought with her, from eggs slathered in cheese to chocolate pancakes drenched in butter and syrup, this feast was going to expand Rebecca\u2019s experience into something she hadn\u2019t yet experience when it came to food, a pleasure to devouring every last morsel that has been given to her by someone who loves her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Returning to the table the two looked at each other with determination for what they were planning to transpire, softly Rebecca sat down in the booth that was position in a manner that seemed as it it was in a serene area, a pond was just on the other side of the window on the side of this building, birds chirped with such enthusiasm that everyone could tell that today was going to be a great day of May. Looking around the table Rebecca could spot a gorged one year old sleeping quite soundly in Nancy\u2019s arms, her face covered with various sauces that drenched the meat that Kiekie had just devoured for Nancy, it was a loving scene, for all the trouble Nancy has caused Christine and Rebecca in theses few months of her taking care of the three girls she really did love the girls as a mother would. Rebecca could only smile at seeing this gently side of Nancy, but the real focus should have been on Emily as she got everything ready for Rebecca\u2019s feast at her own hands, seeing how far this girl would be pushed to was always exciting to see to Emily. Only dreaming of an immobile Rebecca surrounded by a equally huge Kiekie and Christine was something that the young girl was going to see, sooner or later.</span></div></div>",

However she always tried to escape the force feeding by letting Kiekie and Christine be stuffed instead of her. She did feel a bit bad about that. Not for Kiekie since she liked this. At the other hand they never needed to force Kiekie to eat more. She would devour everything edible if it came in reach of her mouth. But still her stomach did stretch a bit and thinking about how much she liked it when Emily fed her she was able to force more food in her stomach. <br>\r\nSince she did't had breakfast she really was hungry.<br>\r\nThe next moment a spoon full of egg was pushed in her mouth.

Placing a hand on the massive stomach that was connected to Rebecca\u2019s body, Emily could just feel how tight as a drum Rebecca\u2019s stomach had become it just sent shivers down the spine of Emily too see her girlfriend in such a helpless state, it was as if Emily was there to take care of Rebecca\u2019s every need, physically and mentally. Even though it has only been a week since the two have ever even thought about going out with one another or even if it was even okay to have these strange feeling with for one another, their bond seemed to be quite sincere when they are around each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the only two who haven't come back to the table with food is Christine and Jennifer, Nancy was actually worried for the poor girl who was with Jennifer since it seemed to Nancy that there was going to be a feast for one girl to start quite soon. \u201cnow what shall we get you to eat, I wonder if they have any sweets around here?\u201d Jennifer asked her self as she looked around the area there was many things to choose from to start shoving into Christine's mouth, looking around she began to saw what this place had to offer to her grabbing a few plates for her little one to devour wasn\u2019t the hard part it was trying to juggle the fact that Christine like to make it hard for Jennifer to fatten her up and she found the pleasure in the act of trying to refuse their feedings that were going to be coming her way. \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to eat, I don\u2019t want to be your piglet\u201d Christine sobbed trying her earnest to deter Jennifer from gathering as much food as she could, it didn\u2019t defeat the spirit of Jennifer to see Christine struggling the way she was. Making four separate yet equally high piles of food on the plates she had gathered all were separate but enticing, to say the least, the first was an all meat plate for her little one\u2019s growing body needed the sustenance of meet to expand even more outward that she had already had, the second was of Christine\u2019s favorites, from the cheesiest mac and cheese to the fluffiness that came with crab Rangoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two were just filled with sweets to the prim from cakes to pies it was full with all the delectable little treats that Jennifer could fit onto the plates she was given, placing them on a cart to be catered to the table where the other four girls were sitting, it stirred up so much pride in her to see her two daughters become blobs of their former selves, if only Christine was more like them, but there would be no fun to be had ant we would have so many intimate moment that I hold so dear\u201d she thought to her self while just looking at her princess, the once fitting pajamas that she love now were tight upon her body, letting a small just luscious crack of flesh peek out from under her clothes. It didn\u2019t even bother the young girl that her belly was sticking out in public, but what did happen was it made her mistress want more and more to rub her growing rolls and just have a passionate kiss with Christine for once, alone from prying eyes.</span></div></div>",

Jennifer wasn't even paying close attention or any for that matter on Christine she was busy just chatting with Nancy about what they were creating in these three girls, feeling the fat of an over exerted Kiekie she was quite full from her past stuffing that she didn't even care that two women were groping and prodding her obese body. \"My she is looking quite well I would say, very adorable with this big belly of hers\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated feeling and lifting her daughters belly just to feel the pure weight of it, she was considered obese by any standard of thinking, her clothes barely fit her growing body she was practically suffocating in her pajamas as they were made for a girl who was at least have her size.

Christine still crying at her master not taking any time for her and just focusing on Kiekie is what caused this uproar \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I not big enough, I thought you loved me I want to be a good piggy, but I want to be force fed and always d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6dumoated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Struggling to say the word dominated made Jennifer chuckle at this little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even comprehend what Christine was saying, Leaning into Christine she kissed the young girl and stated quite boldly \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I do this will you stop having these tantrums, there is no going back when you answer\u00e2\u0080\u009d, thinking about her answer the young toddler said in a sultry tone \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeed me\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put Christine back in her high chair and started to feed her while she tried to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I'm fine with it if you stuff Kiekie since she wants to be fed and become fat. But why are your forcing Christine to become fat?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Kiekie likes it to eat willingly and get fat. Christine likes it to be force fed and get fat. It's just such a thing that people like. You understand that when you're older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other with a confused look at their face. But both lifted their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever I guess. But what about you? Are your still hungry?\" Emily asked on a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry but I surely am not full. Go on, keep it coming!\" Rebecca answered and opened her mouth wide, and Emily fast pushed some more food inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy in the meantime was still focused at Kiekie. But as long if Jennifer put her full attention to Christine, Christine was happy. She must admit she liked this. Being forced to eat. She could't explain not even to herself why she liked this so much since most parents would see the refusing to eat like a sign of being full and stop feeding while she wanted the opposite thing. <br>\r\nHowever Three entire plates were now emptied in her belly and she was halfway the fourth. But now she was starting to get full. But now she knew Jennifer really needed to become rough. She at the other hand needed to swallow or else choke. But that was just the fun part. In how much pain she was after that stuffing.<br>\r\nJennifer picked up another spoon full. Christine looked away but Jenniferer followed her and finally pushed the spoon between Christine's lips. No mater how hard Christine tried to stop eating Jennifer found a way to force the food down her throat.<br>\r\nChristine was now really full but saw there was still one plate left on the table. She knew what was gonna happen but was't sure about this while Jennifer filled a spoon with food and brought it to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she really be able to finish that last plate?\" Emily asked Rebecca on a whispering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm not sure. Christine can pack away a lot of food, but this a awfully lot. But I'm sure my mother will force even the last bite past her lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was totally right. Jennifer forced the food In Christine's mouth. But no matter how much Christine liked it her tummy did't liked this at all and was protesting but Jennifer was deaf to the protesting of the tummy or did't care. Christine had the feeling she would pop or rip or something else. Her kin was tight. She felt like a balloon who was blowing up further and further until it would pop. <br>\r\nBut suddenly the feeding stopped. She looked at the table and saw five empty plates. All the food was in her belly. She was in pain, and totally stuffed till over the brim and ready to pop. The next moment she passed out, stuffed with food.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

The intimacy that Rebecca had felt between Emily was worth the pain all the food had placed on her stomach. \"All right girls it's time to go home and get you ready for a fun day at the park  and dinner with a movie later, since our dear friend Emily will be picked up by her mother after the movie\" Jennifer said, Rebecca understood that Emily couldn't live with them but she wanted to always be around Emily arms and her love. The only problem they had was Kiekie who was fast asleep in the highchair stuffed with so much food that she was put in a food coma, \"she is such a precious angel when asleep\" Nancy whispered to Jennifer as she picked up Kiekie as softly as she could trying not to jostle the young girl awake. Feeling the squishiness that was Kiekie's body made Nancy blush a bright red color, as feeling her hand sink into the young girl was pleasurable, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was a long morning, to say the least, be8ng stuffed to the gills with so many delicious foods was heaven for Kiekie, yet there was still more food her obese body needed to taste in this world. Rebecca was also in pure bliss feeling the soft hands of Emily on her body sent shivers down her body, the feeling of being cared for by Emily and being her lover was all Rebecca could think about at this moment, the only thing that could concern Rebecca was the pressure that was actually being placed upon Christine. Perplexed by the change that has developed in Christine, it was a quirk that was quite hard for Rebecca to understand, she didn't know why her cousin loved the feeling of having no control over herself, being basically a doll for her mother to plaything enticed Christine \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome on you girls its time for us to get home for and ready for our day of fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer said, Rebecca was trailing behind everyone one else due to her being deep in thought about the conundrum that was Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Psyche. All six girls began to pile into the car to head back to the house for some time to relax for a while before going on their picnic, yet Jennifer had other plans beforehand, thinking it would be a great time to measure all three girls before going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally arriving home from the long trip from the buffet, all of the girls were more energetic than before due to them actually having time to actually digest their massive meals that they had all eaten to please the people that were closest to their hearts, although when it came to Kiekie it was food that was the closest to her heart. She never got as much pleasure as she did with anything other than a good meal to be placed in front of her, this was the downside to Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality for if she had to choose between her sister or food, she would choose food. Being carried inside the house was being more and more of a chore as Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was so large it hung low covering the delicate parts of this young girl, even though Nancy was the one who was tasked with caring for their little glutton while helping and being somewhat employed to her friend Jennifer as Jennifer herself cares for her pet project, Christine, yet Nancy had no feeling or concerns for the young girl, as the only thing Nancy wanted to do is make sure the girl grew massive. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what effect it would have on young Kiekie or what the girl thought of becoming so big she will never move again. This estranged relationship was alright with Kiekie who knew her only real love was the food that would surround her every day. With everyone resting from breakfast Jennifer had a great idea to pass the time, grabbing some key items that would be needed, some measuring tapes, scales and a camcorder before exclaiming with such vigor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho wants to be measured first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And Kiekie did't realized she would be second and even if she did she probably would't care as long if she got her food.<br>\r\nJennifer thought about the future. Three obese girls. Rebecca, Kiekie and Christine. Suddenly she saw a fourth girl in her fantasy and slowly put a hand on her belly. Except for her parents and doctors no one knew she was pregnant. Not even Nancy or Rebecca. However she was't sure if Rebecca knew it. Rebecca was very bright and mostly knew what happened around her. Perhaps she knew but she did't said anything about it but who knew. It would still need about six months before it would come out her womb. But if she thought about her daydream, she did't even knew if it would be a girl or a boy. Oh well... she would worry about that later. It would still take a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer.\" Nancy suddenly said. \"That girl Kiekie. I mean I am hardly able to carry her anymore. She's very heavy and she's gaining like crazy. No wonder if you see everything that disappears in her tummy but I'm not sure I be able to carry her anymore. Not for long anyway. And to be honest I think she breaks a stroller or buggy and I doubt she'll ever walk. She can't even crawl. Even if she would crawl it would be with her belly dragging over the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. Guess we won't taking her outside too much. At least not in public. I did't like how other people were looking at us. Like if we did something wrong with those kids. They're perfectly healthy kids. You also did't hear me complain that one girl was allowed to dye her hair purple or that other girl, her pants were so short she might not be wearing any. I mean I saw underwear that's longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because girls want to show their long legs. To attract boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in our time we also knew how to attract boys without dressing like sluts. Well does't matter. I'll take Christine upstairs for a photo shoot. You keep an eye on those other three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy saw Kiekie watched T.V and the other two only had eye for each other.<br>\r\nIn the meantime Jennifer picked up Christine and took her upstairs. She placed her on the bed and put the camera on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right in: 5, 4, 3, 2 ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went sitting next too Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sweetie. How do you feel? I guess you're pretty stuffed from all the food you just ate.\" Jennifer said and lifted Christine's shirt to show her big belly. \"Well let's see how much you weigh now. You seemed to have gained a lot. Last time it was 40 pounds and now it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine enjoyed this time with her aunt. At least this way she got some personal attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"45 pounds. Christine you gained 5 pounds I'm so proud at you. Well done. Now let's take you measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her measuring tape and took Chritine's new measurements and wrote them down excited to check how much wider she was. Thinking about the fact that Kiekie was perhaps even wider. How long would it take before she was wider then the measuring tape? Perhaps she also needed to do this with Rebecca. She was nicely turning into such a beautiful pear sized beauty.<br>\r\nShe took the camera and started taking photo's of Christine.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Christine was loving the time she spent with her aunt and the bond they had together, Christine did worry about her parents and where they were as it has been a couple of months since she had seen them, this was the downside of having parents that love their work more than their children. It has been this way for the longest time, Christine would always be left at Aunt Jennifer's house as they took a monthly sabbatical to a far-off land that Christine was too young to venture too, the only one who loved and cared about Christine's well-being was her aunt Jennifer. At first, she didn't understand how real this love was until now, the touch of Jennifer's hand on her skin sent goosebumps throughout her body, feeling delicate, yet provocative enough that it made Christine wanting more from Jennifer. the simplest touch was enough for Christine to feel loved and safe, yet Christine couldn't help to notice how she was changing her size wasn't as it used to be, she was bigger than she was when she first started to live with her master.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A part of Christine still holds onto the notion of returning to her former self a girl who was so thin that she started with just a couple of months ago. she used to weigh a healthy weight of twenty-five pounds when she first arrived at this house, yet now she teetered between just being fat and being obese, Christine had a hard time moving around with all this weight on her small frame, yet seeing how Jennifer loved her chubby body made Christine want to grow even larger for her mistress. Feeling Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fat body was simply sublime to Jennifer, the doughy texture to this pale girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach sent shivers down her spine, having so much push in this little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was quite svelte to the touch making Jennifer wanting to touch it more. Being touched in such a way was quite new to Christine, she never saw herself as her Aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Plaything or lover she only saw her as a family member nothing. Christine never needed to explore her sexuality before her meeting with and enslavement to her aunt, all she needed to do is be a good girl and play, it was a whole new experience for Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer knew that she needed to get the other girls in here before they could leave for a nice day at the park for a great lunch, lovingly Jennifer looked at the little chubby girl a girl who almost doubled her weight in a few short months and asked her sweetly \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristine be a dear and get Nancy and Kiekie in her for their photo shoot and weighing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, master, anything for you\u00e2\u0080\u009d, feeling the happiest that Christine had felt in a long time, she was practically floating on air thanks to her master kissing Christine and rubbing her growing belly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy and Kiekie, Master wants you\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young girl stated with a chuckle as she sat down on the couch to join the two other girls who were preoccupied with their favorite movie, Tangled. Seeing that all three girls were being good to one another Nancy began her hefty journey in bringing Kiekie to her mother to be weighed and measured, Nancy also wanted to ask Jennifer did to make Christine feel like she was on cloud nine as well. Emily and Rebecca couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but see that Christine was overly happy now, her mood took a complete one-eighty since this morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temper tantrum about Jennifer spending too much time feeding everyone else. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This brand new outlook on Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation was a clear sign that there was something going on and the two girls wanted to know what that was, her sunny deposition was somewhat strange for Emily and Rebecca since Christine gets force fed food all the time, which causes her to cry constantly. The two girls wanted to know if Christine really did love crying and being force fed by Jennifer or not, as they were confused to why she would want to be sad all the time and forced to eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing she understood was that there was nothing in her mouth. She started to move. Moving was't something she was really good in. But she could move enough to make her whole body wobble. Jennifer noticed this and focused on Kiekie. <br>\r\nShe got the measuring tape and measured Kiekie all around. Kiekie did't understood what was going on but enjoyed the attention she got and how her mother praised her and was happy with her. She did't knew why but she was happy anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right now with the camera. All right 6...5... 4... 3.. 2...

Kiekie and Nancy bot seemed to like it. Jennifer got almost jealous.

The scale spun around and around until it stopped on a healthy weight of fifty pounds for Kiekie, this was big for a girl of her age as for normal nine-month-old were not even close to this size, Kiekie just loved food very much is being a big part of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was like a coping mechanism for Kiekie, food was always abundant in their house and whenever she would feel even a little bit sad food was there to comfort her through the trying times of her life, food would never abandon the young girl in her time of need, it would only make her happier if times seemed so glum in her eyes. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why her daddy wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t around anymore or why her mother was always so sad and alone, she had Kiekie and Rebecca were there to support her in her the dark times that existed because of her father died just before Kiekie was even born. Seeing the joy that it brought her mother to be feeding Kiekie to her absolute limits was just a bonus for the little girl, her real caretaker was Nancy, yet Kiekie felt that the woman really had no feelings for Kiekie and Kiekie was just a project for her to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Feeling the fat that covered her daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was euphoric to Jennifer, the squishiness of the pure fat that surrounded this little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was what Jennifer was trying to achieve with her harem of little girls whose sole purpose was to serve Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires. Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires had changed now since her oldest had found someone to love in the girl known as Emily, Emily is like Jennifer when she was her age always questioning what is right and wrong, not knowing if she should indulge in her feelings for larger ladies or if it was wrong to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow if only your cousin could be an eating machine like you kiekie, she would be the biggest in no time, but she has to be difficult when it comes to eating and enjoys the pain that comes to being forced to eat\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated to the young girl knowing full well that Kiekie wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to respond as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really talk yet only spoke with incoherent babbles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, Jennifer, I know you asked me to help you fatten up your daughters and all but my question is why are you taking such an interest in Christine, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really anything special with that girl I mean sure she is a looker, but Kiekie is the one with the most potential of actually becoming a blob since she is still heavier than that girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy question her friend why she kept her eye on a girl who was making so much trouble for the group. Jennifer knew that Nancy was right but Christine was the one who caught her eye she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why but she whenever she was alone with Christine she felt almost as giddy as a high school girl, trying to avoid the question that Nancy had proposed to Jennifer she begun the difficult process of picking up her daughter and moving her  to the other room, fifty pounds of pure fat was definitely nothing to sneeze at, Kiekie almost felt like wet cement with how heavy her body has become. Jennifer hurried to put Kiekie on the couch to relieve the stress that this put on her back and to also get ready for the final couple who were cuddling on the couch right next to Kiekie kissing each other. This was adorable to see as Jennifer could feel their love as if it was a solid mass, not wanting to disturb them Jennifer quietly said to both girls \u00e2\u0080\u009cRebecca and Emily its your turn to get measured\u00e2\u0080\u009d hopping down from the couch the two girls begun their journey to the measuring room, Rebecca was nervous as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if she was meeting the requirements her girlfriend was placing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew her mother focused most on the weight and that was a bit on her belly but mostly at her butt and thighs. Emily put on big eyes when Rebecca went sitting on the bed in just her underwear. She liked seeing this. She felt her mouth got dry. Jennifer took the camera but suddenly Emily pulled her sleeve.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Eh... sorry... but...\" she licked her lips. \"Can... I... take... the... pictures?\" Emily asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well... I don't see why not.\" Jennifer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled while she watched Emily taking pictures. Emily was just like her in a way. She liked fat girls. Something they both liked. She knew Emily also liked to see Kiekie and Christine fattening up but she was really smitten at Rebecca. She wondered how long the relationship would last. So many girls had several relationships before they found the right one. She also had several relations before she married the father of Rebecca and Kiekie. Sure, maybe the first person you fell in love with could be the person you wanted to spend the rest of your life with, but most person had more the one relation.<br>\r\nShe sighed a bit and thought at Rebecca's father. Then she looked at Rebecca. Rebecca did look a lot like her father. After her husband died her mother lived with them for a month. Good thing too or Rebecca would probably have starved. Jennifer felt so lost. But she could't look at Rebecca for some time because she saw the face of her husband in Rebecca. But thanks to her mother she got back on track and could look at Rebecca again without any trouble. Soon followed by a second child. The love she had for Rebecca's father changed in mother love for her two kids. And now Christine.<br>\r\nIf Rebecca and Emily really would have a long relationship would they also have kids? not from each other of course but you could get a sperm donor. Or perhaps adopt a kid. There were ways. But would Emily also fatten that child up? She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was so lost in thoughts she did't even noticed. She took the camera and took a look at the pictures. They were pretty good. Emily was good at taking pictures. Perhaps she could make some money with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right now a video. Emily you wanna film?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer got on the bed looking at Rebecca and saw again the face of her dead husband but soon shook that thought away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Rebecca finally you're also gaining some pounds. Especially around the lower area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed and pinched Rebecca's fat. Rebecca thought this would have been more fun with Emily then with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right now...\"   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Rebecca has always been an unruly child she was a free spirit, this first started when her father died just last year, it was something the two of them had always fought about it was a recurring theme in the house. Jennifer was broken and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know if she could take care of her daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alone, that is why Nancy was always around the family from then on, Jennifer needed help to take care of the girl and cope with her loss that had been plaguing her ever since it happened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cokay Rebecca if you would be so kind and step on this scale so we can get an accurate reading of how heavy you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting\u00e2\u0080\u009d blushing very hard from her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement about her weight, Rebecca knew that she was growing fatter for the girl she loved but at the same time talking about her growth was something that she was been embarrassed about. Always wanted to seem to be a proper lady around others talking about her weight was just a little naughty to Rebecca, not knowing why something so trivial as her weight would make her so uncomfortable, it just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emily held her girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand to make the embarrassed girl in a calmer state, leading Rebecca to the scale in a way that would not provoke the girl and make her sure of why they were doing this softly Rebecca stepped on the scale, worried about what Emily would think about Rebecca when she would see how much or how little she weighed. Feeling the cold touch of the metal scale on her feet was another thing that she had to deal with, other than being poked and prodded like some sort cattle by her mother, it was embarrassing to Rebecca as everyone stared at her with hungry eyes. The scale began its spin to tell her adoring audience how much she weighed, anxious to see how much she had gained with her time with Emily this weekend she knew that she would be obese, but there was still a bit of an allure growing for someone who you loved. Finally, the scale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spinner stopped moving to give Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience an insight of how heavy the five-year-old was, Jennifer looked closely at the scale with a notebook in hand to keep track of all the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weights in a proper and orderly fashion. Stopping at about sixty-seven pounds that Rebecca had gained by the help of Emily and her persuasions of making Rebecca okay with the thought of becoming as big as possible, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy looks like we have a real competitor for the crown for the queen of fatties\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy chuckled after seeing how much the girl weighed. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything to sneeze at she was slightly obese thanks to the constant love and affection that was given her by Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca was astounded of how much she had put on in these short months, looking at her butt she could see where most had gone, the cloth of the dress that contained her bottom-heavy physique was looking a little tighter than usual, it was hard for it to contain all the flab that went to her thighs stomach and butt. Jennifer was quite happy with these results as shown upon her face, it was much easier for Rebecca to grow with this little girl Emily around, knowing that Rebecca would do anything to make Emily happy was enough to get ideas of how to abuse this weakness in her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cokay let me just place this on the chart and then we can start to leave to go to the park for a nice picnic, I hope you girls are still hungry for I have many delicious things for you to consume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca began salivating at the indication that there will be more food at the park, \u00e2\u0080\u009cumm Miss Jennifer can I ask you something in private before we go to the park?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily asked, a bit taken back by the fact that Emily of all people wanted to talk in private about something Jennifer could only accept her proposal of secrecy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They look way better and both will be happy with it later in live. I'm sure that they will thank us later after they turned into beautiful fatties. I only wanted best for Christine, Rebecca and Kiekie. But Christine wants to be forced. I need to push her because she likes that. Just like you push Rebecca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. True I like Rebecca more when she's fat. I like her gaining and feeding her and see her getting fatter but... I don't force Rebecca to eat if she does't want to. I just feed her and encourage her to eat more but if she don't want to eat I would't force her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rebecca and Christine are two very different girls and so are you and I . Good thing too. It would be kind of boring if we all  would be the same right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess. One last question. Could I have a copy of those photo's and measurements?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Will you be careful no one else sees them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a unused diary with a lock. I can use it for that. I like this way more then writing and/or read what I have done one single day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. l'll give you a copy. I need to go some place anyway. There's a copy shop in the same street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily already stopped listening. After she heard: \"Good. l'll give you a copy.\" was all she wanted to hear. She walked after Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are.\" Rebecca said. \"What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing. I just wanted to ask your mother something.\" Emily answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she walked a bit behind Rebecca so she got a good view at her big wobbling butt. She never knew she liked butts that much until she saw this one. They walked into the living room. Kiekie was having a nap on the couch, her belly sticking up in the air like a small hill. <br>\r\nChristine was building a tower with blocks. However the most fun part about it was to push the tower over. Rebecca remembered how she did that with her father and how he laughed when ever the tower was pushed over. He even taught her how to put blocks on a row and then push the first one over that pushed over the second one and that the third and so on. Just like domino. Together the made a lot of different figures. Rebecca had loved those moments. Perhaps she needed to learn Christine how to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right is everybody ready for the picnic. I made a lot of food!\" Nancy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie woke up with the word food. But the obese girl was't able to get up on her own. She was struggling in way too tight. clothes. Of course all clothes of Kiekie were tight on her since she already had outgrown all of her clothes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a good day for a walk, all things considered. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the clouds were fluffy and light. All of this meant that a lot of people were out there, enjoying the weather and each other's company. All throughout the streets, couples were walking hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little family of our story was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca led the \"charge\", so to speak, small hands wrapped in a sweaty embrace. Every so often, the two little lovebirds would steal glances at each other, smiling gleefully each time they saw that their partner was still very much there, very much real. Emily almost had to look twice each time - once at Rebecca's happy face and once at her swelling body, even now spilling out of some much-undersized clothes. Her small potbelly - although not so small now as it once was - flopped over her waistband, which itself was straining with the burden of hips large enough to make the little girl waddle ever so slightly, occasionally bumping into Emily as she did so - which made both little girls very happy. As well it should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind that couple walked Jennifer and Christine, the latter ensconced safely in the arms of the former. To tell the truth, Jennifer was finding it more and more difficult to carry Christine's increasing mass, but she had resolved herself to do it until she no longer could. For one thing, it would provide a real measure of the little girl's progress, and for another, Christine was just <i>so</i> pleasant to feel. Every day more and more squish made it on to her little frame, and every day Jennifer was happier and happier. Christine, on the other hand, was just happy to be safe and warm. She hated the feeding - who wouldn't - but, when her aunt was nice, she loved her to bits. As it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back, last but certainly not least, walked Nancy pushing Kiekie in a large stroller. As the proportionally heaviest member of the family, Kiekie was ill-suited to being carried, both for her own sake - too much hang - and for her potential carrier - too much weight. It was therefore much simpler that she be transported in some kind of vehicle; one, Nancy realized, that she would probably need for the rest of her life. It struck her then that Kiekie would likely never walk on her own, or even at all. The thought made her smile. Down below, Kiekie slept, and dreamed of food. It was idyllic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, idyllic within the family. To the many passers-by, it looked rather less so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, there was the simple matter that the family hadn't rightly left the confines of home in a very long time. As such, they were pale, much paler than the average city-goer had any right to be. Pale, unkempt, and unwashed, with fat bulging out of clothes at every turn, they were an odd, unwelcome sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the matter of the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, despite being the lightest, was herself clinically obese, a child that would not look at all out of place on something such as Maury. Christine, reposing in her aunt's warm arms, was less obvious, but still looked enormous even from that sheltering angle. And finally, for those unlucky few that peeked at Kiekie's carriage, all they saw was a formless blob of baby, wheezing mightily even at such a tender age - a truly horrific sight for anyone with a shred of decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of these passersby considered calling DCF. Some even took out their phones, Googled the number, and nearly pressed the button. All of them, universally, decided that \"No, somebody else would do it,\" and went on their way, the fat family fading from their minds as they went on. By evening, they were gone, a forgotten bit of the conscience of the city. Invisible despite their conspicuousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the park, things would likely be different. Especially considering the lake, and the fact that Jennifer, ever pragmatic, had packed swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a sight like <i>that</i> - how could they be forgotten then?</span></div></div>",

The Lake was one of the biggest draws of the park as it was large enough that it enticed many people to visit this part, if not out of morbid curiosity of what wonders this small town held on its own, there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as many people as Jennifer initially thought there would be at the lake. This was fabulous and strange at the same time for Jennifer as with any day in summer it was unbearably hot for the day, yet there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many people here, sure there were a few families cooling off here and there but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over crowded like it was in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWow this is great not a lot of people here so we can have some fun in the sun\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer exclaimed with a bit of enthusiasm at the situation for she still was as comfortable calling Christine her pet yet, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normal for a woman her age to be so intensely in love with a two-year-old, sure there are things like a maternal love for one another but this was like how she felt when she first met her husband and how they just clicked initially. Leading the pack to the lake was still Rebecca and Emily even though the hike to the lake has taken much out of the pear-shaped girl, her stamina was diminishing with every step, Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really realize that with her increasing size would also mean it would take more to lug around her body. Hands collapsed in one another, both blushing heavily at one another, Rebecca having a hard time with her new assets that came with being a pear-shaped girl. It did have its advantages to being so bottom heavy as her gut was dwarfed by her butt, her face and arms were not affected by her gains as much as her other parts of her body as it was like the only parts were exaggerated was from her belly down to her feet. Emily enjoyed the look of Rebecca, her long fiery red hair tied in a ponytail by her mother so it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in cover her face and beautiful faced that Emily adores, always wearing the same old brown hat that she had since she was three. Her creamy white legs feeling the nice breeze that had blown through the area, giving Emily a much-deserved look at how Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs have developed with all the food that her girlfriend had eaten in all this time, the blue dress that Rebecca wore was very good at covering her from peering eyes even if it was tighter than it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coming upon a tree that seemed like to the perfect place to have a great picnic near the lake, Nancy looking at how much of a hike the six of them had just taken with all three hefty girls at sheer individual sides she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel thankful that they were able to pick up this lovely carriage for the youngest yet fattest of the family feedee trio. Finally getting to the spot on top of the hill Nancy and Jennifer begun to get everything ready for the feast that they both had prepared for the girls to have, a nice blanket to lay upon was necessary for a beautiful picnic to commence, but knowing that all the girls would want to have some fun before they ate some swim wear was packed for the everyone so they can enjoy the lake on this hot day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw enough people in the swimming pool who ate something and after that went straight back in the water so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But swimming is some kind of exercise and exercise makes me hungry. So that way I can eat more during the picnic.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot. I don't have my bikini.\" Emily mumbled disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Jennifer said. \"I took a old Bikini from Rebecca. I think it will fit you perfectly since you're pretty thin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Emily a nice bikini. Rebecca took her bikini. <br>\r\nThere were a few small rooms were you could change. Emily and Rebecca shared one together while Jennifer shared one with christine. Nancy stayed with Kiekie on their spot. She did't really liked swimming and so much water was perhaps a bit dangerous for Kiekie. You heard so many stories of kids who drowned. People were scared of crocodiles, sharks, giant squids and other animals in the sea but the sea itself made  more victims then any of the animals did. Fine this was a lake not the sea and for as far if she knew there were't any dangerous animals in this lake. But who knew. She also heard from the monster of Loch Ness. She did't really believed in it but she knew some people truly believed in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily walked  out. Nancy got a good look at Rebecca. She chuckled. Rebecca had gotten so fat her bottom piece was't visible. Emily looked nice in Rebecca's old bikini. It was before Rebecca started gaining so it fitted Emily perfectly.<br>\r\nThe two girls ran (or in Rebecca's case waddled) into the water. Both started to swim. Nancy kept an eye at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Men this feels way better.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I noticed that walking and moving was getting a bit harder with all this extra weight. But here in the water... it's fine. I don't have any trouble with it.\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Of course not silly. It's because of the water. In the water you don't weigh as much as on land. That's why fat people like swimming so much. It's easier from them too move. And they can float on their fat.\" Emily said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Rebecca splashed a lot of water over Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it seems fat people also are soon irritated in the water.\" Emily mumbled still with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked back also with a wide grin. The two continued playing in the water.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Emily took to splashing around the lake in the area that Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Jennifer had told them where to stay put, many strangers came to this park and she wanted to keep an eye on them for their own safety, this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother the girls if they could feel the cool water on their skin and stay out of this deadly heat that has come to their town. Both girls were dressed in lovely purple colored bikinis they both belonged to Rebecca so it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so uncommon for her to have purple things in her collection of clothes as it was one of her favorite colors to wear, Emily swam around Rebecca like she was an Island to do laps around. Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind being less mobile as she once was, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that was on top of her list to worry about as there were many other things that took priority over this feeling. Looking at Emily and how happy Emily made her was a feeling that she always wanted to keep even if it meant giving up her mobility.  Floating in this lake alone with her thoughts about how her life came to this was worrisome for the young girl as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if this is what she wanted her life to become, Emily was the best thing that had come into her life even if it took a toll on her body. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Emily, I have to ask you something that has been on my mind lately\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca stated in a worried manner as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what answer she was going to get when Emily answered her thinking that if she asked this question she would accidentally make Emily hate her and their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emily stopped her swimming and just floated near her girlfriend the best she could, the brunette was concerned with what Rebecca was going to say since the plump girl had never been this serious with Emily before, it was a little disconcerting, to say the least. Emily didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to expect from Rebecca this was somewhat uncharted territories for her, to think that Emily thought that she knew all there was to Rebecca, this new part of her girlfriend excited and worried Emily at the same time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is it Rebecca is there something wrong, you can talk to me I hope you know\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily said to the concerned girl as she wandered in her own thoughts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I want to become like Christine and become a blob of my former self, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m worried that if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become that massive you will hate me for it I like being mobile and able to do stuff with you, Please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate me but I want to be able to walk and do stuff with you\u00e2\u0080\u009d with tears in her eyes the red head feared the words clung to the words that her girlfriend spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly why would I hate you for just wanting to be able to walk around with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but chuckle at this as it seemed so inconsequential for Rebecca to be worried about, she liked Rebecca for Rebecca, not because of her weight, Emily and Jennifer have two different motives when it came to loving someone and this could be expressed by the way they see their lovers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry your little head Rebecca I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going anywhere if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to gain, I will be by your side always even if you decide to be nothing but skin and bones\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily chuckled whilst kissing her girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek in a sincere manner. This made Rebecca feel so much better since she felt the same as Emily when it came to be there for her and all her endeavors that she wanted to take upon. Feeling relaxed since getting that off her chest the two begun to play a fun game of Marco Polo just enjoying each others company not even noticing the people around them or where Jennifer and Christine were off too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it was a big difference. Seeing a girl that was more or less squeezed in her bikini so fat that it covered her bottom piece, with a belly that stuck put forward. While Jennifer had a flat belly and a body that clearly showed her nice bikini. Sure she fattened up her daughters and niece but not herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go Christine. I want to show my little piglet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was used to this. Her parents often want to show her to other people. Showing what a cute and nice girl she was. She knew very well that Jennifer more focused about how fat she was but that did't matter. She was fat. She accepted that and did't denied it and tried to enjoy it. Besides she knew that it made her aunt happy if she showed of how fat she was. She also loved to be the center of attention. Since she was only child before that never had been a problem. <br>\r\nJennifer picked her up. Putting her on her arm in a sitting position pushing her belly together making her look even fatter. But she must admit That she would't be able to do this much longer. Christine was getting very heavy to carry on her arm. She never used to have this problem with Rebecca at this age. She was even able to carry Rebecca on her arm at the age of three. However Rebecca liked it more to crawl or walk then being carried. She always used to be very sportive.<br>\r\nShe went in a part of the lake that was't to deep so it was safer for Christine. She made sure she staid next to her. She knew very well a kid could drown in two inches of water.<br>\r\nEvery now and then she took a look at Rebecca and Emily. She wondered where the two were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with Christine splashing in the water. Showing her piglet to other people. She sometimes heard people telling how cute she was but she also heard some people whisper about how fat she was. And not fat in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to them Christine. Believe me you're a beautiful piglet. I'm sure some other people see it that way too. Just like Nancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine liked it how her aunt tried to comfort her. It clearly showed how much she loved her. She wanted to be loved. If that mend she need to get fat so be it. She wondered if it also worked that way with Rebeca and Emily. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The water felt cool on Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body the subtle ripples of water making her way to her chest causing the young girl to giggle as it seemed so funny to Christine that this water was lapping against her wide frame. This was pure bliss for Christine as nothing could be sweeter than to be with the woman she loved on a picnic date with many foods that will get forced down her throat, excited with this fact Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice there was a family around swimming in the lake as well. Jennifer wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying too much time looking at this family for it was something that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t concern her in the foreseeable future as they had no value to Jennifer and her plans for her and her slave here, yet she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them out of her sight so easily as being a good mistress also meant protecting her slave from unforeseen dangers that came with being a slave to a master that was about thirty years older than themselves. \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at that fat girl daddy, how can she even move\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a voice coming from where the family was planted, looking over there was a girl not even ten years old chuckling and pointing at Christine so all of her family could look and laugh at how fat Christine was getting and how unhealthy it was for a girl of her size to on the border of obese and just plain fat, this made Jennifer a little proud that Christine was gaining so much weight that she became a freak to the normal populace. Unlike Jennifer feeling prideful of what she was creating with Christine, it only made Christine feel embarrassed to be out in a pink two-piece suit with people ogling her like she was an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Embarrassed at all the people that were gawking at her Christine felt like she should just hide behind Jennifer for she knew that if anyone would protect her from the scrutiny that was placed upon her for being not your average size for a girl her age, Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know how to react to this girl who was laughing at her just because she was overweight. Christine wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the type to retaliate to whoever made fun of her, just taking the abuse from this girl who had no idea why Christine was so fat or why this woman was there playing with Christine. Jennifer tried very hard to just bite her tongue and not say anything to this ignorant girl who seemed was underfed herself which seemed to be one of the causes of her grumpy attitude towards people who were different from her own line of thinking, this silence from Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last long at all as the woman couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand by and watch her piglet be attacked for being a beautiful pound of flesh. Fed up with this girl being rude to Christine, Jennifer had decided that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to take it anymore and finally decided to speak out against the black-haired girl who deemed it necessary to crush the spirit of Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because you are unhappy with the way you look and are angry at the world for it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean everyone else has to be angry too, little girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer explained to girl who deemed it nessicary to lower Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence in what she was becoming, protecting her piglet from the onslaught of humiliation gave her a sort of rush of power, that only Jennifer could protect Christine from other people since no one else would. \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour mother should have fed you more since you seem just cranky from the lack of food in your system, unlike my dear Christine here who is very well behaved when around people she knows her place\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer spoke so highly of her little piglet that it made Christine felt proud of being with her master and she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that being humiliated about other people seeing her as just a fat freak also was pleasurable to see. The black haired girl was actually speechless at this weird family and their kind of morals that they were presenting to her in this manner, she had not seen this kind of behavior before, being proud that a girl was fat was something that was unheard of in a society like the one where they found themselves in. In a huffy the girl begun to walk away from the lake as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know what to say to this woman who deemed it acceptable that this two-year-old to be fat, Jennifer enjoyed one upping the girl in her heartless accusations of her piglet and how it was unacceptable that Christine was so large in  the first place, yet what really made Jennifer happy was how her piglet was humiliated about her body, she enjoyed seeing Christine on the verge of tears only for Jennifer to come and save her piglet from humiliation.</span></div></div>",

That's insulting.\" A girl with long blond hair said, but suddenly grinned mean. \"It's insulting for the hippo, walrus sea cow and the whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer really needed to do something. Christine understood the insults and was starting too cry. She hold her tight and looked with rage at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and you think you look good. I would say you're ugly skinny toothpicks. I bet you parents are disgusted at how thin you are. I saw mummies who were in better shape then you. If your parents would know how you turned out they probably would have thrown you in the dumpster the day you were born. You're just so mean because you don't get any love from your parents. Who can blame them. Who would love a twig with clothes on. She will become a beautiful lady while grow up staying skeletons. Ending up all alone and miserable with no one who loves you. Finally you would even hate yourself by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls were shocked someone said that too them. Wondering if it could be true. Their young minds still were still a bit gullible. The idea that it might be true was a lot for them too swallow. Two of the really started crying. The group turned around and ran away. <br>\r\nJennifer smiled and so did Christine. Her  master really showed those girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued playing with Christine who liked being in the water. Rebecca and Emily also had fun. Nancy and Kiekie both were fine on land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time Jennifer finally yelled: \"Christine, Rebecca, Emily. Let's get out. It's time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled. She must admit that the stuffing sessions did increase her appetite. Emily looked forward to stuff her. Christine looked forward to be force fed.

Yelling just enough so that Emily and Rebecca could hear her Jennifer begun to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmily Rebecca time to get out of the water, it is lunch time we have a lot to do today so get your butts out of that water\u00e2\u0080\u009d finally hearing her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words and knowing that there was a feast waiting on land for her Rebecca begun to make her way to the shore to dine on the food that was already spread out by Jennifer and Nancy for everyone. Emily was faster than the tub of lard that was Rebecca she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care that Emily was faster than her she just wanted to eat some food and look at her girlfriend, never really noticing it until now but Emily was really fit for her age not even having a little pudge on her body, being toned to the point where she just looked amazing and made the obese girl drool over watching Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s butt sway with every movement that she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making their way to the large blanket that was spread out for this occasion, Emily couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel a bit of dread when it came to going towards the blanket, as if she acknowledged that it was lunch time she would also have to acknowledge that her mother was coming to pick her up in only a few short hours, she would have to say good bye to the family that embraced her different quirks and saw nothing wrong with it. There were many items of delicious food to devour just enough for all six of them to have a delicious meal, an umbrella was placed to protect them from the sun, it was more for Christine and Kiekie than for Rebecca and Emily their bodies have been sun kissed a long time ago, giving the two girls a healthy tanned looked to their bodies. \u00e2\u0080\u009chelp your selves there is no need for etiquette just grab what you want, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a banquet to celebrate the relationship between you two girls and the growths that have been going on with you three girls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was the only notification that Rebecca needed before she started to grab the whole thing of potato salad to dig in, Emily was shocked at how much enthusiasm Rebecca was having the large bowl was between Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs as she sat Indian style on the blanket, Jennifer was pleased with her daughter who just months ago hated food to the point that she would reject the notion of divulging in so much fattening treats, with the help of Emily this had all but disappeared, committed to pleasing Emily, Rebbeca would probably become a blob if it meant that Emily loved her more, Jennifer loved this yet she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have Rebecca bigger than her own little slave looking at Christine who always was ready to eat but not willing</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer wanted both her daughters to be fat. She remembered then when she got pregnant from Rebecca she already dreamed of having an obese child. However that dream soon vanished after Rebecca started to walk. Soon after walking came playing with her sportive father and she soon became an active child that soon lost most of her baby fat and replaced it with some muscle. It made her a bit sad. But soon she found out she became pregnant again. But now from Kiekie. She planned to do it totally different with Kiekie to get the fat daughter she always wanted. She got Kiekie and soon after that her husband died. But she had been able to fatten up Kiekie. But even without her father Rebecca stayed an active kid. Until now.<br>\r\nBut for some strange reason she even did't understood herself she wanted her cousin to become fatter then her own daughters. She loved Christine in a strange way. Her little piglet need to become the fattest. And she would make sure she became the fattest. <br>\r\nRebecca was fattening up very nice with a bit op help from Emily. It was too bad Emily did't lived with them. That would maybe help fattening Rebecca up faster. But well she was still very young. She had time enough to become bigger.<br>\r\nKiekie was no problem. She was the biggest baby she had ever seen. She ate everything that came in reach of her greedy mouth. You needed to be careful she did't ate the rapper or anything else the food was in. Still a bit too young to understand what was food and what was't.<br>\r\nBut now it was time to feed Christine. She wanted her to become the fattest and for that she needed some force. Christine saw the look in her master eyes. And knew exactly what that mend. force feeding. But at the other hand... that was what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really like potato salad. I need to keep that in mind for if we ever picnic again.\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled at her. Sure they probably will have a picnic again. Many times. But also once, when they were older, just with the two of them. She wondered how would Emily look then. And she herself? Would she probably be a blob by then? If Emily would like that she would become a blob. <br>\r\nRebecca must admit just eating whatever you wanted and how much if you wanted was easier and more fun then counting calories trying to stay thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can ask me anytime for a picnic.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEmily suddenly stuck her hand in the potato salad and pushed it in Rebecca's mouth. It was so much potato salad Rebecca's cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk.Emily giggled. Rebecca swallowed the potato salad and giggled with Emily. The two were having fun While Kiekie ate everything in sight. At least everything in sight that came near enough to eat. That was a problem for Kiekie. She would most likely never walk and would never be able to go and get food herself. She would always need help from others.<br>\r\nJennifer started to force feeding Christine. Christine she knew this was what she wanted and did like always. However she must admit she was also a bit hungry she she struggled a bit less then normally. After it would all end up in her stomach one way or another.<br>\r\nJennifer looked at Rebecca and Emily seeing how the enjoyed being together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of the food being gone in Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomachs it was up to Christine to finish off the rest of it, Knowing that it was going to end up in her mouth one way or another even if she fought against her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wishes, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anywhere for her to move to avoid the barrage of food that was going to land in her mouth, Jennifer took note to firmly grasp the toddler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand with one of her hands and a large piece of pie in the other grinning maniacally at Christine as she shoved the piece into her small mouth, its gooey cherry center oozing out the sides of the flaky crust that held the whole pie together. Nancy could only look in awe as piece after piece of food begun its decent into Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth and into her stomach, she could only see as the little girl had just ingested enough food for at least two grown sized adult, Jennifer wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done yet either she knew that Christine could and will eat all the food that was left from the destruction of lunch that Rebecca and Kiekie created from their own little feasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer was so very focused on her little piglet, forcing so many delectable treats into Christine own greedy mouth, Christine tried to get away from her overbearing master making a game out of how much she could get away with not eating the food that was given to her. Nancy was looking at the beautiful scenery that was all around them, it was peaceful area to be in with the kids playing in the surrounding area and a lake in the middle, the serene setting was about to be interrupted it would seem as a girl and her two parents seemed to be coming over to their blanket with such enthusiasm it was almost abysmal of how fast these people were coming towards them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJennifer, we have company, Nancy stated to her friend who was too busy feeding her piglet to even notice that their personal area was going to be invaded by these three people who seemed to be fuming at something that Jennifer did, The mother was the first to open her mouth to their group, the woman was slender almost skeletal it seemed like she was just a skeleton wearing a skin suit her permed hair all neat and proper in a nice bun, face was twisted into a massive scowl at how her daughter was talking down to for being so thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman could see why this family believed this as three pigs were laying right in front of her. Looking at Jennifer with such hatred in her eyes the woman did everything to make sure she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attack this woman for practically telling her precious princess that she was wrong to be so thin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me miss but did you berate my daughter by saying that there was actually something wrong with her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman asked her voice like sharp daggers digging into Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. Shaking off what this woman was trying to say in regards to what comment Jennifer towards her daughter, not wanting to take these comments anymore Jennifer stopped feeding Christine to have what she hoped would be a civil conversation between the two women. Looking on the family Jennifer noticed the father who wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing much as to attack them in the manner his wife was, being more aloof about the whole situation it was quite clear that the husband had no stake in this argument. \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy yes I did as you have not taken good care of your daughter in terms of her care and proper training to be more ladylike\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated with such a forked tongue that the woman was almost taken aback by what this woman was actually insinuating, She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how this woman could ever think that her raising of her daughter was somewhat inconsequential to her own daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the woman could see was three piglets ready for the slaughter and yet this woman believed that she was doing a better job raising her children than she was, this infuriated her more than anything, fuming from every opening on her head all the woman dared to do was loudly exclaim to her daughter \u00e2\u0080\u009cKelsey lets go, this woman doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what class is, there is nothing that we can teach this family about the finer things in life since they are all just a bunch of street rats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer knew that she won the debate, for now, not knowing if the woman and her unruly daughter will be back for more, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to argue with the woman anymore, she was a lousy parent just by letting her own daughter being such a spoiled girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat girl really needs to be trained more, she needs to be more obedient like our little piglets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer said in a passing hoping to get back to feeding Christine the rest of the meal that was laid out for her while the other two rested from eating. Finally seeing that they were gone from sight and nowhere near the blanket, Jennifer begun to return to feeding her precious piglet again, seeing all the food that was still left for Christine to devour made Jenifer jump with joy. Scooping up some of the tart, gooey cherry pie once more Jennifer begun to shove it in Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth seeing her stomach that was once covered in rolls become tighter and tighter in a more orb-like appearance. </span></div></div>",

Nancy did the same with Kiekie but it seemed like Kiekie was't done eating. She looked with little pig eyes at the food what was fed to her cousin. <br>\r\nRebecca laid on her back enjoying the touch of Emily's hands on her stuffed belly. It felt so good in a way she was too young too understand. She was a bit disappointed it suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are your stopping?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There coming back.\" Emily said a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked up and saw the people from before coming back. She went sitting up with her legs spread so her belly could rest between them and leaned a bit at Emily's shoulder. <br>\r\nJennifer was so busy feeding Christine she did't noticed the people came back. Until they spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really disgust me.\" The woman said. \"Just look at those kids. That kid over there is so fat she can barely move. And that one is almost spherical. And that one over there... I bet her butt is too wide for any normal chair. The only one of those kids who seems to be healthy is that one.\" She said and pointed to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disgust you? I do a good job at raising my kids. Better then you doing raising a twig with clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter is beautiful, healthy and fantastic. You know she won several little miss selections because she looks so good. She's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. I thinks she looks like a ugly toothpick. You maybe thinks she looks good but she has an ugly personality. She was insulting by beautiful little Christine. Was't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good thing. Then maybe it would come through your thick skull that she too fat, ugly and unhealthy. You should put her on a strict diet. Those other two also. They're way too fat for their age. I should call child welfare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should. Since I believe your daughter is dangerously underfed. I think she could drop down any second from not enough nutrition's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at them and it was clearly the man followed his wife but did't said anything and it seemed like he did't wanna be part of it. She wondered if he really loved her or that he just did't dare to leave her. <br>\r\nThe little girl at the other hand stood next to her mother holding her hand. Her eyes shoot fire. She was clearly still furious about what Jennifer said when she insulted Christine the first time they saw her and she just insulted her again. It was so totally new for her since she was popular at school and won several little miss selections and her mother and family members and other friends of the family were proud at her. Giving her the idea she was perfect. Like she was the most important thing in the universe. She could do what she wanted. She stood above the law. She could get away with murder. She was the sun. The most important thing ever. No one ever said anything bad about her. Until now.<br>\r\nJennifer and the woman looked at each other with eyes cold as ice.    </span></div></div>",

The father didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything to do with this conversation as he just wanted to have a good vacation from his daily job, knowing how his wife usually blows things out of proportions when it came to insulting their daughter. He hated how his daughter of only three was turning out he loved her with all his heart but she was totally out of control when it came to obedience his wife always spoiled her, she was rotten because of it which made his outlook on what the future would look like bleaker than he thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChloe let your mother have her fight lets go get some parfaits\u00e2\u0080\u009d the slender man trying to pry his only child from this toxic atmosphere that his wife had created by mocking his woman and her adorable children. Ashley didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually care about this fight anymore she just wanted to be deemed right, although parfaits did sound delicious to her at this moment, her hand had left the grip of her mother to favor the grip of her father, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to treat bad behavior as much as his wife did but this was for the sake of dignity. The only one who decided to stay was the woman who still had more to debate when it came to how to raise a child, Jennifer could only look at all three girls that surrounded her, the smallest one was her own personal piglet, Christine, it was not long ago that she embraced her inner piglet and accepted that Jennifer was her master and controlled her every move. being the smallest of the three gainers was only finally entering the world of being fat she knew that she had a lot to gain to be perfect for her master and she loved that she would be crying all the way through. It was strange that the thing she loved the most was when she was completely controlled by her master, sure it made her sad it more ways than one and she always wanted to escape the grasp of Jennifer sobbing all the way through but it made them closer as a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca could only hide herself away in the arms of her girlfriend this woman was so vile that Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything to do with her she just wanted more belly rubs from Emily before she had to go back with her mother at the end of the day, sure the day was great up until this point but she wanted to have more laughs and cries with Emily wanting nothing more than to be with Emily without someone judging her choices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your name so I can give it to child services\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer threatened the woman with a certain smugness that came with someone who knew how to work the system, Jennifer was always helping out in the community which is why she was so confident that no matter how large the girls got no one could touch her as they all saw that she was the perfect mother to anyone who looked close enough to their family. The woman wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid of Jennifer she thought that she was correct in the way that Ashley was being a good mother to her three-year-old, she knew that when she looked back on all the beauty pageants that she was entered in and won she would finally know that she is a gorgeous girl, throwing her very own business in the face of Jennifer the person who defied everything she knew what was considered beautiful in the eyes of the public. \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou think you can scare me just wait until child services get a look at what you turned these beautiful girls into, I bet they were so adorable before you got your grimy hands on them and your demented thoughts\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman spouted as a final word to Jennifer before she tried to catch up to her daughter and husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer could only scoff at the strange woman and how she was wrong in how she was raising her bratty child, she wanted to show up this woman in how to properly raise a girl but that was for another time she knew that all the young ones were probably afraid of what was going to happen to them due to the threats that were just shoved in the face of Jennifer. Nancy was comforting Kiekie who really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what was going on all she knew was it made her sad, crying at the fact of what corresponded to the with to real knowledge of what really went on in those brief moments. \u00e2\u0080\u009care we being taken away from you, mommy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca asked afraid of what the answer would actually be, sure Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see eye to eye with her mother but she never wanted to hurt or harm her in a way that this woman did.

Her legs looked if they were covered in tires of fat. Her upper arms were like pillows who were busy swallowing up her fat filled underarms. Even her hands and fingers were fat. Her neck was totally gone long ago and melted her head to her chest. Her but looked like two basketballs that oozed out of her back. But Kiekie's belly hat taken most of the weight. becoming so big it was almost shapeless. On top of it Kiekie's boobs. Of course it was only fat but it was so much fat young teens would be jealous at the size of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer. Kiekie still wants more to eat. She want some of that food.\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's too bad. This food is for Christine. However I must admit that Kiekie is doing a very good job at making her mother proud. She eats and gains without any problem. I don't have to force her or have somebody to love her to fatten her up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca heard her mother but ignored her. She had way too much fun. She enjoyed this so much. She wished this could go on forever. Her mother talked about somebody she loved. She did't loved Emily. She was totally smitten at her and so was Emily. Love was way too weak to describe how the two girls felt. But both were having to much fun to tell Jennifer that.<br>\r\nJennifer only had eye for Christine who slowly got fatter with each bite. Christine still seemed to try to refuse to eat but she realized she really did enjoy it and all the food would end up in her stomach one way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Nancy they sell some food over there. If Kiekie is really still hungry you can get some food there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Eh... Rebecca, Emily can you two keep a eye on that little lard ball.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Emily mumbled. \"It's not like she can move or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily kept an eye on Kiekie but kept rubbing. <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer could only look on with love as a baby who should only weigh so much was almost the weight of a full grown adult male, it was baffling to her how far her second daughter gotten with her love of food, only looking on to the girl who had just awoken from her nap only to be hungry again. Arms like pillows and a stomach as heavy as a bowling ball it was hard not to see how cute Kiekie was becoming as she playfully reached to eat more food than what she was already given to her, drooling at all the delectable things that were only out of reach Kiekie couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control herself when it came to food and no one was going to deny her gluttony. Jennifer knew that the obese girl wanted more to eat but the rest was for her piglet, not that Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the encouragement that Kiekie was presenting to gorge on more food, but Christine who barely could be called as she was the smallest of the three needed to grow more than Kiekie needed to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry honey but this food is just for Christine, you had enough for now your going to have to wait until dinner for more food\u00e2\u0080\u009dChristine was surprised that Jennifer was taking her time with Christine who was on the verge of tears thanks to all the food that was inside her, this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually how she operated with her she usually dominated Christine into doing what Jennifer wanted her to do. Still taken aback by Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospitality that she actually stopped eating as her master had stopped forcing all kinds of foods into her gullet, she felt so full yet she knew that more was going to be forced into her, she felt like she should struggle even more to get her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undivided attention no matter how much she cried or struggled she knew that food was going to end up in her stomach. Acting only on instinct and how she was other people talking Christine tried very hard to make the sounds she heard from others, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more food, full\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine stated still on the verge of tears due to her stomach being stuffed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hearing her little piglet trying to wiggle out on finishing the rest of the cake that was laid right next to Christine, rubbing her stomach in pain of how much food she had forced into her stomach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no my dear piglet your not done yet we have much more to feed you\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Christine was worried that Jennifer was going to say that it was something that she dreaded hearing feeling like at any moment her stomach was going to burst from all the food that was already in there. Grabbing her by both arms Jennifer laid upon her little piglet, Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was only Inches away from Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face this kind of intimacy Christine wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really used to it made the little girl blush in a way that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used to, Jennifer chuckled to see her piglet was so flustered at her being so close. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy this naughty piglet hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten all she can we so if you could be a dear and allow the girls to watch Kiekie and come feed this piglet\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated to her friend with a menacing smile on her face, Jennifer couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love forcing Christine more food than anyone else, this was all to make her dream of having Christine massive a reality, it could seem to people that she was being too rough on the little girl for her own girl Jennifer knew that Christine could take all this abuse, she relished it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more food so full\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine squeak out of her mouth as Nancy brought over the rest of food that she had failed to eat, Nancy was questioning herself if she should give into Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark influence and start to shove food into Christine, Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes pleaded with Nancy for her to stop the feeding that Jennifer was pushing on her. Nancy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do about this, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuh, Jennifer I think she has had enough don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to break your toy right\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy spoke out against her friend due to this inability to know what Christine really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know how much she can take Nancy just feed her okay, this piglet needs to eat\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer told Nancy in a disappointing tone, like she was upset that her friend decided to take the side of Christine instead of her, Jennifer believed that she knew that Christine wanted nothing more than to eat until she cant eat anymore, Jennifer knew that her tiny frame was laughable just by looking at how her oldest daughter had even surpassed her in the weight department, Rebecca could be called obese looking like she is going to need two chairs for her rear. One thing that Jennifer was glad to see is that Rebecca found someone who actually liked what Jennifer was doing and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fat shame the tiny girl due to her posterior, and no one could forget the size of the youngest one, Kiekie. The girl was like an eating machine it was like she was made for this reason, she loved every kind of food and it showed as she looked more like a ball than a girl, her stomach was the biggest thing about her and that was saying something when it came to Kiekie as all of her was abnormally large for a baby. Nancy could hardly believe that all the girls were getting fat almost all on their own, it made her wonder about the future as Jennifer did have room to accommodating their growing sizes for now but from what she talks Christine is going to need so much room to grow sooner or later. Just by seeing the way Jennifer force fed Christine so many sweets that Nancy couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that the little girl hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exploded yet, sooner or later Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play thing is going to need lots of space.</span></div></div>",

She was sure that the people around her would soon hear a \"Bang!!!\" from a girl that exploded because she ate too much. Christine wanted to struggle but she was way too stuffed trying to refuse. She tried to rub her belly too make her feel better. It did't really helped much. More and more food was forced into her tiny mouth. She had no other choice then swallow it. But then suddenly it stopped. <br>\r\nChristine thanked the gods for this. But the next moment Jennifer kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job my little piglet. I knew you could do it. Now how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Christine would have been able to say anything she would probably say: \"Ready to explode\" or \"At the point of throwing up.\" But she was way too stuffed and tired to do or say anything. By the way her vocabulary was't too big anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything All right Rebecca?\" Emily asked still rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhm fantastic. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not that I don't like this but I slowly got the feeling like my hand is going to fall off. I'm rubbing for about a half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca went sitting up straight. She looked surprised at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already a half hour. I thought it was only a few minutes.\" Rebecca said. \"Guess I liked it too much too notice. Anyway I did enjoy it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I liked it too. Funny that I like fat but I'm the thinnest girl here. I mean you, and obvious your sister and cousin, well you're all fat. Compared to the three of you I'm a twig.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even a potbellied pig is a twig compared too Kiekie. She's a bottomless pit. Even with all the food inside her she still wants more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand your mother. Why does she put so much effort in fattening up her niece why she has her own little eating machine over there. I mean sure my mother loves my cousin but she loves me more. At least I believe so. Most mothers love their own children the most. They each think their child is the most beautiful kid in the entire world. Yeah right. I saw some babies and kids who surely were't that beautiful. Sure they were cute but that's all. But their parents still think that his or her kid is perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well beauty is in the eye of the beholder. We of all people should know that.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I know! But I don't get why your mother does't just focus on Kiekie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Perhaps she likes force feeding, and that's what Christine likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did't saw it but she did't seem to like it how the food was forced into her. But your cousin is't her kid right. I mean her parents,  your uncle and aunt are gonna pick her up again. I don't know it they like it if their kid is returned with the size of a hippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah did't thought about that. She just to look a lot like her mother, but with all that extra weight... people always said I look like my father. Perhaps I do but I know for sure my dad had't these thighs or this butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls burst out in laughter after those last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. We still wanna see the movie right. So let's get ready.\" Jennifer said <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Rebecca only could look at her girlfriend as she spaced out in front of her not knowing what the girl was thinking about while in her zoned out space even if Rebecca truly wanted to know where Emily's mind was at, \"You okay Emily?, you seem out of it\" Rebecca asked trying to snap the brown haired girl back to reality in the hopes that the could talk before they go to the movies. \"Oh yeah I'm fine Rebecca just trying to figure out your mother is all, do you really think Christine enjoys being your mother's piglet?\" Emily asked her girlfriend hoping that someone had the answers to her questions, Rebecca could only look at Emily with a dumbfounded look upon her face shrugging her shoulder making a little noise stating to Emily \"I don't know honey\" as she got up and brushes herself off, the crumbs from lunch littered her shirt, being a messy eater like her sister and cousin this was no surprise to Rebecca. They were getting to leave the park in hopes to make it to the movies and for some late snacking before Emily has to be picked up by her mother before dinner time, which was fine for Jennifer as she didn't think Emily's mother could comprehend her relationship with Christine or her children. Jennifer wasn't ashamed about her actions but knew that no grown woman would understand how she feels about her niece, \"Come on kids it's time to go home for a while plus this little piglet needs a new change of clothes since she got so much food on there\" Jennifer said, picking up the drowsy Christine up to head towards the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRebecca and Emily got up as well following Rebecca's mother down the same path as her towards the car the arrived in, the last person to start moving towards the car was Kiekie and Nancy they were slower than the rest due the weight of Kiekie it was somewhat hard on Nancy the Carriage helped her to carry the girl that would be called a blob, a girl under a year old shouldn\u2019t be this fat or heavy but this wasn\u2019t the case when it came to this little girl her mother had plans to keep divulging Kiekie into her own fantasies even if it meant that Kiekie will never be normal, Nancy could see it in this girl that if they would feed this girl all she wanted she could quite possibly become as big as a continent if it really came down to it. Heaving and hoeing the young girl was something that just came with her added girth, not that Kiekie knew how much of a massive burden she was being by being so large, out classing her older sister and even her mother\u2019s play thing was no small feet for someone of her age, there was no denying that this girl loved to eat and is content as long as there is something to munch on in front of her that is, finally after a grueling ten minutes of trekking over the rough terrain that was the park the two of them got to the car and were buckled up for a quick change of clothes before heading out again for the movies.Driving back to the house was quiet for the both women as all the young ones that were in the back seemed to be out like a light, \u201cit must be nap time for them, huh Jennifer\u201d Nancy chuckled as she looked in the back seats on all four girls, Nancy still couldn\u2019t believe she got to live out her dream of fattening little girls until they are nothing more than blobs. Twenty years ago she would never think this was possible especially living in America where it would be considered child abuse for feeding them so much, Jennifer had enough money to get out of any jam it thanks to her late hospital being paranoid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of his family when he was gone, Jennifer didn\u2019t even know how much she was getting until he was already buried and she was alone with his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we still go to the Movies, since they are conked out like this, I mean they already eaten so much and I\u2019m afraid Kiekie is gonna be too big for me to carry sooner than later\u201d Nancy asked her friend who was intent on driving safely home from the park about what she thinks they should do, thinking over the good points that Nancy was making about what they should do for the after noon since they still had a couple of hours Jennifer could just put them down for a nap now and get them up later so they wouldn\u2019t miss the new Disney movie that was going to play later on in the evening or they could just stay home for a massive feast of pizzas that and she could coddle her growing piglet more, kissing her and forcing more food into her already bloated from. This decision had to be made soon as all girls were still passed out in the back and they were heading home for a while just until it was closer to the time that this movie was supposed to start Jennifer could not believe ho her dreams were coming true, sure she loved her daughters with all her hearts but there was some dissonance when it came to her time being around her niece, it was like she could be her true self and express how she really was when it came down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If we suddenly would't go without a good reason that would be something like punish them for something they did't do. That would be wrong. And to be honest I do like most of those disney movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nancy asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I admit some of those older movies like Snowwhite, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty were really movies for kids. A bit childish for adults. But some newer ones like The jungle book were pretty good. I also loved The lion king! Also finding Nemo was fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I saw those ones too. I must admit they were pretty good. So we go to the movie anyway. But what until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're asleep. I would say put them in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy moaned a bit. Kiekie was getting incredibly heavey. Even now Rebecca put on some pounds Kiekie easily outweighed her. Nancy knew it would'take long before Kiekie would be too heavy for her. But she got up anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer first put Christine in bed and after that Rebecca. Nancy had a hard job putting Kiekie in bed and got Emily after that. All four were so deep in slepp they did't even woke up. They just kept sleeping. <br>\r\nWhile the kids were sleeping Nancy and Jennifer were drinking tea in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Jennifer we have to do something. I really do love fattening the three of them but really. My arms fee like they falling of after carrying the blob daughter of you inside. I barely can pick her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose she could stay home, with you of course. She does't really realize that we were going to the movie. Besides she does't even care. Besides some scenes might be a bit scary for her. As long if you give her enough food she does't care about anything else.\"<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\"Well that solves that problem for now at least. However I was listening to Rebecca and Emily when we were in the park. They said some things. I know you love Christine no doubt about that but... she is't you child. Your brother and his wife are gonna pick her up once. The would't mind a weight gain of a few pound But Christine is Obvious more then a few pounds. Would't they well be very angry at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we'll find out sooner or later. However we have gone too far now to go back now. Anything else you wanna complain about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, yes. I think you were pretty rough with feeding Christine in the park. I know you and see like force feeding. But it seemed like this went a bit... far. I mean if she throws up she does't gain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she could handle it.

Being sleepy was another thing entirely as it was almost impossible for the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to keep their eyes open for very long, this had seemed to be a counter to being full up on so much food that they could barely move, one was not sleeping well though, this was Emily as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat as much as the others she could only lie awake with questions that were swirling in her head that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away she just needed to know why the relationship between Jennifer and Christine, is Emily being a good girlfriend by feeding Rebecca the way she is or should she be more forceful with her like how Jennifer is when it comes to Christine, Emily didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was the right choice when it came down to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not feeling like going to sleep as there was just too much that was going on in her mind to make her fall asleep at this moment thinking it would help if she got some milk or some orange juice Emily began to slowly get up making sure that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake any of the other girls that were laid in the same bed as her and Rebecca. Rising from the bed and making sure no one was awoken from their slumber was one of the hardest things that Emily would have to do today as it took all her concentration not to shift the bed in the slightest, finally she was on her way out the door and thought about going downstairs to greet the two women that have made this weekend so magical and ask questions that only Jennifer could answer as they burned into her brain of if she was doing right by Rebecca. Tiptoeing towards the stairs Emily finally made her descent into the kitchen and in the presence of the women who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice her as they chatted about things like the weather and more detailed things about how they thought Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother and sister in law were doing in Africa and how they thought about how big Kiekie was getting as well. Finally they had noticed the young girl just looking at them almost like she was frozen in fear, trying to ask them something had made Emily just seize up right in front of them as they just chatted along about the things that had concerned them both, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you be taking a nap miss Emily, I could have sworn you went to bed with Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated confused at why this girl was not asleep like the rest of them, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her sleep if she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to but she could see the curious face that was plastered upon her face like Emily had something on her mind that she just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing a good job with Rebecca?\u00e2\u0080\u009d finally it came out like a bullet out of a gun the question that Emily needed answers too just blurted itself out of her mouth it sounded like she was drinking as it was quick and slurred together into something that was somewhat coherent for someone to understand. Taken aback by this question Jennifer could only pick up the young girl and place her in a chair to ask her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear Emily why do you feel like your not being a good friend and girlfriend to my daughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Inquisitive to why this young girl would feel this way she could only wait for some kind of response from Emily who was trying to cultivate her thoughts in something that would be able to be understood by Jennifer, she had all these feeling built up inside of her and she would like for Jennifer who is like Emily in how they believe that fat is beautiful to analyze her for she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what she meant herself all she knew is that she needed answers to not only her own relationship but how and why is Jennifer with a relationship with a girl who is three times younger than her it almost seemed strange to Emily and this is something that made Emily curious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you love Christine like I love Rebecca?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily asked just so inquisitive about the whole situation \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you love her the same way I love Rebecca or is it different, I see that you for her to gain but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Christine wants to get fat, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your afraid she will get hurt\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but blurt out these questions. Jennifer was just taken aback by how upfront Emily was with all these questions that she had swirling in her head and that she demanded answers for, knowing Emily will only want the truth Jennifer was going to give it to her and see how she will react, knowing this Is a risky move Jennifer knew she had to give it a shot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That are a lot of questions.\" Jennifer said calmly. \"But fine I will answer them. Well there are different kinds of love. You see your parents love each other. But I'm sure both love you as well. I loved the father of Rebecca and Kiekie. Sure he died short after Kiekie was born. I miss him every single day and I still love him. But he's dead and I have a few other life's that depend of me. I also love Rebecca and Kiekie of course. They're my babies. They're my children. If you carry those children in you womb for nine months and when they come out and you see they're part of you and part your husband you get such a feeling inside of you. Deep in you hart. Then he or she is from you. Someone you need to take care of. Someone who depends on you. You can't really describe the feeling. That's something what you have to experience yourself. Who knows... it might happen once. What I feel for Christine... It's not the same as you and Rebecca. You two are in love. I can clearly see that. A bit like how your parents are in love. Or like me and Rebecca's father, and many other parents. As for me and Christine it's something different. It's something between love for your kids and for your partner. I know Christine and I never will be something like you and Rebecca since she's a toddler and I'm an adult but I really love her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at her and tried to understand what she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I both know that a fat girl looks way better then a thin girl and I want Christine to gain so she will become beautiful. Just like you want Rebecca to gain. I know for sure Christine likes to get force fed. I've been feeding her for some time and I know that. I do what's best for her. Later she will thank me for this. I must admit that today I might have been a bit rough in feeding her. Nancy already told me that and I realized that I need to become a bit softer in force feeding her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that makes sense. But am I doing a good job with Rebecca?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would't you do a good job?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't force her like you do with Christine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Emily, Emily. When I was younger I had a friend. We often watched T.V. But he liked action movies. Movies I did't really liked. While I on the other hand liked romantic movies. Movies he did't really liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We watched comdy's and horror movies. We both liked those. But that's not the point. What I meant to say is everyone likes different things. Just like I liked romantic movies my friend did't liked them just like I did't liked his action movies. Christine likes it to be force fed but just because she likes does't want to say Rebecca likes it too. But the way I see it Rebecca loves the way how you feed her now. You like it too. Don't change it. Keep doing what you're doing now. If Rebecca really wants to do it different she will tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good I'm happy to hear that. I...    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nancy was just looking at Emily mouth agape at what questions were coming from her, not really having an answer for Emily, Nancy made excuse after excuse of what she was trying to explain the answer was actually looking for. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmily I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to sugar coat anything for you but this is just something that you and you alone can figure out since this only pertains to you and what you want to do. Jennifer or I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the decision for you, you can either do what feels natural to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stated the confounded woman on what this girl was really trying to get at when it came to her questions of love and if she was actually doing the right thing when it came to her sleeping beauty, Rebecca. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow enough questions, time for you to go back to sleep so that you will be refreshed for the movie\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jessica helping the young girl back to the room where all three of the other girls gently slept in the room where they were all placed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emily started to shuffle away to rest some more before their trip.

It's no problem all you need to do is... ask. You understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really I'm afraid.  What do mean with more?

I like being with you, the fattening, the feeding. But I like the way it is now. I don't like being forced. The way we do it now is perfect. But if you want to feed me a bit rough... sure. We could do that to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's just that the way of love between the two of us is so different then between your aunt and her niece. I don't want to lose you.

Christine still dressed in her pink dress that was stretchy for her growing body which seemed to not be designated to one area of growth like how Rebecca was more of a pear shape and Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was the largest part of her body, sure Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was the biggest part of her but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all-encompassing like it was for Kiekie her body kept a good balance for the rest of her body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They couldn\u2019t wait to see this new Disney movie, yet Emily was a little more unenthusiastic about the whole thing as she knew that after tonight that she wouldn\u2019t be able to be around Rebecca all the time anymore as he mother was coming to pick her up after the movie, this fact was confirmed by Jennifer who had talked with Emily\u2019s mother all while they were all getting ready for the show. Nancy and Kiekie though stayed back due to just how cumbersome the little Glutton had become on her own to be moved, she was slowing down when it came to weight but the weight she had upon her tiny frame just looking at her she had to be at least one hundred and fifty pounds of pure flub, Jennifer couldn\u2019t be more proud of her eating machine but she wanted this alone time with her favorite piglet to be more special, it was always back and forth when it came to making Christine eat, it was tiring to do yet Jennifer could see how the little girl like it as it was like a game for Christine. All of them started to pile in the car, the girls were excited for the movie as it has been a while since a fairy tale movie had hit theaters it has been mostly superheroes lately when it came to Disney, this was a nice change of pace for Disney. Away they went to the movies Rebecca and Emily looked at Christine more and more from the back seat, being perplexed by the collar that Christine was wearing around her neck it was strange to the girls to see that a human was wearing a collar they just couldn\u2019t get it out of their heads. \u201cWhat is it\u201d Christine piqued up getting annoyed by the two girls who seemed so intent to stare at her than to just talk to her about the abnormality they saw at the pink collar that hung from her neck dog tags not yet attached to it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEmily or Rebecca didn\u2019t know how to respond to seeing this thing, they had to say something about it they thought it was just so peculiar to see Christine wearing it, it seemed as if Christine didn\u2019t mind it or revealed in the thing that was hanging off of her neck. \u201cdon\u2019t you feel weird wearing that thing on yourself Christine\u201d Emily asked innocently she didn\u2019t know if the little girl actually enjoyed the feeling of a collar on her or not, she just didn\u2019t know how normal this was to have on a girl, she had never seen this kind of thing before it was just so foreign to her. \u201chey girls, stop bothering Christine about it she likes it don\u2019t you darling\u201d Jennifer said looking in the back of the car at the girls who seemed adamant on pestering her prize, there were so many questions that they wanted to be answered, but Jennifer had already given them an explanation for it. Trying to think of a way to calm this unrelenting barrage of questions that came flying out of Rebecca' s and Emily's mouth her salvation was insight the movie theater was just a turn away. Jennifer hoped that seeing that they were at the movie theater would keep Rebecca and Emily from being so nosy about the collar that was around Christine\u2019s neck. \u201cYou girls ready for this movie?\u201d Jennifer asked before stopping the car in a good looking spot, \u201cyeah\u201d all of the girls clamored to hope that for a great time for all, one thing was missing from their perfect movie date, that was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for the nearest dollar store to stock up on food all three begun to make their way to it, Rebecca and Emily hands clasped into one another, Jennifer carrying her pet all the way making sure the young girl didn\u2019t have any reason to waste any of the precious calories on this trip, Jennifer felt every supple curve on Christine\u2019s growing body made her shiver with anticipation in what Christine would become, Christine no longer mind the advances that her aunt had made upon her it was relaxing to feel a different kind of love that she was used to. Inside the dollar store Jennifer made it a point to the girls that they needed to hurry if they want to see the movie \u201cwe only have a limited time so get your food and lets get out of here so we can catch this movie and be back in time for Emily\u2019s mother to pick her up\u201d Jennifer stated, but Rebecca and Emily weren\u2019t even paying attention their small bodies where just too quick, zooming down the aisle to get as many snacks as they could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could get all the tasty treats you wanted. Rebeca decided to take full advantage of this and picked a lot of tasty treats. <br>\r\nJennifer looked smiling at what the two girls picked. Rebecca clearly started to fatten up. All thanks to that girl Emily. She wished she had knew this a few weeks ago. Then it would't have been such a struggle feeding her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also some of those.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer walked over to the girls and picked also some treats for Christine and for herself and paid the man. After that Jennifer bought their tickets. As soon if Rebecca and Emily had their ticket the ran towards the movie. Emily and Rebecca found  a spot somewhere in the middle of a row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it. They did't started yet.\" Emily whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before the movie starts we have a lot of trailers.\" Rebecca mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate trailers.\" Emily said. \"However that way you can see what new movie might be fun. That's a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they do it. That way a lot of people go to the new movie. Well I really wanna watch that movie... but until they start we... could do... what  other lovers... do.\" Rebecca smiled and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled and leaned over to Rebecca. Their lips found each other and slowly they kissed. They kissed and cuddled a bit and Emily fed Rebecca some treats then the lights went out.<br>\r\nRebecca had been right. There were some trailers. Emily looked with one eye at the trailers and with the other at Rebecca while she fed her. But even when the movie started Emily kept feeding Rebecca who happily ate everything Emily fed her. Rebecca enjoyed the treats and was so occupied by the movie she did't notice how much she ate. She just ate everything Emily pushed in her greedy mouth. <br>\r\nRebecca opened her mouth but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Emily. Food?\" Rebecca whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no more food. You ate all the food you ordered and also most of my food!\" Emily whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh I'm so sorry.\" Rebecca whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem I liked doing it. I did it willingly. But would you like it if I rubbed your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca suddenly noticed how full her belly was. She smiled at Emily and lifted her shirt. Emily put a hand on her belly and started to rub. Both girls liked this too. They both enjoyed this while watching the movie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how Nancy is doing with her little slave she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how Nancy felt when it came to taking care of her little eating machine, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the relationship that Jennifer had built with her little slave, it must be more sensual than Christine and her had since unlike Christine Kiekie loved food and getting fatter as long as there was food around Kiekie was happy there was no need to mold her into the perfect piglet as she was already there. Jennifer was more focused on what the two little lovers were up to than what she piglet was doing, she would focus on Christine in a bit but she just wanted to see her daughter be treated right by Emily, Jennifer was always protective of her daughters so knowing that this love would last is something as a mother she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were the occasional looks from other patrons there was no mistaking that they were looking at them yet no one said anything, Jennifer was curious as to why but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother her that much, still she focused on her daughter and Emily it was very hard not too as for a young age the two of them became more and more handsy with each other not even noticing that the film had just started a while back they, hugging and kissing each other Rebecca and Emily really enjoyed the others company. Jennifer really hoped that this would last even when her daughter becomes too fat to move, Emily began to lift up the dress that kept Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flub contained to get a good look at her body, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou really are shaping up to be such a cute pear, Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily stated smiling at her girlfriend, Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pale white skin accentuating her natural beauty that was hidden by her red hair. Emily only had eyes for the Rebecca not even caring at the moment about the movie that was being shown in the background examine the body of her lover was one of the most anticipating things that Emily wanted to do all night just to see how much Rebecca had grown. Her stomach and butt seemed to be the most affected by the added calories to her frame the blue panties that was only bought a few months back for her now were stretched into what could only be describe to as a thong like design it seeing this only made Emily giddier, placing her hand on her Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low hanging stomach there could be felt some pushback from the giant meal of snacks that she had just devoured but there was still a plush almost velvet feeling to the elasticity of Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It felt good to have Emily play with her fat it was becoming hard for her her to breath with all the food stuffed inside her gut so the relief that Rebecca felt as Emily massaged her growing gut was pure bliss every delicious rub that came from Emily sent shivers of pleasure down her spine \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmily never stop being my feeder I want to be yours and yours only\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca stated enthralled by the belly rubs that she was receiving from Emily, hearing this made Emily the happiest girl in the world she just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do with her self, rubbing the large stomach that hung off of Rebecca and being close to her growing girl was all that she needed for now, she knew that she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to see her for a while as her mother was coming to get her after the movie and this was going to be hard not seeing Rebecca for a while, loving every inch of the little pear was all she wanted right now. Jennifer could see that it would all work out alright for her daughter there was a good head on Emily's shoulders, encouraging Rebecca to eat wasn't something to be taken so lightly it was no wonder why she was no becoming the second fattest girl in her little concubine of toddlers that surrounded Jennifer and Nancy. Breaking out of the trance that was created by seeing the pure love that emily had shown, Jennifer knew that christine was more than likely jelous that her master wasn't paying attention to her at all, wanting to remedy this in her little piglet Jennifer decided to ......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

What do you think?\" Jennifer asked Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did't answer but thought Jennifer was very right about that. Christine always liked it to see a movie. Sure she did't understood all of it but moving figures with sound and songs were fun. At least fun enough for Christine to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you think so too don't you. Well I'm just happy Rebecca is fattening up nicely. You know I never told this too anyone but after her father died I just\u2026 did't wanted to see her. Rebecca looked so much like her father. I saw him in her face and hair. Luckily enough my mother came to help me out for some time. Well enough about that. Guess you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine rolled with her eyes. Of course she was hungry. Her body got used to being stuffed all the time. That also made Christine a bit more willingly to eat. But sure she liked it to being force fed. But she could't understand why she liked that. However Jennifer would force food in her if she ate it willingly or not so it did't matter to her. <br>\r\nJennifer started to feed Christine popcorn. Christine was't complaining since she was watching the movie not really caring about what was stuffed in her mouth. After all most of it was sweet and Christine loved sweets like most little kids. She just focused all her attention to the movie not really noticing how much food Jennifer forced in her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily barely saw heard or noticed were the film was about but both liked this way more. This was heaven for them. Only think that could make this better was more food and perhaps some fizzy drinks. <br>\r\nOnly one thing was clear for both\u2026 they loved each other. Nothing else mattered to them. They both loved the touch of the other not really caring anyone could see them. However most other people left the two alone and focused on the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer took a look every now and then to be sure everything was all right between Emily and Rebecca but the seemed to be in heaven. It seemed to her to a bit of a waste buying a ticket since they might as well doing this at home and having just as much fun.<br>\r\nThinking about home she wondered how Nancy and Kiekie were doing. All right most likely. Kiekie was fine as long if she was eating or fed. Did't matter to her as long if the food was in her stomach. But being almost a immobile ball of lard it was hard for her to feed herself. It was even hard for Kiekie to even lift her arms and she had trouble bending them. Not that she cared as long if she got fed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Auw! What the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked down and saw Christine had bitten in her hand. She wondered if she did it on purpose or by accident. Well she did't bite through and it did't hurt that much. So she just kept stuffing Christine. Christine still did't really noticed how much she was fed since she had her attention more by the movie. <br>\r\nWhat was fun about Disney movies they had a lot of catchy songs that were fun for kids as wel as teens and adults. After Rebecca turned three her father put several song of Disney movie on tapes for Rebecca and she listened the over and over. It seemed to distract Christine from how much she had eaten. But her swollen belly told clearly how much she had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was a bit worried. Mostly Christine made a fuss if you fed her this much but now she stayed calm. It bothered her a bit. She started to think. How could she get the normal effect from her piglet. She suddenly got an idea. She knew she promised Emily she would't feed Christine so much like in the park. But...<br>\r\nShe took a look at the two lovers. They were both way to occupied with each other to notice anything else except each other. <br>\r\nShe smiled evilly. Time to feed Christine to the max and beyond.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jennifer was so troubled with what people might say if Emily is disappointed that Christine is being force fed again but that was a bridge she might have to cross if she gets caught, Christine was being such a good eater now but that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough as she lagged behind her two daughters and it seemed like the gap grew bigger and bigger as time went on, Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pear shape seemed to just grow with every feeding this was because of the help she got from Emily but her slow metabolism help too, she wondered why Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gain as fast surely her metabolism had slowed too, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Intently watching the movie Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even realize how much food she had already eaten, when it came to any movie that was made by Disney she loved with a passion. Peering at the screen was the only thing that Christine wanted to do at the moment it was all that was on her mind, Jennifer had other things on her mind looking over the fat girl made her urges grow insider her, the pale white skin so supple and beautiful made Jennifer twinge with lust, Christine's blond hair always drove her wild she wanted nothing more that to be with her niece for the rest of her life making her the fattest girl in the world. Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care others were around her or that her desires would win over the dignity she though she needed, with a large box of m and m\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in hand, pouring some into her hand Jennifer shoved them in the open maw of Christine without any warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shocked by the food entering her mouth without her even noticing Christine felt as if she was going to choke, the small candies rushing down into her gullet was a surprise to say the least it was so abrupt that Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to think of it, looking over to her master all Christine saw was a big grin on Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face a grin that seemed pleasant for Christine to see, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry piglet, just watch the movie and I will just feed you all of the food I have\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer said still grinning at her little girlfriend with a desire to feed her. Chocolate, candy gummies, and various chips were all snuck in for Christine to eat, enough food for a girl like her to indulge her self in and Jennifer wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to stop until there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a scrap left for Christine to eat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m already so full, please no more right now master\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine pleaded with Jennifer her eyes not being taken off of the screen she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to miss any of the movie, Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heed the wishes of Christine not even taking them into account she was in control not the other way around this was something that she had to make sure that Christine understood that she was her master, Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play thing to fatten and to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dumping out the rest of the M&amp;M\u00e2\u0080\u0099s into her palm Jennifer shoved the rest into Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth \u00e2\u0080\u009cshh, remember your mine and only mine little piglet\u00e2\u0080\u009d she made it perfectly clear to Christine that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any choice on how much she gets to eat, still how forceful she was and how demanding made Christine kind of enjoying it, she wanted to fight these feelings but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it was normal to fight it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo master I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not hungry you cant make me eat anymore\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine rebelled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take that as a challenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer smirked wondering what brought on this rebellion, It was a good thing that Rebecca and Emily were to into each other to see what they were doing it was a break for Jennifer she had more food in her bag that will be shoved into her pet, Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why she felt great about disobeying her master only to be told that she was nothing more than a food receptacle to be played and kissed, she wanted nothing more than to kiss her master passionately after being fed, fit to burst. </span></div></div>",

They only had eye for each other. Kissing and cuddling and rubbing was what the two girls did. And both loved every second of it. They did't had a clue what was happening with Christine. Besides they did't though anything might be wrong. After all Jennifer promised she would't stuff Christine so much like in the park. <br>\r\nHowever now she did it again.<br>\r\nBut for the two girls this was moment without any worries.<br>\r\nBut that was totally different for Christine.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nChristine was rubbing her belly that was stuffed, swollen, tight and hard like a rock. She tried rubbing it to make her feel better. It did'help a bit.<br>\r\nBut suddenly it stopped. Christine looked surprised at Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all gone a sweetie you have eaten i all.  All the food is in that pretty sweet paunch of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine thought she would explode or throw up. One of the two. At this point she did't really care. Her belly was so full. She continued watching the movie hoping it would help her digest the food faster.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her master had always been so rough with her so it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this was new when it came to their relationship but sometimes when this happened Christine always feels like she is going to pop from all the food that has been forced down her gullet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFull\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all that Christine could muster to say as a light burp escaped her mouth as a feeble attempt from her body to try to rid itself of all the food that the little girl had just inhaled, Jennifer was quite proud of her self with how much food she had deposited into Christine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know your full baby but it was worth it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it soon your be the biggest girl in the world, but we need to feed your before that .happens\u00e2\u0080\u009d she grinned hoping that Christine would understand that this was all for her.

People began to look at the strange family that was behind them not a lot of people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to take this weird family, a woman is obsessed with this little girl was the strangest thing about it not knowing what to do people just thought it would go away if they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even acknowledge their presence. Jennifer could feel the presence of eyes looking upon them, there were going to look Jennifer already knew this but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it any less irritating to her to feel the sense of what she thought was a beautiful loving relationship being demonized by people who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why she thought this way in the first place, or the even the people who refused to acknowledge that she really did care for Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emily and Rebecca were too into each other to really notice the looks they were looking at them, not that they would care who was peering at them in the first place they loved each other ant that was the only thing that really mattered to the both of them not what some stranger thought of their relationship, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so full but it was all so good\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca said still loving the touch of Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands on her stomach, Emily was too engrossed with how much Rebecca filled out of the chair she was sitting in to pay attention to anything else, a chair that was suppose to fit a grown adult comfortably with their posterior was being filled with a girl who was only five years old with was abysmal to think of when Emily really thought about it. Rebecca looked over to Christine and her mother to see them cuddling together while the movie played, it was almost sweet to see them, in a lovey dovey way, sweet to say the least that her mother actually opened up for this girl it was sad that Christine was going to lose her mobility the longer the relationship flourished though and she was being treated like a pet more than a girlfriend for Jennifer but this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that Rebecca would know how to stop even if she could, as the movie played Rebecca could only keep her eyes and love for Emily.</span></div></div>",

However both had enjoyed it but that was not because of the movie. <br>\r\nSlowly people started standing up to leave. Rebecca and Emily too. Emily looked with eyes full of love at Rebeca's wobbling butt while she squeezed herself through the narrow space between two rows of chairs. This was the girl she wanted. <br>\r\nIt was strange in one way. She never thought that she would fall in love with a girl. She always though she would fall in love with a boy, get a house get kids, have a pet. The normal stuff. But now she could't think of a life without Rebecca. She wanted her so bad. A relation with her. A family with her. True she still was't sure about the way how they needed to get kids but there were ways. There were more gay and lesbian couples that had kids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well and\u2026 did you enjoy the movie?\" Jennifer asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... well... it was nice\u2026 and\u2026 eh...\"  Rebecca mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Be honest you both did't see the movie. You were too busy with each other. Well no problem. More couples who are in love kiss and cuddle in the cinema.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with Christine. I looks almost like she's inflated. Like a balloon.\" Emily said and looked suspicious at Jennifer. Jennifer promised she would't stuff Christine as much like she did in the park. Would she lie? \"Her belly is swollen and hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry she's fine. She enjoyed the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did enjoyed the movie and saw more of the movie then Emily or Rebecca. The four of the walked out and were greeted by a:  honk! sound from Emily's mother who was waiting in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's my ride. Guess I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious both girls did't liked this. They hugged each other tight. Emily sinking a bit in Rebecca's fat. The kissed a few times and after that Emily walked over to her mother leaving a sad Rebecca. At the same time Emily was also really sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweet hart. How was the movie.\" Emily's mother asked when she got in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... eh... It was nice. Very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm-hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's mother knew her daughter very well. She knew also exactly when her daughter lied. This was one of those times.

Many people were stepping out of the movie theater trying to get home as they had no reason to stay here, as people begun to move past Jennifer and the girls some started making glares at them. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprising to Jennifer that people would be confused about what they were looking at as Rebecca and Christine were the most normal looking children around, Rebecca with her dress that had a hard time covering her butt from the drafts of the wind to to how many pounds her hips had gained from the constant feedings from Emily and Christine who at this moment looked more like an inflatable balloon than a child of two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her stomach had so much food inside that Christine was afraid that she might just puke all over Jennifer and ruin the night, Panting heavily to exert some of the pressure her master had put on her body on their night out, thank goodness that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to walk as that would cause problems that Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to think about at the moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome on girls its time to go home and get you all ready for bed, it has been a long day for you two\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer pointed out, dawdling to the car as Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tiny body couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep up with her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long legs it was difficult for her.

Tears began to roll down the face of Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tender hear was hurt by the mean comments that were made toward her \u00e2\u0080\u009cis she right am I disgusting mommy\u00e2\u0080\u009d blubbered Rebecca not knowing how to take these comments she just sat down on the ground and cried, Christine was passing out due to the food-induced coma she was placed in by Jennifer, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even hear all the rude comments that were being made by this woman about her all she knew was that she was too tired to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRebecca be a good girl and look after my piglet\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer said with a seething anger to her voice Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what her mother was about to do but the thing that she did know is that her mother no matter how twisted her views were she always protected Rebecca from anyone and every one who sought to make her feel bad about anything. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me ladies what were you saying about my girls\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer shouted at the frail old ladies in an angry tone, they knew that the woman in front of her meant business, what business that was was foreign to them but the knew something was going to happen.</span></div></div>",

Sad about what the ladies said and at the same time happy how her mother react. It also made her thinking about her and Emily.

The table was full with empty jars cans boxes and bags.<br>\r\nRebecca took a good look at her sister. Kiekie changed in a shapeless blob in the past weeks. Her legs and arms had gotten too fat to move. She could just wiggle her sausage fingers and her ball like toes a bit. And of course her jaws. She looked like a bean bag chair with a small head with baggy cheeks and two hand and two feet sticking out. She was a mountain of flesh and fat. She wondered what the two ladies would say about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has eaten everything!

She's really a bottomless pit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had no trouble believing that. She knew Kiekie's appetite and assuming to Kiekie moving jaws she still wanted more food.

Circling the bloated baby, Rebecca begun to examine every inch of her overinflated sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body with a questioning look she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if this was healthy to begin with, her sister looked like a ball not like a baby any more, bloated and fat it was hard to see her sister as she once was she used to be chubby sure but nothing like this she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if her sister even enjoyed her new predicament. Trying hard Kiekie flapped her arms up and down in excitement for seeing her sister again, Rebecca, on the other hand was just astounded how much her little sister had eaten on her own, the blob that she was looking at seemed to be a dream, was this the future her mother was trying to accomplish, Rebecca couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell if her sister was just bloated or actually accumulated this much fat is such a short time, Christine, on the other hand, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care much for what was happening around her all she wanted to do was sleep off the meal that was shoved into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew she was a piggy but this is kind of sudden I mean can she even crawl like this Nancy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer asked questioning how much food did her daughter really eat it was abysmal how big she got in just a couple hours that they were gone it just shocked Jennifer how held the hefty sleeping Christine in her arms cuddling her little piglet, the jingle of Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collar sounded with every movement of Jennifer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell yeah she is just really bloated now but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she will be deemed the fastest baby in a while she just eats and eats, too bad the others aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this one, huh Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy grinned at the progress she had made with Kiekie, who just laid there unaware what was really being said about her. Blissfully unaware about her surroundings Kiekie decided to drift off into a deep sleep, with no more food to devour there was no reason to keep awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a bit disappointed that Emily was't lying next to her. She already missed her.<br>\r\nShe sighed and started to get dressed. She noticed her pants were very tight. When she finally got them around her big butt and thunder thighs she found a new problem. She was't able to close the button. This was a very new problem for the junior gainer. Before Jennifer started force feeding her and her sister and cousin she always used to be slender. Perhaps even a bit muscled. She walked over to her desk and took a rubber band and used that to close her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to ask mom to go clothes shopping with me. Guess she would like that since she always wanted me to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason she was willing to gain weight was pure and alone for Emily. But she knew that her mother also liked it that she got fat so her mother did't force her anymore and focused on Christine. <br>\r\nSuddenly she remembered Kiekie. Her sister was becoming a immobile blob. That girl did't seem to have a bottom in her stomach but a black hole. She wondered how she was doing.<br>\r\nSlowly she walked with socks on over the Kiekie's bedroom. She heard some noises and saw mom and Nancy were already in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then she is mobile.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely. Come on you can't call that mobile! Just look at her. It's not only her weight and weak muscles. She also puts zero effort in it. She's just too lazy. I'm your friend Jennifer but this daughter of you is just a morbidly obese, greedy, lazy pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going  on?\" Rebecca asked while she walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Kiekie. Kiekie was put on hands and knees but if she would crawl her belly would drag over the floor. She was so fat that the fat of her belly was pushed to the left, the right and between her legs. She was't crawling but it seemed Kiekie was already having enough trouble staying in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she does't want to crawl or at least not enough to put effort in it?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that too, but look even if she would crawl it would be very, very slow. With her belly dragging over the floor and all. That will slow her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she could crawl very fast. If it was about F-O-O-D or D-I-N-N-E-R. When she heard those two words she could crawl very fast. Well perhaps not really fast but fast for Kiekie's standards.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember that.\" Jennifer said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kiekie decided it was enough and let arms fall down  one left and the other right  pushing her fat further side ways. She seemed to enjoy using her fat as a mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she is't mobile and she getting too heavy for me too carry. So what do we do?\" Nancy asked.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a large sigh Nancy looked upon the almost immobile girl, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny the fact that Kiekie was an adorable piggy but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to carry someone as heavy as she was this was something that Nancy needed to know. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about anything Nancy we will have to carry her together until we can get the cart ready for her, we will bring her downstairs to her playpen and that is where she will stay until we can get everything set up for her to be more mobile\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer grinned looking at Kiekie as something to aspire to be for all little girls. Unlocking the sides of the crib was the easy part for the two women the hard part was going to getting a hold of Kiekie, Rebecca who was still in shock didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how they were going to lift Kiekie, Jennifer and Nancy encircled Kiekie who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was happening as the overfed girl still trying to crawl around her crib with almost no progress made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both begun to crouch down to grab a side of Kiekie, struggling not to drop the girl was the most important thing in this situation they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make her more uncomfortable than she already was, struggling to lift her was the first of many problems that the two women would have to take care of the next was going to be the stairs, as Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  room and Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were placed upstairs with the guest room that Nancy was using for the time being bringing such a hefty little girl downstairs was going to be trouble in its self later down the road. That was something for later not now, they just needed to get her downstairs, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRebecca, be a dear and get the door\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer struggled to say heaving her daughter was the only thing that was on her mind right now it was all her energy was going to at the moment. Rebecca could see how much the two adults were struggling to hold up Kiekie \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has gotten rather large I guess\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca thought as she reached for the door helping out her mother was the least she could do, but later she needed clothes for her massive thighs to fit it that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting to the stairs was the first accomplishment that Jennifer and Nancy had gotten through it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an easy one to accomplish anyways, walking like crabs both women slowly descended the stairs every step seemed like a monumental feat of strength Kiekie didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the way she was being manhandled by the two women not even showing any discomfort in her current predicament, it was almost like she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about anything that was happening to her, she just laughed flailing her useless limbs around in an exciting fashion that any happy child would do, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least she is having fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d chuckled Nancy hoping to lighten the current situation they had found themselves in. Finally down on the ground floor both women sighed and breath of relief at the this fact Kiekie was getting too big for them to hold anymore this had its positives and negatives in its self, it was finally the first hurdle Nancy and Jennifer had to pass to achieve their dreams of having a harem of little adorable toddlers that were to too fat to do anything but eat and grow fatter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will call someone to help out with fitting the house to be easier to transport the girls when they get too fat to move, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this would happen so soon though\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer exclaimed shocked at how big her daughter was becoming \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are going to have to give her less food and more to Christine I guess since she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grown a lot in a couple of months she has been here\u00e2\u0080\u009d both women nodded in agreement as Nancy begun her daily routine with Kiekie which always started with making breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Kiekie could eat a lot of these jars. But Jennifer wanted her gaining to slow down. Or did she really wanted to let Kiekie stop gaining? Jennifer wanted Christine to become an immobile blob but why didn't she wanted the same thing for her daughter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to stop fattening up Kiekie?\" Rebecca suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would I? Where did you get that idea from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be a young child but I have ears. My ears do more than just hanging around my face. I can also understand what people say. I heard you two. My mother was planning to give her less food and more to Christine. Why do you two want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not really what I want but what your mother want. I would like it to make Kiekie even fatter but... well we are starting to have problems moving her and all. Guess you noticed that too. I guess who have to slow down her gaining until we have some things that make it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie won't like that,\" Rebecca said. \"She's used to eating a lot of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of food? She's a bottomless pit! I bet she could eat an entire zoo and still want more. By the way, Kiekie doesn't eat. What Kiekie does is pigging out, stuffing her face and wolfing down. She eats so fast I wonder if she even tastes the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. I'm not sure if she cares.\" Rebecca mumbled and walked out of the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca went sitting on the bench. She slowly lifted her shirt to take a better look at her own growing belly. It had grown a lot lately. That was mostly thanks to Emily. She loved her so much. She knew that being too fat was unhealthy but she was willing to become immobile if that was what Emily wanted. She was so smitten at her and knew Emily was that as well. <br>\r\nSlowly she rubbed her belly and played a bit with her fat. She must admit that it did feel nice and was kind of fun. Then she saw Kiekie. Kiekie and her huge belly. Slowly she walked over To the playpen and climbed in. She had done that many times to play with Kiekie before. Slowly she stuck out her hands and pushed in Kiekie's fat. It felt warm and soft. Squishy was the right word for it. She slowly started to play with her sisters fat. Kiekie didn't seem to mind. It almost like she liked it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Subconsciously Rebecca\u2019s hand was still on Kiekie\u2019s stomach, rubbing and feeling how much her hand would sink into the flab that her sister had accumulated was really nice and plush it was so fun to run her fingers through her sisters body, every inch had its own padding nothing was saved from the onslaught of flab that Kiekie had on herself, not that the little girl really mind that her sister was giving her a massage the feeling was almost euphoric to Kiekie, every rub felt like angels were dancing on her body it was something that she couldn\u2019t pass up on. Clicking back to reality Rebecca needed to find where her mother went with Christine she had questions for her mother that only she could answer it just didn\u2019t make any sense to her why Kiekie was going to be given less food when it was her mothers intentions to make them all into blobs of their former selves so why did she want to impede that transformation from Kiekie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy herself knew of the reason for this sudden change in Jennifer\u2019s demeanor it all had to do with Kiekie\u2019s size for her reasoning was there could only be one who was the queen blob and that spot was already take by Christine and if Kiekie was going to hurt Christine\u2019s chances for this to happen the Jennifer had to slow down Kiekie\u2019s chances to be queen blob. \u201cBaby food was the only thing that was in the house right now since Kiekie\u2019s food frenzy that happened last night, I guess we have to go shopping\u201d Nancy thought looking around seeing nothing but crumbs surrounding her it was like a hurricane blew through here, it would have been a great help if Jennifer was around he help and pick up this place a little bit while she mad her blimp of a daughter some slop to eat. Rebecca was also wondering where her mother had taken Christine too and slinked off to, looking around the room Rebecca heaved her self up and exited the playpen where Kiekie was still in to go and look around for her mother and cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her mother wasn\u2019t down here than she had to be upstairs she thought, as she didn\u2019t see her and Christine go into the room that was made for Christine so the only logical that if her mother wasn\u2019t downstairs than upstairs was the best bet she had in her current situation. Waddling up the stairs was becoming more and more tiresome as the months went on and her current relationship with Emily didn\u2019t help her situation not that Rebecca really concerned herself with such trivial matter not that if she could help it, \u201cnow turn around I want to get every angle of your gorgeous body piglet\u201d a voice stated, it had to be her mother she was the only one who used the derogatory term of piglet when it came to talking about Christine she just knew that it was them she needed to know why she wasn\u2019t making Kiekie eat as much as she is so used to it didn\u2019t make any sense to her. Closer and closer she got to the voices Rebecca heard the familiar clicking of her mother\u2019s shutter she had always been a shutterbug but when it came to collecting her\u2019s, Kiekie\u2019s and Christine's growths she was relentless she didn\u2019t think that she would do it so early in the morning but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to do so. Opening the door she caught her mother doing what she always did when it came to Christine which was always take to treat her like her precious little doll who was made for Jennifer and no one else, \u201cmom, I was looking for you I have to ask you a something why are you making Kiekie eat less\u201d Rebecca proudly asked her mother wondering what Jennifer\u2019s reasons where for doing this as in her mind it really didn\u2019t make any sense for her mother to be doing this, not in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Rebecca, we can talk later about this, its about time for piglet\u2019s breakfast isn\u2019t that right Christine\u201d Jennifer cooed to her pet like an owner would to a pet Rebecca saw such look of begging servitude on Christine\u2019s face all the feeling she had of resentment, love, and admiration for Jennifer were clear to see, kneeling down and looking like a lost puppy Christine exclaimed with half-hearted enthusiasm \u201cfeed me, master\u201d sad to say Rebecca was quite taken aback by this display of affection. Seeing that her daughter was really shocked at how loyal Christine really was to Jennifer had a devious idea in her head that would really spice things up for her scrapbook, Jennifer had two kinds of sweets in her hands for breakfast she thought, in one was a three-tier chocolate cheesecake and in the other was what looked like a large bowl filled to the brim with apple crumble \u201cRebecca, I will answer why I\u2019m not feeding Kiekie as much if you force feed this piglet one of two choices I present to you, so what do you say\u201d Jennifer stated smiling at the new fun she could have with Christine.</span></div></div>",

She brought it over To Christine's mouth. Christine looked doubting at it. She was wondering why her master was't feeding her. But Rebecca never had been mean to her. Besides her master was looking from a short distance so it would all be all right. Slowly she opened her mouth and Rebecca fed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Now tell me. Why do you feed Kiekie less. I don't understand it. You want us to become blobs. Kiekie is the perfect gainer. She's a bottomless pit. But now you want her to eat less. That does't make any sense. So why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's hard moving her around. She's getting very heavy and\u2026\" Her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\" Rebecca asked. \"That's not the truth is it. Or at least not all of it. There's more, right. Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine. There are three of you. But Kiekie is just sooooooo fat. I want to give you two or at least this one a chance to catch up. Else she might fell a bit sad. Because she can become fatter even fatter then Kie\u2026\" Her voice trailed of again but Rebecca heard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just tell the truth mom?\" She asked while she kept feeding  Christine. \"You just want Christine to be the fattest. But that's not gonna work since Kiekie's the fattest. So you start giving less food to Kiekie and more to Christine so she's gonna be the fattest. So she's gonna become even fatter than Kiekie. That's the truth. is't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess you\u2026 could put it... that way.\" Jennifer mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. Why her? Fine she's your niece. She's family but you seem to care more about her then at your own children. I don't get that. I thought you would like your own children to be the fattest. Your own bloodline and all. By the way she's not gonna be here for ever. She's not your child. She's your niece. Eventually her parents are gonna pick her up. You know that. I wonder how they're gonna react if she's three times the girls she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked angry at Rebecca but must admit that she was totally right in a few things. Christine's parents were gonna pick her up eventually and they woud't be to happy with the weight gain of their daughter. She loved Christine but why did she seem to like Chistine more then her own kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides before Christine become even close to Kiekie's size\u2026 well that might take a long time.

She can't walk, talk she can't even crawl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's fault is that. But maybe you should focus on the kids you're gonna be able to fatten up in stead of the kid that's only gonna stay here for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you?\"  <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n\"Mom... if I gain\u2026 that's not for you but for Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the last of the cheese cakes went past Christine's lips.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer was mulling over why her daughter was so angry with her, not understanding why it was such a problem that she wanted Christine to become the biggest. Jennifer couldn\u2019t hide it anymore it was true what Rebecca was saying,  Kiekie was the fattest and that was a problem that she didn\u2019t foresee, it wasn\u2019t in Jennifer\u2019s master plan that the youngest was going to become the fattest. Jennifer didn\u2019t entirely overlook this situation but she didn\u2019t think it was something that would come to past, even Nancy knew what Jennifer\u2019s intention was making them all fat and immobile and it was understood that Christine the girl who was handed to Jennifer on a silver platter by her brother was going to be so massive that there wasn\u2019t any way for her to have another life than as Jennifer\u2019s pet. Jennifer had always wanted to do with Christine no matter the cost, she had the means and had the intention of doing this but she wasn\u2019t going to until she got the heads up from her brother that he and his wife were going to Africa that Jennifer thought of enacting her plan. This alone wasn\u2019t enough to warrant the change in Jennifer\u2019s soul, she knew something that Rebecca didn\u2019t, Jennifer just didn\u2019t know when she should tell the rest of the family the secret she had kept buried down in her heart. Not knowing what to do with the information she had Jennifer decided, for now, to just keep it to herself, her unruly daughter didn\u2019t understand still why Jennifer was just trying to make Christine the biggest. was it just Jennifer\u2019s own vanity that made her want to ruin the only child her brother or was it just a need to see this angelic child become nothing but a pig?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going have to tell them the news sooner or later, but I don\u2019t know how to tell them about Africa that is just between you and me Christine\u201d Jennifer whispered to her piglet coming down the stairs. Still in a daze from her previous feeding by her own cousin made whatever Jennifer said to her go in one ear and out the other. None of what Jennifer was spouting really made an impact on the little girl she just couldn\u2019t believe she ate a whole cheesecake, Christine knew her appetite had grown just as her waist had but she didn\u2019t think it was this much. In the warm embrace of her master made digesting her large breakfast easier than it would be if she would be kept to her own devices. Knowing that walking wasn\u2019t even an option for Christine while Jennifer was around, burning calories from walking was counterproductive for what her master had in mind for the little girl that was just obvious. Seeing the blob of a cousin that was Kiekie sobbing for being so hungry hurt Christine a little she didn\u2019t like to see anyone in pain especially hunger pain as that was the worst she knew this from experience she couldn\u2019t function anymore if there wasn\u2019t any food in her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is Kiekie crying is she still hungry?\u201d Christine asked her master an inquisitive child she always was not knowing what kind of question she was really asking just seeing that her blob of a cousin was so upset that she thought that she needed to help her from being so sad even though she didn\u2019t know how to help Christine knew that she needed to help. Rebecca looked on to where her mother was and the torture she was putting her sister in with so much disdain for her mother knowing that the sobbing was created by her mother. Rebecca still couldn\u2019t get out of her head what Nancy was saying before kicking them out into that living room it was just a few moments ago yet it was still ingrained into her skull. still, what did it mean? Just a few moments ago Nancy was feeding Kiekie like she always did when Rebecca came in, spoon full of mushy carrots was lifted up to Kiekie\u2019s mouth where she excitedly ate them with such gusto that it could be nothing but adorable to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat woman is impossible, why does she want our cousin to be a sea of flab but not Kiekie she just doesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d Rebecca shouted to the heavens marching through the Kitchen like she was apart of the arm of how furious her footsteps were, beating down on the hardwood floors of the farmhouse. Nancy just looked over at Rebecca who was still in a huff about the run around she was getting from her mother it was infuriating, to say the least, not able to get a straight answer from her was just the worst. Rebecca knew that her mother knew something but she wasn\u2019t spilling the beans on why she had chosen her cousin to be the prized piglet, it was true that Rebecca did feel like her and Kiekie were cast aside from being her favorite something that Rebecca didn\u2019t even want to think about too closely if she was being honest with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer doesn\u2019t love you any less than she does, you must know that Rebecca, Christine is a special case and Jennifer sees a great opportunity to get what she always wanted since\u2026.\u201d Nancy trailed off from saying realizing that she was about to say something that she wasn't supposed to tell the girls for it could cause them to become distraught. Going back to feeding Kiekie the last of the jar hoping that Rebecca didn\u2019t catch on to what she was about to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m done feeding Kiekie, I think its time you two girls play with each other you haven't had a lazy Sunday in while I can see you two need some bonding time with each other so off you two go\u201d a little frazzled with the talk she almost had with Rebecca Nancy begun to pick up the pig of a girl that was Kiekie. Heaving the girl to the living room was hard in its self, like lugging a large bag of wet cement was no easy task, to say the least, it was akin to that. Seeing no more food to fill her gullet was what made Kiekie sob in the first place and lead to the events that Christine witnessing. Seeing Jennifer coming down the stairs was a relief knowing that she almost told the secret that the both of them were keeping was bad for the both of them, she needed to talk to Jennifer in private as quickly as she could so she knew that Rebecca might ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou girls play nice now I need to talk to Nancy for a bit so behave while we are gone\u201d Jennifer placed Christine in the playpen with Kiekie hoping that they wouldn\u2019t be too worried when the adults are nowhere to be found. Slinking out of the living room didn\u2019t go entirely Rebecca saw her mother go into the kitchen, the day had just gotten more curious with the arrival of Jennifer and the secret meeting she was having with Nancy. Seeing this Rebecca decided to\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca decided that she probably would't get a real answer so she decided to go to the living room to play with her sister and cousin. She used to play with Kiekie before this whole thing begun. She played with Kiekie since the day she was born. Sure in the start she could't do much ans slept most of the time. But after some time she learned how to grab things. they could do some silly things.<br>\r\nBut she looked at her sister that was a huge pile of fat. Barely able too move and still wanting more and more food to stuff in her hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now Kiekie. Don't cry. I don't think you get anymore food. They think you're too fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie looked with big eyes at her sister but it was Obvious she did't understand. She did't understood much more than: Mommy, daddy, sister, food, sleep and new diaper. Most other things did't matter to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca went sitting next to her and started to rub an knead Kiekie's fat. It was clear she liked this playing with her fat. It was like a nice tummy rub. But Rebecca must admit that this did feel nice. Soft, squishy and warm like a pillow or a stuffed animal. No wonder Emily liked it so much on her. <br>\r\nShe felt pain like a dagger stabbed in her hart thinking about her. Sure she had seen not to long ago but she was smitten at Emily. She wanted to be close with her all the time. Perhaps Emily's mother could adopt her. Jennifer seemed to care more about Christine then her or Kiekie. Besides she also force feed Rebecca. But Rebecca's best chance to gain was be together with Emily. She should ask her mother or Emily could come over, or if she could go to Emily. Both ways worked for her. As long if she could see Emily it was fine. Did't matter where or why.<br>\r\nAll this time she kept playing with Kiekie's fat. Both girls still liked this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kiekie you're so fat you can't even crawl. Well not that you could before. You were always so lazy. Just what mommy wanted. Why is she so obsessed with Christine. If she wanted to fatten up a little kid she could easily take you. You don't mind and you're a bottomless pit. I bet a entire Zoo fits in here. You would like that would't you. All hippo's, elephants, rhino's and other animals in that huge belly of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped  playing with Kiekie's fat and the moment she stopped Kiekie started whining again. Rebecca sighed and walked back to the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy Kiekie's still hungry. Do you have some food for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I told you\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I did't got a clear answer. But Kiekie's hungry. The only thing that can stop her whining is... food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she does't get any. She just have to live with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. She's just a baby. If she gets hungry suppose she does some stupid stuff. She ca't really think yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the anwer's still no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca walked  back to the living room. She picked up Christine and carried her over to Kiekie. Suddenly she saw Kiekie Munching on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie what are you\u2026 Kiekie you're eating a fern!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie apparently was sitting close enough to the plants to grab one. Rebecca fast grabbed the fern out Kiekie's hands.  There was't much left of the fern. Rebecca sighed and  put the fern out of reach of Kiekie. Hopefully it would start growing again.<br>\r\nShe looked a her sister and Cousin. She got a good luck at Christine's growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really are becoming a fatty Christine.\" She lifted her shirt. \"See... I have some fat also. But that's just for my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Knowing how depressed to hear what had happened to their aunt and uncle especially when it came to Jennifer\u2019s pet it was going to be the most affected by the knowledge of this, not wanting to break the news to any of the kids was the main reason why Jennifer didn\u2019t give her oldest Rebecca a straight answer when she asked about Christine, well that was just half of the reason why the other was she didn\u2019t really want to tell her daughter that she was in love with a two-year-old knowing how in the society that they lived in Jennifer would be ostracized for her love. There was true love there it was easy to see just by the way that Jennifer looked at Christine, her actions were self-deprecating that was assured but Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but be this way around Christine. Was Jennifer like this way thanks to being so alone for many years, not really getting back to the dating scene as it was hard to do when she had two young girls at home who she had to take care of making it hard to date that was obvious. There was also something about Christine that made Jennifer want to fulfill her dream of having a girl who is so massive that she fills up an entire room by herself, her angelic-looking body and golden hair just made Jennifer blush heavily for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right I should tell them the bad news, but I just can\u2019t it's just something I can\u2019t face right now, I don\u2019t know how the piglet will take it knowing that her parents are never coming back. I don\u2019t even know if she knows anything about what happened to them all I can do is be there for her\u201d Jennifer was still contemplating when she was talking with Nancy, not able to bring herself to get into this discussion especially with someone who she deeply cared for it was just one of those things that became harder and harder to do the more she thought about it. Getting up from the kitchen table to face the music that was spilling the beans to the children was something that Jennifer didn\u2019t want to do in any capacity she knew she had to though, it was her responsibility as an adult to talk about the heavy things like this even Jennifer didn\u2019t want to let the girls know about what had happened. Jennifer was hoping she could think about something that could delay the final reveal about what happened to her brother and sister in law something that she could interject before making all the girls sad with the realization of what was going on. Thinking about what she should say to the kids she thought of ways to lighten the load of what she was going to have to tell them only to come to the realization she will have to throw all of her secrets on the table if Jennifer wanted to make this dreadful conversation a little more tolerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess your right all along it isn\u2019t going to be easy, come one Nancy lets go an see the kids once this ugliness is done with we can start having breakfast with Rebecca and Christine since Kiekie has already had her fill right\u201d Jennifer huffed not really wanting to go through that door she wasn\u2019t looking forward toward it at all. Going out to the living room trying to face the children who were there just minding their own business. Christine was playing with blocks and other toys enjoying making a big tower on the gray carpet, bigger and bigger she was making the tower proud of her own accomplishments Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but look the girl up and down, she was filling out quite nicely and Jennifer took notice. While Christine was all alone with her self playing with blocks to keep herself entertained Rebecca was playing with her barely mobile sister, keeping her from crying as the hunger she felt in her stomach wasn\u2019t going to go away for her own mother had decided in her own twisted way of judgment to keep Kiekie fed but not fit to bursting anymore. Kiekie had just become too big and it was hard to get Christine to be the biggest when there was someone who was just an eating machine in the first place, Christine needs to be fed more and Kiekie less if Jennifer\u2019s dream of having a pet was going to come to fruition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls I have something to tell you, Rebecca you have probably already picked up on this so do you want the good news or the bad news first?\u201d Jennifer asked hoping that a little bit of a game would halt the talk they were going to about to have for it was going to be an unsightly discussion, to say the least. Rebecca was quite shocked to what her mother just muttered she thought it was going to be harder to coax her out from letting go of her little secrets was pressing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 I guess the good one first\u201d Rebecca answered, always liking good news before bad it was only just right that she gets to hear some pleasant news before whatever her twisted mother thought was bad news it could just be that Christine is going home for all Rebecca knew. Christine looked at her master when she began to talk to the group, but she really needed to build this city too though she hoped Jennifer didn\u2019t think it was rude of her to keep building while she talked. Binky still in mouth Christine still Built her tower hearing everything but not looking directly at Jennifer, she wasn\u2019t like her cousin she Just wasn\u2019t able to sit still as long as Rebecca did Christine needed to be kept busy and for her to pay attention, the blocks helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo for the good news first then, well Christine will be staying with us forever and ever and I will be paying special attention to her, since as you already picked up on it Rebecca, I don\u2019t need to explain the reason why I will be doing this but know I love you and your sister as my children Christine, I love as you love Emily she is my pet and my lover\u201d Jennifer went on to explain to Rebecca no hesitation in her voice she was utterly confident that what she was saying was what she wanted to say. Rebecca, shocked at what she finally heard couldn\u2019t believe her mother would outright tell her what she thought of Christine. Jennifer felt somewhat relieved with her proclamation of love for the toddler, hiding her feelings wasn\u2019t doing anyone any good and she could see that Rebecca was suffering from Jennifer hiding the core of her relationship with Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow time for the bad News I have to let you know about your aunt and uncle they\u2026.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Of course she did't understand a single word. That and the fact that she did't care about anything except a clean diaper, a nap every now and then and most important to her (a lot of) food. She wanted more food and that was all what was on her mind right now. She did't have a clue what was going on.<br>\r\nRebecca on the other hand knew exactly what happened. Her father died. She slapped her hands for her mouth when she heard it. Tears welled up in her eyes. She loved her aunt and uncle and the idea she would never see them again hurt her but also the thought that poor little Christine lost her parents filled her hart with sadness.<br>\r\nChristine at the other hand froze. Still one block in her hand that slowly slid out of it but she did't noticed. She was still a bit too young to really understand dead, but she knew she would never see her parents again. When her young brain understood that she burst out in tears. Crying long and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh poor little piglet. I'm so sorry. I know how you feel I also lost someone very close to me that I really loved. But he passed away too. But don't worry Christy. I will take care of you. You don't have to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine heard her master but could't stop crying. The thought she would never see her parents again. She could't deal with it. Jennifer, Nancy and even Rebecca rushed over to her to comfort her.<br>\r\nExcept Kiekie. Because she could't move on her own and did't have a clue what was going on but knew she still wanted more food in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Christine. Lets give you some breakfast. That sometimes helps to ease the pain. You know, comfort food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca remembered she once heard that on T.V with a morbidly obese lady. Telling how she became obese. Rebecca must admit this could work. The idea for Christine she missed something could give her the feeling like there was a deep hole inside her that she was only able to fill with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Rebecca. You did't have breakfast yet.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 but what about Kiekie. She's still hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had her fill. Kiekie needs to eat less and Christine more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More? Mom you feed her to the bursting time recently two times. If you feed her more she'll explode. But Kiekie is still hungry.. She needs food. Don't you hear her crying? That will only stop if you give her something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Fine then. I guess she can have a bit more. But just because I want her to stop crying.\" Jennifer mumbled and took some jars of baby food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca started to make her own breakfast. She doubted for a bit but decided to eat a bit more. She wanted herself to fatten up a bit. Not because her mother wanted it but because she wanted to give Emily a bit extra of her. <br>\r\nJennifer noticed this and smiled. Now with Emily, a girl she was totally smitten about, and who wanted her fatter, Rebecca would fatten up. Before she needed to force feed her. This was much easier. <br>\r\nIn the meantime Jennifer fed Christine. She did't struggle or anything else. Just opening her mouth and ate whatever came in reach of her mouth, but it seemed she did't even taste it. She still thought about her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can Emily come over? Or I to her works both ways for me. As long if I can be with Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I will make a play date after breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn silence the three ate further.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fun telling the girls that they would never see their aunt and uncle again, Jennifer was taking it the hardest, having to come to the realization that she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to her brother ever again. Being hard enough to get it through her mind that there was no way she could see them again, but there was also the glee of knowing that her pet was hers and hers alone, it just made sense for Christine to be taken care of by Jennifer since she was already very close with her brother it would make no sense to tear little Christine away from the family in which she knew the most about. Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to function with this information weighing on her mind, she just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out what to do with herself, not seeing her mother or father any more was tearing her up from the inside. One of the biggest things that were going through her head is that she was now stuck being a piglet for the rest of her days. She did care and love her master like a good piglet should but at the same token she did know that she needed to fight the transformation she was going through with Jennifer always dominating and breaking little Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind over and over-conditioning to her to accept the world that she was given. She thought that once her mother and father would come back from their trip Christine could just forget her life as a piglet and being force-fed every second, not knowing the feeling of being fit to bursting by her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow the funeral will be next week I expect you all to be on your best behavior, Rebecca since you have been such a good girl Emily will be coming over for a four day stay with us again starting tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated solemn tone in her voice, hoping that none will hear the sadness that echoed from her soul. Her only brother was gone like it was nothing Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to feel all she could feel was sad, knowing she had to push on it was all she knew. Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think her mother would actually call Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother for a play date with all that was going on but she was quite excited to see her girlfriend again, needing the support that came with the company of other people is just what they all needed. Christine was the one that was affected the most seeming to be dead inside from hearing that her parents were gone all Christine did was play with blocks and hope that what her master had told her a couple of days ago was just a cruel joke that Jennifer way playing on her just to get some sort of rise out of her. Tricking herself that all this was a dream made the pain of her parents being gone all the more difficult to accept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJennifer what are you going to do with your piglet, she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eating anything already losing two pounds just by not eating, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even like playing with the others anymore she just plays with those blocks all the time hoping that her parents are going to walk through the front door any moment something needs to be done to snap her out of this or she is gonna be anorexic any day now\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy told the hard truth to Jennifer, she knew that her best friend was right she needed to snap Christine out of it but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how she was going to do this. It was going to be a tricky thing to act out, snapping her out of this slump and keeping her in line as her piglet was just something Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to do as being delicate was not something she was good at, to say the least. Even Rebecca knew that something was wrong with her cousin this was just so out of character for her she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was wrong or how she could help with the pain that Christine was going through so all she could do was try to comfort her sister instead avoiding Christine in fear she might say the wrong thing to Christine and set her off into a sobbing fit. Kiekie was much easier to pin down on why she was sad, given the fact that Jennifer had demanded that Christine become the fattest girl around it only made sense that Kiekie was given less food and Christine more this made Kiekie herself sad as she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sate her appetite in the way she used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know your hungry Kiekie your just going to have to be a big girl\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Well bigger girl than you already are and learn that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get what you want sorry to say, but Christine needs all the food she can get if she is going to become as big as mom want her to get\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca tried very hard to comfort her sister with little to no avail Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart was set in getting some food the four jars that she was now given wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough she sort of understood why this was happening but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough for her to completely understand so she cries. Rebecca hugged her sister trying to calm her down for a while, being the easiest of the bunch to calm down Rebecca knelt down, hugging her sister each fold of fat that was on Kiekie definitely was smaller than Rebecca remembered I guess that is what happened to when she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always fit to bursting under her own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy watch the girls I need to be alone with Christine, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try my best to get her out of this slump she is in I think you better leave us alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer told her friend, hoping that she can break the sadness that Christine was in. Putting the little girl on her hip Jennifer whisked the little girl away to Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, hoping that if something will break this sadness it would be some heart to heart, piglet to master.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer put Christine on the bed. Christine eyes did't seem to see anything. Like dead eyes. <br>\r\nJennifer took a chocolate cake. Something Christine always liked even before she came living with her aunt. However Christine did't seem to notice or did't care about the cake. Jennifer grabbed a fork and cut of a piece and brought it to Christine's lips. Christine did't care anymore and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen up my little piglet. You miss you parents. I can image\u2026 No I don't. I can't  image how that feels since my parents are still alive. But I can understand you're really sad. But I'm sad too. They were your parents but the were also my family. Well at least my brother. I also could get along pretty well with my sister in law. But my brother\u2026 I knew him my entire life you know. You too of course but I know him longer. I grew up with him. Saw the things he liked to do. Saw the pranks he made. Things we did together. We did't have any other siblings so the two of us played together often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine listened with open eyes while she was fed the pie. She did't really noticed what it was. I might as well have been mud. She was occupied with listening to her master. Suddenly she saw a tear in her masters eyes. Then she realized it that She might miss her father and mother, but Jennifer lost her brother, an she missed him just as much if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was also my family. We were pretty close. He was my big brother. At school he protected me against bullies and he even helped me study sometimes so I got good grades. He was always there for me. Always. Sure we bickered sometimes but I don;t think they're any siblings who don't bicker sometimes. He has done so many things for me. Now he's gone. I can't anything for him anymore. Except taking care of his daughter. That's you.<br>\r\n I love you Christine. I also love my brother and my sister in law. But we can't do anything for them anymore. But I know for sure your parents did't want this. You seem to don't care anymore. You don't care about anything anymore since they died. But I'm sure They wanted you to have a happy healthy life. Not eating anything is't the way. You will look like a skeleton. That's not helping your parents and it is't helping you or me. They're dead we can't do anything about that, but we're alive. Things can still happen to us. We have a future. We are still able to get some help. You can't let it control you life. because else you have no life<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine  did't missed a word her aunt said. It all made sense. She did't care about anything anymore but she liked so many things before. Those things were still there. Being sad about her parents was natural but what was she going to do now? Stay sad for the rest of her life? No! Sure she might still be sad about her parents, that was't bad but she could't let it control her life. There was't a reason why she still could't have fun. She was still here and still had a future. Still things she could like and enjoy. There was't a reason why she could't be happy sometimes.<br>\r\nSuddenly she noticed the delicious taste in her mouth. The taste of chocolate cake and noticed she had been eating it the entire time. Suddenly she noticed she was hungry. Very hungry and the next moment she slammed her face in the pie and started eating it like a starved animal. Stuffing lumps and lumps of the chocolate cake. It looked like she had't eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine you're eating. Sometimes eating is a way to help ease the pain. Filling the empty space you feel in your hart.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nChristine must admit she did feel a bit better now the entire cake was in her belly. Eating did made her feel better. She looked at Jennifer and smiled and said: \"Want more!\"</span></div></div>",

Cake is always good to eat when someone is sad but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what she was really craving, someone to talk to her in this trying time was good enough. Normalcy was great for Christine seeing the joy of her eating again from her master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was something that Christine was taken aback by since she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like eating like what her name implied it was easier to just dismiss food and have her master force it down into her gullet. There was no way Christine was going to be as fat as she Jennifer wanted her to become without a fight it was somewhat of a game for them both to see what will happen, Christine wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to deny it anymore, she did find pleasure in having no control of how much she was eating there was an allure to it and she enjoyed denying Jennifer what she really wanted was the only rebellion she could do as a toddler and she loves messing with her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more not hungry\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine mumbled out of her mouth still chewing the last piece of cake that was shoved into her mouth by Jennifer, Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how much she was eating just wanting to make this feeling of dread that was looming over her that came with her parents being gone, chatting with her master about how there was much more to do in this world than being sad the whole time. Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to push Christine to eat as it could become counterproductive to her plans for Christine she needed the little girl to love her unconstitutionally that was her plan, one thing that Jennifer needed Christine needed to prepare Christine for was her life of being dominated and force-fed at the moment she just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t right in the mind to experience these things it was obvious that this was the case no matter what Jennifer wanted to do with Christine at the moment her piglet needed to be coddled due to the trauma she had just endured with the passing of her parents. Putting down the tray Jennifer was a little upset that her little piglet only ate a little bit but knowing that she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force Christine right now made Jennifer accept the statement that Christine made begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cShhh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 its okay Kiekie, I know your hungry but your not gonna get anymore Jennifer had made it quite clear that you need to lose a few and we need to focus on Christine more which is fine for me as your weight was really messing up my back before\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy tried to calm down the little girl as much as she could it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard to calm her down what made it hard was when Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach would rumble again is what made her cry again that really did it. Rebecca was close to her sister calming her with Nancy near the both of them keeping a close eye on Kiekie not knowing if she would try something to get more food, Rebecca was just trying her best to make sure that her sister was comfortable and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thinking about the whole situation that Kiekie was in. Being such a gluttonous child was counterproductive in the current hand the baby had been given to her it was true that the little girl didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was going on and why she was being given so little food after no one before was trying to curb her appetite. The mixed signals Kiekie was being given by the adults in her life was just so confusing she just wished that this hunger she had would go away as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to stop crying you know, I try to play with her and it works for a little while but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a permanent solution Kiekie wants food to sate her miss Nancy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca was blunt and deliberate with her testimony with the what she was seeing happen to her sister. Kiekie was still barely mobile that was quite obvious, yet the gluttons once massive hunger was culled if only by some small margin Kiekie was hungry this was true but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as powerful of a desire to fill her gut as it once was. Felling her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tiny fingers running against her stomach was quite blissful, their meticulous strokes played with Kiekie's Navel sending sensual feeling throughout the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. Kiekie smiled at the feelings she was getting from Rebecca no piece of her body was neglected from Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers the girls kissed her sister's plump cheeks as she played with her fat it was one of the best things Kiekie could get in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you're right Rebecca but the food is out of the question we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give her any, she needs to lose a few so I can cart her around without getting so many stares, what do you think would keep her quiet\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy asked Rebecca hoping that the little girl knew what her sister liked more than food that would make Kiekie happy enough that she would stop this insistent crying every two seconds. It was a long shot, to say the least as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything that would stop Kiekie from crying that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t food, but it was Nancy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only choice in this situation. Rebecca thought, and thought about the question that Nancy had asked, hoping that she knew of something that would peak her sisters interested enough that food would be second to it all that Rebecca could think of that might work for a little while at least was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiekie was hungry and just wanted food. That was all. She was only getting hungrier by the minute. What also was a problem was that she did't understood was: why? Why did't she got food. She was too young to understand that her mother wanted Christine to be the fattest so she did't understood why she did't got food. Was she punished. But she could't think of anything she did wrong. Her belly was still rumbling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWen they heard the doorbell Rebecca jumped up and ran as fast as a kid of her size could to the front door. As soon as she opened the door Emily jumped at her and covered her under kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you so much. So happy to see you again.\" Emily sad between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also happy to see you again. Come on lets go to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer entered the hall and saw the two walk upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fun those two can get along so well. They were Always good friends but I can see they're truly in love with each other. Is't that nice?\" Emily's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is. But I'm not sure it's for ever. I mean they're still very young. I mean I had several boyfriends before I got a relation with Rebecca's father. I bet you also had several boyfriends. Also love between young kids can end very fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're right. But they were already friends before and they are both girls. I don't know much about lesbian relationships. But we'll see what will happen. But it would be nice If they stayed a  couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily just entered Rebecca's room when they head cries from Kiekie. She was hungrier then ever and now her sister was also gone. This was starting to become the worst day of her entire short life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Emily asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kiekie. She's crying because she's hungry. But my mother put her on a diet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... diet? Hold on! I thought your mother was fattening the three of you up. Or did I misunderstood something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But you know Kiekie. She's a real eating machine. I believe she's the fattest of the three of us. My mother wants us all three to become fat... but... she wants Christine to be the fattest. But with Kiekie's normal food intake... well that was't gonna happen. So my mother put her on a diet so Christine can catch up and become fatter then her. Poor Kiekie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's crying because she's  hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and the only thing that can shut her up is food. We tried anything else but it's no use. She just wants food. That's only thing to make her stop crying. But my mother don't wanna give her more food because she wants Christine to be the fattest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad for Kiekie. But I guess we cant do much about it. So what are we gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I had something in mind.\" Rebecca said on a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she pulled Emily on her bed and started cuddling an kissing her and Emily soon returned the favors. They both loved this. Kissing and cuddling an exploring the other ones curves, however that last part was mostly Emily.

Feeling her precious flab that was gained from constantly eating and her stomach shrink with every second that passed her was unbearable for Kiekie to even acknowledge at the time being. The two girls were just too busy to actually see what Kiekie wanted and what that reason was, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get any food to say the least it was something that both girls knew that Jennifer was going to budge on she was very adamant to wanting Christine the fattest girl around Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unhealthy obsession when it came to Christine the little blonde didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the attention she got from Jennifer as it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad to say the least sure she sobbed uncontrollably when it came to being fed and having to be a plaything for Jennifer, yet she could feel that Jennifer loved her and that was really nice. Rebecca and Emily tried to enjoy their time together as everything was normal, but their time was hard to be disturbed by Kiekie as they were old enough to look after the girl Rebecca was responsible for her younger blob of a sister. Rebecca tried to calm her down the best she could with what she had and tried to make Kiekie forget that Jennifer was the cause of her hunger and the intense crying that was coming from Kiekie was the cause of Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession to have the cutest fattest piglet. Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to think about this too hard while Emily was her so the little girl just pretended that everything was the same as it was last time Emily came over for a four-day visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry Rebecca but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kiss you when your sister is so gosh darn loud all the time\u00e2\u0080\u009d breaking away from the loving embrace of her girlfriend only to spout that was hard to hear but Emily was right it was hard to have a good time when Kiekie was still crying Rebecca knew that she had to find some way to stop her sisters wailing some how it she was thinking of ways to do this, also she was wondering where Christine could be Jennifer and Nancy were downstairs still with Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Debra having a nice chat and some tea before Debra had to go to work for the night shift. Kiekie was trying to grab anything she could seeing if it was food, from blocks to TV remotes she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in how they tasted she just wanted to eat anything at this second it was like she was being possessed by a demon of gluttony it was very curious to see to say the least. Not finding anything that she could really eat only made the little girl more distressed as the wailing began once again something that the two girls were getting tired of since they wanted to be alone with each other and not have this crying blob of a girl blubbering all over them, they needed to find a way to make her happy again or something that would get her mind off of the growling of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can we do for you sister, she is going to run out of water from crying so much if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dry her tears\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily exclaimed a worried about Kiekie, she was more saddened by the way Jennifer was treating her daughter than the size of her daughter, though Emily could see there was a intoxicating allure to seeing some one sobbing uncontrollable and why Jennifer loved it when her pet was forced fed. This was a different kind of pain but kind of the same principles behind it, Emily wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it to Rebecca though as feeding her gently was more familiar to Emily than the brutal methods that Jennifer used on Christine. Emily just thought of that she should see if Christine can Play with Kiekie instead of Rebecca and Emily watching her they were almost of similar ages so it should be a better relationship with them two them. Emily and Rebecca started to look for Christine both were a little shocked that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t with Jennifer, I guess she didn't want to freak out Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mom with having a fat two year old with a pink collar around her neck and dressed up in frilly pink things would be too much for Debra. Going door to door Emily and Rebecca went on the search for Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pet the just needed her for a little while it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so bad since the adults were too busy gossiping about what was happening in their lives like regular mothers do. Knowing that the children couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into much trouble the women just left them alone for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was true that the girls were looking for Christine yet Emily couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take her eyes off of Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plump body every curve of her body was mesmerizing it was no wonder why Jennifer was jealous of all the other girls. Rebecca was a natural born piglet like her sister sure she was unwilling like most girls her age would be at the strange request that her mother had made of her that was quite true, yet their was no denying the results of her mothers feeding. Being the second largest wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that Rebecca ever thought she could feel proud of with her hips being as wide as they were and every waddle she attempted to make Rebecca felt throughout her body, dresses were all she would wear now as pants weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as comfortable as they once were on her form that much was obvious this only made Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind go wild with lewd thoughts of what she was going to do with Rebecca after finding Christine it was enough to make the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head feel dizzy. Coming up to the last room on the top floor made the girls a bit nervous to say the least not knowing what they were going to find once they did find Christine. Hearing cries and wails was becoming more and more of a thing in this house of late Emily could tell. Opening the door as slow and precise they could not wanting to disturb what ever was going in this room looking around with suspicion to say the least as it was Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room so they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make her mad by touching her stuff, all they girls wanted was someone to play with Kiekie so they could have some alone time that is why they needed Christine it was as simple as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIts just a normal room Emily no need to be afraid of it\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca smirked barging into her mothers room proving a point that there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything to be afraid of there were no traps or demonic entities to be worried about well not here anyways as that one was downstairs with Nancy. The girls followed the sound of sobs and pitiful oinks that were coming from the room they finally found Christine who looks like she just had a delicious meal forced down her gullet her arms were still bound to the chair so she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move at all. Looking at Christine Rebecca and Emily were thinking of what to do with her looking as pitiful as she did they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she could keep Kiekie busy, even with chocolate frosting caked on her supple lips the girls were could see why Jennifer had her eye on Christine, it was true that she loved them all but they could see why Christine was special. Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long blonde hair glittered like it was gold was off set by her milky white skin off settled by her porcelain doll like features were enough explanation for them both though her body did leave a little to the imagination with what she was wearing what looked like a school girl outfit complete with twin tails. Rebecca and Emily didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand completely but they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny she was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more master, too full\u00e2\u0080\u009d Christine said not really notice who it was she wanted to fight her master it was so much fun to deny Jennifer even if she sobs in the end. Rebecca and Emily looked at each other as this seemed to be a perfect opportunity to feed Christine if they so desired both had tasted the delicious flavor of anguish, both from Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if Christine really enjoyed it though they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do.</span></div></div>",

Do you really think we can carry her? My mother has been able to force billions of calories down her throat. Emily, she's fat. Just look at her belly. She's perhaps not the size my mother wants her to be, but she's fat. Do you really think we will be able to carry her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not. But Kiekie is't able to walk but she can. We just need to put her on her feet and take her down.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do that. How about that Christine? Or do you like being a pig pet for your aunt? Do you like it to be my mothers little piglet? Or more her fat little piglet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master... so\u2026 much\u2026. food.\" Christine said between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know about this.\" Emily mumbled. \"Liking fat people is fine. If you fatten them up... well that depends if the other person is fine with being fattened up. But force them to become fat against their will. I don't know about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls grabbed a arm of Christine and pulled her on her feet. Christine looked a bit like she did't know where she was. Both took her hand and took her to the stairs. Christine was able to take a slow waddle. By the stair she need to turn and went down the stairs backwards just like a little baby. After that they slowly pulled her into the living room and to the place were Kiekie was.<br>\r\nKiekie was still crying since she still did't got any more food. But Rebecca saw that Nancy was about to crack and feed her no matter what Jennifer said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Jennifer was Chatting wit Debra in the kitchen with a nice cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it about that girl Christine. She's your niece. At least that's what Emily said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed she is. But her parents died recently. Her father\u2026 my brother. Well I decided to adopt her. She's family and well... I like her. She's a cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jennifer was careful enough not to say that she was really in love with Christine. She knew pretty well that Debra and most other people would't agree about that. <br>\r\nProblem was she did't knew what Emily told her mother. Perhaps Emily did say something about her love for Christine. But if she stayed calm Debra would probably think Emily misunderstood something. Like little kids often do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sad to hear about what happened to her parents. But very nice of you to adopt her. What's up with that little one of you? Kiekie, was't it? She been crying non stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just a baby. They cry for everything. They cant talk yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know they cry. But mostly they only cry with a reason. So perhaps something is wrong with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she's hungry. I will feed her in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rebecca there you are.\" Nancy said. \"And with Emily nice to see you\u2026 and you took Christine with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we thought that Kiekie would maybe stop crying if she had somebody to play with\u2026 and well Christine is closer to her age. Perhaps it makes her shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try everything to make her stop crying.\" Nancy said. \"I can't take it anymore. I can't believe she has tears left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy picked Christine up and put her next to Kiekie.    <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nancy was just so sick and tired of the crying that was coming from Kiekie that she was ready to try just about anything, the crying was just becoming too much for Nancy not being able to cook in peace was worst of it all she didn\u2019t want to disobey Jennifer\u2019s decision in making Christine the fattest girl they have ever seen since the girl was special to her friend but she needed to do something about Kiekie even if it killed her. Debra who was still chatting with Jennifer about the girls and mother stuff, it was strange to Nancy that this woman wasn\u2019t batting an eye of how fat Kiekie was or how much food Nancy was cooking for lunch it wasn\u2019t something out of the ordinary for Debra seeing girls who were so small being so fat? Jennifer had also picked up on this conundrum that the women had in front of them, was that Debra was a like minded person or was it that she had reserves about the situation that they found themselves in and didn\u2019t want to say or do anything that would sever the relationship her daughter had with Jennifer\u2019s daughter. There was a sense that something was off coming from this woman it was quite obvious Jennifer didn\u2019t want to pry too much when it came to the subject, not wanting to dig it up in front of this woman but if she asks about it she didn\u2019t want to lie to her about it either hoping that Debra would see that she does love her girls, but one is just more of a girlfriend than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just so glad that your daughter Rebecca loves my daughter the way she does, Emily hasn\u2019t been very good at making friends and now she has a little girlfriend, I just hope that they can stay this way I think its good for her to be around like minded people\u201d Debra said bluntly no condescending tone in her voice what she was saying was coming from her heart. Jennifer really couldn\u2019t track this woman was this just a mask she was wearing for Jennifer to trust her or was she truly not phased by the fact that there were little girls who were fat around her house Jennifer really couldn\u2019t tell one way or another. While Debra and Jennifer were chatting up a storm about the girls still Rebecca, Emily and Nancy were hoping their little plan that had to do with making Christine keep Kiekie busy and stop crying since none of them wanted to deal with Kiekie having a tantrum about not being fed like she once was. Lifting Christine into the little baby gate that they had Kiekie in was much more easier to lift a sixty pound toddler into a gate than trying to put a hundred and fifty pound baby out of the gated space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully that will stop her crying, I even gave them some toys to play with Kiekie didn\u2019t want\u2019 to play with them but Maybe Christine will make Kiekie interested in them and stop her blubbering\u201d a tired Nancy stated hoping that this would work it was all the three of them could think of at that moment it was them just hoping that this would be enough. Christine was still in a sort of stupor due to her not really knowing where she was being full beyond bursting had always put her in one of these moods before it wasn\u2019t anything new. Her master was hoping to replace the pounds that she had lost when she was in her depressive state about her parents deaths it was still something that Christine didn\u2019t want to think about so instead she played with blocks hoping that Kiekie would be happy to play with her as much as she was excited too. Crawling over to where Kiekie and the blocks were wasn\u2019t too hard to do for Christine, wiggling her but back and forth almost as if Christine was putting on a show for the three people who were with her. Thanks to her interactions with her master Christine had benefited from learning to make everything she does a show for everyone to see for it didn\u2019t matter who looked at her anymore its not like she was a human being anymore, she was a pet piglet nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilding a little tower next to Kiekie and grabbing some of the folds that Kiekie was happily sporting Christine began to massage the little girl making sure to spend special attention to every piece of flab that the little girl had. They didn\u2019t know what kind of seductress Christine was now but it didn\u2019t matter anymore the crying was coming to an end with Kiekie now happy and having someone else to play with was the best outcome that could come from this situation Rebecca, Nancy and Emily agreed on that fact with the piglet keeping Kiekie busy they could all just go and go do what they were doing to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou girls have fun, I will start making some supper since its almost time for that, I just hope your mother goes home soon Emily I don\u2019t have enough for everyone since a lot of this is for Christine\u201d Nancy said sighing a little in relief that she didn\u2019t have to hear Kiekie anymore. Emily was also wondering why Debra hasn\u2019t left yet either, knowing how much of a chatter box she was and how Emily told her about Jennifer she wondered if her mother was trying to talk about Jennifer or something else. None of that really mattered right now at this moment Emily just wanted to go upstairs with Rebecca as soon as possible and kiss her wonderful girlfriend even more than she wanted to hear two adults shoot the breeze about life and such.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But with Emily it was different. Emily fed her with love and care and most important did't forced anything down her throat. Jennifer forced her to be fat because she liked her fat. Emily also wanted her fat but with her it was fun. love and care.

They wrestled a bit with each other what soon turned into kissing. A lot of kissing. Kisses filed with passion. after a lot of kisses both were lying on the bed breathing heavy while looking at the sealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2026 that was... fantastic.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I liked it too. I liked it a lot. Very much. But it's just strange. I love you and all. We were friends before, I don't know exactly when my friendship for you turned into love. But before that I always thought I would kiss and fell in love with a boy. Not a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there then anything wrong with me, or with being a girl. or being in love with a girl?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! It's not! Nothing wrong with you, nothing wrong with being a girl and nothing wrong with being in love with a girl, but before I just never thought about that. But I heard we're not alone in this. There are a lot of boys who love boys and a lot of girls who love girls. There's nothing wrong with that. However\u2026 some people are against it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you have those people about anything. Remember Stella? Who always teased me with my red hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked your red hair. It looks good at you. But sure I remember Stella. But I did't liked her. She always acted like she was better and more beautiful then everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that and she had sawdust for brains. Or Vincent who teased me just because I was faster runner than him. What I mean is, you have always people who don't agree or don't like you. But just because they think that way does't want to say it's bad or good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also relative. I like fat girls but other people dislike fat girls and rather have a skinny one. Some like a blond girl other a brunette and I like a redhead. tall, short, big butt, wide  butt, big boobs, medium boobs, small boobs, blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes. All those things, some like them and some don't. But that's all right. We don't need to all like the same things. But we do need to accept them. But people don't. At least not all.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true but you have those people everywhere. So guess we just have to live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder how other kids react at school. You know they tease kids who are in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what. If they sing: Emily and Rebecca sitting in a tree<br>\r\nK-I-S-S-I-N-G. <br>\r\nFirst comes love, then comes marriage<br>\r\nthen comes Emily with a baby carriage <br>\r\n So what? We do kiss and like it. We are in love and who knows perhaps we marry and who know perhaps we do get kids, one way or another, and one day when we are all wrinkles with gray hair we're sitting outside in a chair, drinking tea and remember this talk. What they sing is perhaps true. So what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess your right. I got my breath back. Ready for another round of kissing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would never ask!\"<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Nancy looked as if she was cooking for more than the six people that were in the house more like there were twelve people were in the house, most were the usual fluff that came to mind when someone was making a lunch for a massive party, there was potato salad, corn on the cobs, some pigs in a blanket and even some assorted chips were apart of this feast that Nancy was creating even cooking up some pulled pork sandwiches for the main meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would be a shame to waste all this so I hope your hungry Christine as your our prized piglet after all, I know you hate it but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care as much as Jennifer does I will make you the fattest girl this world has seen\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy was very upfront with what her plans were for the blonde girl, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any reason to make a relationship of slave and master the way that her cohort had to do. With a little fear set in the girls heart could do Christine a little good to make sure that Christine knows her place, Nancy did feel a bit bad for Kiekie more than she did for Christine as the circumstances in which the baby found her self was something that Nancy knew weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to stop until Christine dwarfs Rebecca and Kiekie in size and weight. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be an easy task though as being the most athletic and thin of all three made it hard for Christine to gain as it was, Jennifer was going to break the little girl no matter what this was the plan. Nancy just cooked and looked at the unsuspecting girl of what was going to happen to her knowing that the trials that were ahead of Christine will mold her into a piglet who will be attached to Jennifer with no question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Nancy was cooking and taking care of the girls Jennifer was entertaining Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Debra to the best of her ability not knowing what was said about her made Jennifer quite on edge, to say the least not knowing something didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her situation any easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad that you allowed my daughter to continue to be the lover of your little bundle of you the two of them really hit it off don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer chuckled hoping that it would be a great ice breaker to start into the conversation, not wanting to hide the fact that Jennifer, why Emily came here, was to be the reason why Rebecca would get as fat as possible. This was a secret that Debra would not know about until later was what Jennifer was planning on as she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a good way to talk to another mother about loving fat little girls, Debra, on the other hand, was a little on the fence with Emily loving Rebecca she knew that being in love with another girl wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong in any sense of the word but at the same time being only five years old Debra felt her daughter didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand what love was really was. it was quite the conundrum that she had found herself in as if she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let her daughter see Rebecca any more Debra knew she would be hated for it being as protective as she is Debra didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want her little girl to indirectly break her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad that our daughters hit it off and all but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the nagging sensation that your little bundle of joy and mine don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand what love really is I fear that they will hurt themselves\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra stated quite frankly not wanting Jennifer to get any other ideas about what she really meant about the situation that the mothers found themselves in. Jennifer sipped her tea before placing it down trying to contemplate on the advice that Debra had just given her, she knew that Debra had her reasons and fears about the situation they both found themselves in but at the same token there was true love there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand what you're saying Debra, yet at the same token, I do not believe that the girls don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what love is I do believe they do and have made it a point to us as parents that they care for each other. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there is any harm since I know your daughter has a specific taste and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to help her in discovering herself, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think Emily should love a big girl like Rebecca I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anything wrong with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Returning the frank way Debra was speaking to her Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let anything of what she was saying be up for interpretation, no Jennifer wanted Debra to understand what she was saying was what she thought when it came to the situation of love. Taking to heart to what Debra heard from Jennifer the mother did feel a bit at ease when it came to leaving her lovely daughter with these people, Debra knew that her daughter had a love of larger girls which was something that Debra didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to encourage as much as Jennifer did as it seems she had more know-how about that area. Not wanting to unveil her true intentions yet Jennifer felt that it was in her best interest to not allow Debra to know what kind of evil really was below the surface. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so often that Jennifer could just have some time to herself and talk about mother problems with another mother it was nice to do once and while, making sure that Debra becomes more and more comfortable with her was what she was trying to accomplish in the first place hoping that further on Debra will be on her side when she shows the world her relationship with her slave Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I better get going I totally forgot I had to be at the hairdressers an hour ago, I will be back Tuesday for Emily I hope you all have a great time\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra abruptly shot up from her seat, grabbing her keys and pocketbook before heading toward the door. Seeing that there was no signs harm done to her daughter and that the love Emily felt for Rebecca seemed Genuine enough Debra was on her way. Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to react, helping Debra out the door was all she could do though she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be happier to see the woman leave as it was going to be hard to explain when Debra sees Christine tied up like a dog and force-feed every morsel that can fit into her little pretty mouth. Jennifer and Nancy had to keep an eye on the lithe girl with all their energy, training her to be an obedient pet so they can move on to the other girls was the first thing they knew what they had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I hope to see you Tuesday I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Emily is going to have fun with her little girlfriend, drive safe and have a nice day\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all she could muster waving Debra out the door, Jennifer giddy when her new friend finally drove off as Lunch was just around the corner but she wondered if Christine should get in some training before lunch of her new role as a pet though?</span></div></div>",

She tried to grab the ball but it was hard for her to reach over her belly. Christine giggled. She herself had also gotten pretty fat. She was aware of that but also knew that it made her master happy. Just like she liked it to be forced to eat. She just hoped that she would't get stuffed like the last times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is lunch Nancy?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost ready,\" Nancy answered. \"You better get the girls ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca! Emily! Lunch is ready!\" Jennifer yelled upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily were busy kissing each other but suddenly their magic moment was broken when they heard Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah too bad. I was having so much fun. Well a girls gotta eat, right,\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not entirely true,\" Emily said. \"You can of course also be fed instead of eat. Sure the food end up in the same place. In your stomach. And finally to your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you like that don't you?\" Emily said and pushed her playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't mind. But I only do it, if you're fine with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked or in Rebecca's case waddled downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Nancy both were needed to lift the huge Kiekie into her chair. Kiekie looked happy since she now would be fed. True Jennifer wanted Christie to be way fatter then Kiekie but that did't want to say she would starve Kiekie. But she would be fed less then before. Kiekie was without a doubt the fattest of the girls but Jennifer wanted Christine to become the fattest. Kiekie might be second or third. She did't really cared as long if all three of them became fat with Christine at number one. Top three fattest kids. Rebecca, Kiekie and at number one the grand prize winner and fattest kid ever... Christine!<br>\r\nJennifer and Emily went sitting at the table. Looking at all the food. Rebecca and Kiekie both licked their lips. Christine looked at all the food with a sigh. She knew she was supposed to eat most of it. She got slowly used to eating a lot. Her stomach had stretched a lot the past days but still.<br>\r\nKiekie could't wait to eat and reached out to the food. But she was having trouble reaching it with her big belly in the way. Nancy fast gave her some of the food. Kiekie gobbled the food down in less then a minute and looked at Nancy with a look that said: Was that all? I want more. I'm still hungry.<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily filled their plate. Emily first fed Rebecca some food while she chewed Emily took a bite of her own food and prepared another spoon for Rebecca, or her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was in the meantime busy force feeding Christine. But Christine was hungry so she made less of a fuss about it then normally. That made it easier for Jennifer to pass the most fattening and greasy food past Christine's lips and into her tummy. Why did it take so long to fatten up her niece?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I wish I could fatten her up a bit faster.\" Jennifer mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps you can.\" Emily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean my dear girl?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well... We just have... regular food. But well... butter is kind of... fattening. If you gave her... liquid butter to drink or liquid lard\u2026 well that would really speed... up their weight gain. You also have weight gain powder and stuff that turn all what they eat in 100% pure fat. If you really want to fatten her up so badly why don't you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at Nancy and could't believe why she did't think of that before. It was so easy and so simple. If she wanted Christine to become fat fast she just need to have some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there really stuff that makes you gain weight. I thought most people wanted to lose weight.\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But the also made weight gain powder. They also use weight gain stuff at cows. Did't you see how fat they sometimes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer chuckled evilly and Christine got scared.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Hearing of trying to use liquid butter though did give Jennifer new ways to dominate Christine though, another spoonful of potato salad slid passed the little girls lips mixing with the pulled pork that already occupied her mouth making a sickly sweet concoction that came from the Vidalia onions making it almost perfect for Christine. Her already stuffed stomach felt like it was going to burst at any minute having enough food for three grown adults in her little body didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy, my someone really is looking like a stuffed pig now\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer chuckled kissing the right cheek of her little plaything loving the way that Christine looked right now reaching down to the massive orb that was connected to the little girls body barely being covered by the pink my little pony shirt that she loved to wear, her master examined Christine like she was nothing more than a piece of meat to be devoured it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that was Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life now or anything but it was kind of unnerving for the little girl, to say the least. Jennifer Knowing exactly what to do to make the little girl feel better about being fit to burst begun to reach down toward Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach, it was already begging to be touched with how big it had become being forced to eat so much gave it a tinge of pink to it. Not even noticing Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands reaching down toward Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own stomach only realizing it when feeling the light almost orgasmic feeling Christine was feeling from the small circles Jennifer applied to her stomach it felt so good to have some relief of pressure from her meal. Moaning with every rub she received from her master sent her into a whirlwind of pleasure throughout the little girl's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009clets give this butter thing a shot, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think we should piglet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d smiling at Christine Jennifer placed the bottle full of butter up to the lips of Christine hoping that it would at least effect Christine a little bit, being the smallest of all three girls still didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit right with Jennifer and she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how long Kiekie would keep quiet when it came to Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation so if Jennifer could make it go a little faster made it all the better. Emily Nancy and Rebecca were a little embarrassed with the moans coming from Christine not knowing how to react to the intamaticy that was happening right in front of them made the whole situation a little more awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you girls like the meal did you have enough\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy tried to ask her other wards pushing out of their little mind the sexual situation that was happening right in front of them, it was a little hard to keep out of theithroughs though with every belly rub and kiss Christine had gotten from Jennifer sent her into another wave of pleasure something that neither of the girls had ever seen or experienced before it was hard for them to keep their mind focused. Emily wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in amazement oh how Jennifer could make her pet moan with just a few flicks of her fingers it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something she thought Jennifer wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to do, knowing what kind of relationship that she had with Christine Emily thought that their relationship was more based on being dominated and dominating the person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUhh it was enough Miss Nancy I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I could eat all that there was but it was nice of Emily to help me eat it, right Emily\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca told her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend in a way to keep all their minds off of Jennifer and her piglet, at first it was being hard to do since they were right there next to them, Christine being fed a bottle of pure melted butter while Jennifer kissed her next gently enough to force the girl to go into an orgasmic response. To say that Jennifer and Christine weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoying the interaction that they were having would be a little bit of an understatement, ,to say the least it. Kiekie didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any problem with the love that Christine was given, what the baby did have a problem with was how much food she was given it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. This was Kiekie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life now no longer able to pig out to her hearts content she was now limited to a finite amount as Christine who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s metabolism was the most troublesome was having to cause havoc for Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, thinking that if Christine just was forced to eat more then she would finally be dwarfing the sizes of the two other girls and if Kiekie shrunk a bit by not eating as much then everything else would fall into place. Trying to reach for more food on the table to sate her hunger was all in vain as all of it was made so it would be just out of the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach on purpose, huffing and puffing Kiekie wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gonna give up on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on girls your mother and Christine are going to go somewhere private so we can watch a movie until then\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nancy giving the indication to Jennifer that it was time for some alone time with Christine, hoping that her little nod to Jennifer would get to her friend. Being embarrassed of how she was acting in front of everyone wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything new but seeing Christine fed so much made Jennifer all hot and heavy so much so that she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think straight. Stopping herself from kissing and giving the little girl belly rubs was the first step, knowing that this was going to be something that Christine wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to like Jennifer knew that she was going to have to be fast about it. Picking up the girl from her highchair as her piglet finished the melted butter sippy cup that she was given, apologetically Jennifer bowed herself out and took her piglet for some fun into Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room not wanting Christine to get off of this high too soon. Moving into her piglet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room was for the best gently placing the girl on large queen-sized bed smiling to Christine which only made the little girl hot and bothered.</span></div></div>",

I wanted you to become fatter by feeding you a lot of food. But it's not only the amount of food that counts. It's also what you eat. Liquid butter, liquid lard and weight gain powder that are the things I need. That I can make weight gain shakes. You will gain weight like crazy. I want three fat girls. Rebecca Kiekie and you. But there is a difference between the three of you. You are gonna be the fattest. Kiekie would probably be number two or three but that does't really matter the only thing that does matter is that you're the fattest. Oh I gonna make you so fat. You're gonna be the fattest girl that ever lived, and I'm gonna help you with that. Don't worry my cute little fatty. True you already are fat but I want you fatter. I want you to be the fattest, but now Kiekie is the fattest. So that's why she's on a diet. You're also on a diet but a different one. A diet tells you you can eat somethings and some things not. The things on it can help you lose weight or gain weigh. Kiekie's diet plan is to lose weight and yours is to gain. I'm gonna fatten you up like the witch did in Hansel and Gretel. However I always thought that it should be Gretel that needed to be fattened up in a cage. Not Hansel. Besides that afterwards he did't seem to be so much fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did't understood all what Jennifer said. But she did understood that her master wanted her to be fatter. Or at least fatter then her cousins. That was her first goal. But after that? Did Jennifer had a end goal. Or was she just supposed to gain, and gain, and gain and then gain some more. She feared that that was the answer.<br>\r\nShe must admit that her stomach started to get used to holding more food but then her master started to feed her more and more. Now after every meal she was in pain and her stomach was swollen and bloated. She felt that if you would touch her stomach with something sharp it would explode.<br>\r\nJennifer also seemed to be excited about something. She wondered if it had anything to do with the sticky stuff her master fed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer went sitting next to her and suddenly started to kiss her. She pushed the toddler on her back and lifted her shirt expose more of her big belly and started to kiss her swollen belly. But strangely enough this did make her feel better. She liked the touch of her masters lips on her swollen belly. It felt nice. Very nice. <br>\r\nSlowly she moved her lips upwards. over her chest and finally reached her face and kissed her. <br>\r\nChristine always learned that people who kissed you loved you and she started to kiss Jennifer back. <br>\r\nSoon the two were kissing and cuddling on the bed with each other. No one knew for sure who had the most fun, but fun they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Rebecca and Emily were having trouble with Kiekie. She was crying again since she wanted more food but she could't reach it. And they could't get Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do? What she want is food, but we can't give her food,\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I know one thing we can do,\" Emily said. \"We can give her food... but give her vegetables. The don't much fat or calories. So she does't gain and perhaps she stops crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But does she like vegetables? I hated them when I was young,\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt Kiekie cares about that. It does't really matter to her as long if you can eat it. That's why we need to keep her away from the fern. Well lets get her some vegetables. I'm ready to try anything to make her stop.\" Nancy said.   </span></div></div>",

Thinking of ways to sneak a few foods to Kiekie was tricky to do as Rebecca didn\u2019t want to defy her mother no that wasn\u2019t her intentions, no in fact it was great that Kiekie was being forced to slim down a bit as Rebecca thought that her sister needed to exercise as it was, throwing her cousin under the bus to be dominated and forced to become nothing more than a piglet was a small price to pay, forced to oink and crawl around the ground like the animal she was supposed to be was going to a shock to the little girl\u2019s system but it seems like Jennifer had Christine somewhat under control and wrapped around her finger. Looking around the table all that was left from the feast that Christine was forced to have were the veggies and there weren\u2019t any calories in them and they were quite healthy for someone who was trying to lose weight so Rebecca thought it might be something that she could use to calm down Kiekie grabbing the bowl and placing them in front of her sister hoping that it would calm her down even if it was just a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we can give her this Nancy\u201d the little girl piqued up showing the only adult that was around as her mother was busy undressing her toy upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy wasn\u2019t even really paying much attention to what was happening around her, a migraine was forming in the woman\u2019s head as there seemed to be no end to the wails from her little ward. Rubbing her temples trying to make the wailing that shook her right to her core, the two girls showed a silver lining through all the crying that Kiekie was mustering on her own, looking at the bowl of Green beans the didn\u2019t look like much just salted and peppered to perfection but anything at this moment looked like it could do the trick to stop the constant wailing that was coming from the little tyke. With no reasoning given to why Nancy would give Kiekie more food when the mother of the child didn\u2019t want her any fatter than she was at this moment as she was clearly fatter three times over than Rebecca and Christine combined, it wasn\u2019t a problem that she was too fat, that was least of the problems they faced the problem was that the Prized piglet that was going to be Christine was far too small for the liking of Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this is better than anything else\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Nancy pushed the Green bean toward Kiekie hoping that this would calm the girl down even if it was just for a little while, anything for just a little peace and quiet was welcomed from what the young woman was having to deal with right now. Not even a second passed from when the bowl was shoved in front of Kiekie and her actually reaching into the bowl to grab whatever the food that was in that bowl was. Slurping up the green beans in quick succession was almost mesmerizing to see, Kiekie was back in heaven with food in her mouth the food she was forced to contend with wasn\u2019t even close to enough to what the black hole of her stomach could originally handle not that she really understood why she was forced to eat so much less she thought that her mother was happy when she ate like the animal Jennifer kept on calling her cousin. These things were mulled over and over in the little girl\u2019s brain as she tried to make sense of them, why was her mother just so adamant about taking away the food that Kiekie once thought was the only thing that made her mother happy seeing her eat. Kiekie didn\u2019t even notice that her dear mother wasn\u2019t even watching her over her it seemed like Nancy saw her more than Jennifer ever did, Kiekie didn\u2019t understand this but she was still happy if she was munching on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that will stop her from wailing as much as she has been\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so Emily I\u2019m not so sure if we can take any more of that wailing it has been hard on all of the use and my mother is too busy to deal with her\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sighed in hopes that this would be the end of the fussing that was created by the youngest of them all, Nancy, Rebecca and Emily could only hope that this would be the end at least for now. While Nancy and the girls were trying to keep Kiekie calm in the dining room from her not so great dinner, Jennifer was making her little slave feel like she was the center of the universe which wasn\u2019t hard to do, to say the least. Kissing every part she could think of Jennifer made Christine giggle with happiness, even being the first time that the blonde headed girl accepted a kiss from her master. Christine wasn\u2019t dumb though she didn\u2019t want to give Jennifer too much to work with the little girl didn\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s piglet, yet she was going to find out that was a position that is easy to get into but hard to get out of. Though they were in a tender moment at the moment Jennifer knew that Christine\u2019s training needed to commence as the young girl still thought of herself as a human being, this was quite the problem as her master knew that this was going to become a problem down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey little piglet I know we are having fun but you need to start acting like a proper piglet, but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll teach you\u201d Jennifer happily stated as she helped her little slave on to the rugged floor. Thinking of what she should start with first either how to oink like a piglet or crawl like the sub-human she was Jennifer decided on \u2026</span></div></div>",

But since our legs are longer then our arms it would be a bit difficult so lets say on  hands and knees. Crawling. Just like babies do. Or piglets. Like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer did't had a clue where her master was talking about. It was clear that she wanted her something to do but she did't had a clue what exactly. She did want to make her master happy but how could she if she did't knew what she was supposed to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just on your hands and knees. Come on just like me. You can do it. I know you can.\" Jenifer said while she crawled around Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was a bit disappointed that Christine did't seem to know what to do. The she grabbed Christine and put her on her belly. The grabbed her around her middle a lifted that of the ground a bit and slowly put her down. Now she was in crawl position. Jennifer walked to a corner of the room and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here Christine crawl over to you master like a piglet. On four paws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine still was't 100% sure what her master wanted. But she put her in crawl position and now asked her to come over to her so she probably wanted her to crawl over to her... then it hit her. Crawling on four. Just like animals. Just like... a piglet. Now she understood what her master wanted. That she acted like a piglet. And why not? Crawling was easy. Fast she crawled over to Jennifer. She noticed crawling was harder with all those extra pounds on her. Jennifer looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good Christine. Come over to your master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time Christine finally reached her master who picked her up cheering for her piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Christine. Just like a real piglet. But now you need to become fatter. Soon your belly will touch the floor when you crawl. That's our goal for now. That you need to drag your belly over the floor when you crawl. How does that sound. I also want you to oink but I guess we can do that another rime. Let's go back to your cousins and my daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up Christine what was getting harder since Christine was getting pretty heavy. When she got downstairs she noticed Kiekie stuffing something in her mouth barely chewing it and swallowing it. The she saw the empty bowl between Kiekie fat thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been doing? I thought I made it clear that Kiekie is on a diet!\" She said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom. We only fed her some beans. They don't have much calories. Really mom we had to do something. Kiekie was crying non stop. She\u2026 she\u2026 the only thing that will make her stop crying is food. I know she's on a diet but we did't knew what to do.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie is so fat. She used to eat as much like elephant.  And now you're giving her portions of a mouse. She's just hungry. She wants more food. That's why she's crying.\" Emily said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to make Kiekie stop crying is by feeding her. That's all she want. I understand you want Christine to be the fattest but I can't stand that crying anymore.\" Nancy said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom if you want to fatten us well we're fine with that\u2026 more or less. That you put Kiekie on a diet we're fine with that\u2026 But we can't deal with the crying  twenty-four-seven.\" Rebecca said. <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer had a sly idea roaming around in her head, her daughter Kiekie being who she is wasn\u2019t going to just stop wailing like a siren if they just asked her nicely, she was an eating machine and being compassionate wasn\u2019t something that would ever work like it was intended to work on Kiekie as being a baby thinking that she would think that eating so much was wrong just for now was something that the girl wouldn\u2019t understand, after being praised for a few months for doing the same exact thing she was now being shunned for doing. There was also the problem that was Christine, first of all, she wasn\u2019t really understanding What Jennifer was getting at when it came to making Christine into her piglet and all something just wasn\u2019t clicking for the little girl to really get what her master wanted. Jennifer needed to change both of these aspects as soon as she could as none of the other family members really wanted to hear a baby wailing all the time or have to remind Christine that she is a piglet and isn\u2019t allowed on two legs when at home, both girls needed to be trained as soon as possible. Smiling at all the other people in the room Jennifer began to formulate quite the ingenious plan in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea that will let us kill two birds with one stone, if we train both Christine and Kiekie at the same time then we will gain one piglet and a baby that will stop wailing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwait so you think the best thing to do is to lump Christine and Kiekie together in a single and really train them both, one to stop begging and wailing for food while the other is forced to become nothing but an oinking piglet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Nancy you don\u2019t see if we just train them both then we can do it much faster than if we separated them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was quite befuddled with the exclamations that her friend was making although if she really thought about it though it did make some sense in a sick and twisted way. Kiekie didn\u2019t really understand what the two adults were talking about as none of it really made any sense to her all Kiekie knew was the once full bowl of green beans that she was given was now gone and that made her quite unhappy. Nancy looked at the girl as it seemed she was raring up to let out another wail of discomfort, feeling like her stomach was going to eat itself Kiekie didn\u2019t know why she had to feel like this and why unlike before her mother nor Nancy was going to help her sate this massive hunger that she had. Kiekie looked around the room looking for something else to eat but nothing looked too appetizing to the girl, focusing on Christine, she could see that the girl was crawling around bloated from her overfeeding that she was getting from Kiekie\u2019s mother, Jealous of how much Christine got to eat all by herself. Kiekie didn\u2019t get it why did Christine get to eat so much but not her, this infuriated her to no end it just didn\u2019t make any sense especially when Kiekie looked at the little girl who was about three times smaller than what the blob of a baby had on her own so why did she get all the delicious food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you sure we can train them both at the same time, Jennifer, from what you were saying it seemed you had enough a hard time to train Christine do you think that using all of us will make it easier for Christine and Kiekie to understand what w want them to do?\u201d Nancy was quite unsure about this, not knowing how they were going to train two unruly children at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca both were beaming with pride spoke to Jennifer and Nancy in unison. \u201cWe can help with Kiekie if that will stop the crying so loudly.\u201d Both girls nodding pleased with their plan to help out, thinking that the plan was foolproof and that if it even meant forcing Christine to become a piglet then it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both were happy to help with Kiekie even if Kiekie herself didn\u2019t like what was going to be happening to her and her being no longer a blob of her former self, Nancy did like the idea of having some little helpers on the project it would make taming these girls so much easier than it would be if it was just the two of them alone with Christine and Kiekie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you girls can help but there have to be some ground rules so you girls get to know the basics to say the least. one, you're not allowed to let Kiekie sneak any snacks or feedings aside from what we give her no matter how much she cries the same goes for Christine just reversed, two, Christine is no longer allowed to walk she is going to be made to crawl and oink like a good piglet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer made it quite clear that these rules are set in stone and shouldn\u2019t be cross unless the two lovers wanted to feel the wrath that was Jennifer\u2019s scorn it, intently both girls not wanting to to do something wrong and be punished for it, to begin with, they did feel bad though making Christine learn that she isn\u2019t a human anymore but a pet wasn\u2019t what they thought they would be doing in terms of helping. It was bad enough that Jennifer had a fascination with Christine to begin with now she was making sure that Christine learned her place as nothing more than a sow to be fattened for the pleasure of Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who should should go with who\" Nancy asked not knowing how effective this is going to be to begin with, looking at both girls hoping that this will stop Kiekie from crying and will make Christine learn that she is a piglet and she doesn't need to walk or talk any more simple words is all she needs.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure she can eat more.\" Jennifer said and walked to the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the cupboard but then heard somebody else enter the kitchen. She looked up disturbed and then saw it was Emily. She walked in smiling. She walked over to Jennifer and smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a better idea. Wanna hear it?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for answer Emily looked for a bowl. She walked straight to the refrigerator and took out two sticks of butter. She put them in the bowl and in the microwave. After that she walked over to the freezer and took a gallon of ice cream. She looked in the cupboard and took a bag of sugar and a few bars of chocolate. She broke the chocolate bars in pieces and put them in a cutter (for those who don't know what a cutter is, it's a machine with inside two blades that turn around incredibly fast and can cut any kind of food in tiny pieces). She was careful enough to not cut them so much that it was powder but still tiny pieces. She also put the ice cream in the microwave for not too long so it melted a bit. The she mixed the butter with the ice cream chocolate and the sugar. Making a mixture bursting with calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at what Emily was doing and was impressed. 'That girl is a genius.' she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily saw Jennifer looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked. \"I'm in love with Rebecca. I love her and not Kiekie or Christine, don't worry. You can have Christine like you loving piglet. But even while I'm in love with Rebecca I still like fattening others. I also like fattening Rebecca but I only do it when she likes it. But I know somethings about fattening people up. If this mixture don't fattens Christine up... I don't know what will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled. That Emily liked fattening up Rebecca was no problem she was fine with Rebecca gaining some weight as long if she did't became fatter them Christine. But she did''t think that was going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Lets train the two of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked over to Christine. She was crawling around like a cute little piggy. Jennifer came standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a cute piglet. What do little piggies say?\" Jennifer asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... oink! Oink!\" Christine tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good piggy. For that you get a tasty treat.\" Jennifer said and put the bowl in front of Christine. Christine looked in the bowl. She smelled the stuff and must admit it did looked delicious. She was a real sweet tooth and this looked so tempting. She wanted to put her finger in but remembered she had to act like a piggy. So she put her head for over into the bowl and took a lick. It was like a explosion of taste at her tongue. It tasted terrific. Sure she was mostly giving Jennifer a hard time feeding her but this tasted so good. Besides she knew it would make her master happy and started to wolf the mixture down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. It seems like she likes it.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine liked the bowl totally clean and leaned back with a swollen belly. She had been so focused on the taste and eating it she ignored the pain in her belly but now she felt the pain. Partly because her stomach wast done with digesting her former meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh poor Christine. I believe she's in pain. Jennifer why don't you rub her belly to make her feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled at her and leaned down to rub the swollen belly of her piglet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Being punished for her learned gluttony that her master had to force upon the little girl\u2019s psyche, huffing and puffing from her meal the pink outfit her master had placed Christine in had been constricting her stomach the jean shorts she had been wearing for their little outing didn\u2019t have much give to it causing Christine\u2019s stomach having to push against the button. Never had Christine ever felt this before the sensation she was getting of actually being too fat for some clothing being a girl of small size she never really worried about being bigger than her clothes, the mixture she was forced to eat was something doing a number on her body making it harder to breathe as it was yet the mixture was so delicious that it wasn\u2019t like Christine wasn\u2019t addicted to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good piglet, you're doing such a good job, but I think you can eat a little more\u201d Jennifer chuckled grabbing the little bit that was still in the pot Emily had made, placing the mixture into a bottle Jennifer usually used for Kiekie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the ground stroking her stomach trying to relive any kind of pressure it could in a faint hope to make her fullness evaporate with every stroke. Emily didn\u2019t know if she did the right thing creating this concoction of her, knowing how Jennifer was around Christine Emily already knew that she would be made to make more of it to be forced into Christine. Emily did feel bad for Christine as anyone would feel bad, being forced to become nothing but a pet to Jennifer was quite strange to Emily, to say the least as she thought that love was what was needed for a relationship. Seeing Jennifer dominating Christine was quite different from Emily\u2019s approach when it came to Rebecca. Kneeling right next to the Christine, feeling every new curve that the little girl would have picked up due to eating an immense amount of food thanks to Emily\u2019s and Jennifer\u2019s combined thoughts on how to deal with the thin girl. Emily didn\u2019t know how she felt about seeing Christine forced to act like a piglet, forced to oink and eat from a doggy bowl, it was just so strange that she didn\u2019t know why Jennifer a person who claims to love Christine would do this to the girl? These thoughts were mulled in Emily\u2019s head over and over again but she didn\u2019t know what to do about it as it wasn\u2019t any of her business in terms of what Jennifer thought as love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think she can eat anymore I mean that was a lot of the mixture that she ingested before? Emily sighed worriedly that Christine would throw up with all the food she just had to ingest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Emily, this piglet may be small but she can eat a lot and if she doesn\u2019t she knows that there would be punished if she doesn\u2019t, she will eat it and keep it in as the piglet knows her place\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer chuckled grabbing the bottle or mixture with one hand before helping herself, kneeling to where Christine was rubbing her stomach trying to get rid of the lump that was her stomach, she never had eaten so much before that wasn\u2019t by force it was definitively a new experience for Christine, to say the least. Christine didn\u2019t get what this feeling was it wasn\u2019t excitement more like the little girl was content on what she was. Jennifer finally laying down with Christine, spooning with the little girl the exhausted little girl feeling sleepy thanks to the comforting area she found herself in. Jennifer, on the other hand, was excited to see what would become of Christine, thinking of all the things that she will do to Christine, not like it mattered her pet wasn\u2019t exactly human was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for Dessert little piglet you did a good job with the first half but you have to finish the rest, We will get it into you with or without your help\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNo, too full\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine meekly responded this was all she could do to stop from the onslaught her poor stomach was about to go through was to shake her head violently rubbing her bloated stomach as a way to protect herself. Jennifer didn\u2019t take too kindly to Jennifer for using human speech so freely and for her to only deny her master from what Jennifer deemed to be a good amount of food for her body, crawling on top of the child making sure Christine didn\u2019t have anywhere she could escape to, intently looking into her eyes, smile on face as Jennifer cooed Christine. Shoving the bottle to Christine\u2019s lips no disregard for what she heard all Jennifer wanted was to feed Christine so much that she would think that she was going to explode from all the deliciousness. Forced to chug down the sickly sweet concoction that Emily had made wasn\u2019t so bad, but the force she felt coming from her stomach as she was just about to purge herself from all the food was what made it the worst. Knowing that if she did throw up then Christine would be forced to eat by force again. Sobbing throughout the experience the melted butter and chocolate batter sloshed from the bottle to her stomach choking on it once and a while she tried to hold back the tears of her expanding stomach. Her my little pony shirt almost skin tight against her chubby stomach, her stomach trying to escape the steely hold her shorts button on her. Christine herself wonders how her life became this, being the pet of her aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, on the other hand, didn't know what to do as Jennifer forced more and more of the liquid past the lips of Christine the little girl was frozen not knowing if she should help Christine. Christine sobbing throughout the situation her master had but her in feeling like she would throw up with more chocolate and butter liquid forced through her tiny body. Seeing Jennifer's brutal methods made Emily think about what she had done making this new food that was made to combat Christine's hyperactive metabolism. She didn\u2019t know if what she did was the right thing as she knew that Christine would become the biggest sow anyone had ever seen, but seeing Jennifer force the liquid down Christine\u2019s throat affected Emily. Intrigued by the methods that Jennifer was using in Christine, knowing that she would never do something like this on Rebecca but Emily did see the benefit of it. Her conscious made her not look away, the little blonde girl didn\u2019t know what to do with herself, Jennifer knelt on the little girl\u2019s wrist not enough to hurt Christine but enough to make it so she couldn\u2019t escape easily. The bottle shove into her gullet, her cries for Jennifer to stop and her struggles were all in vain as every last drop of the mixture was going to get into Christine no matter what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this I mean it looks like she isn\u2019t going to like it, Miss Jennifer we shouldn\u2019t force her so much I don\u2019t think\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Emily your so Naive she won\u2019t learn that she is mine if we just allow her to eat when she decides too, you must know that this girl is a going to be the fattest sow you will ever see\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wasn\u2019t easy on Christine, not knowing why this was happening all Christine thought of doing was to sob to her self, trying to mouth words as the last of the once delicious meal slithered into her stomach making it quite uncomfortable to breathe, Looking at her master for help was no use, she knew that Jennifer was doing this to her making her into a piglet was her masters only wish and Christine was only there to serve her master this was something she didn\u2019t quite understand, having some fight in her she wasn\u2019t going to break but she does need to learn that she is Jennifer\u2019s toy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days passed and Christine was fed more and more. Jennifer had learned from Emily. She now fed Christine food that was bursting with calories. She bough a lot of liquid butter and put that in all her food. Chocolate and ice cream were also things she was fed a lot. Jennifer also looked at the computer about weight gain and found some weight gain powder and bought that right away and mixed it with Christine's food. <br>\r\nJennifer looked smiling at her little piglet who was rubbing her swollen belly. The mixture of Emily did clearly had effect on Christine's body. She Obvious gained a lot of weight, and on her small frame it clearly showed. Her cheeks were now more pink and puffy. Her gained all over her body. Her arms got fatter just like her legs, thighs, butt even her chest but her belly took most of the weight. Every day Emily was fed more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily often visited to be with Rebecca of course. Just like now they were on her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Rebecca,\" Emily said lying on Rebecca's bed. \"You know that. But I know Jennifer loves Christine... even while the difference in age is a large gap. But I saw her when she fed Christine... I mean it did't looked like love to me. I might be pretty young and I still need to learn a lot but the things Jennifer does to you cousin\u2026 I would never do those things to you. If that's love I don't want to have anything to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's just what you like,\" Rebecca said calmly. \"Like you know those twins right. One wears red shirts the other blue shirts. One has red bands in her hair the other blue. Even their braces are red and blue! Which color looks better at them? Well that's up to them. What they like. Just like you like me fat. But that twig girl Pricilla down the lane\u2026 well she sees fat or getting fatter like a sin. Something terrible. So she only likes skinny people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you're saying. I like how you look but somebody else might dislike it. But what does that have to do with what Jennifer does to Christine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's the same. Everything likes something else to do with his partner. Just like we two have the feeding. We both like doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point. We both like doing that. Forcing that stuff down Christine's throat. Well perhaps Jennifer likes it. But I'm pretty sure Christine does't like it. It seems like she's stuffing a turkey for thanksgiving. I would't do that to you\u2026 Well unless you would like that. Then I might\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I have rather you don't. I like it when you feed me but I rather don't have food forced down my throat. About my mom and Christine... well you might be right. It could be my mother likes it and Christine does't\u2026 but what can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much I guess. No one is listening to young kids. By the way how is it going with Kiekie's training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so good. I think she did't gain any weight. She might even have lost a bit but still she's very fat, and very hungry. Especially when she sees Christine getting stuffed. Yesterday she came to close to the plants and ate a fern. Leafs and in dirt covered roots. All of it. Can you believe that? It's true. She keeps crying and whining for food. I tried to train her. I really did but it is't really working. I mean if you're addicted to something, you don't need drugs, or alcohol, or cigarette's, In the start it might feel weird and all but after some time your body gets used to it. Then it's not so hard... but with food... You need that every day to survive. So she still gets food because she needs it but she stays hungry. Well you know she's a bottomless pit. Well we keep trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it you have someone who's addicted to smoking and he does't do it for sometimes and as reward he or she may smoke again\u2026 well... that way it's hard to stay on the right path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're right. However Christine really did fatten up. So it seems like my mother is getting what she wanted. A obese cousin that is her lover. It's clear she wants Christine to be a massive sow\u2026 but does she want with Kiekie? Or me? She did try to fatten me... but that was before Christine came in our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she came in your lives?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh her parents went on vacation. My mother was asked to look after her. But they died and she adopted her. I wonder what her parents would have done if they knew this would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go downstairs. Maybe I can help train Kiekie.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were able to let Christine gain, perhaps you can let Kiekie lose weight. You can try. Can't hurt right.\"      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily and Rebecca still didn\u2019t quite understand the reasoning that Jennifer had for fattening up all the girls, as they were still trying to find out the reason she loved Christine the way she did the massive age gap between them this was the first question that popped into their little heads, to begin with. Something that did stand out, was it seemed like Jennifer didn\u2019t love Christine for her mind that was obvious, it was more like Jennifer only like the girl for her body. The plush cheek and pink jowls of Christine wasn't the only thing that Jennifer wanted to explore when it came to Christine, but there was no need to know what thoughts or dreams ran through Christine's head they were inconsequential to Jennifer. Hands clasped together, the two five-year-old began their descent to the basement, while a wailing blob was laid to rest here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian of Kiekie accepted that there was no reason to try to control the sobbing that came out of Kiekie, it was just something that the little girl was going to do no matter what. There was more to it though, it wasn't that Nancy didn't care to know what it was, the woman just had enough of the sobbing to numb her to it. Kiekie being forced into the box that was her diet didn\u2019t do anything to brighten the mood of the baby, she didn\u2019t know, why she was punished for being a glutton when her mother forced her cousin to become the same thing that she was being ostracized for. Looking into the basement Rebecca's and Emily's gazes were met with the playroom that Rebecca played in with Emily so many times before. The carpeted living room was always welcomed to their soft bottoms, Nancy didn\u2019t even hear them enter being too caught up in trying to stop the crying child from wailing. Nothing mattered to Nancy, it had been about a few weeks since the diet had been implemented on Kiekie and she needed some break from the sobbing and fits of sadness that the baby had. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMiss Nancy is Kiekie doing okay, I hope that Fern is doing okay since she ate a piece of it\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh it will do just fine Rebecca, I see Emily had come to see the little wailer too, well she is slimming up but it's kind of hard to concentrate sorry to say\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nDefeated in the sensibility section of her mind, Nancy just wanted Christine to be fatter than Kiekie already so that she can feed the little glutton like normal once again. Seeing that Kiekie was trying to fit anything into her mouth made tested the reflexes of Nancy and her own sanity when it came to caring for the little tot, Emily couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing when it came to Kiekie, tears seemed to always flow from Kiekie\u2019s cheeks when there wasn\u2019t any food that she could eat, her mouth always seemed to be empty. The scene was quite different from what Emily had just seen when watching Christine and helping Jennifer train the piglet to her destiny of being the fattest sow that anyone had seen before, plates scattered about food containers stacked from the month that had elapsed from Christine\u2019s new training. Compared to the neat and clean scene that was the basement it was a shock to the system nothing that looked to contain food was around there was nothing that even looked like it once had food in it around Kiekie and Nancy all there was to indicate that there was some food that the baby had might eaten was a small plate. Half-eaten veggies on the plate one after the other a small chomp was taken out of them but not fully devoured, looking around the room for anything that looked like food was pointless, the once gluttonous Kiekie was now forced to eat nothing but veggies until Christine outweighs her. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a little more depressing than I thought, I mean she doesn\u2019t seem to be eating anything\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI know Emily it has been a little saddening, to say the least, seeing little Kiekie like this all she does is cry for a month now all she does is sob she has become numb to tears rolling down her face, but so has Nancy to her wails too\u201d Rebecca presenting Nancy like she was apart of a show or something waving her hand to the adult who catered to Kiekie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the couch not really moving too much almost dead to the world due to her feedings with Kiekie, sipping coffee like nothing was wrong with a child who sobs about having to lose weight, Emily could feel the difference in the atmosphere from the loving aura that Jennifer had to Nancy who had to no love for what she was doing to Kiekie she just wanted to feed the girl that is what she was employed by Jennifer to do and she enjoyed her work, it wasn\u2019t like it was her fault that Kiekie was a born gainer and Christine had a metabolism of a squirrel. Kiekie knew though there wasn\u2019t any food that if she cried she was bound to get some, though her thinking process was quite flawed Kiekie really didn\u2019t realize how flawed it really was. Sneaking in wasn\u2019t much of a use, to say the least, not wanting to really disturb Nancy they the two lovers crawled over to Kiekie who finally begun to quiet down from her temper tantrum when seeing the two girls nearing her she was always happy when she saw Emily and Rebecca. Giggling and bouncing around from her place, her fat wobbling in tandem with her body, looking more like pudding than a child it wouldn\u2019t be easy to spot to someone who hasn\u2019t spent their time looking and feeling up every inch of Kiekie for about a month but it was quite obvious that Kiekie was much thinner than she was at least twenty pounds lighter than she once was. Living on nothing more than Veggies would do that to a girl, the only saving grace Emily could think of in this kind of situation was at least Kiekie wasn\u2019t like Christine and still considered human by her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now Kiekie don't fret big sister is here I know it's hard for you to see me and Christine eating yummy stuff and you only get greens but don\u2019t worry it's not forever it's only until the piglet\u2026 I mean Christine is bigger than you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay Rebecca remember what your mom told us, Christine isn\u2019t a human being any more we don\u2019t need to call her by her name when we are here\u201d Emily reassured Rebecca that she was fine to call Christine piglet, pushing away Rebecca\u2019s long red hair to kiss her cheek. Though Emily was correct in this it didn\u2019t make it any less weird to think that Christine was considered a pet not a human anymore, she didn\u2019t understand how her mother thought that it was okay to think of your lover as not your equal but is just a mere pet for you to do with what you wish. This was love that Rebecca need to know more of and what better place to find out what her mother though than the source. Emily, on the other hand, was a little enthralled by Kiekie playing with the little girl the only way Emily knew how to play with babies, shaking something shiny in front of Kiekie to calm her down, Emily didn\u2019 know how to train Kiekie to remember that she can\u2019t cry for not getting food as the girl still needed food to survive, this was going to be a challenge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be honest I never was a big fan of veggies myself, and I still don't really like them.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's all that Kiekie is allowed to eat. She needs to lose weight and my cousin needs to be a fat sow. My mother is dominating her. But at the same time she says she loves her. I don't get that while I do understand love. I mean I know it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But I will never try to force you to eat or force you to act like a piggy. Well unless you want to of course. Anything what will make you happy. But if I look at your mother and her piglet... if that's love... well it's nothing like I thought it would be. It does't seem like much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fully agree. I rather kiss and cuddle you, or being fed by you. I love you in a different way then how my mother loves her piglet. Look there's the piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine laid back and belched loudly rubbing her swollen belly. Emily's plan had worked. I was't only important how much a person ate but how many calories were in the food. Together with the weight gain powder mixed in every meal Christine had gained a lot of weight. She was fed every day to the point of bursting. She did't walked or even stand. She needed to walk on hands and knees like a piggy and was only allowed to say: \"Oink!\"<br>\r\nThe girl just did't know what else to do. Her parents were gone. She realized that now. Jennifer was her master now. She had full control over her and she wanted her to be a piggy. She noticed she put on a lot of weight lately. She did't cared so much while Jennifer was very happy with every pound she gained. The thing that she did't liked that she was fed to the point of bursting. If her master just fed her until she was full she would mind the rest of it. However she noticed that it was harder to move with all her extra pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Christine as well. Emily mumbled. I feel a bit guilty. If I had't told Jennifer how to make...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame yourself. Perhaps you even helped both of them. Christine needs to eat less to gain the same amount of weight from a huge not so fattening meal. The sooner she get's fatter then Kiekie the sooner Kiekie is of the diet. Jennifer would have fattened up Christine anyway and put Kiekie on a diet anyway. I think you helped them. Or at least made it a bit easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rebecca. I did't looked at it that way. So I did a good thing? That does make me feel better. I'm just not sure if Christine thinks at it the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad for her. She needs to be a sow that wins firs place in the weigh in. Kiekie needs to lose weight until she's at least a pound less than Christine and as for me... Hmmm. What does she have in store for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's easy. She wants Christine to be the fattest. After that Nancy s allowed to make Kiekie the second fattest. As for you... well I'm the one fattening you. Lets be honest Rebecca. You're not a thin kid anymore. I don't care and all but I don't see she cares as much about you and Kiekie since you both have a feeder. You have me and Kiekie has Nancy. So she's stuck with Christine. That makes sense. But she wants to be the best feeder in the world and that's why Christine needs to be fattest.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything Emily said did make sense to Rebecca. It was true Emily fed her and if it was't for Emily she probably would have never gained. At least not willingly. And even while she did gain, she gained less then Christine and way less then Kiekie. Even if she lost a good part of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie was still sobbing. She did't wanted to eat. She wanted to really pig out. Stuff her face with everything tasty she could find. She did longer wanted to eat icky greens. She wanted to stuff her face with candy, cake, pie and other sweet stuff. But I seemed like her mother was planning to let her starve.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Talking with Rebecca did make Emily feel a little better about the monster she had unintentionally created in Jennifer, the more Emily did think about piglet\u2019s situation the more it didn\u2019t really matter if Emily did anything or not there wasn\u2019t going to be a happy way that Christine would live and not get stuffed full of food. Seeing the young girl laying on the couch so breathing quite heavily from all the food that was just shoved down her throat without her consent, this was Christine\u2019s life now, she was no longer a human anyway so what did it matter. Emily and Rebecca couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for the little girl she was always made to wear whatever Jennifer fancy that day usually something pink, something that would match the collar that Christine wouldn\u2019t dare to take off from her throat, she was owned by Jennifer Christine had accepted this fact nothing would change this. Christine on the other hand though thought it would bee good for her stomach at least if she wasn\u2019t always fed so much that she felt like she was going to puke, being a plaything for her master wasn\u2019t as bad as she thought it would be, though becoming a piglet was just something that she didn\u2019t want to become, having food shoved into her mouth wasn\u2019t something she enjoyed. Jennifer didn\u2019t really care what her pet wanted or cared about this was just all wanted was Christine to be a piglet and with all that entailed, just thinking about Christine becoming an immovable blob of her former-self for Jennifer to toy with made the woman all hot and bothered. Getting ready for the surprise that she had for the girls, allowing the piglet to join Kiekie and Nancy for the time being as she didn\u2019t need Christine at the moment, applying lipstick to her lips, fixing her dress and even spritzing a little bit of perfume on herself as if she was going to a ball or a date Jennifer was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting everything together in her pocketbook Jennifer made sure she had everything together to greet the others that were in the basement, holding onto RSVP slip in one and her bag in the other, this was a little bonus Jennifer had gotten from her work. Working at home did have the benefits as well as some drawbacks as not being able to take care of her piglet when she is at work but being home all the time was a big plus, to say the least not knowing how she could make her dream a reality if she didn\u2019t work from home. Having Nancy around was a big plus as being somewhat a sitter for the girls and her having the same dream as Jennifer in being surrounded by obese and immobile toddlers. Entering the furnished Basement made everyone look at her, Emily and Rebecca in awe of the gorgeous dress Jennifer was wearing in front of them, Christine worried that she was going to be stuffed more, hoping that she would at least rest the for the remainder of the night and just cuddle with her master instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Miss Jennifer you look so beautiful, what is the special occasion for your dress?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mommy why are you so dressed up are you going somewhere or something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls asked, mouth agape with awe in the beauty of Jennifer they sheepishly looked onto the beauty that was in front of them. Not really knowing why Jennifer was all gussied up for any particular reason, even Nancy wasn\u2019t too sure why Jennifer was dressed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell girls and Nancy I happen to get a reservation for us all with each other's partners in a romantic setting at the restaurant la rose rouge, so girls get dressed in your special dresses and Emily help yourself to one of Rebecca\u2019s old dresses that used to fit her when she wasn\u2019t so pear-shaped\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blushed a bit when hearing about Rebecca\u2019s wide butt, it wasn\u2019t normal of how much of a pear Rebecca truly was some would no kid seat could really fit all of that shapely butt in its contents, Emily loved to watch it sway back and forth as the little girl wobbled toward her next month, not really getting anything on top which was fine with Emily. This was one of the main reasons why Rebecca usually stuck to dresses although she did like pants her thighs and butt didn\u2019t make it an easy feat to wear them like other girls her age, though she really didn\u2019t mind as she loved dresses especially brown ones that since her once favorite hat was that color. Since opening up to Emily she had been wearing less and less it was, having the loving embrace of Emily did make Rebecca want to show her face more and more. Both rushed upstairs to Rebecca\u2019s bedroom to look at the best dresses Rebecca had that still fit the pear girl, meanwhile Kiekie who has since calmed down by being around other people that wasn\u2019t just Nancy had been placed on the stroller as she was still quite heavy for Nancy to coddle as she once did. With everyone getting dressed and ready for dinner at the fanciest restaurant that anyone of them had seen before Jennifer was left to tend to her piglet. Christine was still trying to get over lunch being quite heavy from what she was used to it make her chubby belly hard as a rock still. Her master traveled closer and closer to her, Jennifer noticing that she may have pushed Christine a little too hard today, finding out about how to increase her weight was just such a shock that she didn\u2019t want to waste any time. Christine may be just a toy but she is still Jennifer\u2019s responsibility, sitting on the couch next to the stuffed piglet hoping that Jennifer could do something if anything to alleviate the tossing and turning in her stomach. Reaching down to her plump piglet, lifting the somewhat tight My little pony shirt that Christine loved dearly to reveal the milky white orb that was her stomach. An orb of its former self stuffed to the brim with all manner of foods, mostly sweets were contained inside that and gainer mix, being versatile enough to be placed in almost anything Jennifer added it to the sweets she prepared for Christine to devour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I'm feeding you I just use all the room you have. But I need to stretch it a bit. If you eat a bit more after you're full your stomach get stretched. Then it will be able to hold more food next time. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked with big eyes at Jennifer. Her young mind was working hard to understand what was just said to her. It did make sense and she realized it was true. Sure Jennifer fed her to her bursting point every time. But she was able to eat way more food before she was full then before this whole thing started. Just a few jars of baby food would't be enough to satisfy her. She had a big belly that needed to be fed. But not just now.<br>\r\nJenifer slowly pushed on her belly with her warm soft hand and started to rub Christine's belly. Slowly rubbing and massaging it did speed up the girls digesting and she must admit it did feel nice and she soon felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you like that don't you. Maybe I should do that more often. Rubbing your tummy after feeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to tickle and cuddle with Christine. Christine smiled. This were moments she liked to do with her master. Just play and cuddle a bit. She only did't understand why she needed to act like a piggy to her master but she did't worried about it now this was a time to enjoy <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUpstairs Emily and Rebecca were busy looking for dresses. <br>\r\nEmily looked smiling at the dress Rebecca was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks the right size for you. However my butt could easily fit two time in that dress.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah easily. Perhaps even three times.\" Rebecca agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a pear Rebecca. But Don't worry about being a pear. I like pears. I think they taste pretty good. Appele's are... ordinary. You can find them everywhere. Then I rather have a pear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pear. I'm pear shaped,\" Rebecca said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded but was more focused on how Rebecca was pulling trying to get the dress pass her huge butt and she was loving every moment watching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily you need to pick a dress out to!\" Rebecca said. \"Look at the left side of my closet that are dresses I used to wear before I was so pear shaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked for a nice dress but could't help looking  every now and then at Rebecca's butt. Finally she found a nice dress that looked beautiful at her. Before Rebecca started gaining they both had about the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have some of my old clothes. I don't fit them anymore. And I'm sure Kiekie and Christine will never be able to wear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. If your mother keeps stuffing that mixture in Christine's throat she'll need a tent to get dressed. I just wonder what will happen with Kiekie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure. I guess after she's sure that Christine is fatter then her she let her get fat again. Just not fatter then Christine. However if you see how much Kiekie can consume it's maybe wise to make sure Christine is about 100 pounds heavier or else she soon might getting fatter then Christine. However I don't really care. My mother does decide what will happen to those two girls or how fat they will become. As for me, that depends on you. You decide how fat I need to become. But I rather have you fattening me up and feeding me then Nancy or my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that. Lets get downstairs. I think we're about to go.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of the players were ready to leave for Rose Rouge, Emily and Rebecca next to each other, hands clasped in each other a loving couple was a word that could be used to state when it came to the two girls. Emily wore a dark navy blue dress, frilly and cute on her accentuating her slight curves that were only enhanced by her long straight brown hair, Rebecca wore a green dress that complemented her red hair which only caused the pear-shaped girl to look more gorgeous than originally thought, although the dress didn\u2019t quite fit her the way she thought it would bunching up a little around her butt area as it couldn\u2019t drop down if it was on someone of normal size it would have just fallen with little to no effort but that would only be normal on a slimmer girl. Going downstairs Emily and Rebecca gathered at the front door unable to wait for their first real date as a couple it was something that Emily\u2019s mother said was the key factor for deciding to marry her husband so Emily thought it was an essential part of moving forward with Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down from Rebecca\u2019s room both girls had seen that not everyone was at the door ready to leave for the restaurant the only other two who were at the door and dressed was Kiekie and Nancy, Kiekie not in anything too fancy not like Nancy who wore a red strapless dress that was one of Jennifer\u2019s old dresses that she could be used for tonight. Kiekie who finally calmed down from her wailing was contently waiting in the stroller, she was still quite heavy for Nancy herself to life the blob of a girl alone. Kiekie on the other was just wearing a floral dress that was originally meant for Rebecca last year, sunflowers on the front and a light blue scheme to the whole thing, it was a good thing that Kiekie was losing weight so she could fit into the dress that was meant for a five-year-old. Nancy though seemed to be quite impatient to leave as she already knew that she was going to be in charge of Kiekie and wasn\u2019t looking forward to hauling the pig to and fro from her car seat, not that Kiekie like it any more than Nancy did as the car-seat that once kept her safe, dug into her flab on each side making it uncomfortable for Kiekie to ride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is your mother Rebecca I thought she was with you, if she doesn\u2019t hurry up we are going to be late\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know I think she was getting Christine ready, she was looking a little sick so maybe it took mom a little bit longer to get her ready\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Rebecca could do is shrug off Nancy\u2019s questions, as she herself didn\u2019t know the answers to the questions she was being asked as she wasn\u2019t anywhere near her mother to know what she was doing to give Nancy a definite answer on her whereabout, Rebecca herself was in the dark on where Jennifer was. Sitting down on the bench next to the door Emily and Rebecca became increasingly enthralled with each other to really care where Jennifer and Christine were, most likely the two of them were in Christine\u2019s large room, either getting ready for the fancy dinner that was planned or knowing how Jennifer is she maybe documenting Christine\u2019s growth. Being a natural occurrence for Jennifer not wanting to miss any part of Christine\u2019s growths thinking it would be best to videotape and photograph each part of the girl\u2019s supple body. The footsteps of her mother could be heard, clack of a heel on the wooden kitchen came closer and closer to them, the jingle of a chain reverberate with each step that Jennifer took. Nancy sighed a breath of relief knowing that her friend was here and they could go soon, coming into view was Jennifer wearing the dress that she had worn when they were told about their little reservation to rose rouge still looked as beautiful as Rebecca and Emily remember. Jennifer and Christine had finally arrived at the front door with all the others, Keys in hand and ready to go, Jennifer, was excited to have a proper date with Christine, it was fun to bum around the house but she didn\u2019t think that her little piglet had ever been truly spoiled by someone who loves her. Christine\u2019s collar was made to match the dress her master had picked out for her, pink in design almost like a fairy princess aesthetic to it, Jennifer was quite prepared for this date as even the leash that connected to Christine\u2019s collar she was forced to wear as she wasn\u2019t a girl anymore but a piglet was also pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then is everyone ready, sorry Christine was being a little fussy when it came to getting the dress over her collar and finding the leash I just bought for it, doesn\u2019t it look great with her dress\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom don\u2019t you think we will stand out if Christine crawls and oinks at the place, shouldn\u2019t you just carry her\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is right Jennifer we don\u2019t want the piglet to cause a big commotion in public do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rebecca a tinge of embarrassment in her voice scolded her mother for the was she was presenting Christine. Emily and Rebecca didn\u2019t really care what happened to Christine as they had already accepted that she wasn\u2019t a girl anymore but a pet who will become a blob, but they did care about how other people looked at them and Jennifer with her little ticks when it came to Christine didn\u2019t help them when trying to be inconspicuous. Jennifer huffed and puffed not liking that she was being ganged up on by her daughter and her friend at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then let us just go, you guys are no fun, don\u2019t you agree, piglet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coink oink\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about she didn\u2019t see that there was a problem with how Christine was being presented to the world, it wasn\u2019t like she was human anymore so why would people think its wrong for a piglet to be on all fours. Christine didn\u2019t even realize how her mind was being twisted to look at herself as a piglet and not a girl anymore, though it didn\u2019t matter as they were leaving. Christine did know that she was a girl and still human sometimes, but Jennifer slowly was poisoning her mind, thinking of herself as just a plaything for Jennifer was her normal life. Her being a piglet was her life and she began to enjoy her master, not knowing what was so wrong with that, Christine couldn\u2019t comprehend the gravity of her relationship with Jennifer, not that she really much cared to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But that was some time ago before I was so\u2026 pear shaped. When my butt was still able to fit in one chair, and when my thighs were't rubbing when I walked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you pear shape. I like your big butt. I also like your rubbing thighs. I love you. I want to be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too Emily. I'm totally smitten at you. I want to be with you to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh are't they cute Nancy?\" Jennifer asked her friend while she looked at her daughter and girlfriend in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they are. Is't it cute, puppy love? I remember my first love. However my first kiss was't that romantic. I wore braces back then. My boyfriend did too and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess\u2026 Your braces got stuck together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was't a fun trip to the dentist I can tell you that. Good thing those two don't have braces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not at the moment. Jennifer said. But who knows when they get older. A lot of kids get braces these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's true,\" Nancy said and looked at her teeth in the mirror. But I must admit they do work. Look at mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we see what happens. We can't do anything about it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was't really paying attention to what the others said. Just like most toddlers she was busy with herself. She knew she was a girl. However not a human girl. Or was she. Around her cousins and Nancy she sometimes was a human but whenever Jennifer was near she was a piggy. True it was't that hard being a piggy. Just walk around at hands and knees. It was easier then walking sometimes. Especially with all that weight at her belly pulling. Christine did't knew yet that becoming obese would immobile her but even if she did knew she would't mind since she knew there was no way out of it. Her parents were gone and would't come back, her cousins could't help her and Jennifer was now her master and had full power over her. Jennifer was her master, she need to act like a piggy and become the fattest girl in the world. That was all she knew and all the she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie felt miserable. The past time had been the worst week of her entire short life. That she was't allowed to eat. Well Jennifer of course gave her food, but not even near enough to stop her hunger. Those tiny jars of baby food were't enough for her. She wanted to pig out on huge amounts of food. Greasy, fat filled food. But She was aware her mother did't want that. She knew her mother want her to lose weight but she could't really deal with that. Especially not while her cousin got fed until her limit and the some more. Just like her mother thought: Being full is no reason to stop eating. Kiekie would take any chance to get some tasty fatty food in her stomach.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right girls. We're here!\" Jennifer said.  </span></div></div>",

Rebecca and Emily were shocked about how gorgeous the place was, mouths agape not realizing how stunned they looked when peering upon the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on girls, we need to find our seats I hope you two have big appetites as there will be more than enough to sate even Christine\u2019s growing hunger in this place\u201d Jennifer chuckled knowing that neither would willing eat until they would burst, a nice thought that wouldn\u2019t come true with the way that Rebecca is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her mother into the palace hoping to see the decor of Rose Rouge from the inside, Rebecca and Emily couldn\u2019t help but be happy to be in such a lavished place made them both just think of themselves princesses. Nancy, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t feeling any of these thought of superiority when entering the front doors of Rose Rouge having to cart around the little glutton around all the time did have an effect on Nancy and her thoughts of grandeur, feeling more like an added extra to the group and not really there on her own volition, though it wasn\u2019t like helping Jennifer force-feed Christine and Kiekie didn\u2019t have their perks, having her housing and Meals always taken care of was great, and having the choice of going on trips like the one she was just on did make her choice to stick around that much more easier than originally thought. Nancy like anyone in her situation though always did think that with Emily\u2019s mother always around dropping her daughter off and chatting with Jennifer that their dark secret of loving little girls and fattening them to blobs would be ousted by Emily, Nancy didn\u2019t know how the little girl stayed quiet for so long about what was happening to the piglet. The more Nancy thought about it though it didn\u2019t make any sense Emily wasn\u2019t one who was known for keeping secrets why didn\u2019t Emily\u2019s mother ever jump in to stop what she suspected of what was happening at the house, Nancy needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNancy are you okay the waiter has gotten our seats, come one bring the little glutton around they are getting a high chair ready for Kiekie, I just hope it's wide enough\u201d Jennifer was worried it was plastered upon her face, though she really didn\u2019t care what people thought it still was something that made her cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course, sorry was just thinking of stuff I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a problem I mean look at this place this place has everything, isn\u2019t that right girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah mom don\u2019t worry there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t do so what if Kiekie and piglet are just a little wider girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca\u2019s right Piglet will be full tonight and will need your loving, so don\u2019t worry miss Jennifer\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking ton Emily and Rebecca for reassurance was a bit of a low blow even for Nancy but she hoped it worked to rest Jennifer\u2019s mind. The fussy glutton didn\u2019t want anything to do with the conversation that was started by Nancy already Kiekie\u2019s stomach felt like it was eating itself, hoping to herself that she wasn\u2019t going to to be forced to eat greens in this fancy place as well. Using all her strength to lift the hundred-pound baby was was a sight to see, lift Kiekie caused the girls girth to wobble and shake with each heave from Nancy an ocean of flub for all to see and admire, the modest dress that Kiekie was forced to wear didn\u2019t do anything to hide how large the girl was, her diaper itself was cutting into her chubby legs itself not to mention a dress that was made for someone around Christine\u2019s age didn\u2019t even come close to covering her stomach it was a sight to behold. The surrounding guest took a moment to watch Nancy flail in place trying to shift Kiekie to the highchair that was brought for the baby, even Jennifer who was so very close to her piglet, with Christine held into Jennifer\u2019s arms didn\u2019t even realize where Christine was as she looks onto her youngest daughter. The shifting flab made Jennifer shiver with lust looking on it hoping that Christine will be so fat that she would look as good a Kiekie was at this moment, absorbed by looking at Kiekie with such loving eyes Jennifer didn\u2019t make any hesitation to grab a handful of Kiekie\u2019s blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my looks like piglet has some much needed catching up to do, look at this she really is a gainer only losing about twenty pounds and she is still a glutton, not even this dress could cover up all her flabbiness\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer chuckled patting Kiekie\u2019s stomach before getting back to her preparations, everyone who was in Rose Rouge kept an eye on the strange group that had just come in. Looking like a bit of some country bumpkins wasn\u2019t the worse thing it was the obese children that were tagging along with the women who might be the parents of them. Rebecca and Emily to their seats right next to the growing piglet that was Christine, wanting to keep an eye on Jennifer for themselves as Jennifer did get a little overzealous when it came to feeding her piglet. The mood was perfect and both girls were ready for a great date at this fancy place, coming overseeing his new guests gave the poor waiter a little bit of shock to say the least, never did he see such a mismatch of lovers in his life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I believe normally boys invite girls on dates and they need to pay. But since we're both girls I'm not sure who should pay if we went on a date together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would't worry about that to much. I mean we're not even allowed to go away to eat some where on our own, and even if we did we don't have enough money. We can decide that later. We have about eight years at least before we can go on a date just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In eight years.

Kiekie is allowed to have a normal dinner with us. But not an all you can eat! Else she eats this entire place out of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at Kiekie. She seemed a bit more happy. At least she was't crying or sobbing. That was good. At least she would get more food then normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have melon, tomato soup, oh look here. A shrimp cocktail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I want that!\" Rebecca yelled, she ate shrimp cocktail a few times before and loved it.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"You know what I try that too,\" Emily said. \"I never had it before but my mom says you always need to try something new. Besides I'm curious what Rebecca likes. Besides if I don't like it I feed it to Rebecca.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled hearing that since she really did like shrimps. But soon she started thinking about the question Emily asked her earlier. Where did she see herself after eight years. Perhaps she had gotten so fat she could't stand. Maybe her butt would be so large it would't fit through the door. So much for going out. She wanted to get fat for Emily and she must admit she even enjoyed it. But how fat did she wanna get. She did't knew and started to get worried since she did't thought about it. She was glad her mom asked Emily and her what they wanted for appetizers at the right moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nancy wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying attention either as she was quite swamped with keeping Kiekie on a short rope, knowing how she is with food around there was always the possibility that she would try to grab at anything around her which was something that Nancy was going to have to combat this Kiekie being who she is, as the piglet who was Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it easy for Nancy as she gained quite little from time to time. from her long blond hair and very pale skin, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any doubt why Christine was Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite she looked like a little angel who needed to be turned into a blob of her former self which in its self wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be easy, Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darkest desires were going to shove on the shoulders of this two-year-old even if Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking over to Christine Jennifer couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but gush about her piglet, the thoughts of what she wanted to do with Christine had always made Jennifer lose a little bit of her composure, to say the least as her lust always overwhelmed her wanting nothing more than to strip Christine down right now and kiss her little piglet everywhere her lips could and feel the plushness of her growing flesh. Spiraling out of control as she looking at Christine, Jennifer panting quite heavily as the blood rushed to her face in her own perverse thoughts didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to look around the room, the other patrons, some were disgusted with what they were seeing a grown woman in a lust frenzy fawning over what looked like a fat toddler wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that they were looking forward to when booking a reservation to this establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With orders already placed and all the pairs were just waiting for it to arrive there was time for some small talk, though none of them were great at it Jennifer thought it would be best to at least try, Nancy did have other plans when it came to this little dinner ritual that she was forced to be apart of, already her psyche was stretched thin thanks to the little glutton that was in her high chair, that was here nor there Nancy needed to know what angle Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother was playing as there was no way Emily could keep quiet for so long about what was happening at Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house no matter how much she claimed to love Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start then, how are you and Rebecca getting along Emily still think my daughter is the one for you\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer chuckled patting Rebecca on the head who herself had a massive grin upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009coh yes most definitely miss Jennifer, I love everything about her I just hope she thinks the same as me, I would love to feed her more and more that is my desire\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adamant with her choice of words Emily was proud with her exclamations, professing her love for Rebecca and her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how she felt about this as on one hand she was grateful for Emily loving her even when her butt usually takes up two of her kid chairs at home, her butt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be slowing down at all with each pound the little girl gains her butt gains another inch, not knowing if her growths would ever stop was something that did concern Rebecca but at the same token it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as scary as it was first to her, with Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lust for her growing body always made Rebecca smiled, to say the least, it was always a good feeling to have someone want her in that way. Though Rebecca did care for Emily in the same way that Emily did, there was something that did nag at Rebecca, when will she be big enough to satisfy the lust that Emily had for her. Emily did like massive girls but will there ever be a point to end Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing an then they can be proper lovers, what size would that be and would she still want to be mobile by that point or go beyond. Inside her own headspace, Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice the other people looking on more intently at them and her mother being lovey-dovey with Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s they seemed to be angry at something but Rebecca didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it could be she had some ideas but something told her it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something she had foreseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince we are making small talk as it was then I must ask, Emily how did your mother react to when you spoke to her about our little piglet here\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grabbing a handful of flesh from under Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dress, Nancy not taking her eyes off of Emily while fondling Christine. Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes shifted all over the place not wanting to make eye contact with Nancy who seemed to be on a warpath to protect the harem from outside forces. As things got more and more intense between both Nancy and Emily they both didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that the waiter had finally come back from the kitchen the multiple appetizers finally made in the direct specifics that all they made, needing a trolly to bring them the man didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even lookup. Not wanting to be apart of the conversation that this weird family was getting into the waiter thought it would be just better to plop the food down to calm everyone down, multiple trays of foods littered the table, from the jumbo shrimp that Rebecca wanted to an enchilada that nancy thought looked the less fattening all in multiple orders of. With everything set on the table and ready to be eaten and Neither Emily nor Nancy breaking they decided to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..</span></div></div>",

She really wanted to know how much Emily had told. Well the dinner was't over. Now she first needed to feed Kiekie. That would't be hard. Kiekie was a hungry kid and did't had anything to eat the past days except vegetables. She craved for real food. Meat, fish, grains, fat, sugar. She wanted it all in her belly. Did't matter how it looked like. As long if it were't vegetables.<br>\r\nEmily slowly took her first bite of shrimps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Emily?\" Rebecca asked curious licking her lips. \"What do you think about shrimps?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think you're gonna be hungry. I like them. I'm gonna eat by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggled. Sure she liked it when Emily fed her but at the same time she did't want Emily to become hungry. By the way she did't thought it would be wise to let Emily fed her at a public place like this. Sure at home it was fine but she thought some people might find it strange seeing one young girl feeding another. The people paid enough attention to them already without that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Christine looked curious at the food. Since it really did look delicious. Even Christine got some of her appetite back. However Jennifer was aware about the fact she could't feed Christine until over her limit. To many people were watching. Perhaps they would call child welfare, or something like that. She did't want that too happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appetizers were soon gone and a waiter give them cards for the main course. Kiekie was so happy that she had gotten some real food she even swallowed the vegetables. Of course they were specially cooked and spiced so they tasted a lot better then some regular vegetables  she normally ate at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a nice appetizer. But what do you as your main course. Oh look You also get bowls with fries, and with salad. That sounds nice.<br>\r\nEverything looking for Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh I would like something with meat after that fish,\" Rebecca mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrimp are't fish,\" Jennifer said. \"They're crustacean. But I get your point. Look here is some delicious steak. Oh here you have some delicious chicken. Here is some pork\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take the chicken mommy. I always did like chicken.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I take the same. I like chicken too. I like to see what my girlfriend eats,\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it bothers me I can't read yet. Will that be hard. Reading and writing?\" Rebecca asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's always hard starting something new. But reading and writing\u2026 well after a few months you can read simple books. But before you can really write and read good\u2026 well that might take some time. Even adults some time have trouble with writing. That's why we have spell checkers at our computers.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think you do great Rebecca.\" Emily said. \"You're very bright. I'm sure you'll learn soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then a waiter came to take their orders. </span></div></div>",

The waiter, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t too keen on this family being here all of the little girls didn\u2019t seem to be abused in any normal way shape or form, not that the waiter could see on hand but each wasn't a normal size for their age group that much was quite prevalent. The youngest of all of them shoved into the biggest highchair still overflown the chair with her supple fat, dress not really even covering her lower half as her fat legs were shoved into the holes on the bottom of the chair, the woman who was in charge of taking care of this obese child shoved appetizer after appetizer into the girl\u2019s gaping maw. The girl herself wasn\u2019t even registering being fed, it was quite the opposite the other side of the table, calm and collective the woman fed every morsel into the begging girl\u2019s mouth there were times where the girl didn\u2019t want anymore, shaking her head to an fro to indicate this only to have something else shoved into her mouth. The woman who fed the girl blushing, a manic impression she gave off irked the waiter, but there wasn\u2019t anything illegal of being a doting parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else I can get for you girls, I am here for suggestions if need be\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI think we are ready to order if, Rebecca are you and Emily ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mom I think we are, we both want Chicken\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were excited that they were able to make their own choices, though there wasn\u2019t a lot on the kids' side of the menu it was still great that they didn\u2019t have to eat what Jennifer thought what would be appropriate for growing girls. Jotting it down on his note pad that both girls and oldest of the little tykes wanted nothing but the chicken fingers option he moved on to the woman and the baby. Notepad by the ready, making sure that he didn\u2019t forget anything that the woman said to him, Nancy looked over the menu thinking of what to get to feed Kiekie, there were so many choices and the whale wouldn\u2019t mind picking any of them, the drool dropped from Kiekie\u2019s mouth salivating over the various smells that surrounded her, thinking of what different kinds of food would be placed into her mouth made the baby more excited that she had been in the weeks leading to the decision to make Kiekie lose weight due to the inability of Christine to grow as fast as Kiekie gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have the steak with Portabella mushroom gravy, and the little one will have the meatloaf meal with extra meatloaf, also some more drinks too\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp and forceful with her order with no tinge of laughter in her voice the waiter didn\u2019t think the little girl would have gotten so much food it was quite a shock, to say the least, having someone who couldn\u2019t even walk on their own be fed enough food for an adult wasn\u2019t something he was used to, but not wanting to make these people\u2019s dinner out anymore uncomfortable than it was he took the order and moved on to the next customer. The brown-haired woman didn\u2019t even look up to acknowledge the waiter too busy doting on the blonde-haired girl that was right next to her, stroking the little girl\u2019s hair as she ate everything that was put in front of her, Christine didn\u2019t want to be forced to eat in front of all these people, embarrassed that she would be made a mockery of if her master would have to make her eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let us see here, I will get the linguine with pesto with some white wine to go with it, Christine will have\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChicken fingers too, I\u2019m guessing like the two little ones over there\u201d the waiter smirked, thinking he was right in his assumptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness no, Christine needs a more refined taste than chicken tenders, no she will have Chicken alfresco meal with extra cheese and extra chicken and the steak mash potatoes and can we switch the vegetables out with mac and cheese for her second plate and that should be it\u201d Jennifer calmly made her order, still no sense of jest in her voice, she was dead serious with her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter not knowing what to do, such a lot of food for a tiny person he didn\u2019t know if the woman was just making it look like the girl was a pig, not herself, slinking back to the kitchen face of confusion plastered on his face there was nothing he could say that made any sense in what he had just witnessed. With the orders placed and they were again made waiting for their food, Nancy thought it was a good time to ask Emily about her mother, knowing that this was going to be a touchy subject, to say the least, but it was something that Nancy and Jennifer should be aware of and if they need to limit contact with Emily it was all for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Emily we need to know what your mother knows about what we do to that piglets in our care and if she is going to do anything about how we treat our girls\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp with her words, placed quite a lot of pressure on Emily she didn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing about what had transpired with her mother, it wasn\u2019t anything bad though she knew that she was asked to be quiet about what Jennifer and Nancy do but it was all just so lovely she had to tell her mother about it. Emily didn\u2019t know if she should answer the questions that she was given as she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal but not keeping her promise was something that she knew was wrong in talking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom does know about what you guy do and how that you treat Christine like a pet, not a person and well she doesn\u2019t much care what you do as long as Rebecca makes me happy, she actually enjoys seeing all the flub that you're creating she is kind of interested to see what is going to happen to Christine\u201d Emily meekly stated not wanting to get into any more trouble than she felt like she was already in, to come clean about it all was her only option it would seem, at least in Emily\u2019s world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at this revelation that Emily\u2019s mother really didn\u2019t care about how they treated the girls as long as Emily was taken care of was the best outcome, but it was also quite surreal to hear this as Nancy was preparing for the worst outcome, this was in turn due to how Christine was Jennifer\u2019s lover and toy. Nancy thought there would be some repercussions for that at least, Jennifer treating Christine like a piglet, from force-feeding the girl to stripping Christine down to nothing so Jennifer can kiss her piglet, Nancy thought this would become a problem of some sort, as it stood they were okay.</span></div></div>",

It seems there was no problem with Emily's mother. But she just wondered if Emily's mother really did't care, or that she just did't thought that she had the right how to raise their children. that good be. Many parents sometimes thought that other parents treated their kids bad, but did't say anything about it since it was't their child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie is looking forward to the main course,\" Emily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was right. Kiekie was happier then she had been for some time. To be exact since the diet started. She smelled all kinds of delicious food and wondered what she was going to eat. At least she hoped she got fed. She knew her mother did't feed her much but her young mind had no idea why. Why did she hardly got any food while that other girl was fed like a prize winning hog. Kiekie could't talk yet and only understood a few word. But she knew she was hungry and that the only way to stop it was food. But it seemed like the diet had stopped. At least for now. She just hoped it would't start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Christine the main course soon arrives and I would like it if you don't make any trouble and just eat like a good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did't knew anything else to do then nod. She must admit the food did taste good so that was a good point.<br>\r\nRebecca did feel a bit bad for Christine. She needed to become a prize winning sow for her master if she wanted or not and was force fed, She also gained for Emily but that was willingly and Emily did't forced her. Emily feeding Rebecca was just a fun game for them. It was kind of innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah great here comes the main course.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked a bit surprised at her plate. Unlike her girlfriend she had't such a big stomach and this meal seemed pretty big to a girl for her size. She looked at Rebecca with a look that said: Help me!<br>\r\nRebecca friendly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just eat as much if you can. I eat the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I would like to feed you the leftovers but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I know!. Feeding me in a place were anyone can see us might not be such a good idea. But don't worry I eat whatever you can't eat. Everything is gonna be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also put some bowls on table some filled with vegetables (that made Kiekie give a sign of disgust), and other with fries. Then came the plates.<br>\r\nKiekie started stuffing her face like a starved animal. Not using any manners. <br>\r\nRebecca ate slowly but with taste since she must admit it tasted pretty good.<br>\r\nEven Christine slowly started to eat what Jennifer gave her since it tasted pretty good and she knew very well that if she did't eat her master would force it down her throat one way or another, an that was even worse<br>\r\nEmily also started eating but slower then the others. However she must admit the food was good. But what she would really like was stuffing Rebecca with tasty food. Like at a all you can eat buffet. But anyway there were also other people around. To bad. But with a bit of luck they had a life together perhaps they found a way to do it once.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Nancy was worried that all this was too many stimuli for Kiekie should be checked as Kiekie began looking like a starved animal, so longing since she had anything that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t green and leafy, meat was her salvation though, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be long until her diet will resume after this little respite was over with. Nancy like Jennifer couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but notice all the eyes on them, like snakes in the grass all, we're interested to see this family with all three of their whales eat. One woman, in particular, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too keen to see such beautiful girls blimp up as they have been for the past few months she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the reason why the adults would do this to their precious cargo. As Christine, Emily, Rebecca, and Kiekie happily munched way Nancy and Jennifer were wondering what these snooty other guests had mouths a gaped thinking it was in poor taste of what this woman was doing approaching the family as they had a night out it was quite boorish behavior for a woman of her class to have, the woman really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care she had to say something about these piglets as they disturbed her dinner first with their unhealthy appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think you ladies have given these young darlings enough to eat, I mean look at that one she is more blob than girl at this point, you two should be ashamed of what you're doing to them\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman started, sneering and pointing at the overweight Kiekie like she was a freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the tone this woman was making but at the same token, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to ruin the date she was on with her piglet, not knowing what to do about this situation confused her to no end. Calmly Jennifer rose out of her chair inhaling deeply before confronting the woman who thought it was a good idea to attack small children who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know what was going on or that they were being made fun of in the first place, Rebecca never saw this side of her mother, the rage of what she had just heard from the woman had made Jennifer boil from the inside, face red with anger Jennifer looked like she was going to defend her decisions of how she was raising her children and her pet piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it's your choice madam how I raise my kids, Now if you excuse us I have to get back to dinner with my family\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer stated in a huff before taking a forkful of food and shoving it down Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger fueled Jennifer now as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care anymore about making a scene with these rich snobs around. If they were going to be so rude, then why should Jennifer and Nancy teach the girls to not be themselves in public, to begin with. Not hiding behind a mask anymore Jennifer begun to act like she usually does with her pet, doing this just to spite the horrible woman who thought it was best to rile Jennifer up and say that fat is bad to have on a toddler. The woman didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do, freezing up when confronted by someone who is of a lower class made the woman quite confused. Leaving in a huff the nosy woman returned to her chair not knowing what she should do or if there was anything else she could do with the situation as it is, while Jennifer not hiding her love for Christine anymore began to assault the girl with various flavors and smells, cutting up pieces of meat before shoving it into Christine gaping maw, Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what do to she thought she was going to be able to eat on her own it seems this was just a pipe dream as her place as a pet was reestablished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGirls lets show these high brow people what we are really like, Emily and Rebecca I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to allow you to be all lovey-dovey again, stick it to these rich people and show them your love\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer shouted to the girls getting her daughter and Emily all riled up themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere come the choo-choo Rebecca, be a good girl and eat until you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anymore\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily whispered into Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, as a fork full of chicken to her lips with one hand and the other traveled more southward, gripping one of the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plump cheeks groping it like Emily was testing the firmness of a piece of watermelon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both looked at each other and blushed they were relieved of the decision that Jennifer made, Nancy, on the other hand, was a little leary of this not knowing what will happen with this upfront defiance of the nosy people around them. Jennifer wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too worried, anger is what fueled her, how dare they tell her who to love how dare they say that loving a two-year-old in a sexual way was wrong, this was her life and Christine was her property no one was going to take that away from her, Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only purpose was to become and blob of her former self and for her to be Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lover to be pleasured by and give pleasure to this was her only reason for living now. Christine didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what was going on but she did understand these two things, no longer did she think she was human no she was a toy for her master, she will fight the feedings as much as she could in her current situation but at the end of the day, Christine couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny it did feel good to be in love with Jennifer, the feelings of pleasure was intoxicatingly clouding Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind to almost wanting to be the fattest sow in the world.</span></div></div>",

Fine so Christine is my niece but I adopted her so that makes her my daughter to. More or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine knew one thing for sure, Her master seemed to be angry for something that woman said. She did't understand it all but she knew that this possibly would end in being fed to the bursting point and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca were a bit surprised that Jennifer wanted them to feed the other in a public place but why not. They were in love and all other were allowed to know that and Emily feeding Rebecca was one way of loving the other like adult people love each other and had sex. Of course Rebecca and Emily did't knew anything about sex yet. But They did love each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie had't understood a word the woman said and to be honest did't care. She had to live on icky greens for some time but now she was finally allowed to eat real food and she enjoyed it very much. Kiekie's only thing in mind was getting as much of this tasty food inside her as was possible. The only fear Kiekie had that it was possible that after this she was stuck to eating icky greens again but she decided to worry about that later. Now she just wanted to eat and eating she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was busy forcing Christine anything what was on her plate and did't even bother eating herself. It did't matter to her as long if Christine would get fatter and she pushed more and more food past the lips of Christine. Like always she tried to resist however her resist seem to be weaker then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Emily. Look at Christine. It that normal for her?\" Rebecca asked Emily on a whispering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Hm... I admit it does look like she's less resisting to be fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she pushed a fork full past Rebecca's lips what made it for Rebecca unable to talk. But she liked this being fed by Emily. Perhaps it was better she just did't think about her mother and Christine. After all she could't do anything about it. Jennifer would keep feeding Christine until she was a prize winning sow. That was Christine's only purpose in life from now on in the eyes of Jennifer. Christine knew that too. Her parents always supported her to talk. Saying: \"Mom\" and \"dad\" and other words. But the last time she did't talk anymore. Except making some sounds like a piggy. She really forget she was used to be a human being. To her she was now a pig and her only purpose in life was eating or force fed to become fatter and end up like a fat sow. To be honest, that was pretty easy. And Jennifer made sure it would happen. She was cuddling and tickling her while feeding her more and more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy did't need to feed Kiekie since Kiekie was perfectly cape able of doing that by herself. Fine she was eating like a pig in more then one way but she was eating . That was what she wanted, good food. Nancy slowly chewed on some of the food making sure Kiekie would't choke. In Kiekie's case that was truly something that could happen if you see how fast she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Christine felt ready to puke but Jennifer did't stop. Her belly was very swollen and she was in pain but Jennifer kept feeding her more, and more, and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Looking like it was about to explode from all the chicken and other delicious foods Rebecca greedily shoved into her mouth without a second thought, she was now regretting her decision on this thought looking over to the piglet this wasn\u2019t as bad as what Christine had gotten, enough food for two grown adults was shoved into her mouth, Jennifer not even thinking about what this will happen to the girl all she wanted was Christine to grow nothing else really mattered, this was to give the woman who thought they could bud into how she raised her kids a little bit of a screw you, but at the same token the piglet needed to grow. Groaning in pain Christine couldn\u2019t even move anymore, feeling like she could throw up at any moment, wasting the food her master had graciously shoved into her mouth. Jennifer had other plans for Christine, still feeling the heat of anger that the rich woman had placed over her was almost intoxicating feeling the orb that was Christine\u2019s stomach from underneath her pink dress was enough to cover this alien thing that bulged out. It was hard to breathe thanks to the large meal that was forced down her throat, Jennifer didn\u2019t care if Christine was feeling sick now she needed to show dominance int the crowd of vipers. Thinking that they were above the poor and middle class didn\u2019t give them the right to tell Jennifer what was right to do with her children. With everyone did with their festive meal it was in the best interest of everyone that this family would leave the premises, the tension of the room was thick enough to cut with a knife, deescalating the situation was in the best interest of everyone involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmay I get you lovely guest anything else or the check?\u201d He asked now trying to step on any toes, Jennifer wasn\u2019t even paying attention to him having her hands full with massaging Christine, he didn\u2019t know it this was normal for mother and child but as emotions were already quite high he didn\u2019t want to intrude to whatever the woman was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and two of your finest cheesecakes, Christine will be hungry later\u201d Nancy had taken the helms of the conversation as Jennifer was preoccupied with Christine at the moment, stroking and playing with the little girl\u2019s fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams of the dress that were containing the food baby Christine had acquired throughout the meal were at their limits, any slight breath that came from the poor piglet made her dress creak and moan as being distressed with how fat she was becoming it just couldn\u2019t take the pressure of the extra fat she had just accumulated with the force-feeding she had just endured. Jennifer though forceful when it came to food, was always attentive to her sensitive areas when needed. Slowly lifting up Christine\u2019s dress making the orb spilling out from underneath her dress like a cascade of cream, her stomach exited the confines of her dress. Bloated beyond belief with all she had just consumed Christine didn\u2019t think she could eat another bite to save her life, was this really her life now just a toy to be fattened, she couldn\u2019t help but moan out of ecstasy as Jennifer stroked and kissed every part of her body, panting as it felt like Christine had just gone ten rounds with Jennifer she didn\u2019t care if people looked she needed the tender touch of Jennifer on her body it was all she needed right now. The room broke out in a cringe of disgust seeing a little girl moan with pleasure was normal to make these rich folks skin crawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer grab Christine we are done here and I already paid the fine gentleman anyways\u201d Nancy scooting out the door, Kiekie inside her carriage and Rebecca and Emily's shoulder to shoulder with each other, hands clasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be there in a moment, I just have to get Christine ready\u201d Jennifer grinned wildly, a devilish scheme wrapped in her brain as she adjusted Christine\u2019s dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n while they walked toward the door smiling. Emily thought it would be a great opportunity to show her love, her lips pursed she moved closer toward Rebecca before landing a sweet kiss on her cheek. Jennifer, on the other hand, was taking her sweet time, ideas of how to make an impression on these old snobs running wild, thinking of the best way were to show them her true self. At first, Jennifer thought it wouldn\u2019t be best if Christine wore her collar in a place like this but now Jennifer knew that this was the best place for her to wear it to show how a slave should be treated. Clasping the pink collar again around Christine\u2019s neck, Jennifer began to get ready to go home, but this wasn\u2019t the only thing she was going to do with Christine, not in the slightest. Picking her up and placing Christine on the floor, knowing what this meant for her Christine began to crawl on all fours, it's not like she was a person. Heaving the large gut that came from her last meal was a bit cumbersome for her yet she persevered through it, a familiar \u201cClick\u201d rung through her head as her leash was attached to her collar, being led out the restaurant this way was deepening for Christine but knowing her master was the one who was doing it to her, only made Christine pant harder. Gasps and comments swirled the room as the strange family left, not knowing what to make of them the only thing stuck in the other guest's mind was an overfed blonde girl crawling around like someone\u2019s pet oinking as they left.</span></div></div>",

Nancy took Kiekie to her room trying to teach how to lose weight. Kiekie was a lot happier then she'd been for several days. At least since the diet started. Emily still did't understood why it was so important that Kiekie weighed less Christine. And after Christine had become fatter, then what? Let Kiekie gain again. Who knew. But she was better gainer then Christine. She probably soon would be heavier again. It did't matter to her. She could't do anything about it, and to be totally honest she wondered how Christine would look like after some time.<br>\r\nBoth girl waddled upstairs . They went to the bathroom, brushed their teeth and waddled to Rebecca's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I first thought it was strange that a adult was in love with a toddler. But the idea that you want you lover to become a piggy is... well even stranger. Am I right.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say yes. I mean falling in love with kids that happened more often. It was called a... p...p... pedophile I believe. Or something like that. It are men who are into kids. Well I guess some have a strong will power and are able to suppress their feelings.  I mean that you just love little kids is't a crime. As long if they don't do anything with little kids I guess he or she can easy live between other people. But If you as a adult do some things with them\u2026 well that's a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about your mother does?\" Emily asked while she undressed herself. \"Is that a crime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question,\" Rebecca said. \"But to be honest I don't know! I mean she feeds Christine. Is it a crime to feed someone? Even if it is with force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lock me up,\" Emily said and put on her nightie and crawled in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca started to undress an continued. \"I'm not sure if it's a crime to feed someone. I mean adult people feed babies all the time. I don't believe that's a crime even if he or she does it with force, but the amount she feeds is way more then a normal kid eats. But does that make it a crime? Dressing her up like a piggy\u2026 that's perfectly legal. However forcing her to act like a piggy all the time an not seeing her anymore as a person... is that a crime? Maybe? Maybe not? I guess no but at the other hand... she stays my mother and I love her. Even with all her strange things and ways. You don't betray your own mother. Besides if I do what will happen with me and Kiekie and Christine. Perhaps we're going to different foster families and I never see them again. Perhaps I never see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're send to foster families I can ask my mom to take in you.\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I appreciate that,\" Rebecca said and put on her nightie. \"But I'm not sure how it works to adopt a child. I guess they're certain rules. I believe in some cases relatives need to take care of the children. If they are capable. If they ever went to prison then I don't think you're allowed to adopt a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled in bed close to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I rather don't talk about those nasty things. I rather talk about us. I asked my mother about that getting kids with other girls. Not possible. At least not yet. But you don't really need to have a men. You only need some of his eh... my mother called it stuff. We can get pregnant from some stuff then our kids are half brothers or sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then mine kid is not really a kid from you,\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is your parent?\" Rebecca asked. \"The one that raised you an took care of you, or the one who gave his eh... stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. So that does't really matter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she bend over to Rebecca and kissed her. Rebecca grabbed Emily's head and pushed against her face. Both liked this kissing and cuddling. And they liked how Rebecca's fat body rubbed against Emily's thin body. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Blushing wildly Emily was the first to break contact with Rebecca\u2019s eyes which only made the pear-shaped girl giggle of how shy Emily really was, it was hard to really read Emily as she was always away from the house as she still needed to go home to her mother and there were usually together with either Nancy or Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026. Rebecca can I\u2026 umm play with your fat\u201d Emily perked up finding it hard to find the words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can go ahead\u201d Rebecca blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Emily was having a hard time with only made the Rebecca blush harder, both didn\u2019t known what their relationship was at the moment but this just seemed right what they were doing at this moment, reaching underneath the nightie that Rebecca had picked out for the night just to feel the soft blubber that was apart of Rebecca\u2019s body was heaven to Emily. Feeling Emily grope and play with multiple folds that she had accumulated from her mother\u2019s feedings and the sensual relationship Rebecca had with Emily all made her the girl she was now, though Rebecca didn\u2019t know what was going to happen in the future she knew that no matter what Emily was going to be apart of her life. Feeling Rebecca\u2019s body was all Emily could have wanted, every curve and crevice only made Emily want to touch Rebecca more, with a head like a tomato and panting like a dog Emily got to work with feeling Rebecca more and more. An orgasmic feeling Rebecca had as Emily\u2019s fingers danced across her body was almost more than she could bear. She was in a state of nirvana with Emily being the conductor for this magical journey. Reaching around to the backside of Rebecca was easier said than done as unlike her front there was much more when it came to her legs and thighs, so much flub that it made the panties she once wore all the time look more akin to a thong thanks to her butt\u2019s excessive growth rate. Bunching up in between her cheeks was always uncomfortable for the little girl but learning to deal with it for a few months made it like just another natural thing that she did now like the copious amount of food that she ingests daily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca couldn\u2019t help but moan whenever she was touched by Emily like an involuntary action, the pleasure of Emily\u2019s fingers created was so overwhelming for Rebecca that she couldn\u2019t just stop making noises. With eyes locked on Rebecca, Emily knew she was the one who was doing this to Rebecca but at the same token, Emily knew she couldn\u2019t stop. Every piece of Rebecca made the little girl feel like she was in heaven groping and feeling every part of her was all Emily wanted now. Looking at the plump lips of Rebecca Emily couldn\u2019t help herself anymore, leaning in close to Rebecca\u2019s face she kissed her with all she had. Rebecca herself was surprised at first as she felt the tongue of Emily enter her mouth but she embraced it all the same anything that Emily had given her she would accept without a second thought it was just in her nature to do so. Time seemed to stand still around them as the world was silent while the two young lovers made out with each other, a heated display of affection was going on something that both girls hadn\u2019t really experience before. Neither really understood what they were doing but it felt right to be embraced by each other in such a way that it made them both hot and bothered, while the rest of the house was seemingly quiet there was another person who was scurrying around other than Rebecca and Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer still up in the wee hours of the night was hard at work downstairs in the kitchen, leaving her piglet upstairs as Christine had already eaten so much as it was, Jennifer was still quite mad at that woman for what she had said to her. Not wanting to bow to anyone under those kinds of circumstances and fed up of hiding her love for Christine from the public like something that was wrong was something that she wasn\u2019t going to do anymore no matter where or when she wanted to be able to kiss, grope or do anything to her pet no matter where and she did have the perfect way of doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay so your sure that I can make my piglet mine and I can\u2019t force her to wear and eat anything and I won\u2019t get charged with anything from a legal standpoint?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to kill her or anything, she is like my wife well we aren\u2019t on that same level but a partner of sorts, she is here to be my toy to play with\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do her specifically well\u201d Jennifer blushed heavily as thoughts ran through her head with all the things she wants to do with her piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let's just say its can get pretty heated, I just want it so I can play with her and she can please me if I wanted, hell if I licked her body and groped her ass no one can say a thing, that is all I\u2019m looking for\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Phone in hand Jennifer was ready to take on the legal system an have complete control of the sow, by the end of the night no one would be able to interfere with how Christine is treated. It took many calls to different people but Jennifer was glad that she had finally gotten the legal go-ahead to do whatever she wanted with her piglet, Jumping for joy as all was set on a legal standpoint made, with document faxed over by one of the best lawyers Jennifer could find all was set up, no one can mock Jennifer ever again, Christine is a piglet and the whole world is going to know it, already making plans for the weekend to get here, Jennifer couldn\u2019t wait.</span></div></div>",

The only reaction she got that Kiekie threw it in her face. <br>\r\nSure Kiekie wanted to eat. Or more pig out to be exact but not on icky veggies. But on tasty food, candy, desserts. All the stuff Christine got and she did't. She also did't understand why she did't got the good food. She was a good eater. Was't that what her mother wanted? Then why was she punished?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it go?\" Rebecca asked from the couch looking in a book together with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so good. She wants food but not the vegetables,\" Nancy mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Emily said. \"I also never liked vegetables when I was little. More kids don't like vegetables. But if you ask me feeding her nothing but vegetables is't healthy for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer wants her to lose weight so Christine will be the fattest one, and vegetables don't have much calories. So that's why we feed her vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true,\" Emily said. \"But she also needs some other stuff. She needs to eat some meat and fish. Eating nothing but vegetables can't be good for her. Besides I heard that you can't put children on a diet. At least not a crash diet. This looks a lot like a crash diet.\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I think you're right Emily. Kiekie does't look healthy. I think she really needs some other stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother don't want her to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want Kiekie to die?\" Emily asked. \"Because she has barely eaten anything and does't look good she might die. If she dies because she was fed nothing but veggies you and Jennifer might be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy looked at the two lovers who looked at her over the book. She knew they were right and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will talk to your mother. I'm gonna do it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was busy dressing Christine in another piggy outfit. She was planning to take Christine to a buffet and stuff the little piggy like a thanksgiving Turkey. She was just busy with the last part when Nancy walked in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Nancy. What do you think? Is't she a perfect piggy? A pretty piglet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh sure Jennifer but I think we need to talk about Kiekie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? Is she still whining for more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too but I think she is getting sick. She has barely eaten anything  but I'm afraid she needs some protein. Fish and meat. No garbs of course. But I think she really needs\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. Perhaps you right. I wanted to make that kid lose weight. I counted calories but no the nutrition value. Do that. Feed that kid some meat and fish. But make sure it's low fat and not to much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on that,\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now and now you my little piglet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine herself didn\u2019t know what her master and Nancy were talking about it was something that was of no consequence to her, Christine was too busy with what ever her master was putting on her now, most things Christine was forced to wear nowadays were either pink or frilly not really anything too exciting but it was nice to be treated as a princess in this way. Jennifer was quite focused on Christine to really notice what Nancy was saying to her, catching a word or two she understood the problem that Nancy was having and did want to fix it, but it was hard to focus when she had her goddess in front of her. Finally done with dressing her piglet Nancy had Jennifer\u2019s full attention for the time being, hoping to get to their destination as fast a possible Jennifer didn\u2019t want this conversation to last too long, also she thought if she should bring the two lovers with her too or just a date for just Christine and her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo as I was saying, feeding Kiekie just veggies isn\u2019t going to cut it as it can have some sort of ill effects, some low meat like turkey or something with protein is needed too\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you Nancy, so just cook her up some chicken with some of those sweet potatoes and of course a nice green bean salad and she should be fine, I just don\u2019t know what nutrition is, let's hope she loses weight this way instead but I\u2019ll be gone all day and night, me and Christine are having a little fun, since I now have these\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was proud when she declared that now she had legal ownership of Christine, all of the naughty thoughts she could ever think of was now fair play to do in public, as she was legally immune to prosecution for her tastes in lovers. This was a crowning achievement for Jennifer, no longer would she ever feel like she didn\u2019t belong people will make room for her and her sow even if they don\u2019t like what is becoming of the obese girl. Nancy was taken quite aback with the emboldened statements that came from Jennifer, never one for hasty decisions Nancy didn\u2019t know if this was such a good idea as not wanting anything to hurt the harem that they were creating with Christine at the top. Quite leery at this situation Nancy didn\u2019t know what to do about it though, the gleam in Jennifer\u2019s eyes made it known that there was no way that she was going to be stopped with a simple no from Nancy\u2019s lips no Jennifer had the will and determination to do what she wanted with Christine. Thinking of what to do with this situation Nancy couldn\u2019t help but look at the fat sow that was in front of her, Christine on all fours without Jennifer uttering a word to Christine to do so was quite an achievement in itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer don\u2019t you think you should think about this I mean people might call child services on you if you start groping the piglet\u201d Nancy stated worried about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa they can try if they want but CPS won\u2019t come for none of the girls anymore, Mr.Gezzeti made sure of it, no matter what I do no one can do anything, hell I can even strip Christine naked and play with her and no one can do anything about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus look at her Nancy don\u2019t you just think that this goddess needs to feel the presence of a woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Christine up and down Nancy noticed the girl\u2019s new outfit that was picked out for her date with Jennifer, it was something that looked quite breathable to say the least. Being nothing more than a cute pink summer dress with white accents all throughout the dress in the form of frills and the like, not wanting Christine\u2019s perfect skin to be damaged by her new life as a piglet Jennifer thought it would be best if her knees were protected until they toughen up on their own. Knowing that the girl now will crawl like the piglet she is outside now Knee guards were placed upon her. Nancy couldn\u2019t help but see the beauty of Christine as Jennifer did, adorably fashioned for the date Jennifer giving the girl cute twin tails to boot. With both Jennifer and Christine ready for their date together Nancy didn\u2019t know what to do to keep an eye on Jennifer so she didn\u2019t cause too much of a ruckus on her date, she needed to think fast if there was even a chance to reign in Jennifer at all. Rushing into the living room where Emily and Rebecca were just reading to each other, overhearing little tidbits of the words that were being said in the backroom, but they were both more interested in each other as the encounter they had last night changed them for the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the room Nancy was hoping that Rebecca and Emily could help out with Jennifer, needing someone to tag along just to make sure Jennifer\u2019s new power over Christine wouldn\u2019t go to her head, finding Emily and Rebecca wasn\u2019t hard getting their attention was another matter entirely. Both girls had finished reading the book instead of reaching for another they both decided to investigate each other's tongues instead, both Emily and Rebecca were kissing, their love radiating with each passing kiss, saliva intertwined them in their heated exchange. Shocked to see a sweaty Nancy looking at them, it wasn\u2019t disgust nor jealousy, a vacant look was on her face, her mouth finally opening croaking out a few syllables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls I need you to go and keep an eye on Jennifer for me I need to take care of the whale, Don\u2019t disturb her date just observe, I\u2019m making you two handmaidens of sorts for Christine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we can help Miss Nancy, but what should we do if Jennifer asks why we are there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tell her you're there to help feed Christine, whatever Jennifer tells you to do you better do it, got it girls\u201d Nancy exhaled before scooting both of the after Jennifer and Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jennifer\u2019s darkest desires with how she wants to do with Christine in front of her she couldn\u2019t still feel restrained, looking behind her she knew why she felt this way, Emily and Rebecca begged her to tag along which put a damper on her plans. Thinking of this as a few more mouths to feed no matter how much the girls assured her that they were just here to be used as assistants to the piglet princess, Jennifer wasn\u2019t convinced in this at all. She thought of a great way to see if they were telling the truth or just being there to help with Christine. In front of Golden corral, Jennifer parked the letting the girls out before handing Rebecca the leash that was connected to Christine\u2019s collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLead the piglet in, I have to park the car and start feeding her remind her that she is nothing more than a piglet\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes madam I will make sure that she is properly introduced\u201d Emily was confident in her demeanor something that Rebecca admired. Had something changed in Emily she really did seem to enjoy what they were doing to Christine, it was intoxicating Rebecca admitted.</span></div></div>",

At least your mother told us to do that and Nancy said we needed to do what she told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Rebecca mumbled. \"But we can't leave Christine on her own.

She looked at Rebecca who handed her Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to start feeding her,\"Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily is busy getting some food. I could't leave Christine alone now could I?\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. True,\" Jennifer admitted. \"How was it going with Christine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all right.

Emily didn\u2019t know why she felt this was but pulling Christine around by a leash was quite intoxicating, knowing that she would never do it or could do it to Rebecca. For some reason, this was a bit of a let down for Emily, but focusing her dark desires on such a willing participate like Christine made her feel euphoric of how much control they had over her. Christine being relativity broken did help Emily realize this feeling, Rebecca, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t so sure with herself, she couldn\u2019t deny that there was something very special in having complete control over a person. She didn\u2019t want to admit it but her mother was correct in her ways of training Christine, their relationship might be strange, to say the least, but there was love deep in there and Christine will learn that she is their toy. Chris tine didn\u2019t really see any way to get out of her current situation herself, she couldn\u2019t run away as there was no one else who would take care of her and if she stayed when would have to come to terms that she was no longer human that she was a toy, someone who\u2019s sole purpose was to please her master. Being groped and pleasured by having her fat groped by Jennifer wasn\u2019t anything new but the eyes of Emily and Rebecca is what scared her the most, the eyes of someone who was sympathetic to what Christine had to go through were now vacant, filled with lust for the girl and her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t know if you know this but these two practically dragged that blob of a girl in her by a leash, It's very disturbing how you treat your kids\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Man perked up spouting useless things at Jennifer, even before she could start force-feeding the piglet, interrupted for something so trivial only made her mad. How could this man think he knew what was best for Christine, it wasn\u2019t like she was a human being, just an object of Jennifer\u2019s desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls start feeding Christine, this gentleman needs to learn how to address me, my family and my possessions\u201d Reaching into her bag to produce the main thing that she was most proud of at this moment, she knew that a loophole had made what she was doing to the piglet completely in her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away from the table, Christine sighed a sigh of relief not wanting to deal with Jennifer when she was in one of her violent moods and having the caring lovers beside her was the best kind of news that Christine could have asked for. Rebecca and Emily just looked at each other and then back to Christine not knowing what to do with the girl, sure they were ordered to feed Christine but they never really done it to someone who wasn\u2019t fulling willing to eat, Rebecca on her own never fed anyone at all and didn\u2019t know what to do. Slowly reaching for a fork Emily started to do what she was told and feed Christine, Emily almost felt like she was cheating on Rebecca with Christine sure she was told to feed the girl but this was still an intimate thing for them to do, Christine, on the other hand, didn\u2019t want to do anything with the two of them, still in the mindset that she wasn\u2019t fat and still growing she thought it would be best to make it hard on Rebecca and Emily. They weren\u2019t her master they would never love her like Jennifer did so why should she bow to these two? Before they even noticed it, Christine begun to crawl away from the table, Causing havoc for the two girls with no disregard for anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Emily we have to feed that piglet, Rebecca shouted\u201d Feeling a somewhat high from calling Christine a piglet, Rebecca charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyour right, your mom will be disappointed if the slave isn\u2019t taken care of\u201d Emily knew this was right in her mind, it wasn\u2019t like Christine was a person, they needed to chase after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwerving in and out of tables, trying to catch up to the little piglet was a little harder than first thought, Christine was quite quick but Emily the thinner of the two was fast too, Picking up speed to match Christine's she had gotten her just deserts and caught the naughty piglet by the leash. Stopping Christine wasn\u2019t the only trouble, more and more people had gotten to see the piglet, dressed in her dress and having a collar around her neck. Not really caring if people saw as it seemed Jennifer had it all figured out and there was now no need to hide what Christine was, nothing more than a piglet. Back at the table, there was a mad Rebecca there holding out the highchair to place the runaway into. Upset with how silly they could have been with not watching Christine more closely they made sure that she was watched like a hawk. Taking the first piece of pizza from the plate, Rebecca was ready to do what she wanted to do from the beginning. Shoving it into the unwanting mouth of Christine with no hesitation shocked both Emily and Christine who had no choice that to sob or she could just choke on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t think that Emily or Rebecca would do this to her, they were the ones that made the biggest fuss over how she was treated in front of them, that had all seem to have faded. Both revel in the domination that they were placing on Christine, there was an intoxicating feeling when came to doing this, they wanted to do it more and more making Christine bigger and bigger all the while so. Not even consoling Rebecca in the matter Rebecca stepped in, not for feeding the piglet though, taking one look at Christine and lifted up her dress. Stroking and kissing the growing fleet of the piglet, Emily looked directly at Rebecca for approval of what she was doing was alright with her. The motions of Emily dominating Christine made Rebecca feel hotter and hotter, with two-fingers Emily grabbed the pink panties of Christine, something that was her only from being totally nude and gave it a nice \u201cthwack\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is't she?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to you,\" Rebecca said. \"If you did't told my mother that recipe well she probably would't be so fat. Well she would still be fat but not as fat like now. But I think my mother also did some other things to help her gain faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard they sometimes use stuff to make cow's fatter.\" Emily said. \"They use it on cows but... why would't it work on a human. I bet their is stuff that makes you gain faster. And knowing your mother she would probably use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded. She knew her mother was cape able of doing anything that would make Christine fatter and fatter and turning her in the biggest blob ever. In a contest of heaviest children she would win the first prize. At least that was what Jennifer wanted. <br>\r\nShe forced some more food in Christine's mouth. She felt a bit bad for Christine but at the other hand she would be fed anyway. At least she did use less force then her mother who gave Christine barely enough time to chew and swallow her food. <br>\r\nEmily still pulled a bit at Christine's pink panties. However they were partly lost in Christine's fat folds. Christine was fat. Not fat enough for Jennifer's taste, however that would probably be the sky, but still she was fat. She wondered how fat Christine would become.<br>\r\nFinally Emily put her finger under Christine's panties and slowly pulled them of. Rebecca was't sure if this was the right thing to do but she understand that Jennifer had the right to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you feel so soft Christine,\" Emily coed. \"Like a nice squishy pillow. Don't worry Rebecca. You will still be my nr. 1 favorite. But I can have a little fun with her. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca lifted her shoulders. \"Sure why not. I must admit she does feel nice, so soft, warm and squishy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you feed her as much if your mother wants she won't be so soft and squishy for long. Then her belly will be as hard if a rock. I know this Rebecca I have experience. Not with my own belly of course. This flat thing has barely any room but I know your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily slowly slid with her finger over Christine's body felling every fat fold pushing her finger deep in them. Rebecca still fed Christine but in the meantime she could't resist bu also touching and groping Christine and started to understand why Emily liked it so much. She still felt bad for her cousin but she would be fattened up anyway so she might as well enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really does't like it,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second Emily... what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That she really does't like it. Why. It's obvious she does't want the food you can clearly see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. She does't like it. But what now if we could find a way to make her like it. That she likes being fat. Then she maybe would't be such a trouble maker. That would make it easier. For her and for my mother. She probably wants to gain faster and the faster she gets fat the faster she's bigger then Kiekie and the Kiekie can gain again. Kiekie would like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit it sounds good but... how can you make Christine like it?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the downside. Kiekie just loves food and does't mind to gain, I love you and want to gain for you. As for Christine... I don't know. What do pigs like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I the cartoons pigs like it to eat. Normally. Further\u2026 they like to roll in the mud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she's a piglet but... I'm not sure she's so much of a pig she likes it to roll in the mud.\" Rebecca said. \"But well who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darn it. Rebecca it's your mother. She's coming this way.\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fast pulled Christine's dress down and Emily fast pulled her panties back on. Rebecca just hoped they did't turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see you two did take good care of my piglet. You know what I take it over from here you two can go take some food for yourself. Or maybe for the other I don't really care. Do what you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was glad they could go because she got the feeling her face was getting more red by the second. While they walked towards the buffet she must admit she did feel kind of hungry.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

They couldn't make heads or tails of these feelings as they were foreign to them, a muddled mess of emotions swirled in their minds, they both actually did like force-feeding anther person, there was a surge of intoxicating power that came with it. As the line moved closer and closer to the spread of food in front of Rebecca, her stomach growled with anticipation of what was going to be shoved in there by Emily. Various delectable foods we're I don't of the two small girls, from pizza to sushi all was there to be gobbled up by Rebecca.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What should we try first, maybe some pizza would sate that stomach of yours?\" Emily chuckled, pushing some of Rebecca's hair away to nibble at her neck. Goosebumps formed around the place where she was being kissed, this was a familiar feeling that Rebecca loved quite so she enjoyed being groped and kissed by Emily, oversensitive to the feeling of Emily\u2019s little hands over her body was all that Rebecca needed at the moment, the high of force-feeding Christine still running through her body, the feelings that she couldn\u2019t get over Rebecca wondered if Emily felt the same.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally, it was their turn to look over all the food that this place had to offer, so many choices make it quite hard to make a concise choice. They both were wondering about what they should get while their minds were in a haze of ecstasy from the feedings and groping they had with Christine, not wanting to ruin their fun with each other through Emily did think that it was the best that they get their minds back on straight, being corrupted by Jennifer\u2019s own morals was something that Rebecca didn\u2019t even think about, at least now she now understood why her mother only saw Christine as a toy not as a person. Emily herself didn\u2019t want to think about it at all while Jennifer was around, trying to lie to herself that she did enjoy making Christine yield, but if Rebecca didn\u2019t want to do it any more than Emily wouldn\u2019t do it again, Rebecca was the most important thing to Emily and making her into an immobile blob herself was her first priority, the more she thought about it the more her heartbeat became faster and faster, looking like a tomato again Emily had to put these thoughts out of her mind and make room for the now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cwhat do you want to get, Emily there is a lot of good stuff here I can\u2019t believe there is so much in one place\u201d Rebecca half-smiled at her lover as best as she could, a plate full of food in hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know right now what I should get, something that isn\u2019t too filling as I\u2019m not an eating machine like Christine or you are\u201d Emily chuckled, she knew that her statement was quite accurate to say, the wide rear that Rebecca was an attest to that.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrabbing a small plate of pizza Emily was ready to sit down, Rebecca was ready as well having many things on her plate things that did look quite delectable to Rebecca, comparing both her plate and Emily you would think Rebecca was eating for two. Nervously both girls looked at each other's plate, still being shocked by their own motives toward Christine, Emily and Rebecca didn\u2019t think that they could act that way it was all a strange feeling and now going through the motions didn\u2019t help their predicament at all. Looking back at the table to where Christine was forcing more food into Christine, made them both feel a twinge of jealousy, Christine was theirs to play with she was their food balloon to become a blob. Rebecca and Emily looked at each other, both knowing that they each had the same idea wanting to spice up their relationship with force-feeding Christine, but this was something that they would have to ask Jennifer for. Reaching back to the table, both girls next to each other enjoying the meal, taking glances back to Christine and Jennifer, wanting to know what Jennifer did for that man to leave them alone for now something was up it wasn\u2019t right that Jennifer essentially got off scot-free. Emotions began to bubble up from deep within Emily seeing Jennifer force another morsel into Christine set a fire underneath the girl, Rebecca could see a change in Emily one that she herself had felt when forcing Christine to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to be bothered by Jennifer and her taking away their new toy, Rebecca and Emily Focused on themselves instead. Both were still in the puppy dog phase of their relationship began to shove their seats next to each other, plopping down right across from the display of Christine sobbing as Jennifer made her eat everything on the plate Emily had given to Christine. Digging into their own meal both girls were enjoying each other's company and the spectacle that was seeing Christine being forced fed, darkness had taken hold of both Emily and Rebecca loving the sight of a crying Christine in front of them. Emily took a piece of chicken that Rebecca had gathered with the rest of her choice selections that rested on her plate, feeding Rebecca was one of the most rewarding things that Emily was allowed to do, seeing Rebecca blimp up into her giant pear shape was always a treat to witness. Grabbing hold of the plump rear of Rebecca with one hand, feeling her butt ooze out from the spaces between Emily's finger, pleasure ran down Rebecca\u2019s spine as she was playing with while fed more to increase her flabby body. Although both girls were in their own worlds as it stood there was still something quite beautiful on their minds, it was the experience they just had with Christine, wanting to tread the waters with a mouth full of food Rebecca spoke up </span></div></div>",

Eh I mean\u2026 can we perhaps help... feeding\u2026 Christine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was surprised but stayed calm. Part of her liked that Rebecca start to like force feeding just like she. At the same time she also liked it to be fed. Just not by force but she knew Emily would't do that. But all Jennifer cared about was Christine becoming the fattest toddler ever. She liked the idea that Emily and Rebecca wanted to fatten Christine too.<br>\r\nHowever the other part of her was a bit jealous. Christine was her piglet. Not the one of Rebecca or Emily. They had each other. She only had Christine. Why did she need to give them the piglet as well. She loved Christine and did't really want to share her.<br>\r\nBut at the other hand Rebecca only asked to help her feed her. She did't need to lose Christine. But when she was busy doing some things they could hold a eye on Christine being sure she kept well fed. To be honest that would give her some free time. She liked feeding the little piglet but it was sometimes a bit hard feeding since she made so much trouble. Perhaps she could sometimes help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Emily asked. \"Can we help? Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking. I guess maybe you can help sometimes when I'm busy. Perhaps you are allowed to feed Christine around then. But keep in mind I'm in charge of the piglet. Don't forget\u2026 she's a piggy\u2026 not a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for that part of rolling in the mud,\" Emily whispered so soft only Rebecca could heard, however it made Rebecca giggle, but Jennifer did't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know mommy. She's your piggy. But I was also allowed to help taking care of nibbles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's nibbles?\" Emily asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pet bunny,\" Rebecca said. \"Or he was. He died short before Kiekie was born. But I helped cleaning and feeding him, giving him water. I think we did take good care of him but... well bunnies don't live forever. I'm sad he's gone. But well. I guess he's in a better place now. At least that's what I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't knew you used to have a bunny,\" Emily said. \"But just like you were allowed to help take care of the bunny why would't be allowed to help take care of the piggy? By the way we did take good care of her while you were busy talking to that man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, I already said that you could help,\" Jennifer said.  \"You don't have to convince me any more. You two can help. But not right now. Right now I'm busy. So you can't feed the piglet. But you can feed somebody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at Rebecca who looked smiling back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready when you are,\" Rebecca said and laid back and opened her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily face glowed with happiness while she pushed some food in Rebecca's mouth. Jennifer stopped feeding Christine foe a second and took a look at the two lovers. They looked so cute. She took a look at Rebecca's growing stomach an realized she needed to take her clothes shopping soon. She did gain weight being around Emily all that time. Being around Emily was't good for her waistline. Or it was good depending how you looked at it. But Jennifer knew Rebecca would't have gained so much weight if it was't for Emily. <br>\r\nJennifer wanted Christine to be a shapeless blob of fat, but she wondered how much weight Rebecca needed to gain to satisfy Emily. Till she was also a shapeless blob? Or till she was immobile? Morbidly obese? Obese? Or just fat? Rebecca sure was going that way.<br>\r\nBut the she focused on Christine again. <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer was quite surprised with the eagerness that was expressed this was a complete one-eighty from just a few months, it was just so strange was to Jennifer to see Rebecca and Emily acting like this she just didn\u2019t know what to think of it but not wanting to stifle this new side of the lovers she just had to agree to their strange request, though the thoughts of jealousy arose in her Jennifer still agreed to their request. Christine was not happy about this at all, she did mind that she had two new people who were going to fatten her up into a massive sow, what really got to her was that her master thought it was a good idea, was this a test or some kind of joke for Jennifer? All these thoughts ran through Christine\u2019s mind not knowing what to make of this situation at all being lost in thought wasn\u2019t getting her anywhere, and asking her master was out of the question now for Christine as her limited knowledge was even more hindered by Jennifer. Being nothing more than a piglet there were only a few choice words she knew now since only able to oink and grunt for most of the time, it was all she had to say nowadays though it wasn\u2019t all she could say, No is one of her favorite words that she can still say. Another forkful of steak slid into her mouth not even paying attention to what was happening around her she didn\u2019t even notice that her master had stopped chatting with Rebecca and Emily. Continuing with what she was doing before Jennifer was so happy with how obedient her toy was being, it was a first in a long while where Christine was going to allow Jennifer to feed her without any fuss, being overconfident with the whole situation didn\u2019t suit Jennifer, being more gentle with Christine that she was before was unbecoming of a woman who dominated the little toddler into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on my little pet just a few more bites and you\u2019ll be finishing your first plate\u201d Jennifer cooed at Christine, grabbing handfuls of flab from the girl\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her flesh start to ooze between the spaces of her fingers made Jennifer blush, she knew that the girl was made to be a sow, she just needed someone with a heavy hand to guide her to her proper place in the world and that is what Jennifer is going to do everything else was inconsequential a blob lover is what she wanted and that is what she will have. Emily and Rebecca helping with this was a good change of pace instead of Rebecca always blabbing about how Jennifer might break Christine, an annoying thing that her daughter always made to be a point. Now that both girls wanted to force and dominate the girl who was quite younger than themselves was a great moment for Jennifer, to say the least, but it did make her leery as well not wanting to share Christine too much, it wasn\u2019t fair that they had each other and left Jennifer to her own devices while the kidnapped Christine as a third lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to be careful about this, I don\u2019t want to stifle this new spark of domination from the girls it will give me time to build a proper master and slave relationship with Christine but I don\u2019t want them to think that the piglet is theirs either\u201d Jennifer was trying to figure out how to go about this in the most basic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jennifer was trying to think about a way to go about this the two girls across from her were too busy with their own feeding session to see the frazzled woman, Emily pushing another greasy slice of pizza past the lips of Rebecca, who accepted it with all her being. Loving being fed by Emily only made each slice taste that more delicious, things seemed perfect at this Buffet it was quite a strange series of events that led to this day but nothing could make it better. Being accepted as a sub-master to Christine was a new feeling that Rebecca embraced whole heartily, knowing that her mother wouldn\u2019t allow her to get to close to Christine was fine as Emily\u2019s body and soul was her. Not knowing how to put it but she loved the high she got, was this normal for her should she love it or reject it, and did Emily think the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey umm. Emily, do you think it's normal for us to enjoy the fact that Christine is no longer human and is just a food bag now?\u201d Rebecca swallowing the last bit of food that she was given as she asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is she isn\u2019t a person anyways, we should have more fun with her, I mean didn\u2019t you love feeding her and feeling her growing stomach?\u201d Emily was quite adamant with her answer, smug in her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying with Christine while Rebecca fed the poor girl was something she wanted to experience again, there was nothing better to Emily than force-feeding Christine with Rebecca it was an orgasmic feeling to her and she wanted to experience it again with Rebecca by her side as a willing participant. Emily wondered why Rebecca was so unsure about this, it worried her to see Rebecca doubt what they did was right while no matter how Emily looked at it what they did to Christine was the right thing to do, she was just there to be a blob and learn to be a good piglet. Another piece of food slipped through Rebecca\u2019s mouth, slithering down her throat into her growing middle adding the pounds to her adipose was still Emily\u2019s biggest priority but it was good to stretch their minds on the possibilities of a little toy to deal with. This wasn\u2019t the only thing that was on Rebecca\u2019s mind, there was the more pressing matter of Rebecca\u2019s weight, sure Rebecca was a twig still her butt taking most of her weight away, there was the problem of no kid chair fitting the two orbs connected to her bottom but that wasn\u2019t the problem was when will they stop. Rebecca knew she didn\u2019t want to become like Kiekie or even Christine massive blobs of flesh she needed to know from Emily if that would be okay if she could still be mobile? This question was something that plagued the little girl as she needed to know the answer from her girlfriend, yet she was too afraid to ask it. thinking about it Rebecca needed to know she just needed the courage to ask, Looking at Emily Rebecca knew that Emily the girl she fell in love with would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....Emily can I ask you somethi....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... girls go get Christine more food she already cleaned her plate, if you girls are good and watch her I'll let you girls have time alone with her, but remember she is mine your just my helpers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer cut off Rebecca before she could say anything or even object to feeding Christine, Emily was already out of her chair ready to get the piglet another plate in the hope to explore Christine's body and force her fatter.</span></div></div>",

Go ahead,\" Jennifer said and smiled when she saw her daughter running after her girlfriend with a wobbling butt. \"Just look at that huge butt. You're gonna get one of those too you know. That butt and a belly to match. Just like your thighs and your arms face oh and even your chest. Until you just are a shapeless blob who can't move anymore and can't do anything except becoming fatter and fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca finally reached Emily. Both took a plate and went in line to get some more food. Emily knew exactly which kind of food were most fattening.<br>\r\nRebecca looked at Emily. She loved Emily. She was totally smitten at her and she knew Emily was too. She also loved it when Emily fed her and she had no problem gaining some pounds for her girlfriend. Some pounds were all fright for her but becoming immobile went a bit too far for her and Emily did need to know that NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily I need to tell you something,\" She started. \"I love you, you know that. I also love the feeding sessions with you. I don't care gaining a few pounds doing it but... I... don't\u2026 wanna\u2026 become\u2026 immobile. I don't wanna be so obese that I can't walk or can't do anything for myself anymore. That I can't even put on my own shoes or can't stand for longer then a few seconds. I would't feel fine with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grabbed Rebecca by her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca,\" She began. \"I love you and I would never ever wanna force you to do something you don't want too. As long if your fine with gaining weight I  love you and fatten you up a bit. But If you're not okay with gaining more weight we just need to cut down on eating junk food and candy and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess we also need to cut down on our feeding sessions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. We just need to feed you some vegetables. I can feed you breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even if you don't want to gain weight or even lose weight, you still need to eat. Without food you die. I heard that even when you are morbidly obese and can't or barely can walk and need a diet you still need to eat three times a day. But make sure the portions are't big and they don't contain too much calories. So If we get to point and you're not comfortable with, I stop fattening you. We can still have our feeding sessions. We have enough fat already to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled and remembered how much fun it had been to let Emily play with her fat and thought how much fun it had been to play with the fat of Christine. Fast she put some more food on her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have enough food. By the way don't need to feed Christine too much,\" Rebecca said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Else she does't have room for dessert!\"  Rebecca said and nodded to the part were the desserts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferent kind of ice cream, several pies, cakes and more delicious desserts and of course a lot of whipped cream. All kinds of stuff that would really put some meat on the bones of the piglet. Also the bones of Rebecca. And Emily admitted even she would be willing to gain a pound or so to be able to taste all those delicious desserts<br>\r\nSoon they went back to their table with the food.   </span></div></div>",

This wasn't the only reason why both girls looked at all the sweets with amazement, a workaround to one of their many predicaments was blissfully unaware of what the two lovers had in mind to do with the piglet at the table. Jennifer wondered where the two little girls had gotten to thinking that the mission she had sent them on was easy enough, though if Jennifer was honest with herself she just hoped her harsh tones didn't extinguish the flames of lust that Rebecca and Emily had developed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are a little nice to your me playmates, I'm hoping to train them as your handmaidens as you'll be to by to do anything on your own anyway\" Jennifer chuckled as she massaged the small globe that was Christine's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiling as much as they could carry, Rebecca and Emily looked at each other and grinned with glee, both girls carried two plates with them, one for just food and the other for their favorite part of a meal, Dessert. Piled high with things that would make anyone\u2019s teeth rot out and most if not all was for one girl, Christine wasn\u2019t paying too much attention to what they lovers were doing, it wasn\u2019t her concern none of the people around her were no longer her concern they were just in the way. All That Christine should have been concerned with it how to please her master and her two little disciples int the way to make a once lithe toddler into an immovable mass of flab. Training to be a piglet wasn\u2019t always just shoving food down into her gullet thought as she would soon find out, ever action that Christine will have to make from this time forward must be as sensual in action as it is in execution. Christine didn\u2019t know or care anymore, the outside world wasn\u2019t for her anymore being human wasn\u2019t something that the girl knew anymore she just was a pampered piglet and what her master wanted is what she will do. Now, this didn\u2019t mean that there wasn\u2019t any fight left in Christine, no, on the contrary, using her position as royal food bag she made it her goal to no accept any food willing. Being dominated by Jennifer was what Christine lived, for now, denying her master the satisfaction of completely crushing her spirits brought joy to Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look piglet, the little handmaidens have returned for food for you. My, my what quite a haul they have with them all to be placed in your belly\u201d Jennifer giggled before kissing Christine on the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clook, mom, we found the dessert section of the buffet I hope Christine, I umm mean Piglet likes all the food we got her\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay, Rebecca you can still call her by her name just remember, just because she has a name doesn\u2019t mean she is a person, she is nothing more than the embodiment of my desires, isn\u2019t that right little piglet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOink\u201d Christine enthusiastically answered not really knowing what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down all four plates Emily and Rebecca were ready to see if Christine would be able to even tackle the monstrous meal that she had in front of her, with the meal she just devoured sitting in her stomach there Christine felt like she was going to pop. Sitting up in her seat, allowing her chubby belly flop over her panties once again, not knowing if she was ready for the meal that she was meant to eat that laid in front of her, She needed to find a way to get out of whatever was going to happen,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked upon Christine with waited breath, seeing the girl look at the food eyes seeming to pop out of her skull with a shocked expression, Jennifer being who she is wanted to watch and allow the two little girls have fun as well, looking over to Rebecca and Emily she could see the glimmer in both girls eyes. Like starved animals the intently waited for Christine to start digging into her meal, Christine didn\u2019t want any part of what Emily and Rebecca wanted from her, the food which she had earlier was still trying to settle itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls I\u2019ll allow you to play with Christine if you be gentle enough that she gets the hang of your feeding styles, I\u2019ll teach you how to make sure Christine learns how to put on a show when it comes to stuffing her face\u201d Jennifer chuckled, seating the piglet right next to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca intently listened to Jennifer wanting to have fun with Christine and learning the girl\u2019s limits was a good lesson, but not knowing what it meant when Jennifer said that Christine will have to put on a show for them was quite an interesting notion to have. Allowing the girls to get to town with Christine was going to be an interesting thing to see, that was something that Jennifer knew to be true. Leaving her seat to allow the two girls to get close to Christine, Jennifer was anxious to see what they would do, directing them to how to dominate Christine properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy do you want to start Rebecca, I guess this would be an okay substitute from you becoming immobile right,\u201d Emily asked her lover, grabbing a fork of food for the piglet to eat, Rebecca knew that Emily meant what she said about always wanting to be with her and if she decided to lose a few it wouldn\u2019t matter, Christine could be her stand-in for Emily\u2019s desires anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she tried to turn away from Rebecca Emily pushed some food in her mouth and if she turned away from Emily Rebecca pushed some food in her mouth. Both girls seemed to like it and it seemed like the master liked it too. Then why did't she liked it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really is a little piglet, is't she?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well personally I think you don't have to force pigs to become fat. They're perfectly able to do that by themselves. We really needs to force the food down her throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Guess you're right. We really need to start working on your plan making her like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps she likes what's coming now. It's time for the desserts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine's vocabulary was't to big and since she was't allowed to talk it probably would't become any bigger but she could understand most things. She remembered that before she was send to her aunt she used to love desserts. She remembered them being sweet and full of sugar. She was a real sweet tooth but she felt kind of full. She knew very well that would't make any difference. It would all end up in her huge belly that was becoming bigger each day. She did notice she was also able to hold more food every day. She wondered when would this end? Also her clothes felt awfully tight.<br>\r\nRebecca pushed the first piece of dessert in her mouth. She must admit she did like the taste of the food but did't want to swallow it but knew she did't had a choice.<br>\r\nJennifer smiled seeing this. She knew Emily liked fattening but that Rebecca liked it too was something new. A feedee and a feeder. Both together in one. What a funny idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it still save?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. I've seen you cousin eat so much food without throwing up. I know for sure both plates fit in that belly of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I seriously doubt that. The food on it would probably fit but the plates\u2026 don't think so. I also don't believe they digest. I also don't think it's healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!\" Emily said sarcastic. \"But you're right. They won't digest and probably won't be healthy. Anyway, I was talking about the food on the plates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least the food on one plate fits in her belly,\" Rebecca said and showed Emily the clean plate. \"Start with plate number two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something happened. Christine belched and right at that moment her dress ripped. left and right was a rip. All the way up to her sleeves. Christine must admit this felt better. She looked confused at the two girls who did't knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Emily asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I guess just go on. Talking about small clothes mine are also very tight. If you would have feed me a few more bites my shirt would probably have also ripped. Or my pants would have split. Or my pant button would have popped of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wait here! Keep feeding the piggy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca lifted her shoulders and continued with the feeding. wondering what Emily was up to.<br>\r\nJennifer noticed what happened. Tomorrow she needed to take Rebecca and the piggy to go clothes shopping. She would like doing this. take the piggy into a clothing store. Buying some sexy clothes.<br>\r\nRebecca pushed the last desserts past Christine's lips and smiled. Christine felt totally stuffed with all the food inside her. She was so stuffed she was sure she could't eat another bite or she would explode. But then Emily came back with another plate full of desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Emily I really think the piggy has had enough,\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your right. However this is not for her. It's for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 what? For me. You want to feed me more. I just told you what will happen.\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"You did! And it turns me on. How many times I have the chance to see this? So open up. I want to see how your clothes rip of your body.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These thoughts were something that Jennifer would have to mull over in her own mind as at the moment the only thing that the girls\u2019 were interested in was each other, this was something that Jennifer didn\u2019t need to encourage as Rebecca and Emily loved exploring each other's bodies on their own. Not knowing how Emily was going to go about feeding her daughter was half of the excitement that made Jennifer excited to watch the show that was going on behind her, Emily taking a fork full of pasta ladened with a herb induced sauce. It was clear that things like onions garlic and oregano were pack into this sauce, creating a scent of tantalizing flavors that made even the stuffed piglet\u2019s mouth water with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere comes the choo-choo, open wide\u201d Emily joked with Rebecca, smiling ear to ear when gazing at her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u201d Mouth open and tongue out Rebecca was ready to accept the food offerings that Emily had for her growing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeedings with Emily were always such a sensual part of their relationship, though there were a few drawbacks when Rebecca herself didn\u2019t want to become like Christine just a toy for Emily to play with, Rebecca would much rather be the one who toyed with a person that being the toy. These thoughts flooded into both Rebecca\u2019s and Emily's minds more and more recently, seeing Christine force-fed all the time may have had some kind of trigger on them they didn\u2019t know. Another piece of food get into Rebecca a gleeful Emily had shoved it into her mouth, Rebecca didn\u2019t mind that she was being fed while deep in thought it made her whole experience more enjoyable, to be entirely honest with herself. Emily was always gently with Rebecca when it came to feeding, soft to the touch and always awaiting her, unlike the way she was with Christine. When forcing Christine Emily had taken over a new kind of personality, no longer quite as caring as she once was, using Christine as what she was intended to be a creature for pleasure. Rebecca wouldn\u2019t be on the receiving end of Emily\u2019s desires as unbound as they were, both of them had drastic personalities when it came to their desires, but this was something they had in common and now that Rebecca\u2019s mother had allowed both of them to use Christine for this strengthened their own relationship in its own ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy you really are quite the glutton, I never really realized how much I really do enjoy feeding you, Rebecca\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell, a girl has to keep her figure up doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Snarky in her response, Rebecca was too quick for Emily to retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling Rebecca\u2019s sides, her plush thighs were a dream to Emily, she never would think that there would be a girl for her who was the ultimate package, being and even have as dark thoughts as she once had, helping Rebecca see the beauty of commanding someone to your will was something that Emily was quite proud of though, she knew that Rebecca herself wouldn\u2019t bow to anyone as the girl was strong-willed and forcing the girl to do anything that she didn\u2019t want to do already would have the adverse effect. Neither girl was quite having the same discussion in their own minds but similar topics, Smiling at one another only made the two lovers blush in embarrassment. So much love flowed from both Emily and Rebecca that it was quite apparent even if someone didn\u2019t know the girls could see they were mad about each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're doing such a good job, babe all you have is just a few more bites and all of this plate would be gone\u201d Emily cheered, looking Rebecca up and down, the outfit that she had worn didn\u2019t look like it could hold out for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh its all so good, I don\u2019t know how you know what everything is my favorite, I need more\u201d Mouthfuls of food, Rebecca was in sweet bliss with each forkful of food that entered her gullet was like she was kissed by an angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was enjoyable for Rebecca, devouring everything edible thing that was placed into her mouth her clothes had a different option, the jeans she eloquently thought to wear didn\u2019t look so good. Stretched out in every which direction, not knowing how long they were going to hold out was something that Emily was anticipating. Rebecca though oblivious to the fact that her jeans were at their limits still felt the rising pressure that came from her stomach and thighs filling in every crevice that they could think to occupy. Not knowing when they were going to blow was half the fun for Emily, with every mouthful that was shoved into Rebecca\u2019s mouth there was the chance that something was going to break though this was the outcome Emily was looking forward to the most this didn\u2019t stop her from groping each and every curve Rebecca had. With her index finger, Emily began to poke and prod her lover, ever fold of flab, or corpus amount of flab was Emily\u2019s to tease and she wanted nothing more than to feel all the luscious fat that hung from Rebecca\u2019s diminutive frame. The girl had to weigh at least a hundred and fifty pounds it wouldn\u2019t be a lot on someone who was an adult but for a five-year-old, she was considered obese there wasn\u2019t any other way to put it, though she wasn\u2019t the biggest and with the special diet that Christine was on she was going to be forced to be third. Though Rebecca didn\u2019t mind this transition at all, being the one that was going to do this to the piglet, making Christine more fat than girls was erotic for Rebecca and Emily both girls were more than happy to pamper and take care of the piglet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud \u201cping\u201d sound echoed throughout the dining hall, finally giving weigh to the amount of stress they were under, Rebecca\u2019s Pants were officially ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat oozed out every which way it could taking up unoccupied space where ever it could, Rebecca couldn\u2019t be happier about it. Finally able to breathe for the first time all day was a great feeling, her body wasn\u2019t meant for pants though she didn\u2019t understand this quite yet. Regretting her decision the moment that she got to the buffet was circumvent by her desires to dominant and force-feed Christine when everything settled down is the time that Rebecca really felt constrained by her jeans. Emily admired the fat as it spilled out from every hole it could, though her stomach didn\u2019t compete with the large rear it still was enough that it caused her fitting jeans to rip and tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess these pants are done for\u201d Rebecca chuckled knowing her predicament was quite embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looking at the nearly nude Christine, all that was left from her outfit was her panties and the jeans Rebecca had just destroyed she knew that they had to go clothes shopping. Even though this was known Jennifer didn\u2019t know where she should go first, should Christine be her top priority and get her more outfits that a piglet would wear, something that show off her curves and feminine beauty while being a bit more revealing, or should she just go to a toddler story for Rebecca and by her some cute dresses?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jennifer loved her cute little piglet but decided that clothes were't to important for the piggy. Besides she kept the piggy inside and it was always warm inside. It did't matter much if the piggy crawled around just in a diaper. But it would be a bit strange for Rebecca if she walked around in her underwear just because she had't bought pants for her. It would look like she was't able to afford good clothes for her. Like she was a poor woman who barely have any money.<br>\r\nSo that was the reason that she was with her mom on the way to the store the next day. After searching through her whole closet Jennifer found some elastic pants. The fitted but it was clear they were stretched almost to its limits. Another feeding session wit Emily would probably ruin this pants too. But that did't matter. Rebecca was getting some new clothes today. She looked at her daughter in the rear view mirror. Rebecca's upper body was't fat. Perhaps a bit chubby but her lower half was morbidly obese. That butt of her was truly a sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rebecca you and Emily had fun at the restaurant,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca wondered it her mother mend feeding the piggy, or the ruining of her pants, or both. However she did't seem to be angry. How could see. A big part of the weight gain was thanks to her. Especially the weight of the piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was fun. But it was hard to keep up that ruined pants while we walked out. I really do need new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gonna buy some nice dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dresses? Are we only gonna buy dresses. No pants or shorts or perhaps a skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of buying those things if the gonna rip the next feeding session with Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca wanted to open her mouth to argue but realized that her mother perhaps was't wrong. She said her clothes were tight and Emily decided to feed her until they ripped. Because it turned her on. It had been fun. She must admit that, but if they did it too often it would really cut a hole in her mother's wallet for buying new clothes. Clothes were expansive. Or at least that's what her mother said. She did't really knew yet how much money was a lot.<br>\r\nRebecca looked up. A store with plus sized clothes. She did't knew that they were going here but was't really surprised. in a normal store some dresses would't be able to slide over her butt and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, Why is all of my weight in my butt and that of Kiekie in her belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I guess it got something to do with genes. You got some of me and some of your father. Just like Kiekie but clearly not the same.\" Her mother said sounding defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy is everything all right with you?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of the car slowly walked into the store. Rebecca looked around and saw a lot of other people with chubby or fat kids trying on clothes. She saw how her mother looked around amused. Probably imagining how Christine would look like after some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were can we find clothes for a five year old?\" Jennifer asked a clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes for five year old are on the third floor Miss,\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked up the stairs to the third floor but Rebecca noticed it took a little more effort walking up the two stairs. Jennifer looked for some nice dresses. However Rebecca looked if they're might be any pants that her mother might buy. Perhaps some stretchy pants.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't too often since Jennifer had taken an obsession with Christine that Rebecca and her mother spent any kind of quality time with each other. This was a different experience for both of them, each was usually followed with their significant other in some way or another, Rebecca didn't mind this change of pace at all hoping that this would allow her and Jennifer to become closer due to their recent discoveries that both had their own demons that they reveled in. Looking around the mall was enough to make Rebecca quite dizzy, so many shops and vendors littered the structure.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Come now Rebecca we need to get you some clothes, It looks like pants are your enemy now\" Jennifer chuckled at the little jab at her daughter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebecca couldn't deny that what Jennifer was saying wasn't the truth, splitting her jeans just the day before was something she really didn't mean to happen though she couldn't deny it did feel much better when she had breathing room. Coming up to the store that would cater to someone of Rebecca's size, a store that went by the name of Danielle's. Looking into this store it seemed it was all made for little girls of the bigger variety. Many types of clothes littered the different racks around the shop many bright colors and dull colors any kind of color a little girl was here for someone like Rebecca to enjoy. Jennifer never really did have any meaningful interactions with her daughter in quite some time it was just that Jennifer had become quite preoccupied with the force-feeding of her piglet that it never really crossed her mind that she should spend some time with her oldest daughter. With Emily on force-feeding duty with Christine, Jennifer could finally really get to know Rebecca as a person, Looking over some of the dresses and other types of clothes that were around that might just look nice on Rebecca and maybe brighten up that glum demeanor she always had on her face when around Jennifer. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHow about this Rebecca don\u2019t you think you\u2019ll look like a cute little doll in this\u201d Jennifer joked lifting up a sunny yellow dress to the body of Rebecca for comparison.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMom, you know I don\u2019t like Yellow, let's try to find some blue or green stuff, I would rather get some pants too so my underwear isn\u2019t seen by everyone too\u201d Rebecca huffed at Jennifer not thinking that the woman\u2019s suggestions were any good.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebecca\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t really on what was happening around her as she had never been this long away from Emily before, she was always around the girl from her time in preschool to the play dates that she was allowed to have when this crazy summer had begun. Wondering why her mother wanted to separate the two of them so much that she had given up her little pet to be guarded and played with by Emily, was this just a ploy by Jennifer to try to force Rebecca to join a harem of fat little girls or something more sincere? These questions were swirling in her mind, not able to really focus on what was happening in front of her all the clothes that Jennifer had picked out for her to try on and all the ones she picked out for herself were all quite a blur to poor Rebecca. Jennifer, on the other hand, was having quite fun with Rebecca, picking out a few dresses for the girl and some other stuff from swimsuits to even jeans, this place was a honey pot for Jennifer, to say the least. Finding things that could fit Rebecca\u2019s posterior was quite the challenge, yet it seemed like this place was perfect for larger girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, your blocking the dresses, can I just squeeze in,\u201d a timid voice asked <br>\r\nJennifer turning around didn\u2019t think she would be in front of a toddler, a very obese one at that, this girl seemed to almost be alone which worried Jennifer as no little princesses should be alone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sweetheart I didn\u2019t see you there, my daughter and I were just about to check out, though were are your parents I see they keep you well fed too\u201d Jennifer chuckled trying to make small talk with this toddler was hard for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with Tina, she is my feeder and she is getting me some food\u201d the young girl wheezed out, her whole body wobbled with each step the girl struggled to get any footing with her body being weighed down by each pound on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress the girl proudly wore looked more like a shirt than a dress her fat-filled it out some much that no matter what this girl did her panties were clearly visible for all to see. Jennifer and Rebecca were in awe of this girl no matter which way the looked at her they couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with the plumpness of each wobble and jiggle of this your piglet was. Already was it hard for Jennifer to focus on the clothes that she had picked out for Rebecca and now she didn\u2019t feel like the clothes were that important, just oogling this girl was all that was on her mind? Rebecca, on the other hand, had a better sense of will power than her mother and got back to the task at hand, many types of clothes. There were some pink ones and green ones, all looked enticing to Rebecca picking out a few new ensembles that would accommodate her growing self, though her mother thought it wouldn\u2019t be best for her Rebecca still snuck in a few Shorts and pants in her picks for good measure. Jennifer was entranced by the blonde headed girl to noticing anything anyways so she thought it would be best to do the shopping for herself, was she right Jennifer was much to busy in awe, not with just this blonde headed girl, no all the overweight girls that littered the clothing store. So many piglets in one place mad Jennifer grin quite a lot, thinking how great it would feel to be surrounded with all the obese playthings, maybe she could get close to one so her own piglet can have a play date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, little girl, Perhaps you and this Tina woman would like to have lunch with me and my daughter since?\u201d Jennifer hesitantly asked calmly in her demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Nicole and sure if it's okay with Tina I\u2019m always happy for a meal\u201d Nicole was glad to be fed once again though her dress didn\u2019t look like it was going to last with another meal inside her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later a girl walked inside. She seemed to be around sixteen. Still a teenager. The had dark red hair done in a ponytail and some dark sunglasses. She wore some dungarees and a loose shirt. She looked pretty cool. She wore a small backpack and walked over to the obese toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there my little eating machine. I have a box of cookies for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tina. But this woman wanted to lunch with you me and her daughter,\" She said with a sweet child smile. \"This is Tina, She's my feeder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssh,\" Tina hissed to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem. I'm a feeder too. That girl over there with that huge behind is my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did a good job fattening up her lower body,\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's not my doing. I'm not fattening her. I'm a feeder but not her feeder. I'm fattening up a other girl. Well that other girl is't really my child but her parents died and I adopt her so\u2026 But my dauhgter also has a feeder. Her girlfriend fattens up her. So I focus on the other girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice. Can I eh... see some photos\u2026 of the other\u2026 girl?\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer doubted for a few seconds. Sure she took photo's of Christine but kept those for herself. But she also enjoyed looking at Nicole and Tina was a feeder just like her so she decided it could do no harm. She took her phone, went to the photo's of Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very nice. She's a real piggy is't she. So you wanted to have lunch with us and your daughter. Well sure why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to find some nice clothes for\u2026\" Jennifer started but was suddenly cut of By Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done. I like those clothes,\" Rebecca said with a grinned next to a pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at the clothes she had picked and realized she did't thought about shopping after she had seen the fat toddler. She put the clothes she had back. She knew Rebecca well enough to know that if she did't like clothes she would't wear them. Since she was about three she chose herself what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. Rebecca, I and Tina decided to have lunch together with her daughter Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at the obese toddler. Nicole smiled at her and friendly stuck up her hand and waved at her. Rebecca wondered if her mother planned anything with this new girl. She was fat and her mother liked fat girls. So maybe she wanted something. She knew her mother was wicked enough to do some strange things. There was no way to say how far her mother would go. But at the other hand her mother focused on Christine and not Rebecca. Perhaps it was just a innocent lunch with a other woman and her daughter (Rebecca did't knew that Tina was her feeder and not her mother). After all the girl seemed nice enough. There was't a reason this was't a nice girl. <br>\r\nSure Rebecca was smitten at Emily. Emily was't just a friend but her girlfriend. But another good friend, just a friend\u2026 well why not? So so stuck up her hand and waved back with a friendly smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Keeping an eye out for these kinds of things was the on the top of Rebecca\u2019s list, she couldn\u2019t let her mother take advantage of another girl if that is even what Jennifer was after, not knowing what her mother really wanted with this couple was quite infuriating, to say the least. Tina seemed to be quite a normal sixteen-year-old girl, as she chatted with her mother it was obvious that she cared for Nicole a lot, though Nicole did also have feelings for Tina that much was obvious it seemed like food was the top of her list. Rebecca stared at Nicole in awe looking how fat this girl was something that should be admired, though she was little whale of a girl she did move well for her size, keeping up with the adults was something that even Rebecca had trouble with. Each step Rebecca took caused her own flab to wobble side to side, her pear shape didn\u2019t help when it came to walking this was something that she always had trouble with and one of the main reasons why she had decided that she wanted to keep her mobility. The food court was in the site all the many different places to get your grub on was in sight and Nicole knew this all too well, saliva pouring out of her mouth as the gotten closer and closer to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tina what made you want to fatten up this little chub muffin\u201d Jennifer asked, pointing to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t like this at first her brother had a friend named Nikki that was exceptionally large for her age, Nicole said she wanted to try it, though she seems to be better at it than Nikki, Nicole has no off mode so she naturally gained much more than Nikki did\u201d Tina Chuckled, Proud at what she has done with Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn\u2019t really care what the two women were chatting about it wasn\u2019t something that concerned her, there was only one thing that Nicole cared about and that was food. Rebecca, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of Nicole her self the obese child was a sight to behold, thought Rebecca\u2019s heart belonged to Emily she couldn\u2019t help but lust after the blob of a girl that was in front of her there was just so much of her and all Rebecca wanted to do was make her grow bigger and softer. Shaking her head to get these thoughts out of her head, as she knew that it wasn\u2019t proper to indulge in her fantasies, not wanting to offend this girl in any way shape or form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we get a place to sit down and we can have a nice meal?\u201d Tina suggested, pointing over to a nice booth that was at the edge of the eating area of the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that would be best, wouldn\u2019t you say so Rebecca?\u201d Jennifer asked her daughter, noticing that she was intently looking at Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm yeah I mean I don\u2019t want to tire Nicole out by walking farther anyways\u201d Rebecca shocked with her mother asking her as being in a dream-like a state before thanks to her intense look were focused on this whale of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole knew that Rebecca was looking at her with lust, but Nicole really didn\u2019t mind nor cared anything about it. Nicole knew what she was to people now, being nothing but a sex object fitted her role quite nicely and Tina was always feeding and pampering her excessively so it all worked out for the best. As long as the girl had gotten food for her stomach she was quite happy to be taken care of, being considerate an object for people to play with wasn\u2019t anything new for her, she enjoyed that people thought she was cute and sexy it made Nicole always feel wonderful to find out people wanted her and do things with her. Making their way to the booth each group sat down simultaneously, Rebecca and Nicole looking at each other, the same was true for Jennifer and Tina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I think I should get some food for us all, can you help and watch Nicole for me,\u201d Tina asked Jennifer before getting up from her seat and walking toward one of the many restaurants around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can I think this would be a great time for Rebecca to get to know Nicole anyways\u201d Jennifer responded, patting her daughter on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye to eye with Nicole looked on at the obese girl with somewhat wanting eyes, the dark thoughts she gets when looking at Christine had enveloped her mind as well. Though not as strong of feelings when she looked at Nicole they were still prevalent to Rebecca. Not wanting to look like a complete weirdo in front of this girl Rebecca thought it would be a great time to make this girl her friend, or an acquaintance at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cso\u2026 uh\u2026do you also watch Sofia the first, it's my favorite show\u201d Rebecca struggled to make small talk, tripping on her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah she is good, I much rather like tangled more though, I am a princess after all\u201d Nicole chuckled causing her multiple folds to jiggle as she laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was quite mesmerized with Nicole and just how much of her there was, is this what she was trying to create when it came to Christine or just something larger than even this girl? A large growl coming from Nicole was just the indication that the girl was hungry, though even Rebecca was quite hungry in this environmental so many different smells and different ethnic foods were around both girls anyone would be lost in the scents that were coming off of them. Jennifer though was quite interested in this little girl she just wondered what other little piglets did Tina know, though she said that Nicole gained thanks to a girl named Nikki made Jennifer quite curious if there was a network of fat-loving girls or were they alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Nicole, Tina was saying that you gained thanks to the help of a girl named Nikki?\u201d Jennifer asked, peering at the little blond girl, looking at every fold and roll looked like it wanted to get out of her way to the small baby blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah my brother was good friends with a girl who was around his age who likes eating, so she was fat, she used to be much bigger than me and now I\u2019m bigger than her thanks to Tina\u201d Nicole proudly stating, eyes beaming with a sense of accomplishment.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJennifer was astonished of how well Tina had done with Nicole not knowing if there was a cut off for the little girl thought it didn\u2019t matter what was astonishing was just how big Nicole had grown, at that time Jennifer had seen that Tina began her return to the table. Food piled high in front of Tina, various things from Cheeseburgers and Chinese food littered the tray she had, though it was quite obvious which tray was Nicole\u2019s. Tina not forgetting her new friend\u2019s trays as Tina had a hard time to balance all of them at once.</span></div></div>",

She became a princess over a night just because her mother married the king. Her step siblings are first one in line to get the crown. She still needs to learn how to be a princess.\" Nicole said grabbing some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But she's learning every day. Besides, how old is Sophia? Eight or nine.

Lots of other kids to so\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Rebecca stopped talking. Not because they did't liked talking but because they were both focused on eating the food. The feeding of Emily did stretch Rebecca's stomach. She could eat a lot more then before. But well at least she could eat by herself. That was way better then getting it forced in your throat, like Christine. Emily fed her of course but not with force and Rebecca knew Emily would stop if she was full unlike Jennifer who would stop when she wanted to stop. To bad For Christine. Rebecca felt a bit bad for her cousin. And now she was helping forcing food down Christine's throat. But at the other hand if she did't do it Jennifer would so it did't really matter.<br>\r\nShe looked over at Nicole who was stuffing her face like a true gainer. Rebecca wondered if Nicole liked food, gaining or both? Probably the last but still she was curious. It was clear that Tina wanted her fatter. She was just like Jennifer, Nancy and Emily a feeder. If the were a feeder then what was she? Well if you wanted to get really fat you needed a feeder before you got so fat you could't move anymore.<br>\r\nNicole showed she could eat. Food went past her lips pretty fast and was gone in a few bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she chew the food? Or tastes it?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Tina said. \"Nicole take it easy or you get a tummy ache. Again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole kept eating. Still pretty fast but slower then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Nicole would like it to come over for a play date,\" Jennifer suggested. \"I'm sure we have some of that\u2026 what was it... Sofia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sofia the first mommy. She's the first princess named Sofia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she won't become queen. Her stepsister Amber becomes queen.\" Nicole said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. She's kind of spoiled, and a bit selfish, a bit vain, and don't want to lose, and thinks what she says and thinks is the way it needs to go, and is jealous, and never wants to try something new, and wants to have it all, and is sure that what she says is right, and is a bit mean sometimes but still she has her hart on the right place. Besides Sofia would't wanna become queen. She's to busy becoming a protector and finishing stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing I don't like about all those princess movies is that all those princess have such tiny waists,\" Jennifer said. \"It looks like all those girls suffer from anorexia. I have no problem when a few of them are thin but all of them. I mean the people who make those shows have eyes right. Look outside! Not all girls have such a tiny waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. More then 50 % is fat. So you would think some of those characters in kids movies could also have a few more pounds. Why don't they do that. Did't they see hair spray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Hairspray had a lot of black people. I never  saw a black princess in those Disney movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there are. Tatjana in: the princess and the frog, and Kida in: Atlantis. However Kida was't really like most other Princesses. You know fancy dress and Tiara. But you're right. There are only two black princesses in all those Disney movies. That's not much. Now about that play date\u2026\"  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jennifer and Rebecca were in the mall having a wonderful lunch with some new friends Emily was made to be in charge of the little piglet, as Nancy was training Kiekie. Kiekie was looking thinner than she once was, as she wasn\u2019t given as much food as she once consumed. Though she was forced to fast for the time being as Christine, on the other hand, was given all the food she could want and more, the new power dynamic of Kiekie and Christine was slowly shifting toward the toddler. Emily didn\u2019t mind this at all as she has grown to appreciate what Jennifer was doing to Christine and wanted to help with the woman\u2019s plans for when it came to Christine. There was definitely an allure to making Christine bend to her will that was something that Emily couldn\u2019t deny. Looking at Christine Emily was quite pleased with what she saw, the girl was a slow gainer, to say the least but it seemed as if that was coming to an end, her body getting used to gaining was having some adverse effects to her body. The Chubby toddler only seemed to be getting fatter and fatter as time went on, though it wasn\u2019t like she had any choice in the matter she was nothing more than a toy for her master and now Emily and Rebecca have seemed to join in on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry piglet your master will be back sooner or later, but I\u2019m here to watch after you and keep you well-fed\u201d Emily chuckled as she was excited about what she was allowed to with Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA saddened \u201coink\u201d came from Christine hoping that her master would come back soon to love and cuddle the poor toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer exclaimed that Emily was in charge of her little pet and that as long as she didn\u2019t break the toddler than Emily could do anything she wanted with Christine, which was music to the girl\u2019s ears, sure she would rather be apart of the shopping spree with Rebecca but this was a great conciliation prize that she had on her hands. So many dark desires filled the girl\u2019s head that she almost forgot that Nancy was around too, though she didn\u2019t think that Nancy would stop Emily from acting out what she wanted to do but just as a safeguard from Emily\u2019s most extreme ideas more than likely. Nancy didn\u2019t mind seeing Emily embrace the force-feeding side of this fetish, but she didn\u2019t think that Emily would use Christine for her dark thoughts. This was something that surprised Nancy, not in a sense that it was out of character for Emily, no that isn\u2019t what shocked her was how Jennifer had taken the a liking to having Emily dominate Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Nancy I think Christine is hungry can I feed her now?\u201d Emily sheepishly asked her caretaker, not wanting to really bother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapped out of her daze, Nancy looked down at the excited face of Emily who was waiting for Nancy\u2019s answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Emily there are two cheesecakes in the fridge for the piglet you can feed her one now and one later, your girlfriend and Jennifer won\u2019t be home until eight since they are having mother-daughter time anyways\u201d Nancy chirped, happily helping the girl to force this piglet to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Christine over it was obvious that she was well fed competing for second place as with Rebecca was going to be hard, to say the least and then fighting the whale of a girl Nancy was tending too was going to be even harder to get but knowing how Jennifer\u2019s thinking was it was quite possible that Christine would outpace and outgrow both these girls. Emily didn\u2019t understand what Nancy was going on about though she didn\u2019t care all that mattered to her was Christine and watching her balloon to giant proportions, the feelings of making that happen were almost orgasmic for Emily the only thing that would make it even better would have been if Rebecca was there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily skipping to the fridge, Emily was quite delighted in the thought of what she is about to do with Christine all with the blessing of Jennifer on her side. Looking into the fridge there were quite a number of delectable goodies that Emily would have been willing to shove into the tot's body, from a whole baked ham to some delicious looking Jello with some kind of fruit inside, it was hard to choose but finally what she was searching for came into view. Quite a large chocolate truffle cheesecake was crammed into the fridge all for Christine to enjoy something that Emily was happy to shove into the small tot\u2019s mouth. Christine, on the other hand, was fearful of what was about to happen to her not knowing how Emily would be with her. Christine worried what was about to transpire, outfitted in her favorite My littler pony shirt and panties to match, its wasn\u2019t like she was going out today anyways so Jennifer didn\u2019t bother to dress up her piglet anyways, only placing Christine\u2019s hair int cute twin-tails was all she had gotten today from her master, rushing out the door with Rebecca before giving her to Emily. The shirt that once fitted her quite beautifully now was stretched to its max distorting Rainbow dash\u2019s form as it tried to hold back all the flub. Each day Christine wondered if this will be the last day she would be able to wear her favorite shirt. The thought of losing her shirt to her fat was enough to make her sob about what her life had become, Emily though didn\u2019t understand what Christine was crying about didn\u2019t much care either as she had her own plans. Emily wanting nothing more than to be enveloped by the blob that was going to be Christine she was going to follow through with what Jennifer wanted and that was to for Emily and nancy to teach Christine how to make every bite she makes a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, piglet its lunchtime I\u2019ve got your favorite cake, I guess its time to practice your eating technique\u201d Emily chuckled, stroking one of Christine\u2019s hair, a huge grin on her face on what she is about to do.</span></div></div>",

But she also knew very well that the cake would been forced down her throat one way or another. At the same time she must admit she was hungry. Jennifer stuffed her with so much food every day her stomach was stretched a lot. Also her body got used to having a full feeling and she was't full.  Christine wondered what to do. <br>\r\nShe did't thought she was a human anymore. She was convinced she was turned into a piglet. She had't said a word in weeks except for: \"Oink!\" what perhaps was't really a word but more a sound. Someway she was now a piggy. Just like the prince who was turned into a frog. What did pigs cared about? Eating was one of them. She did't knew what to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on piggy. I have some delicious food for you,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie heard it. And tried to get towards her but Nancy grabbed her around kiekie's fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't. We put a lot of hard work into letting you lose weight. We're not to going to let all that work go to waste. You stay here. You need to lose weight until Christine is way bigger then you. After that you can eat whatever you will and gain as much if you please as long if you don't become fatter then Christine. Understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Kiekie did't understood. She just understood a few simple words that she could't even speak out. She did't cared about much as long if she got enough food, clean diaper and enough sleep. However she was more happy then most past days, except for the day thew went to the restaurant. Nancy fed her more food then just some icky greens. She fed her also other stuff. It clearly improved Kiekie's health. She seemed a lot more happy. However she still wanted more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily brought some cheesecake to Christine's face. She still had mixed feelings so she tried to turn away but at the same time opened her tiny mouth and Emily forced some cake in it. Christine chewed. It was chew or choke. So it was a easy decision. She chewed and must admit that the cheesecake tasted good. That was from her point of view the only good part. Most food she was fed was tasty. That was one of the reason this was still bare able. More and more bites were forced past her lips. No matter how much she tried to resist Emily knew a way to get more of the cake in her mouth. Emily was a professional.<br>\r\nThe more food was forced into the little girl, the tighter her shirt got. Emily was full aware of that. She hoped one thing would happen a fed the piggy even faster. Emily just fed the piggy the last bite of cake when she got her reward. Christine ripped through her shirt at the sides. Christine looked disturbed at her favorite ruined shirt and burst out in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's not so bad,\" Emily said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get her a new shirt. Perhaps she's a bit cold,\" Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty warm in the room. So that seemed a bit unlikely. However Emily returned with a bigger shirt but as soon as she tried to remove the ruined shirt Christine started to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like she don't want a new shirt,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree but then why was she crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was still sobbing while she tightly hold on to her my little pony shirt.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine\u2019s mind was almost at the breaking point her, shirt was just one of the things that made her question her humanity, all she was good for was to eat and please other people. Emily was happy with what she made transpired, creating the massive piglet was her dream she didn\u2019t care if Christine didn\u2019t want that, nor if Jennifer told her to stop, Emily was going to force Christine to grow no matter what. Nancy was shocked that Christine\u2019s shirt finally gave out it was something that Jennifer was hoping would happen, it was the only thing Christine still had around that was from the time when Christine was still considered human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry piglet this is a good thing it means your growing\u201d Emily chuckled, softly stroking Christine\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine\u2019s flub was definitely expanding, each day it seemed like her stomach had gotten larger and rounder, each piece of her begun to grow and there wasn\u2019t any way that Christine could stop it. A slave to the people who took care of her, she wasn\u2019t her own person, just a slave to the pleasures and wants of others. Looking down at her body Christine saw the effects it was to her body. Her once lithe body rounded out with fat, her stomach settled nicely into her lap something that she hadn\u2019t experience once when she had the love and support of her parents. How much did she weigh now she must be at least a hundred pounds of fat on her body she thought, when will she be big enough for her master and Emily. Emily quite enjoyed the dark side of force-feeding herself, looking the utter shock and sorrow that came with Christine realizing that her shirt that once fitted her when she was thin was now nothing but a shredded piece of cloth was delightful, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily do not worry about dressing her anyways she is going to have to get used to being nude all the time anyways not like we can find clothes for her when she is fatter\u201d Nancy scoffed, thinking on how it was utterly useless to try to clothe a sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy, although she had her own piglet to look after. It was quite better when the girl on her lap finally stopped wailing with not getting fed only green stuff. Mixing it up with other healthy choices did help with that as well but it wasn\u2019t going to be the end of her weight loss program. Christine finally had a real chance to grow and Kiekie needed to learn her place as the second fattest. Nancy thought it would be good training to teach Kiekie her place, though the girl didn\u2019t know anything about the outside world being less greedy would be something that Nancy would have to instill in the girl no matter what. Looking over the tot, she wondered how could she stop the greediness that Jennifer allowed to run rampant, now Nancy was the one who needed to cull this girl\u2019s hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily are you done with the piglet, cause I need your help with Kiekie\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost, I don\u2019t know what I should dress her in her selection aren\u2019t really that cute or seem to be too small\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat is probably the case, her clothes are only from when her parents dropped her off but don\u2019t worry, Jennifer is with Rebecca picking out clothes for her\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off this, as she is too focused on Christine, Emily before going to the beckoned call of Nancy thought it would be best to examine the piglet\u2019s growing body. Every angle was taken into consideration, from her shapely thighs to her growing stomach, Emily groped and prodded Christine. A small \u201cUrp\u201d came from the overfull tot, Christine didn\u2019t know what was going on her mental state was uncertain at the moment, all she did was follow the orders that Emily gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get a good look at you, looks like I\u2019m gonna have to get you to stand piglet\u201d Emily was quite clear with what she wanted from Christine, grabbing her hands and helping her to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up on two legs was tricky for her, the wobbliness of her footing didn\u2019t make it Emily very sure that she could do this very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my just look at you you're getting rather plump I must say, your master and I are going to treat you well,\u201d Emily whispered while she grinned like a Cheshire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n looking at the fat Christine has accumulated, only made Emily giddier for the future. The ripped sides of her once precious My little pony shirt that her own body had torn asunder only made the sting of her transformation from that of a skinny girl to a piglet that much more hard to take. The fat of her stomach oozed from the open pockets caused by the ripping of her shirt only enticed Emily more. Once allowed to dominate and control a girl was something that she had always wanted to do but never wanted to do it with Rebecca as she would have no control over someone her own age that wasn\u2019t willing, but Christine was perfect. Knowing that Rebecca herself had reserves of the though of dominating Christine, Emily on the other hand begun to relish in the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching underneath the stomach of Christine, Emily began to lift up the full gullet that was Christine\u2019s stomach. Feeling the weight of it was wonderful, knowing that this was the start, Rebecca might have a second thought when it came to putting this piglet in her place but Emily didn\u2019t have such qualms. Stroking each part of Christine\u2019s plush figure gave Emily a feeling of euphoria, she knew that there was greatness to be had in Christine and she will break the girl to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo lay down piglet, you did good, I have to help Nancy now\u201d Emily stated leading Christine back to her crawling state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was shaken just by how authoritative Emily was toward Christine, is this how Emily really was? Now the problem on hand was Kiekie, girl was still trying to see if there was anything left of the cake, as she struggled to get away from Nancy. Nancy didn\u2019t think she had seen the girl move so fast before, using all of her energy Kiekie wanted nothing more than to go to the plate that once held the massive chocolate truffle cheesecake. Emily knew this of the little glutton, though she didn\u2019t know how far the girl would really get. Seeing her body wobble with each uneasy crawl was quite amusing to watch, lighting Emily\u2019s heart ablaze with ecstasy from the performance, she wanted nothing more than to watch the little baby in her hypnotic crawling that even made Emily pant with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere does she think she is going, it's not like she is going to eat anything over there\u201d Nancy chuckled knowing that Kiekie was doing this all for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiekie, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really care, sweating while she crawled making sure her hands crush her massive stomach. It was the most prominent thing of her body, so large it was that all of her private parts were obscured with her stomach. Even as she crawled around in nothing but a diaper, her stomach was still the biggest touching the ground like a waterfall of flesh. Though Nancy had kept her composure, Emily had enjoyed each movement the obese toddler made sent her in a mode of fluster. Having a head like a ripe tomato Emily didn\u2019t know what to do as all she really wanted to do was kiss and play with Kiekie folds of fat. Kiekie, on the other hand, didn\u2019t know any better, to say the least, it wasn\u2019t as if she was trying to look hot or even sexy to Emily all she wanted was cake, though her mission was for naught it wasn\u2019t anything that Kiekie understood or cared to understand. Before either Nancy or Emily could act, Kiekie found her way halfway to the cake tray before she was exhausted by her own acts. Huffing and puffing Kiekie could no longer move, too tired to do anything all Kiekie could do was to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess she resolved it for us, the little fatty couldn\u2019t even walk forty feet to her prize\u201d Nancy chuckled at how ridiculous it really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow out of shape really was Kiekie, though she wasn\u2019t fit, to begin with, her balloon of weight was finally catching up with her Nancy guessed. Though there was a lot going on it all seemed to calm down both, piglets were down for the count making it easy for Nancy to sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With those rubbing thighs, butt the size of two basketballs. You gonna have a belly so big it touches the floor when crawling. Pillow like arm with chubby hands and sausage fingers. Your cheeks so round pink a puffy that looks like you stuffed a jawbreaker in each of them. That's gonna be you. You're gonna look just like a bigger version of that. But we won't stop there. Oh no. We're gonna go further. Those legs of you are gonna be useless. You won't be able to walk anymore. You legs will be so fat that it looks like you have tires around them. Your arms gonna look like huge pillows. So heavy you won't be able to lift them with fingers that looked like overstuffed sausages. And your belly is gonna be the biggest. Thinks this big. It's gonna be so much bigger. A huge ball of fat that pins you down to the floor. Like a huge beanbag chair attached to the front of your belly with your boobs on top of it. Just look at your chest. you have them. It's all fat of course but they're there. I gonna have them too in a few years but mine won't be fat... well at least\u2026 not all of them. I think. I guess there must be something in there that makes milk. Anyway that does't matter. you're gonna have several chins and that cheeks of you are gonna look like  bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked a bit scared. Was this really what was gonna happen. Was she gonna look like her obese cousin that was lying there on the floor, and was that just the beginning. She did think it was. It seemed like it was going to be this way. Her master always talked about making her fatter and fatter. Becoming a fat sow. But Emily gave her a proper description about how she was going to look. She did't look forward to it. She started to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she does't like it,\" Emily said and suddenly she grabbed Christine's belly and shook it.\"This one is gonna be so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her hands on Christine's belly and softly rubbed with her hand over the swollen tummy of the piglet. Christine did't say anything since she must admit this stroking her belly felt nice. At least she stopped sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look the piglet likes it. But she did't seem to like what was going to happen. Kiekie seems to be happy. Or at least more happy since you started giving her other food except greens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I realized she needed vitamins. She is still a growing girl. Fine she grows more sideways then up wards but still she will grow taller but for that you need stuff that is in meat and fish and grains. Without enough of those things\u2026 you don't grow and you're not healthy since\u2026 well you need those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I like this. Ever since I was little I like seeing cartoon characters on T.V getting fat. I like fattening others up and now I have Rebecca and this piggy. Poor Kiekie. I thought the plan was to train her to lose weight while we train Christine to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was the plan,\" Nancy admitted. \"But it did't really worked. Sure Kiekie lost weight but she's still morbidly obese and still fatter then Christine. But still she only can think about food. She just wants to eat and get fatter and she does't like this. Especially not since before she could eat herself the size of a whale. But well Jennifer wants her fat but not fatter then Christine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... wait a second. So after Christine is the size of Kiekie Kiekie if free to gain again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not right away I guess. You know Kiekie has a bottomless appetite. If we let her eat what she wants after the first pound the piglet has more then Kiekie she probably beat that record within a hour. Then we can start all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo first the piglet has to become fatter then Kiekie, and after that she needs to gain a lot more weight to make sure she stays the fattest, and then Kiekie is allowed to gain again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably she wants fat daughters but her niece needs to be the fattest. I sure hope the piglet gains very fast because I find it kind of hard denying Kiekie food. I like it more to fatten her up. That's why I joined\u2026 but now I need to do the opposite and I need to let her lose weight. Ah well. As soon if the piglet is much fatter the Kiekie I can continue fattening her up again.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> <br>\r\nWhile Christine\u2019s heart was chilled by the prediction that Emily had made about her future Rebecca and her mother were having lunch with some new friends. Jennifer and Tina talked about how they had found comfort and lust for someone much younger than themselves. Jennifer had no shame about what she was attracted to, nor did she think it was inappropriate for a woman like her to be in a relationship with a two-year-old. Tina was new to these feelings herself though there wasn\u2019t any twinge of fear from what other people think when it came to what she was doing, she couldn\u2019t help like Nicole, the girl was always a sweet button when she ever babysat her, Nicole loved Tina too if she was honest. Though the little girl wasn\u2019t paying attention to what the adults were talking about anyways none of what she what they were talking about was of no consequence to her all that she cared about was the food in front of her nose. Being inside a food court had its benefits especially when it came to girls like Nicole, so many choices of foods always made her taste-buds go a flutter, Rebecca, on the other hand, didn\u2019t understand this feeling that Nicole had when it came to food. Though they both did gain it seemed that Nicole\u2019s reasoning was different than Rebecca\u2019s, as even though they both were fat little girls albeit one quite fatter than the other, one gained for the person they loved and the other did it for what Rebecca didn\u2019t quite know. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026. Nicole, If I may ask why did you start gaining?\u201d Rebecca meekly asked trading glances with the gargantuan toddler<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTina\u2026.Uuurrrp\u2026. was the main reason, She\u2026.Slurp\u2026Began force-feeding me and I begun to love her for it\u201d Nicole answered between each mouthful, ripping and tearing through her fifth big mac.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis shocked Rebecca, she couldn\u2019t understand why she would gain for someone who force-fed her all this food. Looking at the girl as she devoured each thing that was in front of her was a show to behold, everything that was put in front of her disappeared a few seconds later into the massive gullet that was her stomach. The thing that was supposed to be her dress was stretched to its absolute limits, looking more like a tent to Rebecca it made her wonder if this girl had an off switch or even if she could stop eating anymore. Tina, on the other hand, had thought Nicole was the perfect little girl her only desires were two things to keep on eating and to be loved by Tina. Slowly and surely the once large pile of food that was laid before Nicole was disappearing into her mouth, while Rebecca could only watch in both fascination and amusement. Though Rebecca was a feedee for Emily, she also awakened the tendencies her mother had when it came to force-feeding people, something that she thought that she shouldn\u2019t give into. No matter what it was if it was either food or drink it would end up in Nicole\u2019s stomach she didn\u2019t plan on stopping either. Rebecca wondered why she would make herself so fat in the first place, it seemed like the girl didn\u2019t care about being mobile at all forgoing everything else to just eat for her master.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Tina force-fed you, I mean you seem to be eating it all on your own, you sure she just like to see you eat\u201d Rebecca questioned the girl, she didn\u2019t see any of the darkness that she has experienced with Emily or even her mother. Tina seemed nicer to say the least if not a little strange for loving a girl so young and so fat. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou want to see what happens if I don\u2019t eat, I mean it's not pretty\u201d Nicole huffed, stopping her constant motion of shoving food into her face, a grin on her face Nicole turned to Tina.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTina I\u2019m not hungry anymore, I don\u2019t want any more of this\u201d shoving away the tray that was laid in front of Nicole, still bursting with a good size pile of burgers and pizza slices, as well as other more sweet things.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking at how much was left Tina couldn\u2019t understand why the girl stated she was full, knowing how much the girl can put away this was quite a conundrum, to say the least. As if there was a shift in the air Tina\u2019s kind demeanor changed, a dark aura surrounded the once happy and peppy teenager. Tina was neither angry nor furious with Nicole, it was just a cold and calculated, as she lifted from her seat to assist the little piggy with her meal, a wide grin appeared on the face of Tina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Now Nicole why must we do this almost every day, you know that your mine and mine alone, body and spirit is mine\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not your plaything I will fight you, Tina\u201d Nicole placed a brave face, but there was a smile with it, as the girl had already submitted to the feeder a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina stood behind Nicole wrapping her arms around the rotund girl, placing her face right next to Nicole\u2019s face, her hands going a little more south, grabbing the sizable adipose that was apart of Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh finally standing up for yourself are we, you and I both know its too late I mean your just a piglet in human clothing\u201d Stoking one of the multiple folds of fat that she had. Her Blue dress stretched to its limit thanks to the feeding she had received from Tina. Grabbing one of many burgers that littered Nicole's tray she gently undid the wrapping that surrounded the burger. Three layers of meat were inside this monstrous quarter pounder, so big that it would make an adult satisfied for the rest of the day, Tina looked up and down of her creation wondering why she was resisting her future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my dear Nicole are you going to eat it all by your self or am I going to have to feed it to you?\u201d Tina asked, hand still playing with all that Nicole had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not eating more, your going to have to force-feed your piglet\u201d Nicole teased, knowing that any defiance got under Tina\u2019s skin. Nicole was fearful of her Master, yet at the same time, she relished in the ecstasy of being tied up and forced to be a piglet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not going\u2026.,\" Nicole started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next moment Tina pushed the quarter pounder inside. She hold Nicole tight with her arm wrapped around her pushing the food inside with the other. Rebecca was a bit shocked. Her mother had force fed her before. However since Christine came into their life she was only focused on Christine. Emily did feed her but never by force. Of course her mother did force feed Christine and she and Emily did that too. But this seemed to be with a bit more force. Nicole had been right all along. It was't a pretty sight. It seemed Tina did really force feed Nicole if she did't finish her food. However Tina did a good job at fattening her. Nicole did't seem to like the force feed but at the other hand it seemed like she liked eating before Tina started force feeding her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee mommy,\" Rebecca whispered. \"Nicole did also eat a lot before the force feeding. It seemed like she liked it to eat and gain. Well perhaps that's something for the piglet. Find a way to make her like eating, gaining, become fat and getting fatter. If she starts liking that it might be easier fattening her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. You know Rebecca that might work. It's a good plan. Only problem is how do I make her like it? I would like it if she was more willingly to gain. But how do I do that? I tried making her a piggy. That worked but it did't changed her appetite even while she's a piggy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for ears, tail, snout and lying in the mud,\" Rebecca whispered softly. \"Well Nicole did eat a lot of the food by herself. Perhaps Tina knows a way how to make the piglet like it to become a fattened sow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina said that She knew a girl name Nikki that was obese and seeing her made Nicole like it. So we need to find a fat girl that's happy being fat and might teach the piglet it's fun to become fat. Perhaps that might work. I mean we can trey. Can't hurt I guess. But were do we find such a girl? I mean we can forget doing it with Kiekie. Especially since she needs to lose weight. But... we can use Nicole. Perhaps Tina would like it to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking Tina forced fed everything on the tray to Nicole. There was sauce around her mouth and food stains on her dress. Rebecca looked at her side and saw the dress was already tearing. Just a few threads were left but the were at the point of ripping too. Nicole looked like a turkey stuffed for thanksgiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now my cute  piglet is properly fed I guess we can make a play date. If you still want to of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great. By the way I could use your help. I want my piglet to get fatter but she makes trouble with eating all the time. Perhaps you can help her to become a bit more like your Nicole. That would make fattening her up easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca realized that by doing this they would have less fun time fattening Christine. But at the other hand Tina force fed Nicole too.She would eat more herself and they could force feed her some more after she did't want any more. And perhaps if Christine got a lot fatter then Kiekie they might start feeding her too. However Kiekie did't need to be force fed. Se would eat anything edible that came near her mouth.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a play date...\"  </span></div></div>",

Rebecca didn\u2019t know what was next for her and her mother, though they did go clothes shopping already and Rebecca did want to get back to Emily and tell her about the new friend that she had just met, this decision was for Jennifer who seemed to only want to talk to Tina at the moment. Before long and plans were made, Jennifer couldn\u2019t believe that the girl who was just forced to eat enough for ten men still wanted more she wanted to know the secret from Tina, this playdate seemed to be the perfect place to find out how she got Nicole to be the way she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for this enlightening experience, I\u2019ll see you next Saturday, be sure to park in the back\u201d waving at her new friend as Jennifer took the hand of her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Nicole hope to see you soon\u201d Rebecca waved to her friend as well, not able to take her eyes off of the body of Nicole, feeling warm, Rebecca wanted nothing more than to see Nicole bigger than she already is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina and a weak Nicole waved both Rebecca and Jennifer off, as they finished their escapades throughout the mall. It was true that they did get clothes for Rebecca so what was next on the agenda the little girl wondered. Pondering what else she could need or want in this store was abruptly stopped by the tugging of her hand, her mother was in full determination mode. Jennifer had a set of things that she needed to get done before going back to the house from getting Christine more revealing and proper clothes, stuff that will entice and excite Jennifer, For that she knew the only place to go was somewhere where they could find stuff that would fit a little girl but be a bit more on the sultry side. Rebecca wondered where they were going, it was hard for her to keep up with her mother as with each step a wobble of her massive rear made it almost impossible for Rebecca, though she was a massive pear shape there were some strengths in this fact her calves and thighs weren\u2019t all just fat there was some powerful muscle around her wobbling flesh. Quickly she tried to keep up with her mother who was on a mission of sorts, she needed to get back to her piglet and stock up on food for her newest arrival. Eyes darting around Jennifer was looking for one particular store, the one that they were previously it was nice and she was going there as well but it also had a sister location. This location was what Jennifer was looking for, a place that she would be able to get the cutest outfits and maybe some more risque ones too for her piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom where are we going now, I\u2019m tired and still hungry\u201d Rebecca wined her feet hurting from walking so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a store called leather and lace, after that its some shopping for food and then dinner at home\u201d Jennifer stated, eyes darting from one side of the mall to the other, looking for any sign of this phantom store. Eyes shifted over every place that she could look at, Jennifer thought was getting a bit annoyed with the mall not knowing if this place she was looking for even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this place is in this mall, mommy\u201d Rebecca questioned the validity of the claim that this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n going to from the second floor to the bottom Jennifer looked for this place. The ground floor was her last grace, though not many people went here as there weren\u2019t many stores down there to Jennifer it was worth a shot. Taking a deep breath to clear her mind from the anger she felt from not finding this shop, feeling all the anger leave her she Jennifer opened her eyes. There in front of her was the shop she was looking for, though it seemed to be a bit smaller than the store upstairs there was a little bit of an antiquated familiarity to it. The online forum that told her about this place didn\u2019t do it service, there were many kinds of clothes and tools that were in here for Jennifer could make her piglet wear. Like a kid in a candy store, Jennifer began to pick out a few outfits, none looked like they were made for a toddler to wear showing much skin of the person who would wear these outfits. Having so many choices Jennifer begun to stock up from baby-dolls to other lingerie looking things Jeniffer made sure that she didn\u2019t stock up too much as she still needed to go back to the other store for other more acceptable outfits. Knowing that Christine was growing still, Jennifer thought it would be best to get various kinds of sizes for her little piglet to wear while still fattening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, there isn\u2019t much cloth to these outfits, don\u2019t you think piglet will be cold?\u201d Rebecca thought to ask not knowing what they were really doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell, Rebecca these outfits are to make piglet look good not be functional\u201d Jennifer told her daughter not even looking down, as she was quite focused on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiekie or Rebecca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets see.\" Nancy said and thought. \"I'm not sure but we both know Kiekie is very fat. I knew for sure she used to be heavier then Rebecca. In the meantime Rebecca of course got a huge butt butt I'm pretty sure Kiekie is still a lot heavier then her. Also the fact that Rebecca is a lot older then her. Compared to age and height, Kiekie is way fatter then Rebecca. But at the other hand Kiekie is losing weight. So it's hard to tell. Does't really matter to Jennifer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. She does't care about the others. She wants them all to become the fattest kids ever but she has the prize baby. The fattest kid ever. That's the only reason she wants Kiekie to lose weight. That's not a good reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. But Jennifer is in charge. Rule 1: She wins. We can't do anything about it. But It's hard to tell who becomes fatter. It also depends on how fast the piggy gains weight and how fast Kiekie lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And later she need to gain all that weight back. Would't it be easier to let her stay this weight. Don let her lose or gain weight but keep it the same. The piggy is gaining so she will finally catch up and continue gaining and after she gained more weight Kiekie can gain again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice but I'm not sure Jennifer agrees with it. But I can talk with her. Perhaps she agrees. But for now no. They have been gone for a while now. Well I guess Jennifer want Rebecca to eat . Probably do a little grocery shopping. Getting more food for the piggy. Say what do think about gaining weight. By yourself I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh I never thought about that. I'm not sure. I guess I would't matter gaining a few pounds. Might look good at me but getting obese or even morbidly obese? I don't know. I like fattening others up. Never really thought about myself. Besides if Rebecca get's morbidly obese she might need help with some things. I can't her help if I'm just as fat. So I don't think so. Rebecca also don't wants to become immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think Kiekie does't care as long if s he can eat. So I guess the outcome is that the piglet becomes the fattest, then Kiekie and third one is Rebecca. So there you have your answer. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Let's make the piggy fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked up. She had't talked for a while except saying: Oink! She had't learned to say more words. However she did learn to understand more words. And she knew what those words mend. She slowly leaned back against the wall. What was the point in refusing if it was forced down her throat one way or another? Perhaps she could better just give up.<br>\r\nEmily walked over to her with another  cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up piggy. More food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine took a deep sigh and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine had just given up to try to run away from Emily and Nancy they were too overpowering, her body was small and weak she knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get away from these two. Just opening her mouth to eat seemed to be the best course of action, why try to fight it her destiny was to become a massive pile of flesh for people to play with her, groping and being kissed was all she had to look forward to she wasn\u2019t human anyway. Christine wanted to fight but she was still so full from the last cheesecake that lethargy had taken over her overfed gut rested on top of her panties the band doing its best to contain all the fat that Christine had accumulated was finally piling on more and more she food she ingested previously still hadn't fully digested, Christine was quite afraid of what is going to happen to her when she had to eat another cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I know you can eat it Christine\u201d Emily's encouragement was nice to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t know if she should even attempt it, being left to wear nothing but her panties since her most favorite shirt was all but a pile of rags now did give the little girl some breathing room. Nancy thought it would be best to help Emily out, her other young ward was still on the floor sleeping off her exercise she unknowing did on her own, Kiekie lying there like a pile of meat soundly asleep on the carpeted living room floor. Getting a knife from the kitchen Nancy elegantly begun to cut up the Cake, not one piece was bigger than the other, like the perfect maid it was done with precision and speed. Nancy knew the limits of the girl and knowing what her friend wanted she thought it would be best to only give Emily a few pieces of the cake and not the entire cake as she didn\u2019t want the anxious girl to ruin Christine\u2019s large dinner or break Jennifer\u2019s most favorite toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, slowly feed the girl, she seems kind of full so take it a slow as you can stomach Emily\u201d Nancy reiterated to Emily, knowing how obsessive the girl has been when it came to forcing Christine to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the first slice to the open mouth of Christine Emily was happily feeding the greedy girl, seeing the glazed look of Christine though didn\u2019t have much of the same spark as it once did. Emily didn\u2019t know what was wrong but Christine being the way she was now wasn\u2019t fun for her, not wanting to make this food go to waste Emily shoved it into Christine. With a sigh, Emily had successfully fed one piece of cake into Christine. It wasn\u2019t the same not in the least, there was no defiance of hatred behind the eyes of Christine anymore, this isn\u2019t something that Emily had lusted after it was just sad. Seeing how unenthusiastic Emily did raise some questions for Nancy she didn\u2019t understand what could have changed in the girl she didn\u2019t know what was happening. Emily was getting what she wanted she was feeding Christine as she dreamed about, so why wasn\u2019t Emily more obsessive like she was before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201csomething the matter Emily, you seem a bit glum, didn\u2019t you want to fatten Christine up?\u201d Nancy questioned, she was trying to understand the process of why Emily was being like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it's just that she isn\u2019t crying or fighting back anymore, it just seems like there isn\u2019t much of a point to do this if she isn\u2019t going to sob\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell, she can\u2019t fight when so full, to begin with, don\u2019t worry about it just keep doing what you're doing, not all times you feed her can be full of sorrow for Christine you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to lift the spirits of her little ward, Nancy was on the right track with this patting Emily on the head to reassure the girl, taking this opportunity it Nancy thought it would be best to keep the conversation from earlier going thinking about how to weasel in the thought of Emily her self in the conversation hoping with some sort of clarity to what the girl was thinking on the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you could try to feed your self if you wanted to I mean I know we chatted about you gaining do you even want to?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a gainer, I like being thin and forcing other to gain for my satisfaction, being thin is better for me to help Rebecca out anyways, so I don\u2019t want to give that up I much rather be thin\u201d Emily strongly stated, a little annoyed that she was questioned again about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there was feeding going on at home, Jennifer was in a little slice of heaven, there were many outfits that were just the right size for her piglet and others that seem like Christine would have to grow into. Rebecca didn\u2019t understand the logic behind most of these outfits though as she couldn\u2019t tell why someone would wear them most looked to be just bikini\u2019s or are too small to cover much some were looked like they would be fun to wear at night and others looked like Halloween costumes just that someone who would wear this would be showing off more skin than Rebecca would like. Jennifer had a few outfits already in her arms waiting for more to catch her eye, she didn\u2019t think there would be a lingerie section for two-year-olds but here it was, right in front of her and Jennifer was happy to pilfer its contents of this store. Rebecca didn\u2019t know how she felt this store her mind trying to figure out what purpose this kind of store was really about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, why is there so little material to these clothes they don\u2019t look like they would cover much\u201d she questioned wondering about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell dear these are not for functionality, there are to make the person look attractive, like piglet her main purpose in life is to be beautiful and attractive to me Rebecca didn't quite understand what her mother was getting at, she had limited experience on what being sexy means she didn't think about it too much, though 5here was one thing that she wondered did Emily find Rebecca sexy or beautiful? This was something she just had to know, Emily was the only one for her and Rebecca wanted to do everything she could to look good for her girlfriend. If these outfits we're supposed to enhance your beauty in someway Rebecca wanted one. Looking around the store at all the kinds of bedroom outfits for little girls and little boys respectively Rebecca found one that looked like it might fit her and was just her style. Finding various colors and outfit stood out to Rebecca chose a few to accentuate her body wanting no ordinary kind of outfit but something that makes Emily go wild. Finding a bunch of clothes very appealing she just grabbed three, making off with some that were to spark Emily\u2019s heart ablaze. With Jennifer clutching all the clothes for her piglet, to different types of underwear to outfits that Jennifer would force Christine to wear, all pink in fact and the outfits that Rebecca had they were all set to return to the other store where they met Nicole to shop for Christine to have normal clothes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A while later they returned to the car both carrying a few bags with the new clothes. They put them in the car. Rebecca was kind of tired. She was surprised. Her mother had taken her to the town before and she never had been so tired. Suddenly she realized that the last time she took her to town she did't had this huge butt. She did't mind it or want to lose it but carrying it everywhere was hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we can go to the supermarket to buy some nice food for my three hungry girls at home and prepare for that piggy Nicole,\" Jennifer said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca thought that she did't had three hungry girls. Kiekie was the one who was really hungry. Christine was force fed and Rebecca was only hungry for Emily. That food was involved\u2026 well she was fine with that. as long if Emily liked it. She could't wait to see her. She knew Emily was waiting for her at home. At the other hand she had fun stuffing Christine. She would rather doing it with Christine and thought so would she but well she let Emily have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're here. Come on out of the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca struggled to get out of the car and waddled inside while her mother took a cart. Rebecca knew this super market she had been here so often. Fast she looked through the aisles. She stopped by the aisle with some cheap toys. But no one really go her eye and she turned to the magazines. Sometimes there were funny comics. She could't read yet but she could look at the pictures. They were fun, and sometimes you did't really need to read comics to understand the story. The pictures were most of the time more important then the written words. She flicked through some comics for a while until her mother saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are. You always liked it here. Most kids ran straight to the candy aisle but not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked in the cart. It was filled with the most greasy and fattening food. It did't really surprised her but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy\u2026 I really think we need to eat more vegetables. Maybe some fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Kiekie also needs food of course. How could I forget that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca rolled with her eyes that was't really what she mend. She wanted that they all ate some vegetables so they would at least be healthy. She sighed. She wondered how her mother ever became a good parent. She seemed to care more about her cousin then her own daughters and she did't believe forcing kids to become fat was good parenting. However she still loved her mother. And she liked this shopping with her. It was the most mother daughter thing they had done in a long time. The last time was before she had a butt the size of two chairs.<br>\r\nHowever her mother also put at least some healthy stuff in the cart. Rebecca waddled after her mother to pay for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Christine belched trying to ease the pain in her overstuffed stomach. The feeding had't been much fun but it never had been fun. But she must admit eating was better then getting it forced down your throat. <br>\r\nKiekie was sad. After all her hard work she did't even get a single crumb of cheesecake. She still did't understand why she was't allowed to eat herself fat and round. She was a fatty. Why could't she be fed like her cousin? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca knew that her mother was trying to prepare for the arrival of Nicole for next week but there was just way too much Junk food and not enough for healthy but fattening stuff, she just didn\u2019t want to make the wrong impression when it came to Tina and Nicole something that Rebecca could relate to. Nicole did send a spark inside Rebecca though she was a feedee herself there was some kind of beauty of seeing a girl who had no knowledge or care of the repercussions her life might have if she just keeps eating with no care or wants to ever stop. Rebecca didn\u2019t want that for herself she much enjoyed being mobile and able to do some things for herself, being obese was just fine for Rebecca and Emily supported this point that her girlfriend had made. Though Rebecca herself didn\u2019t want to be immobile that didn\u2019t mean she did not enjoy seeing a girl turn into a pile of fat and flesh, this is why Christine was the best way to vent these lustful feelings upon. Though Emily and Rebecca knew that sole ownership of Christine was to Jennifer it was a stroke of luck that her mother let them help with force-feeding her to become the entity of Jennifer\u2019s pleasure that she was meant to be. Emily gladly did it, happy to feel the rush of pleasure that came from each tear that Christine cried and each pound she gained, Rebecca was still had her reserves about it. she did it with Emily, and she did think that it was quite amorous what they were doing, them doing it could only deepen their love for one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we have enough, though I don\u2019t think I like the selection of meats they had, and I hope you girls like fish\u201d Jennifer chuckled, placing two large swordfish cuts into the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells weird, I hope it's going to be tasty\u201d Rebecca was quite unsure of the choice of dinner her mother had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was healthy for them to devour which was a start, Rebecca much rather have some pizza or some cake than fish. She wasn\u2019t against trying new things but fish just seemed to be quite different from what she is used to. Looking at the cart she could see that her mother was trying, more leafy greens and even fruit was in there though that wasn\u2019t the only thing that was in the cart this was to be expected when it came to Jennifer and her desires. Rebecca couldn\u2019t wait to get home to Emily and tell her of the girl she had just met, thinking that her mother was a special case was a little arrogant of Rebecca she knew that there were different people in the world but meeting another person who wanted nothing more than force a little girl to be a pile of fat and flab was out of the realm of possibility to Rebecca. Checking out couldn\u2019t have happened at a better time, Jennifer struggling with the carriage as it stood was the point she knew that it was time to leave and that she would have enough for a few weeks at least. An egregious amount of food was pack in such a little space, it was a godsend that nothing was crushed too badly, the bread was a bit mangled, that was to be expected though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you had fun at the mall today Rebecca, we should get out more you and me\u201d Jennifer smiled, loading all the food she had bought into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah mommy it was fun, we never do it anymore\u201d Rebecca happily replied, hoping to do this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t before long that they were on their way back home, with goodies and news of a new friend in tow. While Rebecca and Jennifer started to drive back there Emily and Christine were enjoying each other's company. With two cakes shoved into her small body, Christine wasn\u2019t looking forward to Dinner. Emily, on the other hand, was busy herself, though Nancy thought it would be a waste of time and energy to dress the piglet as she would just outgrow the next thing they put on her Emily saw it differently. Looking at all the hand-me-down clothes that Rebecca graciously had given to Christine there were some quite cute outfits though the still might have some slack they would look just great on Christine. Many things were in this pile of old clothes from dresses to jeans even some hats were mixed in made it quite hard to find exactly what she was looking for. Finding something that Emily like better than the other things was going to be a challenge something that she expected. While she took care of finding clothes for Christine, Nancy was in charge of watching a sleeping Kiekie and a fidgety Christine. Nancy couldn\u2019t help but watch Christine as her body struggled to adjust to the weight of cheesecake that was nestled in her gullet. Nancy wondered why this resisted Jennifer, though it didn\u2019t matter her destiny was to be a blob no matter what. Looking upon her Nancy could already see the feedings affecting Christine\u2019s body that the were looking for. Her non-existent stomach had now ballooned to an orb of sizable depth, though she was nowhere as fat as the sleeping whale on the floor it was still a great start to what they were trying to create.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you fight it girl, you know your going to be an immovable mass sooner or later, being smart, being active and having free will are behind you all you need to do is look beautiful and be obedient so give up\u201d Nancy only told her the truth, in her cold way.<br>\r\nDefiant as ever Christine spoke up \u201cI\u2026. love\u2026Master\u2026 want\u2026. be\u2026thin\u201d the girl struggled with the sentence as it has been months since she talked normally but got through it in defiance of Nancy\u2019s statement.<br>\r\nThough Christine knew that all her fighting didn\u2019t matter in the long run as she was still growing and treated as an item not really as a person, this didn\u2019t matter to Christine though she didn\u2019t want to give her master all the power and there was a sort of delight that came with being force-fed that Christine would never give up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only squeal. I seemed also like it took her a lot of effort saying those few words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we tell Jennifer?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No better not,\" Nancy said. \"She would't like it if she found out the piglet spoke. She probably will be even angrier if she heard what the piglet said. Does't really matter. She will become a immobile blob, no matter if she likes it or not. So she can better accept it. Fighting back will only make it harder. For her and for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment they heard the front door open. Rebecca waddled in as fast if she could. Emily dropped what she had in her hands and ran towards her lover. Rebecca opened her arms wide and hugged Emily. Emily enjoyed this since she sank a bit in Rebecca's fat. Nice soft and warm. The two lovers walked (in Rebecca;s case waddled) inside and Christine followed with some bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how bad was it?\" Emily asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest it was't so bad. We needed to go to a plus size store. Obvious. Or do you think those would fit in normal pants?\" Rebecca asked and slapped her huge butt. \"Anyway we had fun together. We also met two other people. Nicole and Tina. Tina is a feeder and Nicole is a feedee, and I can tell you she can put away a lot. Don't be jealous Emily. That's on of the seven sins. By the way you don't have to be. I'm still totally smitten at you. But I think Nicole can become a good friend from me, and you too. You like fattening. She likes eating and becoming fatter. So I'm sure you two would get along nicely. Don't worry. We set up a play date so you can come on the same day like she. But we had fun and found some nice clothes. We also went grocery shopping. However I sometimes think we really should eat a bit more vegetables and fruit. For the vitamins you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes those are important too. However I don't like most vegetables. Fruit is fine but most vegetables taste icky. Kiekie fully agrees with me. However she did eat her vegetables today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because her diet changed. If I only were allowed to eat vegetables I probably also get sick from them and did't eat them. But together with other things\u2026 they're not so bad. However I had a fun day but how was your day? Whole day alone with Nancy, Kiekie and the piglet. At least you were allowed to feed the piglet. How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to know that too,\" Jennifer said. \"Did you feed the piglet good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Emily fed her two entire cheesecakes that now are resting in her belly so I think she did a good job,\" Nancy said. \"However Kiekie still wants more food. She tried to crawl towards the cheesecake but the exercise from crawling to were the cheesecake was was so exhausting for her she passed out before even reaching it. The poor thing. Does she really need to lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jennifer screamed. \"I told you before: my piglet is gonna be the biggest. Did't you understand that. Kiekie can become fat but the piglet becomes the fattest? That's final.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understands that but Christine would become fattened up anyway. So she will get bigger then Kiekie sooner or later. That does't matter is she loses or stays this weight. So she can eat a bit more so she keeps this weight. Until she's dwarfed by Christine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do like her more fat... so fine. But I warn you, She needs to stay this weight or lose weight I don't care but don't let her gain. Let's make that clear.\" Jennifer said it on a tone like she gave a little kid lecture. \"By the way what were you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for some nice clothes for the piglet. So I looked through some hand me downers from Rebecca seeing if there was anything nice for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet but Rebecca's clothes don't fit her. They're a bit too long I'm afraid. When Rebecca wore those she was taller then Christine and I don't think she was this fat. But I have some nice clothes here that would fit her. Come little piglet I dress you up nicely. Rebecca why don't you take your new clothes up to your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Rebecca grabbed Rebecca's bags and walked or waddled up to Rebecca's room. When they were inside Rebecca dropped the bags and looked at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Emily,\" Rebecca asked. \"Do you think I'm....\" <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Rebecca knew that her girlfriend did enjoy the darkness and domination she had over Christine, but Emily spending time with Christine made Rebecca herself doubt if Emily even found her sexy to begin with. Rebecca didn\u2019t want to think about it too much she didn\u2019t want their relationship just to be about her growing fatter and fatter, was Emily just attracted to her due to the fact she was grown to the obese girl she is now, was there anything more to their relationship or was Emily just attracted to her fat. Many things were weighing down Rebecca she needs some sign that everything was okay and that Emily hadn\u2019t just moved on to Christine due to the fact there wasn\u2019t a cut-off point for Christine\u2019s growth. Emily felt this tension coming from Rebecca, not knowing that this is how her lover felt when force-feeding Christine was a little disheartening to hear from Rebecca. She had to make Rebecca feel much better, Emily did think that Rebecca was beautiful to say that to Rebecca made Emily feel embarrassed though. From the freckles on Rebecca\u2019s face to her fiery red hair and emerald green eyes all the things that she had gotten from her late father made Rebecca desirable to Emily. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course you are, I want nothing more than to play with your body and love every inch of it\u201d Proudly exclaiming to Rebecca, making sure she was comforted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c I just feel like, you enjoy Christine more than me and that just messes with me, do you like Christine?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI like Christine like you would a toy, what I would like is if you would enjoy forcing her to eat other stuff too. I know your sweet Rebecca but she isn\u2019t a person you have to know that she is just a doll for you to play with\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI know this, but I just don\u2019t want to hurt her, if it would make you happy though I will try\u201d Rebecca somberly stated, this was something that they could do together then Rebecca will learn to give in to this side of her.<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that Rebecca didn\u2019t like seeing Christine as a toy or a beautiful doll it was more that she still though Christine as a person. Though she didn\u2019t want to think of Christine as a toy, Rebecca didn\u2019t see a way for Christine to escape her fate. Thinking it even might be good for Christine, she was already a dumb blonde so why not just be a bimbo for them to lust after.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try Emily, do you still find me desirable though? I want to be everything you want\u201d Rebecca stuttered not knowing if what she was saying was the correct thing to say, her mind in a bit underwater with multiple feelings.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEmily being insightful as she was picked up on this little hiccup in Rebecca\u2019s thinking, Clasping her hands around Rebecca\u2019s calming Rebecca from worrying about it too much. Emily had ideas with what to do with Christine if Rebecca wanted to do this with her then who was Emily to try to stop Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, I always find you very appealing to say the least, when you started to gain you became more desirable I want you to know that I love you and will always love you\u201d Emily adamant showed Rebecca her true feelings, landing a peck on Rebecca\u2019s cheek showed the pear-shaped girl that she had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was at ease, Rebecca was so tense when she saw that Emily was quite obsessive when it came to Christine it only made her feel more and more like she wasn\u2019t enough for Emily. Though Emily did still want to force-feed Christine and play with her, Emily just wanted to do it more with Rebecca. Rebecca herself had some doubts about it but then again there were some benefits to it as well. Rebecca did find Christine quite beautiful in her own right, experiencing force-feeding Christine and putting her in some of the outfits that her mother had gotten for the little piglet might be nice. Rebecca wanted to give it a try, she did have these dark thoughts in her mind and although Christine still fought it, still trying to act like she was as intelligent as she was when her parents alive this was all an act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Emily, I did get an outfit that was just for you but maybe I can wear it when we feed Christine tonight\u201d Blushing, as Rebecca knew that the outfit she was referring to was a tad revealing, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, If you want to wear it I may just cuddle you to the floor, I'm going to have to kiss every inch of you tonight anyways\" Emily chuckled, wanting nothing more than explore Rebecca's body, though she also wanted to see Rebecca give in to her darker side and force feed, Christine.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the way you did't answer my second question. Do you think I'm\u2026 sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest\u2026 I don't know really because I'm not sure what sexy means. Not exactly. I mean we're still very young. Perhaps a bit too young to really know what we can find sexy. I don't have much experience whit it. I mean my older cousin said he found his girlfriend sexy. But well he's about sixteen just like his girlfriend. I mean we still have eleven years to go until we're that age. I think we figured out what sexy means by then. But I guess I think\u2026 that I find you sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca seemed happy. To be honest she also was't sure what sexy exact was but guessed it had something to do with people in love. Like she was in love with Emily. She really was totally smitten at Emily. But Emily was at least honest. She could't really tell if she thought Rebecca was sexy because she did't knew what it was. After all the ones who talked about it were older. Perhaps it was something that only older people had. Just like boobs and beards. But sexy was something in your head instead of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I also think you're sexy,\" Rebecca said. \"But I must admit I also don't really have experience what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not worry about it yet. I guess we find out what sexy means. I mean there are still a lot of words we don't know. Just wait and we'll find it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say wanna see a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. As long if it's not finding Nemo. Not that it's a bad movie but I've seen it over a dozen times. I know every line by now.\" Emily mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl I met liked Sofia the first. So I guess we wait with watching that until she come here. How about\u2026. The princess and the frog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I must admit that that princess is also a bit to thin for my tastes but... well they all are so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really are all thin. It's a bit unrealistic. Just look around there are so many fat people. So make a few fat Princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should really make those. Besides princesses are rich so they would be able to buy enough food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily watched a movie While Kiekie was still sulking about the small amount of food she got and Christine was rubbing her stomach trying to speed up the digestion of the cheesecake in her belly so that she would have more room for when she was fed.<br>\r\nLater Jennifer called Rebecca and Emily inside the kitchen so they could have dinner. After that they could both feed the piggy. Both smiled hearing this and fast ate their dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're done with dinner! BURP! Oops. Excuse me. Now can we feed the piggy?\" Emily asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait a few minutes,\" Rebecca said. \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer lifted her shoulder and decided to already got the food for the piggy. A few minutes later Rebecca came back. Wearing one of the sexy outfits from the store. I clearly showed a lot of skin. Especially around  her belly and her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Rebecca asked. \"What do you think?\"    <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow, you look super good Rebecca that purple is a great color for you\u201d Emily was quite astonished by what Rebecca had put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither knew what sexy meant but Rebecca thought that this piece that she had picked up was something that emulated it. Emily didn\u2019t know what to say, being utterly speechless at how great Rebecca really did look in her new outfit. Though this definitely wasn\u2019t something that someone would wear out in public it did accentuate the various parts of Rebecca\u2019s body. Entranced by how Rebecca looked everything else seemed to be inconsequential to her, Rebecca didn\u2019t know if she was looking sexy, strutting a pose that she once saw in Us magazine thinking that this is what adults found to be sexy. This piece that Rebecca thought to wear was called a baby doll, purple in color it didn\u2019t hide much of her growing body. Wearing what was supposed to be a thing was hard enough for the pear-shaped girl as the panties didn\u2019t look like they were there, sure they protected her front have from being on display but when it came to her rear, they were no to be seen. Rebecca\u2019s cheeks had essentially absorbed the small string-like material into its sell, Rebecca\u2019s rear end did come equipped with enough flab that it wasn\u2019t hard to see the girl\u2019s butt obscuring her thong on its own. Her butt cascaded around the panties enveloping them, Emily was taken aback by just how fat Rebecca really was not really understanding how many pounds the girl had really packed on in a few months. Jennifer was quite interested in her daughter as well, feeling a sense of pride in Rebecca\u2019s feeble attempt to look sexy, though Jennifer had no interest in her daughter sexually it was good to see that Rebecca was trying to look good for Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Rebecca darling that baby doll looks so good on you, I think you need to get a bigger size next time we go to the mall. Your panties look as if they might be a bit tight on your butt, I think maybe just a size up would be good.\u201d Jennifer\u2019s concern was spot on when it came to her daughter\u2019s choice in size of the lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think your right, it's digging into me a bit\u201d Rebecca agreed with her mother, grabbing one of the sides of the panties. Rebecca pulled it away from her body showing there wasn\u2019t as much give to the material as originally thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was stunned at how beautiful one outfit made Rebecca looked, was this what adults meant when they were talking about what sexy is? it wasn\u2019t just another one of her many other outfits, Rebecca had gotten just for Emily to admire and cherish Rebecca no one else. All kinds of feelings erupted from Emily's strong feeling of lust and desire came from her looking onto Rebecca while wearing this baby-doll. Seeing every part of Rebecca only made Emily want the girl more, though it seemed as if the upper parts of her body were quite unaffected by her weight gain that didn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t touched in some way by Rebecca\u2019s gaining. Just by looking at her arms it was easy to see they were thicker, it was easy to compare them next to Emily\u2019s and could clearly see they were even bigger than the young girl\u2019s neck. This wasn\u2019t the biggest thing on Rebecca either, though she did sport a bit of a double chin her pride and joy were how much fat had accumulated on her backside and thighs. It might not look much compared to an adult as the five-year-old was one third the size that didn\u2019t matter as even thought that this was the case Rebecca's behind could easily fill a chair on its own but this was later accentuated with her thick thighs taking up the rest of space. Though her stomach wasn\u2019t as large as the rest of her, it was easily poking through the lacy purple cloth of the baby-doll hanging off of her body, covering up her privates further just by how much of her there was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was happy to see Rebecca in this outfit though she was more excited to see Rebecca accept the dark side of herself, Christine might not like it but it would be a great show, to say the least. Emily not wanting to wait anymore to watch Rebecca force-feed Christine with her immediately grabbed one of the many types of desserts that littered the table. Though dinner was done with, as each member had their fill of fish and collared greens settled in their stomach Christine wasn\u2019t done eating. A large chocolate mudpie was waiting for her to eat, Jennifer didn\u2019t mind that Rebecca and Emily dominated Christine as well Jennifer knew that Christine was her pet the collar around the girl\u2019s neck made that known to all. Before Emily and Rebecca could dominate Christine Jennifer had to prepare her pet, not wanting to be upstaged by her daughter it was time to get one of the outfits she had just bought for her little piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, girls you get everything ready and I\u2019ll prepare Christine for you two, Rebecca do not worry about it just have fun with it\u201d Jennifer calmly stated, picking up Christine from her highchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer soothing voice put her daughter at ease, was it noticeable that she was a bit tense? Though she didn\u2019t have a problem with Emily force-feeding Christine she never really did anything like this before she didn\u2019t know if she would do a good job and it was weighing on her mind. Wanting the approval of Emily Rebecca was about to try it and love dominating the little piglet.</span></div></div>",

Anyway I enjoyed feeding her. I really liked it. But I like it even more to do it together with you. That we both force feed Christine at the same time. I really enjoy that. Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I really like that. However one part of me feels a bit bad for Christine. I must admit that. But I like feeding her more then feeling bad for her. I'm also doing it with you. And my love for you is way bigger then feeling bad for her. Besides my mother will force the food down her throat one way or another. Does't mind if we do it or she.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. However when she grows up she might not like you?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can live with that. I can maybe make her understand that it woud't have made any difference when we fed her or my mother. Oh there she comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah how cute. Look Rebecca. She has the same outfit like you. She looks adorable. A bit like twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smile when she placed Christine down. She had chosen the same outfit on purpose. However it fitted Christine better. Since Rebecca had the lion part in her butt that was very big compared to the rest of her body while Christine more gained all over her body.<br>\r\nHowever Emily knew that pears shaped like Rebecca was a lot healthier the apple shaped. She was happy with that since she wanted to have a long time with Rebecca. To grow old with her. Perhaps some kids. One way or another  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you girls have fun. I expect that she eats everything on those plates. Understood. You're done when I only see empty plates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily nodded excited and both grabbed a piece of food. <br>\r\nChristine in the meantime worked hard on digesting the cheese cake. It did work. She was sure a big part of it was digested. But she knew very well what came now. She had been through this yesterday. It was clear the master now had some sidekicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Christine open up,\" Rebecca said. \"That will only make it easier for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine knew Rebecca was right. her own vocabulary was in one way small. She barely spoke. Since she barely spoke it was getting hard for her. However she did listen and could understand enough words so she knew partly what was going on around her. So she did the only thing she could think of and opened her mouth and the first item of food was pushed inside.   <br>\r\nKiekie was still sulking. It was so unfair that she was only allowed to eat so little while her cousin was fed so much. Like a turkey being stuffed for thanksgiving. She did't knew much with only being a few months old but she learned what jealousy was. That was what she now felt against Christine. Not that she was angry at Christine. She knew very well that she was fed and did't liked it. But thing is her young mind could't understand why. However her food did changed. She was finally fed something else except only icky greens. She missed good food so much. She sure hoped it would stay like this but with Jennifer you never knew. However she started to like Nancy. After all it was only Nancy who had fed her the past time. And Nancy talked friendly to her. Fine she did't understood a word but she knew the difference between talking friendly or talking angry.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine didn\u2019t know what she could do, another piece of food slowly wormed its way into her gullet being pushed in there by her cousin and her girlfriend. Christine didn\u2019t know how she should feel about it, somewhat feelings of betrayal and anger bubbled up from Christine\u2019s heart, thinking that she was safe when Rebecca and Emily were around was now just a foolish dream that Christine had she was nothing but a piglet and they were there to make sure she knew this fact. Choking on whatever sweet slop was shoved into her mouth next only caused Christine to sob more, its all she was good for now, her intelligence nor her personality were the reason\u2019s why Jennifer liked her that had been made quite clear by the woman no it was Christine\u2019s beauty and nativity that really made Jennifer want Christine. Being the centerpiece of the harem of little girls and one of the soul reasons why Jennifer wanted one to begin with she Jennifer made it her mission to control Christine and made the girl know that she was just a toy for her aunt to fatten and kiss. Though Christine could feel that there was more to the relationship than this it was quite apparent that this was first and foremost in Jennifer\u2019s mind, they weren\u2019t equal in term of lovers, Christine was less than Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wide, we only got done with one plate there are two others for you piglet\u201d Rebecca smartly stated patting Christine\u2019s stomach like a loving mother would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Rebecca your really good at this, seeing you so dominating is quite cute\u201d Emily giggled, as the girl didn\u2019t know what it meant to find someone hot as she thought that this was what people meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food being shoved into her gullet wasn\u2019t of any consequence for Christine it was monotonous at the moment, Christine knew that she would be fed no matter what so why fight it when other things were on her mind. Though the girl didn\u2019t mind eating so many tasty things that she didn\u2019t enjoy denying her master the satisfaction of having Christine being complacent with her feedings even if she had feelings for her aunt she wouldn\u2019t give Jennifer the satisfaction of breaking her. What was troubling for Christine was to think about was why did she love Jennifer though? why did she feel her heart go aflutter whenever she was with Jennifer and why did she kind of want to be a blob for her lover to begin with. Did Christine really love Jennifer? A question that the girl didn\u2019t know how to answer herself she did feel admiration for her master and did want to do anything to please her, if that meant that she was to be akin to an Exotic dancer or a harlot for Jennifer then she would, she didn\u2019t understand why she felt this way but Christine knew it was right to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slice of dessert went past her lips, Christine, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really notice nor really care being in a daze was part of the reason, the other was Emily while Rebecca was busy feeding Christine fit to burst Emily was groping and feeling each and every part of her body a little moisturizer to keep Christine\u2019s body supple and perfect. At first, it was quite strange, to say the least, but it did feel really good to each and every part of her body was sensitive to the girl\u2019s touch as Christine was always pushed to eat everything she could by Jennifer had this effect on her. Starting with the pads of her feet and working her way upward Emily was making sure that no part of the piglet was left out, reaching for her thighs now Emily made sure that every supple fold of Christine\u2019s skin had some moisturizer on it jiggling them slightly just to feel the heaviness that came with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn\u2019t help but smile at this knowing that this wasn\u2019t the biggest Christine would bee seeing her grow all over was a pleasant turn of events, though she did like the look of a pear shape having a girl who was fat all over and a little centered in her stomach as a nice apple shape was a great change. Christine didn\u2019t know how she felt about Emily massaging her whole body, though it did feel nice to be treated like a princess and have Rebecca feed and massage her body though a nice comfort that she didn\u2019t think she would ever get. Though Christine knew that the girls had different ideas swirling int their heads than being helpful when it came to what they were doing, they lusted after Christine much like how her master did. Being wanted by so many people just for her body wasn\u2019t something she really felt before, though it felt really good to be inspected and loved for her body and being a slave for pleasure, was this what Christine really wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my Christine you really have become a bit bigger haven\u2019t you, don\u2019t worry your still quite a beautiful girl, I mean just look at those eyes they\u2019re like an ocean\u201d Emily said grinning at Christine, massaging her stomach with some lotion as all the plates had been cleaned by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it, Emily I see why pink is your favorite color it goes well with you Christine, this thong is perfect for you\u201d snapping the lacy thing betwixt her fingers Rebecca could only giggle as she played with Christine\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine herself was in quite a daze, the food she had just consumed stuffed tightly in her stomach. Jennifer was nowhere to be seen all Christine had to contend with was her little sidekick, so many thoughts were running through her mind one that stuck out to her was if she truly love Jennifer or not? That answer was actually quite easy to her in fact she\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Was unsure. She knew something about love. Her parents loved each other. She was't blind to the love of Rebecca and Emily. But in both cases they cared for each other. Her parents never fed each other. Not as far if she knew. She knew Emily did it sometimes with Rebecca but that was willingly. It was't forced down her throat like in her case. <br>\r\nJennifer, Emily and Rebecca forced her to become fat. They did't cared what she wanted. She just needed to eat and become fatter for their pleasure. But did they really cared about her? She seriously had her doubts. Fine Emily and Rebecca were less rude than Jennifer and just liked it to feed her. They liked that she got fatter but she did't think it was their plan to turn her into a obese sow. <br>\r\nIn a relation was love. Did Jennifer ever showed love? Sure she kissed her but she had seen many people kiss. She also kissed her family members. Once on T.V she also once saw teenage girls kissing. They were't all in love. What Jennifer did was feeding her even if she did't want to. She wanted her to become fat. But that was't her choice. She needed to act like a piggy. That felt kind of embarrassing. She was forced to walk on hands and knees and was't allowed to walk up straight. She also was't allowed to talk. Just: Oink. Like a piggy. Nancy, Rebecca, Kiekie and Emily did't need to oink. Fine Kiekie could't really talk  or understand it but still. Why did she need to be a piggy. She did't want to be a piggy. She wanted to be a human girl. Walking on two legs. This living as a piggy growing fatter only to please her master. Was this really the life that she wanted for herself?<br>\r\nChristine was getting more confused. If she looked at all those things it did't seem like Jennifer really loved her. She was more a slave. Jennifer always said she was her master. Her parents had cute names for the other and for her. But master was what she was. Everything would go her way. She was the boss and she had to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is gone,\" Rebecca said. \"She seemed to be really stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. She looks really adorable in this outfit Rebecca, and you do too. What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the piggy is full now. We can maybe give her a belly rub. It will help the food digest faster.That does make it easier for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this outfit show a lot of that bare belly of her. It's perfect for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine did enjoy the belly rub and it did made her feel better. She started to think again.<br>\r\nJennifer maybe was't really in love even while she believed it but she did like her. But more like a toy, or a play thing. Was that what you felt for you toys real love? She did't think so. However you could like some toys. <br>\r\nHowever Being treated like a princess was all right. Those outfits were't to bad. She did't mind them so much. <br>\r\nBut what about her? Did she love Jennifer? Was it love if only one of them loved the other? She was't sure. Hard to tell.<br>\r\nBut she did things for her master to make her master like her. She wanted the master to like her. <br>\r\nSure she was a piggy now. Even if her mind remembered she once was a human she was now a piggy. But if she was a piggy it was better than be a piggy that was liked. Just like people liked a belly dancer or a harlot. Sure they were't that important but people enjoyed them. They liked that company. She was now a piggy for a master who only wanted her to become fatter. At least it could be worse. She got good food. More then she liked but still It was better than being starved. <br>\r\nWell There was't anything she could do to change it. She might as well try to enjoy it. Those belly rubs were fine. She would stay Jennifer's play thing for now. She would fatten up since there was't a way out of that.<br>\r\nBut she wondered what would happen to her if Jennifer would't like her toy anymore? <br>\r\nAll those thoughts were very confusing for the young mind of this girl. She was't even sure of everything that she thought about was right. Perhaps she misunderstood something. Ah well she would find out later.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca enjoyed this new feeling she had with Emily, her feelings of domination of Christine and the new feelings of love she had when doing so with Emily. A new kind of high for Rebecca came to being, though she still tried her best to be cordial toward the plaything that was her cousin there was no denying it now that Rebecca thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of power she had over Christine. There was no denying what place Christine had in the hierarchy of things it was clear that she was the lowest when it came to free will, but in the eyes of Jennifer in terms of lusting after Christine was at the top. Christine herself was quite confused with her thoughts mulling over in her brain what she was feeling when it came to her master there were so many different feelings that she was trying to get out of her that it almost became difficult to think straight in any sense of the word. Did she love being a toy for Jennifer, was she content with being nothing more than a plaything, was afraid that Jennifer could be tired of her after she becomes the size she is looking for will she ever is able to live happily with Jennifer? All these questions floated around the little girls mind that she wasn\u2019t paying attention to the belly rub she was getting and massage of her whole body by the two little sidekicks of her master, none of this was something that she was processing it, though Christine did feeling the warmth as each piece of her bloated figure was tended to she just couldn\u2019t\u2019 register it at the moment. Though Christine couldn\u2019t handle it, Rebecca and Emily were having quite the time with the little chub muffin the had in front of them. Using some of the lavender lotions Jennifer had given them they begun taking care of the princess, both of them giggling all the way through happily making sure Christine didn\u2019t get any painful stretch marks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis stuff smells good doesn\u2019t it Rebecca, maybe after we\u2019re done with playing with Christine we should use some of this one you\u201d Emily happily said before putting a generous dollop of the lotion on Christine\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I think I will need more on my butt than stomach\u201d Rebecca chuckled before giving her butt a giddy slap, sending a small shock wave through her flab causing her butt to wobble from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was quite excited that her girlfriend was getting into domination as much as she was, though Emily still knew that Jennifer owned this magnificent slave it still was fun to force-feed and pamper the princess. Emily, unlike Rebecca, knew exactly where Christine truly stood on the totem pole. Being the pride and joy of Jennifer Emily made extra time to get into every nook and cranny of Christine's body making the girl smell of nothing but lavender. The small baby doll that she was placed only accentuated her figure that much more, now with the added lavender lotion it only made Christine glow that much more. Christine didn\u2019t know what to think of her situation. her master did enjoy the fact that she now had two sidekicks that were quite apparent to Christine though that wasn\u2019t too bad if she could have days like this where she is taken care of by the loving hands of Rebecca and Emily it wasn\u2019t so bad, not knowing what was coming next for Christine was something that made the girl worry a little bit, the feeling of being stuffed still weighing herself down Christine knew that this was her normal now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you feel great don\u2019t you piglet, don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be with your master soon, though it seems she is trying to get things ready for you playdate\u201d Emily giggled, thinking about the new girl that Rebecca described. <br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure that Christine will love Nicole, they are in the same kind of situation if not the same, though I don\u2019t know how Nicole is treated by tina there is love there I just don\u2019t know\u201d Rebecca questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing this out of her mind Rebecca wondered what should she do next with Christine, or should they give her back to her mother? There were many other thinks Rebecca wanted to do with Christine but at the same time she didn\u2019t want as with Emily there she thought it wouldn\u2019t be the best time. Both girls were waiting for the weekend with a new friend to play with they couldn\u2019t help but be anxious, though Emily didn\u2019t know anything about Nicole she couldn\u2019t wait to look at this girl. Christine was a great toy but she was just so slim though she was getting fatter steadily it was quite interesting to Emily to see what could be as Rebecca said this girl was a few years younger than them and already is fatter than her friend Nikki. Christine was interested in this girl too, was this someone she should look up to or fear? Rebecca stated that the girl was broken by her master was something that caused Christine to fear her new friend but at the same token, it was interesting to hear. Christine herself was being broken, knowing that she did care for her master and wanted nothing more than to be her stripper was something that Christine had come to accept. With that noted Christine\u2019s master finally made an appearance, seeing how well they were taking care of her piglet made her happy and sad at the same time, though it wasn\u2019t something that she would admit. Knowing it was going to be hard to rip Christine from the little lovers it was something that had to be done as Christine needed to be trained in how to look beautiful, whether it came to eating or just looking good, Christine needed training and maybe how to striptease people too would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you girls did make her eat it all huh, well she needs training now so how about you two help Nancy\u201d Jennifer was happy to have some alone time with her sow it was all in preparation for Saturday and the arrival of Tina and Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Take another bite!\" Rebecca said while she tried to get some more food in Christine's full mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her lover grabbed her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca,\" Emily said. \"I love fattening up others more than anything\u2026 except for you that is... but you're going a bit too fast for her now. She barely has time to chew. Why are you in such a hurry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just want her to be ready before Nicole comes. Besides that girl has a big appetite. I saw her eat. Well it is because of Tina. I think she forces her too become fat too. But she likes it too. That's the difference between her and this little piglet. However she does't seem to struggle so much anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she accepted she will become a fat sow. It does make things easier. Anyway, if Nicole arrives before we're done I think your mother can take it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last piece of food went down Christine's throat. Like if they had planned it the doorbell rang. Rebecca fast waddled to the front door what gave Emily a good view at her friends wobbling butt. It did gave her a strange pleasant feeling. She did't even knew what it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Is this maybe what sexy means?\" She whispered. \"If it is I find Rebecca super sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca came back holding a chubby hand of a fat girl. Nicole looked at them  with big eyes. Emily looked back. She was still totally smitten at Rebecca but she had the idea this girl could become a good friend. At least she liked her waistline. It was true, she was younger than them but smiled friendly. After her came Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here she is. Like promised. Oh and who is this little piggy?\" She asked looking at Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's our pet piggy. Just call her piglet,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tina saw Kiekie and bend over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and what have we here. Oh you're a fatty. Yes you are. Yes you are,\" She said friendly to Kiekie. \"Well I need to go now. I pick her up in a few hours. Oh and if you wanna feed her, please do. The greasier, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was surprised hearing this. Normally people did't asked something like this when they dropped of a girl for a play date.<br>\r\nThe three kids fast walked away to play a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Nicole. Rebecca told me about you and she was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm fat and wanna  become fatter and that's what Tina wants too. She's my feeder. Oh and I really like Sofia the first. You know that movie about a little princess?  A village girl that became a princess over a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I remember that,\" Emily said. \"I like that little witch so much. What is her again\u2026 Lucinda. That's it. She's fun. After she became good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fun but I also like Vivian,\" Nicole said \"She's cute, and shy. But she can sing fantastic.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It are fun characters but what I find a bit disappointing is that they are all, with no exception very thin. That's what I dislike about Disney movies. Most other animation movies too now I think about it. You barely have fat persons in those movies. That's not reality. I mean look around in the mall. about half of the people there are fat. So do that too in the movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must admit you're right.\" Nicole said. \"It would be fun if they added a bit more fat characters. Especially since more and more people become fat. I think they would like it more when some characters also were fat. A character they can relate a bit to.\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Looking over Rebecca and Emily it was easy to see the enthusiastic looks they both had on their faces, like herself they too were enthralled with all sorts of girly things, it didn\u2019t matter if it was princesses or ponies all cute things made them swoon with delight. Rebecca knew that they would be fast friends that was something that she was counting on knowing how Emily acted around girls of her caliber did help the process of friendship happen a lot quicker than expected though which was a plus she guessed. Emily was enthralled with looking at this girl, Rebecca did mention that she was quite large but she didn\u2019t really think of what that really meant. The gravity of how big Nicole really was almost awe-inspiring the size of a whale in front of her made Emily let out a little moan of pleasure. She didn\u2019t think that Nicole or anyone else except Rebecca could do that to her but just seeing every crevice and fold of Nicole made her body make noises even if she didn\u2019t want to, though she had no control of what her body was doing it was still something that Emily was a bit embarrassed about. The lust she had for Nicole wasn\u2019t something that she wanted to admit at all with Rebecca right there next to Emily she knew that all she could do was keep it together and have a wonderful play-date with this look of perfection in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you girls heard of the new cartoon out, its called the owl house it's super cool I like it\u201d Nicole chirped up, trying to escape this strange silence that had to endure \u201cdo you Uhh want to watch some episodes, while we wait for lunch\u201d Pointing at the couch she tried to shoo her new friend to do something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca still not catching on of what that verbal sound coming out of Emily could mean, did she like Nicole more than her or was it meaning that she was bored the feelings of doubt had clouded the mind of Rebecca. Not knowing what to think about it Rebecca thought it would be better to just drown it out with some cartoons, it seemed to be the best course of action for all of them and a way to become closer friends. Emily easily hopping on top of the leather couch like it was nothing, Rebecca and Nicole were two totally different stories, that was easy to see. Rebecca could only get one of her fattened thighs on one of the cushions before having to back off and try again, the with of her butt making it impossible for her to get any closer to her goal of climbing the beast that was the leather couch. Nicole wasn\u2019t even able to do that being younger than them and much fatter than them she couldn\u2019t get anywhere close to the proficiency of her other friends. With her body being so tiny and so round it was just exhausting looking at the couch let alone trying to get atop the monstrous beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca by some miracle had finally gotten atop the couch, huffing and puffing from the exhaustion that came from the act she just had to pull off. Rebecca might be on the couch but how were they going to get the princess on top of it? Looking at the limited options they had both girls needed to help their friend somehow. Looking around the room for something that could help Nicole in any way Emily's eyes lowered to a small step stool that Rebecca had to use as a chair as the children sized chairs that came with her table didn\u2019t really fit her anymore. The size of her bottom dwarfed anything else that she would think of sitting on, this was perfect for them though Emily hopping back down from the Couch away from the heaving Rebecca to help Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chere Nicole try this instead it will make it much easier for you to get up on the couch\u201d sweeping her hand to the stool Emily happily pointed at it knowing her plan was perfect \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to get up if you use it and we can watch that show you were talking about and I can get you two some snacks as well\u201d Emily was happy to help her new friend in any way she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn\u2019t know about this looking at the wobbly chair that had previously been punished by Rebecca\u2019s own girth, she didn\u2019t know if it could handle someone who was double in size as Rebecca was. Not wanting to make a bad impression of the generosity that she showed Nicole begun to use the stool. One foot in front of the other Nicole made her ascent to the glorious couch, it was like the thing was a million miles away for the young tot with every little step feeling like a great achievement in her own mind. Closer Nicole got to her goal, reaching for the leather armrest she finally got somewhat on it, scooting closer and closer with the help of Rebecca too she was doing it. With heavy breaths and sweat beading down her brow, Nicole was on the couch, Emily finally coming back to see the great achievement her new friend had made on her own, food was her reward for reaching her goal. A tray of chocolate and sweets was held by Emily, both girls trying to be great hostesses they wanted to make sure Nicole\u2019s needs were met. With them finally comfortable in on the couch and Nicole gleefully eating her reward that came with the gusto of a true piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Emily, I was famished I though I was going to waste away\u201d shoving more some of the sweets into her open maw \u201cIt\u2019s a really good show you two will like it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nicole was now all settled into her seat and happily munching on sweets they all were ready to watch this cartoon, picking up the remote Emily begun to put Netflix on for them all, though Rebecca and Emily were interested in a horse cartoon they couldn\u2019t start without talking about the elephant in the room. That elephant wasn\u2019t Nicole this time though, it did have to do with her but it wasn\u2019t about her as much as Emily would like it to be. Both Rebecca and Emily were pondering a lot of stuff as they looked for this spirit cartoon, none of it really concerned Nicole she was just happy to have food in front of her, her dress, on the other hand, had wasn\u2019t too happy groaning and moaning with every morsel passing Nicole\u2019s lips in a feeble attempt to keep together on Nicole. It was amazing that there was someone like Nicole in the world, it was even more fascinating to both girls that at first, she didn\u2019t want to gain as much as the one who got her gaining this Nikki girl only to completely dwarf her weight to what was in front of them now. This made Rebecca quite curious if Nicole had become the fattest between Nikki and Nicole, how large is Nikki then?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's the friend of my brother. However I both think they're more boy and girl friend. Hi, hi, hi. Anyway, she's a nice girl with brown hair and very fat. Well my brother is also kind of chubby and I also used to be kind of chubby. Really chubby. Not fat like now. However Nikki who was back then fatter than me and ate a lot. No surprise of course. But Nikki wore her fat confident. She knew she was fat but she had no problem with that. Just the opposite. She liked being fat. She called herself a gainer. She told me how much fun it was to be fat. It's warm, soft and fun to play with. She is right. Also you can eat what you want. Not like those skinny people who count calories and think their live is over if they gain a single pound. But not Nikki or me. Clearly not you either. However it seemed so much fun. I wanted to do it too. I told that to Tina and she wanted to help me. Well she sure she did. Most of all of this is thanks to Tina. But I'm happy with it! I last took a look in the mirror and I almost did't recognize the girl in the mirror. But it was me. So fat. But I found out I looked good. Fantastic. Beautiful. Fat looks good at me. So I kept gaining. However I kept getting bigger but my clothes don't so when we went clothes shopping and met you and well... now we're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that girl Nikki is the reason that you started gaining. Is't that right?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right. I'm a gainer now too. And I'm good. Or perhaps it's Tina who's good. Maybe we're both good. Since we beat her. I'm now fatter then her. First it were just a few pounds but now you can clearly see I'm fatter then her, and I could't be more happy. The only downside is getting so fast out of breath. Also need help with some tasks like getting up on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she was you teacher and now you became better then her,\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah I guess so. However she's also still gaining. So who knows. Perhaps she'll catch up on me. \u00cf'm fatter then her now but she's not very far behind. Picture me after a diet for some time. Now we're talking about fat girls what's up with your sisters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh they're not my sisters. Well one of them is. The other is my cousin. However my mother adopted her after her parents died so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. But why does she act like a piggy. Is it just a game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She's a piggy. My mother thought us she's nothing more then a piglet. A play thing or a toy. That's how we need to treat her. She is only allowed to walk on hands and knees and she is't allowed to talk unless she says: 'Oink!' So she's more like our pet pig. However I and Emily like it to feed her. What we need to do is to make her fatter then Kiekie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiekie? Who is that. Is she that blond, blob looking girl? She's so fat. She looks great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but my mother does't like it. She wants my cousin to be the fattest. So she wants my sister to lose weight. At least until my cousin is fatter then her. After that\u2026 I think she's fine if my sister starts to gain again. My mother is the boss and the feeder of my cousin. Her friend Nancy feeds Kiekie however she's on a diet now, and she does't like it. As for me... well Emily is my feeder. She feeds me. We like doing that to.\"       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With those questions answered Emily and Rebecca thought it was quite rude to press Nicole for more info about someone they haven\u2019t even met, it was quite entertaining to think that there was a girl who was fatter Nicole that she looked up to and made her want to gain to match. Looking up and down of Nicole\u2019s body, it was amazing to think that this girl was ever considered thin or even chubby. It was even more unbelievable that there once was such a girl who was much fatter than her when she first started. Rebecca and Emily just couldn\u2019t stop staring at this beast that was in front of them; it was hypnotic how Nicole just shoveled in more food into her maw. Emily and Rebecca couldn\u2019t help but stare at Nicole, who was being entranced by something else. Watching the television's moving pictures on the screen was more interesting than anything else; it was like the whole world wasn\u2019t around her, nor was the consequences of her actions. One of those consequences looked like it was going to bite her in the bottom quite soon though no matter if she noticed it or not. It wasn\u2019t all her fault though, as it was more than likely that Tina was the one who dressed her, even if that wasn\u2019t the case it was undoubtedly Tina\u2019s fault that Nicole was this way. The powdered blue dress she wore was more like a small tent than a dress for a little girl, stretched thin the dress groaned in periodic intervals as it tried to keep all the flab Nicole had contained. Her fat pushed up against the cloth left nothing to the imagination; in turn, this only made focusing on the cartoon that much more difficult for Emily and Rebecca. Both wanted nothing more than to touch and feel the accumulated flesh that Nicole had on her frame, though the girl was barely mobile. Both girls wondered how long it would be before she was robbed of that. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNicole pointing at the screen at what seemed to be a brown horse before happily informing her new friends who this horse was\u201cSee that is Spirit he is such a cool horse I wish I had a pony like him\u201d Happily she bounced around the couch causing her fat-filled arms to jostle in unison. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRebecca finally stopped looking at the obese child and began to focus on what Nicole was trying to show them. Looking at the show, more Rebecca could see why Nicole liked it. It was just like Princesses Sofia\u201cI like this show, how did you get into it, Nicole.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tina put it on while she force-fed me is all, and well, I like it so much I kept watching after our little meal.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWow, this show isn\u2019t half bad. I like the horse riding parts\u201d Emily was just as enthralled with this show as her friends. Looking down at the bowl that her new friend and girlfriend were snacking on, Emily could see how low it was becoming. She knew that neither Rebecca nor Nicole would be happy if the snacks stopped. While they both talked about the show, Emily thought it would be best to get more from the kitchen, grabbing the bowl before heading there. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nEntering Emily could see that Jennifer was hard at work for her newest guest; just witnessing the table; it was clear she knew that Nicole was a big eater. An entire brisket was there to rest while Jennifer decided to make some other things aside from the brisket. Emily knew that this wasn\u2019t out of the kindness of her heart no she wanted to be ready, Jennifer looked at every feeding as a battle, her piglet wasn\u2019t any different when it came to when Jennifer stuffed Christine. Speaking of Christine, Emily couldn\u2019t think that Jennifer had left the girl to her own devices.; that wouldn\u2019t be something that Jennifer would do. Scoping out the room, it was easy for her to find the piglet, with some toy blocks and a doll. Christine was left to play while Jennifer did what she needed to do.  With bowl in hand, Emily as invasive as she could begin to look for some snacks for her hefty friends. Looking in the fridge first as that was her regular go-to when it came to delectable things. Coming up with nothing but dinner and lunch type food on the shelves, it seemed like her hunch was incorrect. Looking around was proving to be futile as she didn't find anything that could be considered a snack, no chocolate or chips it seemed like there wasn't a lot, or if there was, she didn't see it. Getting antsy by Emily's constant darting back and forth, Jennifer finally perked up addressing the tot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, what do you want now? As you can see, I'm busy, so just tell me what you're looking for so I can help you, and you can exit the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Nicole and Rebecca are running out of snacks so I thought I should get them more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...Fine, give them these then, but make sure they are prepared for lunch soon as its almost done.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jennifer helped Emily, Nicole and Rebecca happily watched the show. Both weren't paying much attention to how much they were consuming. As more of chocolate passed their lips, neither knew how much was left in the bowl. Though truth be told, they didn't much care to know. Spirit was all that mattered to them and was all that they wanted to see. Getting kind of full Rebecca had finally had enough of the concoction, she didn't know how the girl sitting next to her was still eating. Was it like involuntary action, or was it fear seeping through, Rebecca had seen how unrelenting Tina could be, was her friend this programmed that she just ate anything in front of her? Though Rebecca herself didn't admit it too often she wanted to see Tina feed Nicole again, seeing her squirm with tears in her eyes was a sight to behold something made her want to see Nicole like that again. These thoughts did make a chill run down the spine of Rebecca though it wasn't a bad feeling just a different feeling; to see the anguish of others while she was becoming closer to immobility was a strange feeling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So you like that horse. Did you ever rode on a horse?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did't, and if I would do it now I would probably hurt or even kill it. However I once had a babysitter short before Tina who did that. Riding horses and ponies I mean. But I'm afraid it's a lost cause for me now. By the way I'm not sure if I like it. I mean sure it looks like fun in that cartoon but still\u2026 cartoons are fun but they're not real. I don't know if it's much fun to ride a horse for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also never rode a horse. With this butt it would probably be terrible for the horse. All my weight is in my butt. I look like a pear. You and my cousin gain more all over your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Your butt is bigger than mine bit I have a bigger belly. Also bigger upper arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have also people who look like a triangle upside down,\" Emily said. \"Small belly, thighs and butt but with huge tits. But I believe most girls wanna look like a hourglass. Big tits, small waist and bigger ass and thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe most girls but not me,\" Nicole said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me neither,\" Rebecca said. \"However I have that big ass and thighs. I don't have a small waist\u2026 however it's small compared to my butt. As for my tits\u2026 well I guess I have to wait for those a few years. Well I sure hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat too much you two,\" Emily warned them. \"It's almost lunchtime. I knew for sure Jennifer made a big lunch. I think the piggy and Nicole need to eat most of it. Jennifer would like it to force more food down your throat. She has done that many times with the piggy. I bet Tina wanted Jennifer to force feed you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Rebecca mumbled, but was thinking that if her mother fore fed Nicole she and Emily could feed the piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunchtime!\" Jennifer yelled a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer walked out the kitchen to grab Christine while the other three got of the couch. Well Emily got of, Rebecca and Nicole acted more like beached whales rolling of the couch. The three girls walked or waddled to the kitchen and went sitting at the table. All three looked with big eyes. Jennifer did her best. It was a huge meal. Emily thought it was enough feed to feed a entire orphan home. But she knew this was all for one normal girl, two fat girls and one piggy. She knew she needed to be careful. If she ate too much she would become what Nancy suggested some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer returned with Christine who had a blank expression on her face. She did't care anymore. She was gonna become fat there was no way out of it so as soon as she was placed in her chair she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three started also eating. Well Emily and Rebecca started eating. Nicole was inhaling it. Emily never saw anyone eat that fast. Well maybe Kiekie but apart from that. She wondered if Nicole tasted the food.<br>\r\nSuddenly the was a loud rip to be heard. Nicoles dress ripped right at the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nicole mumbled. \"That's too bad. I liked this dress. Guess Tina and I need to go clothes shopping again.\"<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca was quite shocked at how calm Nicole was being, having just split her beautiful dress right down the middle she would think the whale of a girl would be a little more concerned in what she had only done to it. Looking at Nicole, there was no such concern on her face; it was just another Saturday for her. She kept shoveling down food into her mouth with no concern about the outside world. This only baffled Rebecca she thought that Nicole would at least be a bit embarrassed with what had just happened to her, but there was nothing, all Nicole wanted to be food. Emily and Rebecca looked at each other with quizzical looks, Grinning at her girlfriend looking over at Nicole over and over, knowing that she was right of the girl is a good friend for them both and was something they both can fawn over. Though Christine was a good piglet too, there was just something about Nicole and her willingness that was euphoric. The tears Christine always came with was great; her size was something to be desired, not when they had a girl as big as this in front of them. Shoveling anything and everything she could get her mitts on, not even taking the time yet to register if what she was eating was food or not. Even Jennifer was surprised by Nicole\u2019s eating habits; she wondered if she made enough for Nicole and Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you got some competition for food this time around Piglet, are you going to let Nicole outclass you?\u201d Jennifer jabbed at her piglet, egging the poor girl on to become a glutton like her friend that was just across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine didn\u2019t think it was any use fighting her master at this point. With the obese almost immobile blob across the table, Christine only shuddered to think about it. Was this the future that Christine had to look forward to, or was there something she could or even should do about it. Feeling like there was no point in fighting food being shoved into her mouth other than the pleasure of defiance, it gave her from denying Jennifer something that Christine quite adamantly wanted to see. Mulling over what to do wasn\u2019t the only thing she had to deal with. All the while, her master\u2019s little sidekicks were also getting more and more anxious with each passing moment, seeing the disappearing food as a sort of timer for them to shove as much as they could into Christine. Whether Christine was going to let that happen was beside the point, both Emily and Rebecca knew that Nicole was an eating machine, and Christine needed to catch up to that beast of a girl. More and more pieces of pork slid down Nicole s throat to meet the other foods that she had already ingested; this was what a feedee should look like; there was no point for her to stop herself as her body was Tina\u2019s to do with as she wished. There were times where Nicole thought she could escape the tyrannical reign of being force-fed all day and night, like how Christine believes right now. That was just some fairy tale. She was a glutton, and her only job was to eat to please her Tina, getting fatter for her or kissing, and making out with Tina was her sole prerogative anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching as some sort of wild beast, the only kinds of sounds coming from her were the occasion grunt or an orgasmic \u201cSho good\u201d coming from her stuffing another rib in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike some sort of miracle of the gods, Nicole had finally ceased her hunger sated by the offerings made by Jennifer. The table was decimated by Nicole; most of the brisket eaten; it was quite a shock that the sides and pulled pork sandwiches were spared from Nicole\u2019s hunger. Panting like a dog on a hot day, Nicole was full to the gills, enough food for about three adult men stuffed into her little body. Jennifer was amazed, to say the least, about how this girl had taken her large meal and made it look like it was just another Saturday. Though Jennifer was amazed with how much she just saw Nicole ingest, this didn\u2019t mean she though the girl was done, no there had to be more give to her. Jennifer made it her mission to make sure she would find that limit, no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls feed Christine all she can fit into her body, I won\u2019t be outdone by Tina in being a feeder, but Nicole is mine to stuff I want to see how much give she has left in her\u201d She chuckled patting the massive stomach that was connected to Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Emily, and I would be glad to fatten the piglet; do you think she will become like that someday mommy\u201d Pointing at Nicole, Rebecca was anxious to see the piglet that large sooner rather than later. \u201cI want to have more of her to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer could only laugh that just a few months ago, Rebecca hated the idea of force feeding. Now she just couldn\u2019t get enough of doing it to someone else; I guess it's true that people rather be the person inflicting discomfort instead of the one receiving it. Helping her daughter and Emily out by making a few plates for Christine, Jennifer, with a big smile on her face, looked lovingly at her pet. Wanting to see this girl explode with fat like Nicole was all she cared about. Tina knew how to do it, so why couldn\u2019t she do the same? Stroking Christine\u2019s head, Jennifer bent down to her little lover, examining each piece of her smiling at the cute skimpy school girl outfit she made her piglet wear before leaving her the care of her cousin and Emily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well I guess maybe there can fit a bit more food in my tummy. But... You will have to help me. You will have to\u2026 force feed me,\" Nicole smiled grinning even wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole liked the look at Jennifer's face. She was surprised that this girl seemed to have no problem with being fattened up. Nicole smirked. She was used to this. Tina Force-fed her all the time. Her body was used to eating more after she felt full. I stretched her stomach so it could hold more food next time. Doing that time after time after time stretched her stomach very much. Now she could eat a lot. If Jennifer force-fed her or Tina did't matter to her. She kind of liked being force fed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Can she still eat more?\" Emily asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Rebecca answered. \"The piglet has eaten many meals bigger then this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about the piglet but Nicole,\" Emily said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she. I don't know. Well I saw Tina Force-feed her once and she used pretty much force. I can tell you that. But I don't know how much Nicole normally eats.  I only saw her once before today. But well all that weight on her body does't come from salads.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Emily said feeding Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was acting like a machine. She just opened her mouth. Someone pushed some food in it. Then she closed her mouth chewed and swallowed it. Over and over again. She just did't cared anymore. Her will was broken. Besides there was no way out of this. Her parents were dead. Her aunt was now the one who took care of her. Before she would be able to run away she need to be a bit older. By the time she would be old enough she would probably be so fat she could't walk. Besides she was't allowed to walk unless when it was on hands and knees. If she kept gaining like this her belly would soon be dragged over the floor if she would crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole in the meantime enjoyed it. Jennifer was forcing more and more food in Nicole's throat but she swallowed it all down. Getting fatter. Soon there would be even less left of her dress. More seams started to split but Nicole did't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and Emily on the other hand were having fun force-feeding the piglet. Of well it was more just feeding since they did't have to use any force. The piglet just did't care anymore. She was just a pig now. A pig that needed to get fatter and fatter. <br>\r\nJennifer reached for another part of food but found nothing. She looked disturbed at Rebecca, Emily and Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the food?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a lot of it is in here,\" Emily said and pushed with her finger in Christine's belly. But I think most of it is in there,\" Emily continued and pointed at Nicole's huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer could't believe it. Did she already ate all the food. Sure she knew Christine probably also at a lot of the food but still. She looked at the obese girl. Her belly was round and as hard if a rock. Nicole looked pretty happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... more,\" She managed to say. \"Really\u2026 or... I'm\u2026 gonna\u2026 throw\u2026 up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer did't liked it but she knew also that Nicole was probably right. If she gave Nicole more food the her belly could handle it would all come back up and that would't be a pretty sight and she would lose all those precious calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna take the piglet to bed,\" Jennifer said flatly while she picked up Christine and walked out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right Nicole?\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No... problem. Tina... Force-feeds... me like... this... all the... time. I'm... fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your dress,\" Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Too bad. It was... a nice... dress. But... well. Don't... make such... a big deal... about it. We're... all girls. Even... that piggy,... blob sister... of you and... that woman... that takes... care of her...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell,\u201d Jennifer started, feeling a strange mix of pride and exasperation, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for her to lose weight, this is what we wanted after all. But still, we should probably find a way to automate her feeding, no need for you to exhaust yourself with how much work it is to feed her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but where do we get something to do that? As far as I know, neither of us have any engineering experience, not to mention the obvious problem that no one would just be selling feeding pumps.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that, shouldn\u2019t we at least check? It is the internet, after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Nancy ceded, \u201cYeah, there is that point, I guess. Regardless, we should probably move Kiekie to where she\u2019ll be staying for the foreseeable future. Would it be fine to just set her in front of the TV?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, but it is Kiekie, so I doubt she\u2019ll even notice as long as we keep her full. On that point, we might as well see if we can get one for each of them, save the inevitable hassle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but let\u2019s focus on actually getting her to the lounge for now. Actually, why did we even bring her up here? How exactly did we manage to do it again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, Jennifer realized she couldn\u2019t recollect the effort of moving the boated child from the kitchen, odd. \u201c...No idea actually, but we might as well learn from our mistakes. Wherever we put her now will most likely be where she\u2019ll stay for the foreseeable future.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now, I\u2019ll ask again, how are we moving her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly surprising the two, Rebecca had an idea, \u201cCould we try to get her onto a cushion and then slide her down the stairs? Maybe that could work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily musing over it, Nancy agreed, \u201cIt\u2019d be easier than straining ourselves to lug her down the stairs. Assuming it\u2019ll work, at least.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, having come up with a decided course of action, they started the preparations, not to say there was very much to be done. Sure, they had to find suitable padding for the baby to rest on, but there was already one readily available, her crib\u2019s mattress. With that, and a blanket to awkwardly strap it and Kiekie together, the women began the cumbersome process of sliding the contraption down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the struggle was much lighter than it sounded, only requiring an occasional nudge as the cushion slid over each stair. It wasn\u2019t a fast process, though it still continued at an adequate pace. After an exasperating fifteen minutes, it was done, only taking a few more to get her to the desired room. Once they\u2019d gotten there, the trio noticed another issue; they didn\u2019t have any food left in the house, not to mention they wouldn\u2019t be able to carry \u201clittle\u201d Kiekie inside any form of restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, that problem wasn\u2019t about to go unmentioned, so, despite being a little vague, Rebecca piped up in true toddler fashion, \u201cWhat do we do now? I\u2019m getting kinda hungry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, a grin began to spread across Jennifer\u2019s lips, though it died with the recollection of how empty the kitchen was, the cupboards not even containing a meager bowl of cereal. As such, they needed food, but how to get it? Thinking over the possible courses of action, Jennifer finally realized the obvious, \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll just have to order delivery for now. Do you want anything in particular?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to think, the four-year-old decided on something simple enough, \u201cPizza maybe?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d her mother began, turning to her, accomplice, \u201chow many should we get? Would three for each of them be enough? Though we can always put whatever leftovers there are in the fridge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I just hope it\u2019ll be enough for Kiekie here.\u201d Nancy agreed, patting the doughy infant for emphasis, the subsequent jiggling doing well enough to prove her point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll put in the call, for now, the worse that\u2019ll happen would just be that we'll have to order some more, though that wouldn\u2019t exactly be a bad thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that settled, Jennifer moved to another room as she called in their order, leaving the other two with Kiekie. For a moment, neither of them did anything, but it wasn\u2019t long before Nancy sat on the couch and turned on the television. Left without the option of cartoons, Rebecca wasn\u2019t quite sure what to spend her time doing. Still, she was curious about how malleable her sister\u2019s body was now that she was so heavily swaddled with flub that she couldn\u2019t move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on those feelings, the four-year-old sat next to their sibling, tentatively squeezing her body as the two waited for the pizzas. Eventually, the elder of them wondered when Christine would be up, but given the impossibility of her mother letting the girl go unfed, she knew it wouldn\u2019t be long. Leaning slightly onto the cushion she knew as her sister, she relaxed as the wait for their food continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not a moment later, Emily dashed out of the room, excitedly bounding down the steps to the living room. Left alone, Rebecca was a little startled at first, but that soon changed into a somewhat foreign feeling, hope. As of then, the young girl\u2019s mind was full of thoughts like; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can finally be thin again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother will stop forcing so much food down our throats.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I knew Emily could help, I wouldn\u2019t have tried to get here so much earlier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these ecstatic thoughts bouncing around her head, Rebecca couldn\u2019t wait for Emily to come back, mother in tow, to help her stop the injustices happening at her home. Unfortunately, life decided that now would be the perfect time to teach her a lesson; \u201cYou don\u2019t always get what you want.\u201d After a few minutes, her friend returned, at first, she was confused by the plate of food the girl was holding, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to turn that into despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for? I didn\u2019t say I was hungry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this? Don\u2019t worry, Mom\u2019s making more, she\u2019s always wanted to have daughters on the heavier side, but until now she wasn\u2019t sure how Dad would react to having another kid, let alone fattening them up too. But now we\u2019re going to make sure to thank your mother for this chance. After all, we\u2019ll be having so much fun together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Wha- W-What!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would\u2019ve taken little to inform the girl that her hopes were nothing more than that, hopes. But Emily did it seemingly effortlessly, her blinding smile having almost the same effect on Rebecca as socking her in the gut. Since much like as if she were punched, she had the feeling of something cracking, then shattering, inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Come on, eat. After this, I\u2019m sure your mother will let us come over to your house and help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Rebecca just stood there, staring forward blankly from the shock of it all, but after enough prodding from the girl whose motives so resembled her mother\u2019s she eventually gave in. The food itself wasn\u2019t bad, a tad basic, though what would you expect from a simple sandwich, and the slight fullness it left in the poor girl\u2019s stomach was well known to be a depressing omen for what\u2019s to come. As soon as she'd finished the sandwich, the perpetually unfortunate girl was ushered downstairs by her ecstatic companion, almost being dragged into the kitchen where said companion\u2019s mother was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! I brought her; you\u2019re almost done, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear, there\u2019s plenty on the table all ready to get started on... and Rebecca?\u201d Emily\u2019s mother asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you know the drill by now but, eat, because either through your own or me and my daughter\u2019s efforts, all of this will end up in your and Emily\u2019s stomachs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaaaaah... Fine I guess, not as if I have a choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, get started.\u201d Gesturing to the spread already on the table, the woman turned back to the stove, finishing the last of the many dishes meant for the young girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rebecca, she didn\u2019t know much else that she could do, so she started eating, somberly bringing bite after bite of food to her frowning face. It didn\u2019t take much time for her to crumble though, as after a few mouthfuls, the girl couldn\u2019t hold back the bitter tears of her disappointment, sorrow and frustration spilling down her cheeks. These feelings weren\u2019t helped by the enthusiasm her companion had for eating; Emily\u2019s reaction was nearly juxtaposing hers with its positivity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point though, the four-year-old was having trouble finding a reason to bother resisting anymore, after all, nothing she\u2019d done had given positive results, and it wasn\u2019t as if she had much incentive to resist, sure she didn\u2019t enjoy the feedings, but what could a toddler expect to accomplish anyway? Strangely enough, as the girl crumbled mentally, she started eating faster, almost as if trying to use the food as a way to smother the fear she now held for her near certain future. Nonetheless, at this point, Rebecca had well and truly given up, for what else was she to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the two other people in the room, Emily\u2019s mother had since finished the last dish and at that point had started encouraging her daughter to eat more, who, given what she\u2019d been taught from infancy, needed minimal prompting. But not all was going as desired, after all, Rebecca was getting a bit full, which wouldn\u2019t do if she was ever to grow to the size she should be. There wasn\u2019t much to be done about her capacity, other than increasing it at least, so the girl\u2019s current captor moved from her own, all too willing child, and picked up a few dishes to force into the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rebecca noticed the woman moving over to her, the four-year-old didn\u2019t react, though it seemed unlikely given how meagerly lucid the child was in regards to the food pressed to her lips, those in question merely opening and closing as whatever dish was pushed against them. Even with the lack of opposition, it was still tiresome to hand-feed the girl, leading her offender to eventually get lost in her thoughts, one of them wondering just how well she and the girl\u2019s mother will get along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, no one noticed specifically when, the feeding was over, Emily\u2019s enthusiasm had traded itself for sloth, leading to her current state of dozing contently on the table, as for Rebecca, she too was asleep, though hers was much more fitful compared to the other girl\u2019s, unsurprising given how much had been pushed into her gullet. There laid a slight problem though, as even though the current situation was nearly perfect, what was she to do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she had to bring Rebecca back to her house soon, but would she rather feed her own butterball-in-training or let Jennifer do it for her...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking that Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother would be horrified about what was going on at her house, but the woman seemed relieved that someone other than herself saw the beauty in feeding little girls into massive blobs. This was something that Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother had hidden away from her husband knowing how society would react to her devoted proclamations of love for children who are so fat that them being called children is just a joke, to say the least. Thinking that Emily was just in love with Rebecca she never saw that there was more to their relationship, it was true Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother had always suspected that some of her love of fat had rubbed off of on her daughter, that really wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad thing, to say the least but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it was just love of fat on other people or on her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder if Jennifer Rebecca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother had any ideas on how she determined it was the right thing to do\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother wondered as she looked on to the snoozing girls with wonder hoping that Jennifer could do something about her own daughter maybe if she learned from Jennifer how to go about forcing Emily to become fat too than they can have force feed parties at Jennifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Not wanting to waste any time with just her thoughts that were running wild of what she could do to Emily. Going into the other room to call up Jennifer who was so gracious enough to leave her number for Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother to call her if anything was wrong, she did want to call her but there was an alternative motive than just letting her know that her daughter was safe and sound at the house no there were other things that needed to be discussed with Jennifer these things were more important that something as trivial as well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello Jennifer this is Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Debra, I have a few questions for you if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind of me asking them\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra stated with confidence in her voice while she talked quietly in the other room twirling her long brown hair in the other room not wanting to wake the two piglets in that room, she could hear that Jennifer was a little shocked to hear from Debra she was quite worried that something was wrong with Rebecca or worse that the woman had figured out her dark secret and was going to go to the authorities about what she was doing with Christine how she had a prominent relationship with Christine it was something she was dreading to have a conversation about but Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like she regretted her choices and was prepared to face them head-on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh what is wrong, is something up with Rebecca is she being a brat again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry about that\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer begun to make fake scenarios up to protect her from the stigma that Jennifer surely thought was coming from this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no its nothing like that, I was told by my daughter that you like to fatten up girls well I was hoping you could add Emily to your little Harem\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra nonchalantly asked the woman, Jennifer was in complete disbelief that this woman had just asked her that it was something that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expecting not in the least. No words came out of Jennifer's mouth for a while she was still trying to process the conversation she was trying to have with Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother. There was just silence between the both of them as this situation had become a hundred times more awkward than it was originally it the air was just so thick that you could cut it with a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry if I weirded you out, I heard from my daughter that you were forcing your girls to become little piglets, was this true I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not judging I was just hoping you could force feed Emily as well is all I was getting at\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra stated not wanting to make Jennifer more uncomfortable than she is already. On the other side of the phone call Jennifer was mulling it over in her mind she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind having another girl to feed it would make the whole situation more fun but at the same time, there was no one she could really have to feed her since both Nancy and herself had their hands full. Kiekie was a little glutton, to say the least being in front of food was enough for her to start devouring all that she could that was all too apparent but she still needed to be supervised more than the other girls. Jennifer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to come back to Kiekie being a blob of her former self before Christine could reach the same heights. Right then and there something Nefarious popped into her head, thinking that if she could get the help of Debra then it would all work out for the best for everyone involved and this would be a great bonding moment to share with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can show you how to force her to eat and how to make her eat, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got no real time to feed another girl I think you should try doing it yourself\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennifer coldly told the woman, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong there were just too many girls too keep track of with just two people to force to eat on their own and Jennifer wondered how strong the conviction was of Debra, this would be a great time to show Jennifer how much she wants to fatten up her daughter. Jennifer wondering what the woman would do, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rocket science there were only two choices to choose yet the anticipation of what Debra was going to do was very interesting, to say the least.</span></div></div>",

Jillian loved being thin herself she loved to munch on chocolate but she loved doing gymnastics more it was one thing that was her favorite activities, as she played outside with their dog snow her mother was inside making pancakes and other fattening treats for her princess, as Jillian entered the kitchen all sweaty from playing with the family dog, in her favorite pink dress as she asked her mother 'what-cha cooking mama?'' Jillian's vocabulary wasn't the most sophisticated as she begun to learn how to talk not too long ago, but some simple phrases are all she needed to get what she wanted. With a smile and chuckle Carol begun to place a large amount of pancakes upon the table, telling her daughter 'oh just cooking you a light breakfast my piglet' with a sign of refusal upon Jillian's face, Carol wondered if she should even ask her daughter if she is going to eat all of these pancakes or just to handcuff her and make her, what should she do'</span></div></div>",

Carol is disappointed but unperturbed in her decision and she easily catches Jillian handcuffing her to the highchair; terrified Jillian starts bawling but is quickly quieted by a sharp cuff to the face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo my little piglet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her mother said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to get away that easily, as punishment for the attempt I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not taking off the cuffs until I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve either stuffed you till you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move or you end up passing out, more likely the latter instead of the former.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jillian whimpered, she just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why her mother was acting like this, she had always been a loving, caring woman or at least as far as Jillian knew- Her thoughts were broken away when a large forkful was shoved past her lips, so as not to choke she had to quickly chew and swallow, especially so since Carol quickly shoved in another forkful as soon as she had seen Jillian had swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was pleased by that because of the amount of food she kept in her piggy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the slightest protest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes piglet, this is all you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be doing from now on, eating and growing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said. Jillian was having trouble focusing on her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words because of both the onslaught of food and the growing tightness in her stomach which was beginning to hurt causing her whimper and start quietly crying. Carol saw her pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tears and stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you worry pig, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make sure that all of your breakfast gets into your soon to be bigger stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After Jillian saw how much food was left only been fed about an eighth of what was on the table she started breathing faster, leading to her stomach hurting more, and more. Jillian begins to choke on the food she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being stuffed with. Carol noticing this stops feeding her piglet, since food on the floor is less forming fat and tries to get her to stop choking so she can get back to feeding but, now she sees piggy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach and is surprised at how stretched it is. Carol hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought that it could get so red and decides to stop for now, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRest pig, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wake you in an hour or two for your next feeding, so digest fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She tells her daughter.  in the short time before falling into a food coma she realizes that true to her word her mother had stuffed her till she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move, her last lucid thoughts were bleak.</span></div></div>",

You might think that it had always been like this but in actuality they had been quite the happy family before her father, Barry was caught having an affair; it started with a slip-up when he called his wife, Susan the wrong name, understandably it went downhill quickly, leading to the current custody battle situation we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing. After she got dressed Angelica went to the kitchen for breakfast and was surprised when she saw a suitcase packed and set next to the table near where her mom is sitting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMommy, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Angelica. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh sweetie that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a suitcase, the one I packed for you while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be at my sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, well your aunt  Marcie's house for a while\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan amended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that with me and your father fighting all the time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to enjoy yourself; honestly I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been woken up at least once during the night by us and our fights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica thought about how she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had trouble sleeping during the fights, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes mommy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though Susan wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised she was still sorry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be better for you to stay at your aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s til all this blows over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica understood but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still miss her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come too, mommy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Susan tries to think of how to explain divorce to a 3-year-old, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry baby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have to work out some things with your father, unfortunately by the end of this we may not be able to see each other as much, depending on what the courts decide; though hopefully, they rule in my favor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since she was three Angelica didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand very much of what had been said, but she knew that it meant that her mom had to stay here, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOK mommy\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen am I going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan thought she knew there was something \u00e2\u0080\u009coff\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her sister but just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite remember what. As she thinking the sound of the doorbell broke into her reverie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh that must be her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan said as she broke away from her thoughts and got up to open the door.  Fifteen minutes after letting Aunt Marcie in her and they were done catching up. Marcie asked about Angelica, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she the little tot I saw last Christmas? She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown so much I barely recognized her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The mention of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrowth\u00e2\u0080\u009d tickled something in the back of Susan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, but what? In response to Marcie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question, she replies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Angelica and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown quite a bit in the last six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marcie agreed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven with the confirmation I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised at how big she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten, so she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking back with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She confirmed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get going, with how long the drive is and all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marcie agreed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right then, Angelica can you grab your bag?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica picks up her bag, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBye mommy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBye sweetie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Susan replied.  as Marcie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car drove away, Susan still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shake the feeling that the next time she saw Angelica she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d would no longer be the moderately active little girl she knew and loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As her aunt set Angelica on her arm, she could feel how light the girl was, something she planned to change, carrying the child with the one arm and pulling their bag with the other, Marcie brought her charge into the kitchen, placing her on one of the chairs as she procured all the pre-made baked goods she was keeping in her fridge and cupboards, covering the table in the mentioned treats the last thing she needed to do was secure her niece to the chair. As she was shaken awake, the first thing Angelica noticed was the thick scent of frosting in the air, the second, was that she couldn\u2019t move her limbs, the third thing was noticed as she opened her eyes in shock, she couldn\u2019t see, confused and somewhat terrified, the child tried to struggle against whatever it was that kept her in the chair, doing little other than showing Marcie that she was awake, as she opened her mouth to cry she instead got what tasted like cake shoved into her mouth, dumbfounded she swallowed, only to get another mouthful, and another, and another\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ended up startling Marcie out of the daydream she\u2019d fell into as she was overfeeding her charge was a call from her sister, Susan, asking if Angelica was having any problems getting used to the new house and being away from her parents, nonchalantly, she explained how the tot was still asleep from the long ride there, so she\u2019ll call back if she sees if anything's wrong once she\u2019s woken up. After the call ends, Marcie finally turns to look at her niece, surveying the lesser contents of the table in the process, as she did she saw that Angelia\u2019s stomach had swollen to an almost unbelievable size, pushing out a good three inches more than it had before and tinged an angry red, noting this, she felt conflicted, she didn\u2019t what to hurt the girl, but, having their stomach stretched this large would obviously mean she could eat more next time, and the next, and so on. Before she left the room to check the news, or maybe finish that book she\u2019d been reading, Marcie decided to loosen some of Angelica\u2019s bindings, not like she could go anywhere anyway, leaving to start on the rest of her day, she happily mused of when the tot would outgrow her bindings, not expecting it to take much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marcie came into the kitchen, both to check up on her disappointingly slender niece and to make herself some dinner. Once she\u2019d set out everything she\u2019d need to make a quick meal, her interest shifted to what sounded like fabric rubbing against itself, looking over to the origin of the noise, she was pleasantly surprised to find that the girl was waking up. Letting the unfortunate child wake up, Marcie set out the remnants of the earlier feast, then leaning over and whispering in Angelica\u2019s ear, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHold still, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hungry after such a long nap.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what her aunt said, the tot flinched, trembled, and began whimpering as she remembered the hopelessness of her situation. Her fear didn\u2019t stay unanswered for long, as the now terrifying scent of frosting reached her nose, then the taste to her mouth, which had been roughly filled with a taste she\u2019d recently grown to despise. She didn\u2019t resist, if only because she was smart enough to realize she couldn\u2019t, and so the feeding continued, with an increasingly painful amount of cake and frosting being packed into the child\u2019s gullet, likely to turn to an equivalent amount of flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie, though ruthless in her methods, did care for the girl, it was only that she was much too small for her tastes, and since she was staying here for the foreseeable future, why not get her to the right size? That was the mindset behind her actions since picking her niece up from her sister\u2019s, and until the day that she has to return her to whoever wins custody. Back in the present, the stuffing was nearing temporary conclusion, and with the table having emptied a majority of its contents, it wouldn\u2019t take long for the girl to finish, but what next? After thinking about it for a little while, Marcie came to a conclusion, if she was still awake afterward, why not let Angelica watch a movie or something? It might make the girl hate her a little less, she hoped it would, regardless of her actions she was still the tot\u2019s aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that internal decision, Angelica had been successfully stuffed with the entirety of what had been on the table, her swollen middle a testament to her unwilling gorge, now, like before, she was beginning to doze off. Noticing this, Marcie decided that she wouldn\u2019t bother the overfull child, leaving her to rest, she decided to undo her bindings in case the tot woke up and needed something during the night. Leaving the now unbound child to sleep, Marcie ate the quick meal she\u2019d made for herself, then went to bed herself, having pleasant dreams of the inevitable\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Not knowing what the day was going to bring Angelica begun to fear being around her aunt, Marcie was always thought of being an attentive aunt that always had a good head on her shoulders and would always be around to take care of Angelica. Something that was becoming very apparent to the little girl the more she would spend time with her strange aunt, was that there was some darkness in Marcie she had a devious side, to say the least, this was just something that she was going to have to accept about her aunt, though Angelica didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if her stomach would be able to get used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo More\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica preemptively yelled to her self still thinking that she was in the chair being fed more food than she had ever seen in her life, forced to ingest so much she was surprised she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any heartburn after that gorging. Not wanting to see her auntie as what had just transpired the day before was still burned into her brain, she knew that this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normal but while her mommy and daddy were having their problems as they have been for some time she was stuck being at her aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Angelica was hoping that what had occurred the other day was just some kind of bad memory that her body tricked her into having, the constant disagreements her parents would have over the months was just twisting the little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s psyche. Still in her purple pajamas that her mother packed for her the day before Angelica just laid in bed hoping these memories she was having would just vanish, lugging herself from being under the covers was no small feat for her as for it being a weekend Angelica just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like doing anything that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAngelica dear its time to get up and get some breakfast\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marcie yelled from the bottom of the stairs hoping that would be enough to rouse her niece from her incessant slumber. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope Angelica likes what I made for her, its all of her favorites\u00e2\u0080\u009d thinking to herself Marcie knew that in the end she has all the control and will do what she wants with Angelica but its always to get them a choice for choices are the spice of life. Sighing from the exuberant cost of energy it was going to be to deal with Marcie, she began to make her way downstairs trying to shove that strange dream she had down into her subconscious there was no way that was real it was just so strange, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walking down the stairs, holding onto the banister for support being very uncoordinated with walking since she just learned to do that just a few months ago. Making her way down she could see that Marcie was there just waiting for Angelica to get down to the bottom floor anxious looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI made it auntie\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica proudly announced feeling so proud at her accomplishments it felt like a wave of pride washed over her. <br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good now its time for breakfast so come along, Honey\u00e2\u0080\u009d in her sweetest voice Marcie exclaimed, holding Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand leading her to the kitchen where breakfast was already prepared for the tot. Entering the threshold of the doorway it could be seen that the there was a highchair already in place for her to be placed in, that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the thing that seemed out of place for Angelica the thing that really made her dread that the scenario she though she dreamt was turning into a reality in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we having people over for breakfast auntie\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica tried to laugh off her suspicions of what was going to happen the best she could, feeling the grip of Marcie tighten around her little hand was scaring her to say the least not knowing what kind of things her aunt was thinking about. Looking at Marcie put fear into Angelica to say the least a wide grin was on her fact while she eyed the food, eyes darted down to Angelica from time to time almost telling her that this was all for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no dear there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anyone coming over this is your breakfast I hope I made enough I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a growing girl, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that right Piglet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u009d her true intentions slipped out for just a bit was all Angelica needed to know that the dream she had wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a dream at all, Marcie did force her to eat against her will and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over with not even close. Trying to pull away from Marcie wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been a good way to start the day for all Angelica knew was her aunt was adamant of feeding all of this feast into Angelica, she knew that she had to get away from her aunt and get back to her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not that hungry auntie\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just gonna watch TV\u00e2\u0080\u009d Angelica chuckled in hopes that this was enough to sway the twisted mind of her aunt to let her go in hopes that she would be able to escape from what ever devious plans she had cooked up for her niece. Keeping an eye on her little niece Marcie reluctantly released her hand for she had to get the highchair ready for Angelica and make sure her piglet had enough breathing room to eat. Looking around and at what Marcie was doing Angelica knew that this was her chance to get away from what ever her aunt was going to do to her she had to take it, not wanting to make her aunt mad or anything Angelica begun to slowly slide her body toward the door frame hoping that Marcie didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for the aunt to notice what Angelica was planning. She'd expected it from the start, not that the girl's attempt mattered, the door had been locked since her arrival. Regardless, she focused on finishing the last of her niece's breakfast, a devilish grin adorning her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Angelica, she'd finally crept over to the door, adrenaline flowing through her tiny body. Moving her hand to grab and turn the doorknob. She felt happiness unlike any she'd experienced before, and when that doorknob didn't turn, she felt similarly great despair. Not much was necessary at this point, though at first, her lips weren't quite in tune with her emotions, momentarily making her face a heartbreaking visage. Still smiling as widely as when she'd expected escape, yet now with tears beginning to stream down, drops falling and soaking into the carpet never to be seen again. As if they were a fitting metaphor for her hope. For a moment she wasn't able to understand what happened, so she tried the knob again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again. The corners of her mouth lowered all the while. Slowly distorting it into a frown that would likely stay there for the foreseeable future.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, having finished setting out her niece's meal, Marcie neither noticed nor cared much about what her charge felt was a tragedy. For why would you expect a benefiter to complain? Sure, she wanted to be friends with the girl, but no reason that couldn't come from Stockholm\u2019s trademark. Moving to the other room, she went over to the door and picked up the sullen girl, carrying her back to the table and the breakfast that covered it. Though she didn't care to comfort her charge, Marcie did give the girl a chance, leaving her unbound in case she tried drowning her sorrow with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it seemed like a possibility, Angelica shakily taking bites out of the dish in front of her, slowing speeding up as if to fill the void her hope had left. Yet because of how dense it was, it didn't take long before the girl was full, regardless, she ate, more out of fear and desperation than anything else at this point. Unfortunately, her family wasn't known for its patience, and her currently unremarkable speed led the girl to soon find her wrists bound to the chair. When it happened, you might\u2019ve expected her to cry, which, while likely, wasn\u2019t quite possible with Marcie already having forced a forkful into her mouth, leading to the pattern of; chew, swallow, repeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this cycle, her stomach was steadily overstuffed, pancakes, waffles, sausage, and all other forms of breakfast, finding their way into her gullet. As it continued, it eventually reached the point where the girl's stomach showed a more visible indication of its overfull state. Despite this, Marcie continued trying to force dish after dish into her charge, regardless of how said charge's stomach was beginning to tinge red from the stress it suffered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, Marcie had to stop, with the noises that were coming from her niece; she didn't think it'd be a good idea to continue. Especially once she finally realized how engorged the girl's middle was. After all, what good would it be if all of her efforts were strewn onto the floor? Still, there wasn't a reason not to clear the table first, and with what she was working toward the woman saw all the less point in wasting food. When that was done, the aunt looked down at her adorable, unfortunate, oh so undernourished niece. The thoughts of what's to come reminded her of when she'd first realized her attractions, it'd been hard restraining herself that time after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to break her new toy Marcie thought it was going to be for the best for Angelica to rest from her first feeding, a smile was stretched across Marcie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, grinning from ear to ear as she looked upon Angelica with desire \u00e2\u0080\u009cits so hard to wait for my little glutton, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry you can sit and rest as I make your next meal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Marcy begun to say picking up Angelica gently making sure not to touch her sore stomach as little as possible when moving the tot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blue shirt that once covered Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach was so overfilled with so many sweets that it stuck out and stopped being covered by her shirt only slightly. Place down on the plush couch was the best feeling to her the massive feeding she just had experienced was something out of a horror movie Angelica couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comprehend what reason she was fed in such a way her aunt was usually a happy go lucky and kind person what made her attitude shift in such a way to feed her so much and have no remorse in what she had just done, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess a little TV time would do you some good so you can relax and digest your big meal, your being such a good piggy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marcie chuckled knowing that Angelica had no choice in the matter in how much she got fed anyways but it was fun to make it seem like the young girl really did have a choice in the matter of how much she was going to get fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Happily humming Marcie made her way to the kitchen to get cooking for the glutton that was sitting on her couch, she was happy as can be to feed Angelica all the delicious food she could scrounge up for her niece. Angelica was a different story entirely, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why there was such a shift in her aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demeanor all she knew is when she got the chance to she needed to get away from this demon that looked like her aunt, as of right now that was going to be a little hard to pull off as currently immobilized by this giants orb that was her stomach. Looking at the flashing pictures that looked like a cartoon of some sort she began to become entranced by the cartoon, it looked to be Steven Universe one of her favorite shows to watch when it was on. So very docile when a TV is put in front of her like any other kid, this made it a bit easier on Marcie to curb the relentless the little girl, although her bloated stomach made it easier to tame her as well though Marcie didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really mind teaching the little one who was really in control in this situation, every girl needs to know who is the master and who is the slave sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going to the kitchen, feeling confident that her little glutton wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to move since she was glued to the TV Marcie began to make preparation for Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next meal. Digesting her meal that was shoved past her lips felt so much better to Angelica than being so full that she was afraid that she was going to pop, yet moving wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an option although she kept watching her marathon of Steven Universe for about an hour and a half now, Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes never really focused on it she was more concerned in looking for a way to escape from her so-called aunt by any case, not that she was really in a position to do anything right now although when she finally digests and can move normally again that is when it will be time to strike.</span></div></div>",

Some time passed and now it\u2019s about two years after that convention, Ron gained a lot from that event, now having three new enjoyments in his life, the first was his half-year-old daughter Beatrice who\u2019d brought to him the previously unknown joy of children, the second would obviously be the one who\u2019d given him that child, his wife Amy, who he\u2019d met at that fateful convention, they\u2019d been fast friends and soon learned that they had more similarities than first thought, the third thing he\u2019d gained was his hobby, though of less importance than his family, he still felt satisfaction after every refurbished room. Currently in one of the aforementioned rooms, he surveyed the furniture mentally noting what was or wasn\u2019t safe for babies, in the end he wrote down what would need to be changed at the bottom of his note sheet, sighing as more than half of each room of the house needed changing, totaling to a somewhat startling sum for the storage of old and purchase of new furnishings for the home, irked and worried he went up to sleep. At breakfast, before Amy left for work, Ron decided to explain the current situation, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything other than cheap products like plastic chairs or the like will put us in the red,\u201d He stated, \u201cthat\u2019s assuming you\u2019re wanting to keep our current furnishings in storage where they won\u2019t deteriorate, I\u2019d prefer not to, so I\u2019m open to any possible suggestions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t expecting anything, so when Amy asked him if any method was fine he was intrigued and asked her to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we fatten Beatrice up?\u201d Amy suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ron prodded, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that helps how?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if she was fatter she\u2019d have more padding to protect her,\u201d Explained Amy, \u201cand don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t think she\u2019d be any cuter. Anyway, it\u2019s not going to hurt to try is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Ron agreed, not like it could end that badly anyway, but he still had one more question, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhen do we start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re really sorry about pushing this onto you, but your father and I only have so many opportunities for a promotion, especially at our ages, so we want to make sure to take any chances left. Thank you for promising to take care of your sister.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine mom, I\u2019m used to your trips and I know why you take them.

Remember, if you\u2019re letting her crawl around, make sure you\u2019ve picked up anything small enough for her to put in her mouth, we don\u2019t want her choking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should be fine, I\u2019ve tidied up. You two go on ahead, call me when you get there, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, love you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d Said Jeremy, as he pulled both of his parents in for a hug goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter they left, Jeremy picked up his sister, Lucy, and brought her into the room he\u2019d somewhat remodeled for her arrival. The room wasn\u2019t much, it\u2019s main fixture was the crib he's borrowing from his parents while they were on their trip, the only other things in the room were the boxes of diapers Jeremy had bought for Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a glance nothing was amiss, but upon closer inspection, you\u2019d notice something about the diapers, namely, they were all the wrong size, some even the largest size the store carried. The only reasons one might buy them would be if they had strangely poor eyesight, a child at that size, or reason to expect a need for them soon. Out of those options, only one made the slightest sense, there was some reason for him to expect a need for them, but what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer, odd though it was, became clear enough when he pulled out a large cake and began cutting it into chunks small enough to fit into his blender, after filling the blender jar, Jeremy held down the lid and started blending the paste that would become one of the main aspects of Lucy\u2019s diet while she was here. When there was a bit more space in the blender Jeremy stopped it, took off the lid, topped off the jar with gain shake, replaced the lid and restarted blending. Jeremy stopped the blender as soon as the mixture looked uniform, then detached the pitcher from the stand before opening a drawer and grabbing the other two things he needed, a funnel and a roll of duct tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jeremy had set out what he was about to use, he started to think about exactly what he was planning on doing, because honestly, what was he planning to do? Was there some hidden but sensible reasoning for this? No, there wasn\u2019t, the only reason Jeremy had in defense of his future sins was paltry at best, being little more than that she\u2019d be cuter than she was now. Originally, he\u2019d had a half-joking thought about doing this so he could have an extra comfortable gaming chair, though that soon changed in favor of a strange perversion Jeremy had noticed in himself, he wanted Lucy to be helpless, incapable of doing anything of than eating, sleeping, etc. Even before she ended up immobile, Jeremy wanted to savor how much she\u2019d struggle, trying to crawl even as her stomach was resting ever more so on the ground. Once Lucy was rendered immobile under her own power\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Jeremy got back to the task at hand, pulling off a length of the tape with an audible SHRIIIIP, he quickly secured his unfortunate sibling. With how rough he was while binding her, it came as no surprise when Lucy woke up, soon becoming perplexed enough by the situation to start crying, accomplishing little other than granting Jeremy a sadistic pleasure in her discomfort. Deciding to take advantage of Lucy\u2019s wailing, Jeremy wasted no delicacy shoving the funnel into her mouth, making sure it was properly taped. Once the funnel was attached, Jeremy picked up the pitcher again and started pouring the fattening liquid into the unlucky baby\u2019s mouth, watching their throat bulge with each small, desperate swallow. As Lucy\u2019s face slowly started to convert into an expression of abject discomfort, then pain, as Jeremy kept the flow steady, pitiless toward the overfull girl, mercilessly pinching her nose whenever her pace slowed, forcing her to take a few panicked gulps to try and get a breath of air. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what to Lucy felt like an eternity, though in reality was only around fifteen to twenty minutes, the last dregs of the sludge her brother had forced into her had made their way through the funnel and disappeared with a final, exhausted gulp. With the pitcher emptied, Jeremy detached and removed the funnel before putting a strip of tape over Lucy\u2019s mouth to make sure none of the mixture gets expelled. Afterward, Jeremy decides to have some fun with his overfilled sister starting to pinch, poke and prod at the swollen mass that made up Lucy\u2019s midsection, enjoying the discomfort shown to him on his sibling\u2019s face. Due to how rough she was being handled, Lucy had started crying again, sobbing quietly through the tape on her mouth, hoping for her brother to stop, surprisingly, he did after a quick glance at the clock. The reason was that Jeremy saw it was about time for him to put in his work for the day, leaving Lucy bound and stuffed he went to his office to put in his shift. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The media was in turmoil, as was a good portion of the country. The reason was apparent, the young Dewly heiress had been abducted, and no one had entirely figured out how. People\u2019s theories ranged from conspiracy to it being the product of plain negligence, but the only way to actually know would be to ask the perpetrators. So why not move to their perspectives, maybe we\u2019ll learn something\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look, we\u2019re famous.\u201d Said Chris, one of the abductors, pointing at one of the nearby newspaper racks, filled with papers showing a headline in large, bold letters, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDEWLY HEIR ABDUCTED, BY WHOM? HOW?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, Gerald, another member of the group, gave him a blunt reminder, \u201cOf course we are. What did you expect? That no one would notice if we stole the child of one of the wealthiest families in the world?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to the large boxes of assorted foodstuffs they\u2019d bought after they\u2019d set the terms of returning the girl. Instructing his partner, \u201cStop being an idiot and get over here so you can help me load these. The gold\u2019s not about to make itself.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Chris conceded, hoisting a crate into the back of the old van they\u2019d gotten before the heist. Again thinking that the other member of their group was a tad eccentric. As in all honesty, what kind of person would be able to pressure anyone into writing a ransom agreement to pay the girl\u2019s weight in gold?  Who wouldn\u2019t take advantage of that?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the last of the boxes into the van, Chris climbed inside, shutting the doors behind him and making his way to the passenger seat. Then attaching his seatbelt while Gerald started the vehicle to begin the journey back to their temporary home. Both held a bit of pity for their victim, given what they expected her to be forced to experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot horribly long after that, they\u2019d returned, the van parked at an entirely nondescript home. Its anonymity increased all the more, given that it sat on a back road. Hopping out of the vehicle, the two set to work, moving box after box inside, eventually filing a decent half of the living room. That didn\u2019t matter much, though, as soon enough, Carla had grabbed one of the containers before moving back to her captive with a noticeably happy disposition.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Anna\u2019s room, the child was abruptly woken up and soon found that she couldn\u2019t move any of her limbs. Before she\u2019d registered it enough to cry, someone else spoke, seeming happy for whatever reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re up, great. Now,\u201d The woman started, picking up a cake from the box beside her, \u201copen up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, and a little hungry, she did. To her, near-immediate regret as a handful of baked good was forced into her mouth. Choking the arguably delicious mouthful down, Anna once again made the mistake of opening her mouth in an attempt to cry. And so, it started, a handful being stuffed into her at every opportunity she gave, and a pinch or poke, whenever she stopped giving said opportunities. Expectably, the two\u2019s opinions on the activity were mirror opposites.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Carla, there hadn\u2019t been a happier time than this that she could remember. Her enthusiasm showed, hands forcing chunk after chunk into the girl\u2019s face, and thus her stomach. On that point, the woman noticed that it was looking a tad tight, and, though notably disappointed, decided that it would be better to stop now. Half-jokingly thinking of how she wouldn\u2019t get any money if the kid burst, which didn\u2019t seem terribly farfetched at this stage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving poor Anna in her makeshift crib, Carla made her way out of the room, a small part of her hoping that her cohorts wouldn\u2019t make a fuss if they saw the girl. After all, if not this, then how was she expected to make their fortune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To a girl and her mother this was home to them even with all the tourists that always made it unbearable to even walk down the street to the nearest grocery story was almost a chore thanks to the people who have come all over the world just to gawk at the culture that this mother and daughter have brought up to know their whole lives. It was quite appalling to see these sheep on the street just grazing about not even caring about the locals who the were ticking off, \u201ccome on Brooke we have an appointment to meet your Father who would rather be at work than home with his loving family\u201d Brooke's mother would state over and over to her two year old daughter. Brooke\u2019s parents at the time were going though a nasty divorce that has made it hard for the little two year old to have a normal life, her life seemed as If it was coming crumbling down around her. Now it wasn\u2019t money or a placed to live that was so worrying when it came to the life that she was living, her parents seemed to be always fighting about things she didn\u2019t really under stand all she knew was her mother always kissed her on the cheek and told her that it wasn\u2019t her fault, it was his. Brooke\u2019s mother always looked sad and alone to the girl and she wanted more than anything to help her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the large building that was front of the was somewhat awe inspiring to the little girl, this is where her father worked and where he drove away his family, Pushing back her blond hair out of her face to get a good look at the building where her father put countless hours away from his family to make her mother sad with his betrayal. Brooke didn\u2019t even realize what had happened to the happy family she once knew all she knew now was that her mother loved her to no end and will do anything to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t be living with her father, it was her last ditch effort to make trouble for her ex-husband and his new lover as her expert lawyers were at the moment she was filing these papers to her husband trying to find every loophole in the book to protect her and her daughter. Reaching the floor that her vile husband was working on she begun to feel the sting of eyes that were centered upon her, the workers all knew of the loveless marriage they had together for the past ten years, the only joy to ever come from their marriage was the blonde haired bundle of energy that was Brooke, Brooke Brooke almost like her mother with a few exceptions here and there, but their striking blonde hair that both of them posses was one thing that tied mother and daughter together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a divorce\u201d state Brooke mother triumphantly while slamming the papers down upon the desk of her ex-husband while looking over some important numbers for his company, \u201cyou can talk to my lawyers If you have any questions dear  but me and Brooke are through with you\u201d brimming with pride in her statements Brooke\u2019s mom begun to walk out of the office just as her husband begun to get that hot wash of shame. All of his colleagues that see him everyday looked in awe as he begun to yell at his wife \u201cyou won\u2019t get a dime Shelia, you must know this no one will take this case\u201d spouting all the most rude and incoherent things that he could think of just to get a reaction out of his wife, just as she got to the elevator to leave her old life behind and to start a new one with her daughter, her phone rang. It was her lawyers stating some business that pertain to her keeping her personal honey hole and Brooke would seem to be the key, looking at her all Shelia could see was money in her eyes.

Her belly round and pressing into the waist band of the pull-up she wore as well as causing the pink shirt to stretch pretty tightly over her belly.  Shelia knew her daughter was getting full she had just finished eating enough food to fill a child at least 4 times her size and age; but sheila wanted her daughter even fuller, she needed her to be fuller.  For her plan to work she needed Brooke to get fat.  Brooke not wanting to be a 'bad girl' still ate, more slowly mind you, but ate none the less as her little hands were slowly rubbing as best as they can her bound belly.</span></div></div>",

Her belly in futher discomfort due to the position she was now it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want a pop then eat!\" Brooke's mother was very forcefull with her words but Brooke was so full.

Brook didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how much she could put up with this pain, her mother or the person that she thought was once her caring and loving mother looked pleased with the progress Brooke was making, she knew that right now Brooke was just bloated with food and she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually fat not yet anyway. Seeing how uncomfortable her daughter was from her pants the only logical to help her daughter, grabbing Brooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet Shelia begun pulling on the bottom of the jeans yanking them off with one swift movement Brooke was only wearing her shirt and diaper.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was such a relief for Brooke to be stripped of her jeans made more room for her stomach, Shelia looked at her daughter as she just laid upon the couch, breathing heavily as the meal that was forced into her gullet made every breath made her feel like she could explode at any minute. Seeing how much pain her toy was in Sheila thought it would be best if she just cuddled her daughter for the rest of the day she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to break her little piglet but she needed Brooke to know who was the master and who was the slave, here is hoping that Brooke got the message. Sitting down beside Brook who was laying down on the couch trying to alleviate some of the pressure from her stomach, slight burps escaped her mouth as she cradles her stomach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry my dear piglet you will get used to this I promise\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shelia chuckled reaching down to her daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach she began to lightly stroke the orb, small circles in the pale flesh was just what Brooke was looking for.

Shelia was on the phone the whole time sense they left the confines of daddy's office. Brooke didn't truly understand what was going on she figured they were just acting normally.  Getting loud and being mean was what mommy and daddy seemed to just do recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful we will be right over,\" Shelia yammered into her phone before before hanging up without so much as a goodbye.  The with a huge smile she looked down at the slow walking little Brooke with her blond brownish hair and her wood board like appearance.  \"Hey my precious little one,\" she picked up Brooke and held her close in her arms as they traversed the streets of London with purpose  \"you ready to eat?\"  Brooke looked up at her mommy with gentle eyes and nodded only once.  It was around lunch time for the little one anyway but Shelia had other ideas.  The got to the the place in which Shelia was talking to on the phone, it was a buffet; but not just any buffet, this one seemed abandoned.  They walked in and was greeted by a chubby female no older then 21 with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wonderful you made it, and so fast too,\" the young adult smiled at the both of them \"your table is ready follow me,\" she took her hand and presented the way to the two of them.  The followed the girl to a room in the back of the empty buffet.  See Shelia's emergency call was to rent this restaurant for a special meal for her and her daughter; but mostly her daughter.  they were seated at a long table and it was piled high with plates full of food specially tailored to be eaten by a two year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I can't,\" Brooke said in her soft voice motioning to the food at giving a concerned look to her mother who was nothing but beaming at the amount of food sitting there on the table \"It, to much.\" Brooke continued to say to her mother who might not of actually been listening at this part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit, my child.\" she smiled wide as she picked up a spoon and scooped a spoonful of yams from a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, mom,\" was all that came out of brooks mouth before the yams were blindly shoved into her face. they were so good covered in a thick layer of sugary marshmallow goodness.Brooke didn't have time to saver it before a spoonful of something completely different was places in her still kinda full mouth.  She realized her mom might just keep stuffing her face if she didn't sit and participate so she took this time to sit down and prepare to eat at her own speed if her mom let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna be a good girl and eat on your own?\" Brooke's mom asked her with less joy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mum I will be good,\" Brooke slowly started eating mashed potatoes from the plate in front of her. Besides the yams they were probably her favorite thing. She ate at least two plates after that first one before burping and sitting back in her chair, completely full.  you could see the sight outline of her bloated food filled balloon like belly.  She was done or so she thought.  Her mother let her breath of a moment and after another big burp from her child she shoved a few french fries in her mouth. Brooke looked up at her mother confused with the fries hanging out of her half closed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it,\" was all that came out of her mothers mouth.  Brooke looked back at the rest of the table with dread fearing if she ate much more she would die; but she trusted her mother not to do anything scary like that to her.  Well at least she would hope.  With her belly full she chewed ad swallowed the fries; but her body wouldn't allow her to willing open her mouth.  She was just to full; but her mother wasn't hearing any of that, or even cared about it for the moment. she held up a fish fillet to her daughter wanting her to eat it but Brookes lips stayed firmly shut to her mothers advances. \"Brooke you are gonna eat, or so help me!\" Shelia nearly rose her voice at the little two year old, with the bloated, full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so full mommy, no more please,\" Brooke's voice was quiet, timid, frightened at her mother but her mother didn't have a friendly face on, it was rather intimidating and harsh.  Shelia held the fish up to her daughter, but still Brooke remained resolute in her not eating.  Then Shelia did something unforeseen she grabbed her daughter's face with her free hand and forced her mouth open to force this food in.  Brooke's resistance was next to none so she had her mothers hand holding her mouth open when she saw that her daughter needed more food in it. Ten minutes and another plate down soft tears started to stream down Brooke's face as she struggled to chew and swallow another bite.  Her hands were on top of her dress feeling how big her belly was, it was monstrous to her, but it wasn't enough for Shelia.  She wanted her daughter bigger, much bigger; but it wouldn't happen over night.  Maybe she should quit for this meal seeing as how her daughter is new to this and thus gets full so quickly.  Though on the other hand her daughters belly was starting to keep her daughter from breathing to it's full capacity due to it's bigness; but looks like she could fit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think this mother should do?<br>\r\nGo home this time and let little Brooke rest<br>\r\nor<br>\r\nShe should just keep stuffing her child</span></div></div>",

She could see how tight her clothes were before she pressed down. Brooke's belly was tight and full but not full enough for her.  \"You finished eating?'. Brooke was confused it was almost like her mom thought she was just eating and got full when infact she was forced to eat; but through tears in her eyes she looked up at her mom and nodded yes.  With that nod Brooke's mom frowned and then got up. Brooke's fear was swelling up again as Sheila walked away from her to get somethings. She promptly came back with desert, lots of soft treats, cake, pie, ice cream, it looked amazing; but Brooke was to full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I'm to full for this,\" Brooke was pushing away what she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not done till I say you are done,\" and with a few speedy motions the Velcro on Brooke's cloths we're opened giving her a bit more room but not much more. Not that, that mattered to Sheila, she was only focused on putting as much food into her daughter as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy please, don't make me,\" as when words fell out of Brooke's mouth her mother shoved a thick peice of cake into her face smearing a good portion of it on her already messy face but getting alot into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw that is a good piggy,\" she smiled as she continued to force more down into her daughter's belly. Brooke got a moment to breath after a slice of cake she took that one moment to try to make a plea to her mother with tears, and some snot streaming down her food covered face like a good piggy, still with her mouth full and her belly even Fuller streching even her now looser outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mommy no more,\" she was sobbing and breathing hard between her belly and crying getting in the way of her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Shelia's tone became harsh again as she balled her free hand up and put down the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mommy I can't, it hurts.\" She pleaded with her mother \"I'm too full, it's to much...\" Little Brooke was cut off as her mom slapped her clean in the face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should happen next</span></div></div>",

Still, she continued with her command; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ask for your opinion? No. I said you would eat. Therefore you will. Now, let\u2019s try this again. Open up my little piggy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointingly, the girl didn\u2019t respond, only staring blankly from the shock of what had just occurred, her mother, previously as gentle as could be, had brought her hand against her; why? Confused thoughts were floating through her head, some merely scared, while others grasped at straws such as, \u201cIs it my fault? Should I just eat until I can\u2019t move? Would that bring my mom back?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, those questions would go unasked, and therefore unanswered, there were more important things about after all. Not to mention the needy looking one over by the food, the employee recording the spectacle on her phone with one hand, causing Shelia to smirk when she realized why the other was nowhere in sight. Calling out to her, she informed the woman; <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey, May! You know you could help out if you want. No need for you to watch from afar, why not join the fun?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, the proprietor started walking closer, asking a worrying question, for Brooke, at least, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but should I get some more food? Or there are some unprepared items like cake batter if you\u2019d prefer those?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you mention that before?\u201d Shelia exasperatedly mentioned before continuing. \u201cStill, that\u2019d be great, could you go get a pitcher of it? After all, what better way is there for us to make sure she\u2019s packed as full as we can get her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d She promised, teasing slightly before she went, \u201cDo try to keep her conscious, though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpectably, it only took a few minutes before Shelia\u2019s new friend returned with a pitcher in hand. The container filled with the equivalent of over half a gallon of well-mixed cake batter, with some extra butter and sorts for good measure, of course. It showed itself to be satisfactory if Shelia\u2019s smile meant anything, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing suit, the lip of the receptacle was pushed into Brooke\u2019s mouth, forcing the greasy flow to pour down her throat. Sadly, it barely took a minute for her remaining capacity to be filled, announced by a short fit of choking before she passed out. The women were disappointed by this, not to mention distracted in Shelia\u2019s case, the mother\u2019s arm going slack as she was lost in thought, leading the remaining batter to drizzle onto the unconscious child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for just what the woman was thinking about, she was recalculating how long this project should be expected to take. Since, disappointingly enough, her earlier assumption of the girl\u2019s capacity was a tad too optimistic, meaning it might take a bit longer, but then there was the introduction of May. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay? You\u2019ve been spaced out for a few minutes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Shelia startled, not realizing she\u2019d been so deep in thought, \u201cSorry, I was just trying to think of how long it should take before we see some solid results, best I could think of was a month or two though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be nice, and not to sound rude, but predictions don\u2019t really matter. As long as we keep fattening her, the result will be the same after all. So, what\u2019s the use of possibly setting ourselves up for disappointment?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess. What should we do now, though? I was planning on bringing her back, but it doesn\u2019t look like she could make the trip without spewing all over the seats, even ignoring the result of when I was distracted.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t we wait in the break room? There\u2019s a television in there for when business is slower than usual if we need to waste some time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we might as well see if we can get to know each other a bit too. We don\u2019t know anything more about each other than our names, after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the unconscious, blatantly abused toddler in her chair, the women walked off, happily chattering as they found more in common than just their guilty pleasures.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nodding to Shelia that she will be good and not cry about the abrupt slap that was caused by Brooke being so rebellious about her feedings then they would go home for some rest and relaxation, no matter how much this decision pained Shelia to make. Picking up her two year old and pressing her bloated body against hers was almost heavenly, feeling the girls stomach which at this point was more like an orb than a stomach the fullness that she had created with just the bits of food in her was nothing to what Shelia was planning to do to her daughter. From the first time Brooke was born into this world Shelia loved her daughter but not in a way a mother loves a daughter, she loved her the way a husband loves a wife or a boyfriend loves his girlfriend, from day one of meeting her awful husband in that ritzy bar that he was the perfect pawn to use in her plans to be rich enough to put her twisted Ideas to motion. As they were leaving from the buffet the woman who was called upon to make Brooke eat so much had arrived with another meal for Brooke to devour, just looking at this large bowl of pudding that the woman was carrying made Brooke sick to her stomach the thought of that being forced into her little body was a sick thought with this woman being so cheerful about the situation Brook was in made it all creepier than it needed to be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will not need your services anymore today Claudia thank you for all your help fattening this little one, but its time to get this one home to digest her big meal and some measuring when she wakes up\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shelia spoke to the woman who was caring the large bowl with such a subtle tone that it was almost weird how they left the Buffet area as Claudia bowed to her guests only thing coming out of her mouth being \u00e2\u0080\u009cplease come again I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to see you and your piglet again\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n,  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally the got home to their house a house that was bought by the divorce that was placed by Shelia to get away from her husband and focus on her true love, that is the girl who was so full on food that was forcefully stuffed into her mouth that she was in her car seat sleeping. Being comforted by the sways of the car made it easy for Brooke to fall asleep with such a full stomach. Shelia was excited for tomorrow this is when she can truly show Brooke that she is her piglet and her only place in this world is to please her master in anyway possible, carrying Brooke into her room was more difficult that it once was due to her added weight but it was still like carrying a feather for Shelia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSooner or later my sleeping piglet we will have to make your room on the first floor when your still mobile that is\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shelia could only say grinning wildly at what she was creating with Brooke as she took the sleeping girl to her room, the room full of things that were of the pink and girly nature only made sense for she just loved anything barbie or bratz her room reflected this out looked. Placing the girl into her bed Shelia looked on to her little creation with loving eyes thinking of all that was going to be come of Brook, Shelia could only kiss the unconscious girl on the lips for now whispering in the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear \u00e2\u0080\u009csoon my pet you will be as big as the dining room\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></div></div>",

Even with the new attention Brooke placed on the current situation, she realized that it wasn\u2019t like she could do anything, even if she was able to manage some sort of resistance, she was too exhausted, mentally more so than physically, to pull any sort of attempt, and who could blame the child, their realization was enough to at least startle most in her situation, adding to that her age, she was taking this unexpectedly well, as one would expect a girl her age to uncontrollably bawl, her daughter\u2019s seeming acceptance of her future, filled Shelia with if not joy, anticipation, impatience for what the future would undoubtedly bring, now with a grin filling her face, she continued feeding her pet, thinking of how well this was going, now with no doubt that she'll fulfill her desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around the room she found her shoes, twilight sparkle inspired naturally, putting them on her feet, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to tie her laces yet so the only thing she could do was tuck them in the shoe themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All set to escape, Brooke\u00e2\u0080\u009d now needed to just get out of the door it was just that simple\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought to herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmom is making more food for me so she should be distracted, this is going to be easy\u00e2\u0080\u009d opening the door slightly looking into the hall for her mother not wanting to encounter her not in the slightest, looking through the gaps in the banister looking for any indication that her mother was in the area, listening intently she made her way down the stairs as slowly as she could hoping that she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be caught by Shelia was her ideal situation but Brooke knew she had to be on guard all the way through this.

This was something that Brooke didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to happen to her she knew that she wasn't supposed to go outside without her mother since she was still two years old and the bustling city of London was quite different from the quietness that came from their home. Looking at the large red door in front of her, the handle squarely just in arms reach Brooked shuddered with the ideas that came from her trying to escape her Mother or whatever that demon was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a few feet away from me why is it so hard, Just open it and get out of here before the next feeding\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brooke said to herself trying to make her feet move as she wanted them too, something was wrong though the seeds of doubt begun to blossom in her very soul she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move from the spot that she was planted it was like her mother was bringing her back to the house making sure that Brooke knew that she was nothing more than a piglet to be fed she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any real choice in the matter she was hers. It was quite true, to say the least even as Brooke looked at the door longing to go to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and try to convince him of how Brooke was no longer being treated like a daughter anymore she was just a toy for Shelia to pose and fatten up, Shelia was just right behind the door-frame of the kitchen that peered into the living room, having quite a view of the front door was a plus too, she knew what her daughter was up to from the beginning she just wanted to see how far Brooke would really get with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh there you are Brooke I was wondering where you went to\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shelia nonchalantly stated knowing full well that she was trying to escape the house of horrors that Shelia had created for her little piglet thought there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a ways that Brooke could physically get away from her mother but seeing that there was still some hope in Brooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes that Shelia could take advantage of and turn into something that only made her piglet more obedient to her and that she was doing this for Brooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own good even if she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that it was all for the best in the long run. Frozen in fear of what would happen to her if she really told her mother the truth of wanting to get away from her ant the mental manipulation that was being pressured onto this little toddler, sauntering over to her daughter to try to steer her away from in hopes that this little encounter of Shelia knowing what her silly daughter was thinking before she could act on it would be enough to deter her from trying again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I escape, I just stood there like an idiot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brooke thought, hating herself for not going anywhere with her attempt being all for naught all little Brooke could do was release herself from the machinations that her mother has in store for her. Picking up the toddler was easy enough to do picking her up by her arms and placing Brook on the side of her hip like picking up a box filled with air. So light made sheila depressed a little bit she it had only been a couple of days sure but she thought that with the constant feedings that she had begun to force on Brooke would do something to the little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body this thinking was proven false she may have gained a pound or two but nothing that seemed like it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be out of the ordinary for a girl of her age to acquire especially when living in an area like London. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what she was looking for. No, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a chubby girl or even a fat girl, Sheila craved something more something that made her mind run wild with how ridiculous with the thought of a toddler achieving this. An obedient blob of a piglet is what she wanted that was all she ever thought of when she divorced Brooke s father as he had done is a job, giving her a daughter whose beauty was out of this world and the funds to make her dream a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course, Shelia did care for her daughter, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that way other people would see as caring for a toddler though this was quite apparent to anyone who looked into the house and sees what Shelia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love really meant for someone under her power. From what Brooke dressed into where she went all were going to be controlled by her mother this was just a part of life now there was nothing that Brooke could think of doing to make sure she could do that would make the loving mother that she once knew come back from the dead. Her master wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the mother she once knew something was different and Brooke couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really put a finger on what changed her mother into the master she turned into within the week. quite perplexed with this Brooke wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even paying attention that they were walking somewhere she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where as she never really paid attention to the architect of the house or where all the rooms were she was too busy with preschool to remember this, since she was pulled from school as a way to control her Brooke noticed these things a little more clearly. Shelia used one hand to carry her piglet around like she was just another thing that any woman had to carry and the other opened the door that was quite a mystery to Brooke, the door creaked open the door hinges squeaking all the time it opened to reveal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Brooke saw surprised her, notably so. It wasn\u2019t that she was still being surprised by her mother\u2019s actions, not this time at least; instead, she was amazed by the room in front of her. Holding to the stereotype, the toddler was never one to turn down anything pink, princess, fairy, or any other girly things. Such things were the quickest route to the young girl\u2019s heart. So enamored she was by the d\u00e9cor, the girl momentarily forgot about what her mother had and was doing to her, initially not recognizing the elaborate cakes placed around the room. Regardless, her pleasant reverie was soon tainted by her mother\u2019s almost sing-song voice,   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you like your new room, dear. Now,\u201d Shelia says as she picks up one of the room\u2019s many cakes, \u201clet\u2019s see how long it takes you to grow into it, my piglet.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke, having climbed onto the bed to see how comfortable it was, now found that she was trapped, there was nowhere she could go to escape her mother. Nevertheless, she frantically scooted backward, away from her mother, and only stopped when she\u2019d reached the headboard. That didn\u2019t deter Shelia in the slightest; in fact, it did the opposite, making it all the easier for her to constrain her toddler to the headboard.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she\u2019d reached the rear of the bed, Brooke noticed her mistake. It wasn\u2019t merely her mother\u2019s actions, not this time. Instead, it was the pair of handcuffs conveniently set atop a pillow, having been initially camouflaged through their pink color. At this point, there wasn\u2019t anything the girl could do except tremble, terrified at what had begun to be known as an unavoidable experience, one that, for a reason presently unknown to the girl, she didn\u2019t entirely hate. Instead, she was almost enjoying it, if only a little. In league with this small, somewhat unwelcome revelation, the tot almost failed to notice what her mother had done. Shelia had briskly closed the cuffs over the girl\u2019s wrists, making sure that she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything other than eat, and the mother will so enjoy the repercussions.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even with the conflicting feelings that Broke had about the whole experience, once she was overfilled with the room\u2019s cakes, she wasn\u2019t much able to resist in any meaningful way. Because of that, the tot had fallen into somewhat of a food coma, systematically eating whatever food she found shoved into her mouth. Shelia didn\u2019t care, only wanting to make sure her daughter ate all she could, though that doesn\u2019t mean she paid no attention to the girl.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after she\u2019d fed Brooke the first of the cakes, the perverse woman saw something quite promising on the girl\u2019s face, a smile. It was small, almost enough to escape her notice, so she decided to try something. She placed one of her hands on the two-year-old\u2019s stomach, rubbing the swollen area to see if there was any effect on the girl\u2019s temperament. Slightly surprising Shelia, there was, the girl soon seemed to relax, even becoming more receptive to the feeding, and, the previously almost unnoticeable smile grew, spreading contently over her piglet\u2019s face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a similar, but much larger smile to end up on Shelia\u2019s face, and who would question why? Honestly, even if the woman took slight, perverse pleasure from her daughter\u2019s resistance, she took all the more from the promise of faster growth. Still, she didn\u2019t know how much she could get her daughter to eat, even with her enjoying it. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what she did next, picking up a slice from one of the remaining cakes she, once again, begins the routine of pushing piece after piece into Brooke\u2019s stomach, nearly drooling as the girl\u2019s stomach slowly bloated out, tightening around its contents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, for Shelia at least, she barely managed to get another cake into her piglet\u2019s stomach before she started shifting, pathetic, half asleep attempts at freedom. Though she had to admit, the toddler\u2019s middle was looking a bit red, on its way to being as pink as her surroundings. Because of this, as one with a basic understanding of nutrition would know, there wasn\u2019t much of a reason to keep going. Since even if she wasn\u2019t hurt, it was quite likely, given how full they were, that if they were fed more, what was currently inside the girl would assuredly find its way outside. So, to avoid that, the feeding stopped, temporarily letting the child digest the first of the day\u2019s meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the decision to let Brooke rest, Shelia took off the handcuffs she\u2019d previously secured her daughter\u2019s wrists with, happily thinking of how it didn\u2019t seem like she\u2019d need them anymore, for the most part at least\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brooke knew that she was fed again against her will but this time she didn\u2019t mind it as much as the other times she was just too focused on the large pink room where her mother had brought her, seeing the decor put the little girl into a stupor of sorts, the room being so large and made into a pink wonderland made her not even realize that half of the food that was on the table that she passed when she crawled on her bed was decimated by Shelia forcing the cakes and pies into Brooks gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my in all the anticipation of making making your new room I forgot to get your new clothes too\u201d Shelia coyly stated with no hint of embarrassment in her words she didn\u2019t really feel bad for her misstep of forgetting to by Brooke some new clothes as her old ones were at her fathers house. For Shelia it was the perfect excuse for her to show off her piglet while she walked around downtown London, taking great care to make sure she had every thing before they both went downtown Shelia got Brooke cleaned up before making her way downtown. Grabbing a stroller and a bag full of snacks Shelia was ready for their day out around town even making a clothes shopping list as a good measure that she didn\u2019t forget anything that she needed to do. Brooke on the other hand was still in a daze from being stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey still smiling about her new room and how pink it was blinding to see it all in its glory. Releasing Brooke from her own binds Shelia got Brooke ready for their trip sitting her piglet into the car seat and begun to drive downtown, coming to her senses from and spacial awareness of where she was she as she didn\u2019t even realize that before Shelia moved her into the car, struggling again the belt that was tying her down to protect her from an accident as Brooke still didn\u2019t understand where exactly she was thinking that her mother was going to force feed her again like she did earlier still not realizing that the horror she thought was going to take place had already happened. Passing through the town to get to downtown London was such a hassle for Shelia, but knowing that there wasn\u2019t much food left in the house kept her focused on the matter at hand. Looking back at Brooke she could see that Brooke was acting up, fighting the belt that kept her secured in place as Brooke got more antsy to escape Shelia still thinking that she was going to be fed again was what Brooke dreaded the most in the situation that she found herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down piglet if you be a good girl we can go shopping first\u201d Shelia explained to her daughter hoping this would calm her down even just for a little bit, seeing that Brooke was on edge did make Shelia revel in feeling of dominating her little piglet to suit her needs but being out and about and having Brooke sobbing like she is now isn\u2019t really a great look for sheila and she knew she had to quiet her now or end up with the consequences. Brooke realized she wouldn\u2019t able to get away from her mother the way she is now and the thought of getting clothes and such did make her feel better, as she was a girly girl at heart and going clothes shopping always put her in a good mood no matter what mood she was in beforehand. Pulling into a parking spot Shelia started to get the stroller out and set up for Brooke and grabbing her pocketbook she grabbed her daughter and they were on their ways to look around the heart of London. Stores upon stores littered the downtown region there was always something to do when it came to going to London, Brooke was always scared of the area due to how many people were there and that there were so many things to do it was all just too much to take in for her she did like being carted around by her mother all the time but at the same time she would rather be home in her new bigger princess room that Shelia had made for the little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go we can get what we need from So tiny London, they have great deals\u201d Shelia exclaimed excited to go clothes shopping with Brooke it was a while since they did anything together and she wanted to make sure that they had some quality time together. Entering in the shop Shelia was quite surprised at their selection of stuff, everything for newborns to Kids of five years old were on the main floor looking at all the clothes made Brooke giddy with like a child in a candy store there was no denying that she loved looking at new clothes it was almost lethargic for her. Looking at the selection of stuff in Brooke\u2019s age group there were many looks and attitudes of clothing that could fit Shelia\u2019s piglet it was way too much to take in but they had much to do and couldn\u2019t take all day. Having to look at them all Shelia had to make one of two choices she could really make her piglet embrace her role as a doll and dress her in cute pink clothes or a little more of variety she just didn\u2019t know which to go with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shelia was quite entranced by all the different styles and colors that the place hat it was enough to make anyone a little dizzy at the site there were just so much for such a little store she didn\u2019t know what would make a great outfit for her piglet to wear it was very troublesome, to say the least. Going from clothes rack to clothes rack looking at it all was something that she didn\u2019t really like not as much as her little piglet did anyways looking at brook who was right next to Shelia like she was glued to her for Shelia always made it a point to make Brooke know about stranger danger and how it was best that she was fused to Shelia at all times, even with the newer attitude that Shelia had towards Brooke the fear was still burned into her mind. Holding her mother\u2019s hand Brooke looked at all the different kinds of clothes with her they had dresses, skirts even, tube tops for little girls just like her being surrounded with something that Brooke always like shoved the almost demonic things that her mother was putting her through for the past week, the force-feeding seemed like a distant memory and her mother was back to being her old self again, something that Brooke was hoping would happen. Brooke hated what her mother had become as she didn\u2019t see the little girl as a daughter any more no she was nothing more than a pet to force all of Sheila\u2019s sexual desires upon it was quite clear that Shelia didn\u2019t see brook as human anymore she was a piglet to be force-fed until fit to bursting, to become a blob of her former self was what Brooke should focus on nothing else should matter for Brooke lived to please her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese look nice don\u2019t you think Piglet, I think you would look so cute in these\u201d not really paying much attention to what her mother was doing Brooke was surprised when she saw that Shelia was holding a bunch of clothes in her arms. It could be seen that they were different designs and textures but one thing was quite clear when you just glanced at them, all were very pink. Variety of shades and hues of pink but pink nonetheless all that were gripped in Shelia\u2019s hands were pink. It was true that Brooke did love the color pink it was one of her favorite colors but to wear it all the time gave her mixed feelings to say the least with a half-smile Brooke looked at her mother just enjoying the time she was having with her mother was enough for Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets do a little fashion show with your new clothes Piglet I want to see how your gonna look, I even got a few sizes that were meant for five-year-olds, you and I both know that these clothes will become to tight for you in a few months but I always like dressing up my piglet\u201d Shelia chuckled leading Brooke to the changing room, the coloration in Brooke\u2019s cheeks faded realizing that her mother hadn\u2019t changed back to how she once was she was still the demon who forced her to eat so much food that in just a week Brooke had gained seven pounds of pure flub. Brooke knew that whatever it took she was going to defy this new version of her mother in any way she could think of being thin was going to be everything to her for Brooke was nobody\u2019s pet and that even included her mother. Shelia knew that she should get her piglet home and all but there wasn\u2019t much time between their days that they would get to do this for her and Brooke this was maybe a once a month occurrence for them both if that. Scooting Brooke into the dressing room so that Shelia could change her pet into something more cuter, although Shelia also wanted to check out Brooke body as well. Both her and Brooke went into the changing room, dropping the clothes and even her own pocketbook Shelia begun to work on Brooke, unsnapping her blue jeans to reveal the pink panties that her mother placed upon her this morning, Shelia was taking her daughters form all in poking and prodded Brooke\u2019s body only made the little girl feel more and more embarrassed. It wasn\u2019t something that Brooke had ever felt before the hot wash of being an object of someone\u2019s desire was something that she didn\u2019t know how to respond too so she looked around and just had this hot feeling coming from her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed my pet your natural form is beautiful, once we get home I\u2019ll so you how much I love you\u201d her mother chuckled before kissing the little girl\u2019s neck, this was a feeling that was also new to Brooke she didn\u2019t know what to do with these new sensations all she could do was look on with fear as her mother inspected every inch of her growing body like a vicious dog who just smelled blood. Next came her shirt seeing the tiny stomach that Brooke sported was somewhat of a disappointing point that Shelia had to look at she knew it wouldn\u2019t be instant for her little girl to become a massive blob she just thought there would be something there not this poor excuse of flab there wasn\u2019t enough for Shelia there was practically nothing there which just made the whole alone time she had with her piglet end abruptly. Being disgusted with how small Brooke was more than enough cause to continue their shopping trip with going to load up on all the fatty foods that Brooke was going to need to be the girl that she was supposed to be. Putting a frilly pink dress on her piglet did make Shelia feel better but it wasn\u2019t enough for her, kissing Brooke one last time before leaving the dressing room. Going up to the cashier with a bunch of clothes in one hand and the other holding onto the hand of Brooke, Shelia made it quite clear that she was done with shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Obviously leading to her previous attire being much too small, Shelia, given all of her perversions, decided not to waste any money on clothes that her piglet would soon end up outgrowing, instead choose to leave the child as she was, all her bloated flesh left uncovered for naught but the eyes of her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Currently, the swine of a girl was being stuffed, seeing as it was recently becoming the apex of the young hog\u2019s days, for the nth time that day Shelia was filling her daughter with all the calories she could handle and then some. The combination of her lack of attire and the intensity of her semi-forced feedings led to a sizable portion of her overly bloated form to become soiled in crumbs, sauces, fillings and all other sorts of food, by now it\u2019d be normal for the child to have quite an enjoyable time with her master whenever she bathed, at first it was both a reward and a method, as it gave a positive outlook and positive experience to the growing girl, though now that aspect was mostly redundant, not as if Brooke was in a state to resist anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s developing faster than anticipated,\u201d Shelia thought with a smile, squeezing one of Brooke\u2019s many folds possessively, \u201cSeems she really was born to grow.\u201d<br>\r\nPicking up the overgrown child, who\u2019d finished their last gorge of the day, Shelia went to clean off her pig from the remnants of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In this buffet Shelia had put her own perversions to the test, Brooke was always a good girl when it came to her mother as she had never betrayed the trust that Shelia had placed with her, as Shelia's daughter. The small girl sat there in the Seat that she had almost been restraining her, the stomach was so full with food it hurt to even move. Her mother looked quite proud of the plates that Brooke had accumulated over the barrage of food that was stuffed into her mouth, her once pristine pink clothes were stained with food that her mother had the pleasure to forcefully shove into the little girl's mouth, taking pleasure seeing the young girl struggle and sob as she is used as a personal play toy to her once caring mother.  \"Why mommy, please stop I'm so full\" Brooke began to beg as little burps escaped the young girl's  mouth, she didn't know why her mother was so transfixed on feeding Brooke copious amounts of good that was shoved into her daughter's mouth it filled Shelia with glee to see the young girl to be filled like a balloon, not wanting to break her toy Shelia has decided to bring the distraught girl home to the home that was soon to be won by the divorce papers she served to get ex-husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke could do nothing but sob at what her mother was doing to her, it was happening so suddenly that the young girl didn't know how to react. There was also the fact that there was this strange woman who owned this bigger that her mother had gotten in contact with, there was something just strange about her, Brooke was too full to keep her mind on the right to even wondered what was this young girl's  end game. Sheila could see that Brooke was stuffed to the gills with all sorts of foods that only made her once flat stomach have an orb-like appearance. As light as Shelia could he began to pick up the blonde haired girl from the seat that causes her all this discomfort, grinning wildly with a smile from ear to ear Sheila said to her full daughter in a calm tone as if nothing was wrong with this situation, \"come to my dear piglet, time to go home.\" Thanking the woman for her services and handing her a check for all the food Brooke had consumed and been discreet with Shelia's plans to make this little girl into a blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it home to her humble abode where her devious thoughts were always there to keep her company, she never really loved her husband or his subtle mannerisms that he had. Only wanting the power that came with his status at one of the most powerful companies in the world, she more had a taste for much younger girly flesh that Brooke was going to for just perfectly in. Feeling the full front of the orb that was her stomach Brooke could only squirm in her mother's tender arms, so many things went through the young girl's head that she just had to ask her only parent left \"Why mommy why did you feed me, I'm so full now\" distraught at the broken trust Shelia had placed in her daughter she could only smile with glee at Brooke. \u201doh my dear Brooke you couldn\u2019t possibly know why, in due time you will learn your place as my piglet, but now it is nap time for you young lady so I can make you a wonderful meal\u201d Shelia said to her daughter a sadistic grin plastered upon her face, there was much in store for Brooke one could only imagine what that would be.Entering the room that Brooke had always loved was eerier than usual thanks to the constant feeding she had just had, she knew she had to resist her mother in any way, the question that was on her mind. \u201cI\u2019m so full mommy I don\u2019t want to eat anymore\u201d sobbed Brooke hoping that her mother would see the error of her ways and stop this rampage Shelia had put on for her daughter. Softly she placed her daughter in her small child bed, kissing her forehead gently and whispered delicately into young Brooke's ear \u201cdon\u2019t worry my dear slave you will learn that your body is mine and your here to please only me.\u201d this made Brooke sob at her medicament as Shelia went downstairs to start making a feast for Brooke.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For all the knowledge she had in the way the body interactions with any&gt; other humans, no family to speak of or lovers, she was alone yet Willow Had a dark secret that she wanted more than anything. No one knew Willow's desire or how far she would go to fulfill it, human genetics has always intrigued her yet some might say it was actually for all the wrong reasons as she got into genetics to make anyone healthier. Willow thought that if she could help the body could sustain us longer and in places that humans weren't supposed to thrive in, would be a jump forward in the field of genetics. Going to lunch for the day as she did every day, alone and unfulfilled with herself to the closest restaurant to her work, a local pizzeria that always had a lived in kind of feel to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Enjoying a nice slice while going over her notes for a serum that took her years to develop, hovering over her notes Willow thought to herself \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes I believe this new version of the serum will produce the effect I have been striving for on humans, the rats seem to have a steady pulse and as confirmed it will only work on the female populace I just need a human test subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d trying to review her research in the hustle and bustle that was created by this no longer concentrate on her work opting to just sit and people watch to pass her time on her lunch break as her research would never get done in a place like this anyways. Looking at all the young girls that were in this place, Willow couldn't help but feel pride she knew that her project will change them for the better. Willow knew there will be people in this world who chastise her for making humans so large and what purpose is her research for in the first place, knowing this would be the case with this kind of research this didn't deter her from it in the slightest. \"if only I could find the perfect test subject Willow stated under her breath, eyes glazed over like she wasn't really looking at anyone in particular, her eyes were just wandering around the place looking for anyone whom might fit the bill of what she was looking for to be a human guinea pig and what her darkest desires wanted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It was no secret that Willow was a bit peculiar when it came to other people, she wasn't very social and usually kept to herself, as she didn't want other people to know her unsung perversions when it girls but they could never get fat enough for her without some serious health complications, that was one of the main reasons why she wanted to get into genetics to fulfill her dreams and lust for the fattest girl in the world. \"I want pizza mommy, please?\" whined a young girl around the age of two, she was trying to get some delicious pizza from her mother who wasn't having any of her sass this afternoon. \"Now Christine, be a good girl and maybe I will get you a cookie\" her mother stated shooing away the blonde headed girl to sit down and behave for once. Willow couldn't stop staring at this girl she seems just to be Willow's type of girl, Christine seemed to be about two years old, Had long blonde hair, ocean blue eyes and pale white skin which Christine decided to cover with a cute frilly pink dress. thinking to herself Willow's dark desires begun to surface, she wanted this girl as her piglet but she didn't know how to get her away from her mother.</span></div></div>",

She felt as if she was going to die soon if she didn't get any sleep. Without any pressure on Willow's part, Joanna was ready to jump at the chance to get rid of Christine, even if it was for a little while, \"take her if you want but I have to tell you she is a bit on the wild side and is hard to take care of\" Joanna exclaimed. This did not deter Willow on her mission, this girl was gorgeous to the young Scientist and needing a human test subject was just the icing on the cake for her, as Willow wanted nothing more than to force this girl to be her slave. Hoping that the darkness that started to grow in Willow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart was visible to the mother of the child she was about to take,Willow begun to write down her information for the Joanna so she could come by and see the day care center of which a lot of time Christine would spend in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cokay so we will be there around nine to explore this place\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joanna exclaimed with a suspicious tone in her voice, like she knew something was afoot but not knowing what it was or caring about what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Willow watched the little girl,.

In her mind she knew that this little girl would be the perfect test subject and maybe future fat lover.Willow closed her eyes picturing herself half naked in her bra and panties and sinking into this little girl's sea of fat.Kissing and creasing the little girl all over and kissing her on the lips. \"Oh that be wonderful she be stuffed so full and with the help of my little experiment she will blossom beautifully.\" Willow said to herself in a dream like daze. \"Id have to make sure to get her bigger diapers!\" She giggled to herself. She continued to watch the little girl and her mother trying to find the opportunity to whisk this poor future blob of fat away from her mommy and stuff her properly.

Looking around there were many things that could excite a girl of Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age from toys to game and even a pleasant looking place where she could take naps in silence, it would seem as if that Willow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan was going to work as both of her clients seemed to be satisfied to the changes that were made to created a place fit for a child to have fun while the mother was away. \u00e2\u0080\u009clooks like this is a place where Christine will be able to hang out while I do the things I will have to do, here is all the things that you need to know about Christine, she becomes fussy when it comes to food there are only certain things that she will eat,mostly fruits and vegetables are the best choices when your trying to feed her\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joanna stated giving Willow a folder with everything that she needed to know when it really did come down to caring for Christine and all of her certain quirks that came with caring with a two year old of Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Willow barely was listening to the woman and what she was talking about she was paying more attention to Christine, she was what Willow really wanted to take care of the extra baggage that came with Christine was Joanna, hoping that when Willow proves herself to the mother that she is a competent woman that can take care of her bundle of joy all on her own. \u00e2\u0080\u009chow long will this woman keep on yammering about how to take care of her daughter I need to get my tests in by the end of the day and write my report to the genetics division\u00e2\u0080\u009d Willow thought with a facade of contentment on her face nodding ever so often looking like she was actually listening to Joanna even if she was more interested into looking at Christine imagining how big she will force this girl to become. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be Back around five to pick up Christine, so make sure she is ready by that time that would make my job a lot easier when it came time to come get her, as today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on a tight schedule with everything that is going on today\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joanna stated leaving her daughter in the care of this woman she just met knowing that this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best decision that she could have made in this kind of situation it was one that she was going to have to live with as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any other option to make at this point in time. Christine was hearing all this but with her just barely the concept of speech didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick up on anything that was really happening other than she was to stay with this woman until her mother would come back, but not knowing when that least this woman seemed to be nice enough to be considered a playmate, Christine wearing a still very pink outfit that consisted of some shorts and a spaghetti stringed like Christine was ready for a picnic, something that willow fantasized about doing with her little slave as soon as possible. It would seem as Christine actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for food that much, she was too active for her own good and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat much for that fact and the fact that she was a picky eater in the first place this madWillowetter for willow as she knew that Christine would need to learn that Willow is her master one way or another, the sweet serenade of tears falling and wails of discomfort clouded the mind of willow.</span></div></div>",

Willow got onto her knees opening her arms and giving the little girl a hug. She gently cooed into the little girl's ear. \"Shh is OK hon, you and I are going to have fun lots of fun. Mommy will be back soon.\" As Willow hug Christine she began to think about what her mother said about her only eating fruits and veggies. Willow knew that in order for this girl to get fat she had to convert her from fruits to sweets which won't be a big problem thanks to a formula she came up during her theory testing that she tried on small animals but yet on an actual little girl. The formula would unlock a girl's genetic craving for sweets and treats. However, Willow knew that for the formula to make this girl become an unstoppable glutton for sweets she would have to stuff this little girl and stretch her belly which with her being a picky eater would be a problem. However, once Willow could get Christine addicted to sweets with the help of the Formula to kick start it and to get her to eat sweets then her dream will become a reality.Willow continues to comfort the little girl who now was hugging her. Willow began to feel how skinny this poor little girl was. \"Once she gets fat she will become an idol for all little girls to get fat for!\" Willow said in her head. Willow began to slide her hand down Christine's back she could feel how skinny she was. Her hand drifted to Christine's butt. Willow could feel the soft thick diaper under Christine's shorts. Willow couldn't help herself she began to sink her fingers into Christine's butt. \"Oh, my if she gets fat she will have a real bubble butt sticking so far out behind her!\" Willow said to herself as she felt Christine's butt. Indeed from the way it stuck out, Willow knew that her butt will get very big once Christine gets fat. Willow giggled at the thought of Christine getting too fat for her diaper and seeing her diaper turn into a diaper thong. Willow knew she had to get started. \"Christine baby girl you want some milk?\" Willow cooed. As she cooed she slid her hand up to Christine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shorts waistband and began to slide them down to expose Christine's pink diaper. The diaper crinkled as her fingers slid across it. The diaper was thick enough to give Christine a cute little waddle. Once the shorts were discarded Willow tossed them aside. Christine nodded with a finger in her mouth. Happily that this nice girl was going to give her something to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"yes please.\" she said in her two-year-old voice. She realized that Willow took off her pants but figured it was OK since she was running around the house in her diaper and t-shirt normally.Taking Willow by the hand she leads Christine into the dining room. Willow could see Christine waddle a bit from her diaper.Each step she could hear Christine's diaper crinkle. Once in the dining room, Willow sets her onto a high chair. Willow smiled at the little girl and went into the kitchen to prepare a bottle of the special blend formula and some sweets. \"If my calculations are correct a few minutes after I inject this she will want to eat the sweets and when she does the fun will begin,\" Willow said excitedly. She couldn't wait to seduce her little fat slave into getting fat and cute! </span></div></div>",

Christine was still unsure why she was here in nothing but her t-shirt and diaper it was a strange feeling being in somewhere she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize and being with someone who she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that well, this was all new to her but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything that she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle on her own as Christine knew that her mother would come back for her yet she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when this would be so at the moment she was going to make the best of the situation that she had found herself in. Willow looked at her little experiment going around the room fully unaware that she was in the danger of what was going to become of her for now that Willow had Christine in her sights, this young girl wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be able to go back to her mother not without her body and mind belonging to Willow alone. There was something that always worried Willow when it came to divulging into her darkest desires there was a chance that the unwilling participant could have a heart attack due to the increased growth that came with being forcefully fattened up to sizes that would be impossible someone of such a tender age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Willow had her serum that she had used the funds from her job to develop with the sole intention to use it for this purpose, sure she could use it as a thesis to make sure that her benefactors that came with her job would be off her back but to have a slave the size of a room was all she really wanted when it came right down to it. Looking at Christine playing around with the blocks that were laid out for her to interact with as willow could only imagine what the future will hold for her relationship with Christine, imagine the young girl so obese that Willow could use the two year old as a bed due to her size, but this was going to be the future at this moment she needed to prick this girl with a needle without her noticing.luckily for her it would seem Joanna had forgotten her motherly duties of teaching this girl how to speak which made it easier for Willow to do what she wanted with Christine whom was still oblivious of what was really going on. Preparing things for what was about to come willow couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait anymore for this girl to be totally enthralled with these blocks and started to get the needle ready for injection, inching closer and closer to the girl, looking on how adorably she was playing with her new toys that were placed in front of her. There were just so much things to keep herself preoccupied while her mother was away doing god knows what outside this house without her, this was a new experience for Christine for she was never without her mother before it was all new to her, she hoped that this new woman who was told by her mother to take care of Christine would do a good job in caring for her while her mother was away from her. Feeling a prick on her body Christine begun to well up with tears, blubbering at the fact that something had just hurt her thigh as the needle had entered with the serum that was going to change Christine for the better, Willow couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but enjoy the sweet tears that streamed down her face, the real fun would begin for Willow gathering some the food she had hidden away from Joanna, to start force feeding Christine.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't wait till sweet little Christine's thigh was so fat that she couldn't even put a needle in it. She could see the tears of Christine. \"Owe.\" She whimpered. Willow has Christine a hug and snuck another grab at Christine's diaper covered butt. She loved hearing the diaper crinkle under her fingers. \"There there baby girl.\" Willow cooed. \"You be just fine. Now how about a treat for my little one for being such a big girl. Christine still crying a little smiled and shook her head happily at Willow awarding her for being a good girl.Willow gently picked up Christine into her arms. \"We can't have the little princess walking now.\" She carried Christine into the dining room there was a large girly looking throne it was wide and had soft white pillows. Willow set Christine into the throne. She couldn't wait till she got to fat for it. Christine looked like a little doll compared to the large wide throne. Christine giggled and skimmed around in the chair. Her diaper crinkling as she moved around. \"I'll be right back with your award Christine\" Willow cooed and kissed her on the cheek. She seductively walked into the Kitchen and started to bring out a portion of the stash. Willow now turned on wanted to feed this sweet little girl all of it but she knew that right now it was impossible but she knew she had to slowly force Christine's stomach capacity to get bigger which meant forcing as much food into it but not enough to make it explode but close to bursting. Willow giggled happily as she set the treats onto the table. Christine stared in wonder as a pile of treats was growing in front of her. Willow wanted to stuff this sweet girl and then whisk her to her bedroom for some a little make-out session and cuddle in her bra and panties. Once all a good chunk of the stash was on the table. Christine asked Willow. \"Mis...miss...Willow is all dis for me?\" She had a look of curiosity on her face. Willow giggled. \"Yes baby this is for you.\" She already had a chocolate muffin in her hand and set it in front of her. Christine giggled and peeled off the wrapper of the large Chocolate treat and started to eat it. Christine ate about half of the muffin before she set it down with her chocolate covered hands and leaned back into her throne chair. \"Miss I'm done now.\" Willow cooed \"Oh baby girl I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not done yet.\" As Willow gently picked up the remaining muffin. \"I want to see you eat most of this treats so I can have some fun time with my little piggy Slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Christine was taken aback by the sudden change in personality that had transpired, This woman who was there to take care of her, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being as nice as she was when her mother was here, the sudden change in personality was something that scared Christine as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was going to happen to her with this woman who was grinning viciously over her with eyes that could burn through anything with how focused Willow was on her intent. Holding the rest of the muffin in her hand Willow had the intent to making most of the food that was placed on this table end up into this little girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach Willow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires were getting the best of her wanting to stuff this girl with all the food that she had available on hand in the secret kitchen that she had all the fattening food stored in the secret compartment in the house, it was true that she was doing this out of personal reasons there was a scientific reason attached to her reasoning hoping that her serum would work in the way that it was intended to work was another reason why willow wanted to fatten up this young girl hoping that her years of research would pay off from her little experiment with her little slave here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Inching closer and closer to Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face with the half eaten muffin in hand the little girl tried her best to avoid the onslaught of food that was going to happen but it seemed like it was going to happen even though she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it to happen to her, this woman who was there to take care of her shoved the rest of the moist chocolate muffin into Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth forcing her to eat the rest of it, the gooey texture of the muffin smeared across her mouth with a sickly chocolate smell coming from the new stains on her mouth, the tears begun to well up in Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to escape what was happening to her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry my dear this is a good thing that is happening be good girl and eat like you were meant too\u00e2\u0080\u009d willow stated to Christine hoping that the girl would understand that this is for her own good and that soon she will only think about two things, eating and having sexy time with her master, willow couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain her excitement when that day will come when Christine is broken and wants nothing more than to please her master, but that will not be until later for now she will savor the intimate times she can see the misery that she was putting Christine through. Christine was forced to swallow the rest of this muffin no matter how much her body was telling her not to it was out of her control feeling the fullness that came with so much food for someone of her age to be shoved into her gullet, not knowing what to do about being force-fed she could only cry about her situation and try to get away from this manic woman. As the last of the muffin was popped into Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, the overly full girl could only sit there in disbelief that this was done to her and that she actually ate all that she was given to her it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like she really have a choice in the matter as Willow had grand plans for Christine hoping that this girl will be so big that no chair can contain her size all dressed up for some sexy time with Willow dressing her up in cute outfits and hoping that she can trade Christine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diaper for some adorable panties.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year was 1886, the industrial revolution was in full swing and Great Britain took full advantage of this newly acquired wealth, but with the dangerous conditions that came with factory work meant some children lost parents to accidents to help the rise of children being without parents more orphanages were opened to combat this, one such orphanage was St. Mary\u2019s home for troubled girls an all-girl orphanage that help deal with girls who couldn\u2019t get over the grief of losing their parents with the help of sister Lucy of course. St. Mary\u2019s home for troubled girls had seen better days, this was the state the orphanage had gotten its self into as money wasn\u2019t flowing as it used to, some of this was the cause of poor money management but most was that none of the orphanage\u2019s donors had continuously given St Mary the money it needed to become fully functional this meant that adopting was the only way that St Mary was kept afloat and that was slowing down as well. Seven girls were the only ones that remained in the orphanage. The girls were as young as three to as old as six, still, young children who didn\u2019t understand the love of another or were broken due to the death of their family, Sister Lucy made it her life\u2019s work to help kids like these come to terms with the death of their families just as she had to when she was around their ages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat am I going to to do, I don\u2019t know how to care for these girls with no money coming in it would be easier if some of them would be adopted already, but for some reason no one wanted these girls\u201d Lucy thought looking over their files she tried to find some reason why these seven were being overlooked while other girls were adopted, of the seven there were two, three years old there was Brittany, she was the rebellious one always in doing her own thing when it suited her best her brown hair was always in pigtails, the other wasn\u2019t from the great country of Britain she was more eastward bound, her name was Kimiko, with raven black hair and a pale complexion she was a beauty to behold, quiet and attentive she was almost the perfect child if it wasn\u2019t for that strange tic. There were also the three, four-year-old sister they were always together ever since birth sister Lucy thought just by looking how they played with each other there was Sarah, Sophia and the youngest only by an hour or two Skye, all donned blonde hair so full and beautiful that it would make anyone jealous to see it. The one that Sister Lucy considered the oldest Sarah was always getting into some kind of mischief no matter if it was intentional or not she always dragged her sisters in with her schemes getting all three into trouble, Skye always loved going along with her sisters plans, Sophia was always meek with her words never speaking up against her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two were two five-year-old girls both from a faraway place one came from the country of Spain her name was Camilla, her black hair was always offset by the tan complexion she had, still afraid of the new surroundings that she had found her self in especially with her parents who only wanted a better life were gone from this world due to a mining accident. Ella, was the other was from far north where it was cold and damp, being one of the only people to survive the sinking of a cruise ship, saddened by the death of her parents she always kept to her self-trying her best to be the perfect little girl, but it was hard with this sadness she kept inside of her. Sister Lucy just didn\u2019t know why these seven were thrown to the side where others that were in her care were taken without a batting an eye this was strange to Lucy there was nothing wrong with them not that she could see. Looking at the files of past girls who were adopted from the orphanage all had something in common they were all obese, to say the least about them, it seems adults who are adopting the children who live at the orphanage were all adopted due to their size, even the last girl who was adopted was quite pudgy compared to these stick figures Lucy was looking at right now. It was quite simple if these girls have any chance to get a family that will love them, Lucy will have to make them the biggest girls in Britan, but that would cost money to do and that was something that the orphanage was dearly lacking in even before she decided who would be Lucy's first participant of her feedings she needed to find some money to fund her endeavors. Lucy\u2019s first chioce was to beg the city for help with her plan, but this could cause problems in the long run, she could also go with the famous philanthropist that lives inthe city, he has always been exotic when it comes to his fickle likes but one thing that was always constant him being surrounded by his harem of little girls, he could be a viable option to help fatten up these girls. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While she thought, the Sister eventually decided her decision was obvious. There was no reason she couldn\u2019t go to the mayor second, trying her hand at the eccentric\u2019s aid first. Truly, why take assistance with strings attached when you could get the same without? Not that she was confident that Mr. Wilkinson would hand her a free lunch, Lucy kept hoping. But with that decision, the woman had another problem, how might she increase her chances of getting assistance? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne way to do that could be playing into his peculiarities, there were seven girls she could pick from after all. But which one would be best? A meeker one like Sophia? Or one of the more outgoing children like Brittany? No one knew that much about the man\u2019s preferences, nor the man himself really, aside from his seeming love of youth at least, but that was beside the point. Still, that wasn\u2019t to say it took horribly long for her to decide, choosing little Sophia. Even if the choice was partly because of her clothes being in a more favorable condition. With that finished, she went to the girls\u2019 room, thinking that it may be where the four-year-old was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInconveniently, the little girl wasn\u2019t, a couple of others, Camilla and Ella, were, but they, as seemed to be their norm, weren\u2019t who was wanted. So, after a short, awkward bit of small talk, their caretaker left them to their business. Once she had, Lucy checked the yard, immediately perking up when she saw the timid toddler with her siblings, the trio huddled together while Sarah discussed her scheme for the day. So, interrupting the \u201cSo I\u2019ll\u201ds and the \u201cThen you\u2019ll\u201ds, the matron butted in, looming over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about doing this time? Should I start thinking of new ways to punish you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepish, if not remorseful, the leader retorted, \u201cN-Nothing,\u201d followed by a quieter, \u201cplease don\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a little at the girl\u2019s refusal to look her in the eye, \u201cFine, but I need to take your sister with me for an errand.\u201d Turning to the other, \u201cIs that alright Sophia?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen come along, say goodbye to your sisters and we\u2019ll get on our way. We wouldn\u2019t want to miss the horse-bus.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay... bye.\u201d Waving slightly to her sisters as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two were less concerned, each letting out a short \u201cSee ya, sis,\u201d before going back to their conspiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the four-year-old was brought inside for a moment, squirming a little in confusion as her mother redressed her, leaving her in a slightly faded, but still respectable dress. Now, looking the child over in her new attire, Lucy smiled, thinking there might be a hint of a chance of all this ending well. So, patting the toddler on the back for a small reassurance, the Sister walked both of them back outside, explaining as they looked for the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sophia, I assume you\u2019d like to hear what\u2019s going on?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Miss Lucy...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, you\u2019ve noticed how the orphanage isn\u2019t looking too good haven\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the way to try and fix that, both of us are going to go see one of the wealthier residents of this city, and if all goes well, we\u2019ll get some funding. Maybe even a home for some of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the shy girl was led to speak up, \u201cD-do you not want us anymore? L-like our parents?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Realizing that may have been a mistake, the caretaker desperately tried to soothe the girl, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. It isn\u2019t that I want you gone, not at all, but I just don\u2019t believe the orphanage is the best place you could grow up in. I can\u2019t raise all of you to your best with only my own ability.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... are you trying to get some help for that then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. Please don\u2019t be too worried, I don\u2019t want to say goodbye to any of you either.\u201d Setting a hand on the child\u2019s shoulder, she continued, \u201cNow, let\u2019s find an empty one, it wouldn\u2019t be good to make Mr. Wilkinson wait, after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it was only another few minutes\u2019 walk before they found their ride. Following a wave of her arm proving enough to tell the coachman to stop, they crossed the street, boarding the cab once they could. After that, and a short instruction from Lucy telling the driver to take them to Wilkinson\u2019s, the pair rested, both worried in their silence, if for differing reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it wasn\u2019t too long before they reached their destination, only taking about half an hour for them to arrive. From there, after the Sister exchanged a few shillings for the ride, the pair made their way to the gate, announcing their purpose to the guard. When they had, and the man had gotten permission, the two went inside, though Sophia, left in awe by her surroundings, was half dragged behind her guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treatment didn\u2019t end once they\u2019d entered the building, rather, it only became more necessary. What with the gilded windows, elaborate furniture, and assorted servantry, there was little the child, or Lucy herself, could keep their eyes off. It didn\u2019t help the pair\u2019s focus when they were left in the sitting room, told that the master would see them shortly, once he\u2019d finished his current business. As for what that was, the poor maid\u2019s slight blush didn\u2019t give any help to the caretaker\u2019s imagination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft to themselves for a time, Sophia couldn\u2019t hold back her amazement for any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so... fancy here.\u201d She exclaimed, having failed to think of a better word to describe their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is, do you like it? All the decorations and people?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s so pretty. The people are a little scary though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, if you get too scared, just stay near me okay? I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Thank you, Miss Lucy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry your little head about it. Now, what did you think looked best?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, there was likely another ten minutes\u2019 worth of conversation before Mr. Wilkinson returned, having finished whatever previous business that had occupied him, though, for whatever reason, he seemed to be a touch out of breath. Not to say Lucy cared, she had much more important things to bother with, the somewhat hefty man in front of her representing those goals, a few of the usual girls cuddling against him. Still, even before she could start, he greeted them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my apologies for the wait.\u201d He started, finally sitting down across from them, \u201cNow, do tell me what business has spurned your visit. When you requested a meeting, I do believe you mentioned a loan?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, Henry Wilkinson had benefited from this revolution of modern machinery in the most eloquent of ways. Placing more machines than men in his factories had quite an effect on his wealth, going from just a man with one factory to being one of the richest men in Great Britain. Many suitors had tried their hand in winning over the man; each woman that tried to reach into his deep pockets had come up dry. Henry wasn't one to dwell on the triviality that was love. Now power is what Henry always wanted; love was inconsequential for this businessman control was all he was need.ed.<br>\r\nThe sister had nothing but love in her heart for the people she had .sworn to take care of. The church had almost abandoned these children and her crusade, causing her to just scrape by on her own. Which is why she had gone do Mr.Wilkinson in the first place. Sophia didn\u2019t understand exactly why she was there, or why she was given the only good dress the orphanage had? Was this going to be her new father, did the sister not want to keep her anymore? There were so many questions that little Sophia had on her mind. She didn\u2019t know what to make of any of it.<br>\r\nThough the sister told her to keep quiet and just look pretty as she hashed out some sort of deal with this man. Henry looked over at the girl that the sister had kindly brought with her, up and down he studies the young girl\u2019s body making notes in his head what to improve on and what can be left alone. If there were more girls like this little one around the orphanage, then it would be easy for the sister to get the funding she desperately needed to acquire, not one to dally Henry began to deal with the sister. Always the sharp-witted one with a silver tongue, Henry got right down to business. Looking over the nun and the small child she had brought with her as a way to soften his heart, Henry knew this game too well and wasn\u2019t one to give for nothing. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow let's get this show on the road, dear sister, as I have a board meeting in half an hour what is it pray to tell you would require of me?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see Mr.Wilkinson, I run a small orphanage for troubled girls, and we are severely underfunded.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see, you think with my wealth, I would be able to help your little orphanage out and save these girls from the street; the questions are what will you do for me?\u201d snapping his fingers, signalling some of his servants to get the tea and desserts ready.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, umm, what can I do to make sure that we can count on your donations to the orphanage?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe discussion of what will happen to the orphanage had been drawn out by both adults, something that Sophia herself wasn\u2019t much to paying attention to as none of it interested her. Looking around, the various trinkets and pictures that Mr.Wilkinson had collected over the years were marvellous to look at.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh my, you misunderstand my intentions Sister Lucy; I don't give away things for nothing.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy didn't quite understand what the man meant. Confused by the suave attitude this oil tycoon had, with the jaunt of his steps a, smile reached across his faces reaching for some parchment and an inkwell. Henry always knew how to smell out a good deal and seeing that the poor sister in a pickle only made his job that much easier to do.\u2014Scribbling it all down on the loose parchment, that smile never leaving his face. While he was hard at work with the plans, one of his most loyal maids had entered the room. Various cream puffs and cakes came in with her, a cart full of sweets was what she was pulling it was enough even to make the strong-willed Sister salivate a bit. Being the astute person, he was Henry could see this was going to be easier than he thought, before leaving the premise of them Mr.Wilkinson whispering something into the maids ear causing her to automatically blushed in the mere mention of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow then, I\u2019m willing to loan my services and vast wealth to you and your band of misfits, Sister Lucy.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWonderful, the children will quite enjoy your company and generosity.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow, now let's not be coy, as we all known you have probably heard of my interests, if you want my wealth and help with your children then you must keep them in line and teach them that they are mine, body and soul.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cah, well I knew you were a brash man, I didn\u2019t know you strayed this far from god if I do commit to this act what is needed of me?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe sister was quite afraid of the man\u2019s answer, not knowing what was going to become of the children if she did accept his \u201cgenerosity\u201d. She didn\u2019t have any much of choice, the church didn\u2019t have the means or wants to help her with her endeavour, so this man was the last-ditch effort Lucy thought to save these girls from death.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing too ghastly Sister, my servants will be helping you in this so don\u2019t you worry about the nitty-gritty. All you need to do is keep them in line; I like my future slaves nice and obedient.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cS..slaves, what are you blathering on about, these are just children, Mr.Wilkinson what do you plan to do with them.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be such a daft woman, if you want my help to keep them off the streets then you're going to help mould them into being the perfect harem for me, you can start by forcing feeding that one on the couch all the sweets.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYour serious?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course, its this or they will be thrown on the streets so what is your choice, Sister Lucy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just eat, please, I\u2019m hating this as much as you are.\u201d Lucy half-muttered along, trying her best to just block out what she was doing, only focusing on repeating a cart to mouth sequence, ignoring any pleas for her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as was obvious, the instigator of all of this was having their own fun, one hand moving along one of his young attendants, while he sat. That wasn\u2019t to say Henry was silent though, talking with a nearby maid as his entertainment continued in the background. The topic wasn\u2019t much, the maid merely being told that she would have free reign once he had left, allowing her to do whatever she pleased as long as the toddler got her fill, the more so the better. Though the tycoon still wanted more from the yet unwilling orphanage director, speaking up with his next demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that! Don\u2019t do it in such a boring way, watch what you\u2019re doing to such a precious little girl. And really, there\u2019s a chance for a bonus if you show how much you enjoy it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartling, the parent couldn\u2019t help but parrot back, \u201dEnjoy it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, enjoy it, and do you really think you have time to repeat everything I say?\u201d Came the snapped response, \u201cYou\u2019ve already wasted a few minutes, so if you want my funding you better step it up in the time you have left.\u201d Pausing a moment, he continued, \u201cOh, and it really doesn\u2019t matter to me if you listen or not, your tot will get stuffed regardless, the only difference is whether I give you money. So don\u2019t ruin this by trying to be the better person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lucy began to understand how wrong the situation had gone, it wasn\u2019t once the talk had started, no, it was as soon as she\u2019d let herself be in the same room as this miscreant. Not that there was anything she could do about it now, no, the best she could hope to manage was to do as her oppressor demanded, even if the funds would only serve to allow her to do this again, more so for each additional girl. So, deafening herself to the hypocrisy, the nun forced a smile as she pushed the next cupcake into her distraught charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, by this point, only felt a strange mix of confusion and betrayal. Sophia just couldn\u2019t grasp, let alone come to terms with the fact that this was how the person she trusted most was treating her, was this why miss Lucy hadn\u2019t been able to find her a family? Why her birth parents had abandoned her and her siblings? These were the only thoughts the toddler had as she cried, the tears moving down her face as her sobs were choked with dough. But those were worsened by the words the child heard next from the one she\u2019d trusted most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, don\u2019t worry about a thing. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to it soon, though I can\u2019t say if you\u2019ll be able to keep up with the increasing portions.\u201d Seeing the girl blanch, the Sister reassured them, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine though, I\u2019ll make sure all of you get your fill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, none too reassuringly patting the girl\u2019s head, the woman continued to bring the baked goods to their mouth, forcing danish after \u00e9clair into the opening. Sophia\u2019s shy self too overwhelmed to much resist the onslaught, dutifully munching away at what she was fed. Yet, the experience couldn\u2019t last forever, and the four-year-old did get full after a point, again beginning to squirm around uselessly as the baked goods were ever pushed against her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the food\u2019s provider, he had already left the room, feeling sufficiently satisfied as he prepared himself to discuss a possible cooperation between his and a rival company, which, if successful, could increase revenue by a good thirty-percent. Thus, the maid, Annalynn, had free reign for the moment, only required to make sure the debatably unfortunate little girl was given the stuffing of her life, not to mention see if she could provide Ms. Lucy with enough food for all of their charges. They\u2019d ultimately need stuffing as well if they were to ever reach Mr. Wilkinson\u2019s expectations, distant as they might seem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, after a bit of thought toward how she wanted to go about it, the maid went beside the Sister and spoke up, adding a few orders to what her employer already had already decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do stop for a moment and listen, Mr. Wilkinson won\u2019t be happy if you don\u2019t after all.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the girl, it was terrific for Sister Lucy to think that this girl was the head maid on such an illustrative position, Lucy couldn\u2019t believe that it was right with what they say about Mr.Wilkinson liking younger girls. Looking at Annalynn the, girl couldn\u2019t have been no older than twelve, yet she seemed to be loyal to the oil tycoon, almost subservient to the wants and needs of Mr.Wilkinson. Looming over Lucy, the proper maid was watching closely to the motions and actions that Lucy had taken toward Sophia. Annalynn was one for everything to be done to the letter, not one to deviate from what Henry wanted she made sure that everything and anything was accounted for even if that thing was a fussy toddler. Lucy couldn\u2019t believe that this was his head maid; Annalynn was just so young to begin with.  She couldn\u2019t help but look into the girl\u2019s eyes. Cold and calculative, there seemed to be no hint of remorse or guilt in what she was doing, just a grin upon her face when looking at Sophia\u2014forced to ingest another tart by the sister\u2019s hand, both Sophia nor Lucy knowing when this would stop. The sister\u2019s heart begun to break with each dessert Annalynn made the .weak nun force Sophia to eat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cSister...Please stop. I\u2019m so full,\u201d the young four-year-old squeaked, holding back the tears from feeling betrayed by the one person she trusted the most.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sophia, but please just eat all you can; if you don\u2019t, you, this maid will make you eat.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut why I\u2019m just\u2026hmmph\u201d Sophia's words were cut short as a large slice of cheesecake was shoved down her throat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEach piece that the sister had to shove int Sophia\u2019s mouth only broke her heart more and more, though she couldn\u2019t defy what her new sponsor wanted to do with the children and risk not getting the funding needed to keep the girls off of the street. Though it might hurt her relationship with the girls in the long run that was something that Lucy was willing to risk if that meant they would live life on the high hog, though they might have chains on their wrists when all is said and done That didn\u2019t mean they would have to face the harsh realities of life and all that came with it. The girls had already seen so much death and destruction in their lives that if Lucy could protect them from that unpleasantness and make the girls wealthy with a master that loves them, then that is what she would do, not without her watchful eye on Mr.Wilkinson. Sophia, having eaten all that she could with a healthy \u201curp\u201d coming from her mouth, Annalynn was pleased with what the poor nun had to do, halting the feeding from proceeding any further. Looking at Sophia it was clear to see that the girl had no more room in her stomach as it stood right now, Annalynn though being so young herself already knew how to treat her master\u2019s toys, ordering the other maids to tend to Sophia. At the same time, she showed the nun what her new orders would be and the renovations that were going to be planned for the rundown orphanage. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCome with me, Sister Lucy. We have much to discuss; they will tend to the master\u2019s property while we talk.\u201d Annalynn opening the door for the horrified woman.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy still trying to process what she had just agreed to do to her wards, how will this affect them, and was she doing the right thing to give them over to this man and his other little employees? Annalynn seemed to have the most day to day things under control. She was reviewing with Lucy how there will be an architect to the grounds of the orphanage shortly after they finalize the plans and what will be needed of her after she signs the contract. Annalynn never really liked this part of her job, though, thinking back to the first time she became the head maid herself and having to sacrifice her sister for happiness. A sister who became the premise of what Henry had based his harem on. Reaching one of the many rooms that Mr.Wilkinson\u2019s mansion held, Lucy was made to focus on the contract that was written up by the legal team under the supervision of Henry knowing exactly why a lonely nun would seek him out in the first place.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have reviewed the contract that my master had created for you, as you can see the orphanage and all the renovations would be owned by you, sister Lucy along with the help of the maid service to take care of the girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lit up Lucy\u2019s face thinking of all the children she could save with a clean and fully stocked orphanage. There were many things that she could do with a fully functional facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dthough I wouldn\u2019t be too happy about that miss Lucy as this is only the case if you agree to the terms, if not, then we will gain our investments in other ways.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI understand I will comply to the best of my ability I guess\u201d Lucy was a little unsure of what this meant but signed nevertheless as no choice was going to be better than this.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGood, now if you follow me to as its feeding time for my sister, I can explain your role in the orphanage now.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUhh, okay, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnnalynn grabbed one of the many food-filled carts while directing the stunned nun to follow her into another room, what Lucy saw only made her question her decision more as in this room was\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, honestly, Lucy had to admit that she couldn\u2019t quite tell what it was in front of her, not at first. And with good reason, what with the room\u2019s only occupant being nearly indistinguishable from a large, flesh-toned cushion. Truly, the Sister was having a bit of trouble grasping what it actually was until her companion called over to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Emma, it\u2019s mealtime again. Ready?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe responding \u201cGimme!\u201d though immediate, was detracted from by the two unwieldy, wobbling hams the child called arms, themselves much too large for anyone to expect the girl fed herself. Hence the question, but it wasn\u2019t as if it took too great an effort to find where that demand had come from, the charming, fleshy face only forcing the entering pair to look from a lower angle than straight ahead to find it. So, bringing them around to the child\u2019s side, Annalynn introduced the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lucy, this is my little, three-year-old sister Emma. And I want you to feed her, I need to get you as ready as we can before you leave, the master is expecting you to start feeding your girls as soon as you return after all.\u201d Rubbing the enormous stomach beside them for a moment, the adolescent continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much though, either I or another servant or two will be sent along to help you out. Not to mention make sure you\u2019re doing your share.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was somewhat to be expected, I guess.\u201d The Sister conceded, hoping a bit of curiosity may raise her mood, \u201dDo you sevantry enjoy having a hand in this as much as Mr. Wilkinson seems to?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Was the chuckled reply, \u201cwho did you think made the masterpiece in front of you?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo my own sister? Yes, and despite how adorable she is now, whining like a baby bird whenever food is nearby, it was so much fun while she resisted.\u201d Sighing a moment as her cheeks darkened, \u201cWatching her when she\u2019d try to waddle away was just so...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, just get on with feeding her. Look at how hungry she is after all.\u201d Annalynn reminded, making sure to remember to ask her master if she could have some bonding time with her sister again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d Lucy wavered, at least until she reminded herself of how this would be any worse than what she\u2019d done under an hour earlier, \u201cAlright, could you scoot the cart a mite bit closer then?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, now don\u2019t leave my sister waiting any longer. You don\u2019t need to force her, remember?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that does... help.\u201d She admitted, grabbing the first of the pastries, a doughnut, and pressed the kobliha against the waiting toddler\u2019s mouth. With Emma happily scarfing it down, if getting a touch of jelly on her face due to the desperate speed of her eating. Yet what made it awkward for Lucy wasn\u2019t the plain action of feeding the child, no, rather, it was how simply happy the toddler looked as she ate krapfen after zeppole after bomboloni, struggling to keep from showing a smile of her own at the childish glee that the blob had plastered on her face. Still, her rational half tried its best to dispel her rapture, reminding her of what trauma the girl likely went through on her way to become such an adorable specimen, but even then, it seemed the woman was too focused on the present result to fully care about, if not simply register that uncomfortable notion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that attention, the sister failed to notice that she\u2019d sped up, if only lightly. Though that implicit enthusiasm didn\u2019t go unnoticed by her supervisor, Annalynn couldn\u2019t help growing a bit more optimistic toward the plan\u2019s end. Knowing that all the church member needed to do was realize an appreciation of what the magnate set out to accomplish, and it would become so much easier to fulfill the man\u2019s expectations. Perhaps he may even feel generous and let Lucy keep one of them for her own enjoyment, as a sort of a reward for developing a shared enthusiasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was but the future, and the present often showed itself to be much less gratifying. Case in point, Lucy had begun slowing down, nearly stopping her task once her hand grabbed air. Too shocked by the possibility that she\u2019d already stuffed the top shelf into the mattress of a girl, even if little Emma held no less enthusiasm than before. As it was, the toddler in question had returned to whining for more food, her anchoring stomach nowhere near satisfied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop? You aren\u2019t even close to being finished you know, can\u2019t you hear how desperate she is?\u201d Annalynn impatiently complained, irritated that the woman had had second thoughts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so much...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much what? Look at Emma, she\u2019s starving, shouldn\u2019t you help?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Looking at the child in question\u2019s desperate face, Lucy had trouble thinking of a good reason to refuse, \u201calright. I don\u2019t have any reason to punish her after all.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, get on with it then.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look and a sigh, she did, resuming her conflicted effort to fill the child. Not that there was much more to say, what with Emma fulfilling expectations and eating anything that reached her mouth, and Lucy begrudgingly enabling that. Nor did it take much time, the remaining cakes and pastries disappearing even faster than before, even if more out of impatience toward the situation than enjoyment of it. Though that didn\u2019t quite explain the idle massaging that one of the Sister\u2019s hands could be seen doing, rubbing a small section of the mass in front of her as the other arm worked on filling it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Annalynn, she was wondering what would be the best course of action to continue with. There was another cart for her sister to eat, one wasn\u2019t enough anymore after all, but it was obvious that the woman feeding her was nearing apathy, retreating into herself to ignore the current situation. From that, the child was stuck with thinking of an alternative, since even with the task she\u2019d been assigned, she wanted her share of fun from it. So, staring blankly ahead in thought, it wasn\u2019t long until the girl was bothered, a simple, known question breaking her focus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, I\u2019ve finished feeding her.\u201d It came, it\u2019s speaker gesturing to the bare trolley as they continued, \u201cAre we finished here then?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy was baffled by how unphased the maiden was, seeing this blonde girl splayed out on what looked like to be a queen-sized bed. It looked like the girl was broken a long time ago by her master, it was just abysmal to think that this was going to be the future of the children that Lucy had promised to protect and care for. Thanks to her inability to convince the church to help these poor souls, the only choice she had was to make a deal with the devil. That wasn\u2019t the only thing that stroke fear into the sister. Seeing this blob of a girl in front of her, Lucy could see the will to fight had escaped Emma a long time ago. It was hard to think that the reason for the state Emma had found herself in was the cause of her sister right next to her. Lucy thought a girl of her age would fight to protect her younger sibling. This was entirely untrue when it came to Annalynn, feeding her sister to the wolves so she might be able to live the high life herself as a servant. Lucy had never experienced something like this in all her years as a nun. She had always seen the good in people and adhering to the lord's will. This was all she had ever done; it was what Lucy had ingrained in herself. Looking over to the young maid Lucy could only feel a chill run down her neck, Annalynn wasn\u2019t disgusted or horrified with how large her sister had become since being the plaything of Mr.Wilkinson, nor was Annalynn fearful about what would become of her. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHerself was such an agile creature of beauty for a twelve-year-old child, Annalynn herself relished in seeing her sister eat and grow this was apparent if one would just look at the girl\u2019s face. With a face like a tomato and the heavy breathing that came from her lungs, Annalynn sounded like she was in heat. Panting in the background of Lucy feeding her sister was quite uncomfortable to hear for the poor sister, it wasn\u2019t just the girl in front of her who was warped by Henry\u2019s sense of beauty. All the maids seemed to be on the same page as their master, thinking that nothing in this world was quite gorgeous as an obedience blob of a girl like the one Lucy was forced to feed. Annalynn did do this to her sister under her own volition that wasn\u2019t something she denied. Some rejects of Annalynn enjoyed every moment of what she had created, her sister and the nun before she will learn the ropes even if she refuses the pleasure of it all. The cart of treats finally empty and Emma sated for the next hour it was time for Lucy to know the extent of her other duties. As though her main orders would be to fatten the poor girls under her care, it wasn\u2019t the only thing she was tasked with doing. Annalynn is happy to point out to her; none of the girl's motions was wasted when climbing her sister. Not even the nun right in front of her noticed what the girl was doing. Stripping down to nothing but her panties, Annalynn was prepared to do her duty for her master.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNow this next part of your training is as much for their benefit as it is yours, I\u2019ll show you myself what I mean\u201d Annalynn, like any other of her tasks, was as cordial as she could be.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBowing her head in silence, the poor nun finally spoke up, \u201cI\u2019m here to learn so, please teach me.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnnalynn was quite smug with herself. Seeing someone who was supposed to be more experienced than her looking to her for help was something that she quite relished in. Lucy couldn\u2019t help but stare at her teacher though, not wearing anything but a pair of knickers was quite strange to see; what's more, seeing the girl starting to climb the mound of flesh in front of them was a sight to be seen anyways. Questions ran through the nun\u2019s mind while she saw this display of athleticism, Annalynn making it her priority to quite literally mount her dear little sister. It seemed like Emma didn\u2019t mind the motion that caused her body to wobble back and forth. Annalynn, mounting her prey like some kind of hungry beast, feeling every piece of exposed flesh that ran off of this massive girl\u2019s body. Closer, Anna got to her sister\u2019s face the more shallow and rushed her breaths became, her lust for her sister was an external display for Lucy to witness. She could see now that Mr.Wilkinson didn\u2019t just control the people he fattened but the caretakers as well, seeing this sweet girl moan with pleasure from feeling her immobile sister underneath her was a special that Lucy didn\u2019t think she would ever see. Though she was confused by it, all Lucy herself couldn\u2019t help but love watching the two of them, wanting nothing more to see more of this. Annalynn herself didn\u2019t mind the nun watching her, she liked what Emma had become, and their daily ritual\u2019s only enhanced their love for each other. Both Annalynn and Emma locked lips with each other, as a motion of passion exerted throughout their bodies. With each \u201csmack\u201d of their mouths, their love for one another only grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, I didn\u2019t think they had this kind of relationship,\u201d Lucy murmured to herself, not wanting the maid to think less of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnalynn was too busy with her sister and their kissing to worry about her inductee, as much as she should be. Though Lucy wasn\u2019t the smartest person out there, it didn\u2019t dawn on her yet that this kind of intimate relationship was going to be something that she was going to know quite intimately. That was something that Annalynn would have to ingrain into the poor nun, each of Mr.Wilkinson\u2019s slaves was needed to learn how to be sexy in ways that children shouldn\u2019t know about, if that meant learning to striptease or pole dancing then that is what they will learn. Lucy was going to have to teach them these skills and help each of the girls to learn what it means to be sexy.</span></div></div>",

On that note, one, or possibly both of its involved parties seemed to have done the same in more than a single sense, but regardless, in the end, Emma was simply left there, betraying no one\u2019s expectations. Still, Annalynn quietly left the room for a brief time after she\u2019d satisfied herself, and a glance from the terribly interested Sister gave light that the great stomach\u2019s dampness did not entirely consist of its own sweat. That wasn\u2019t to say Lucy had any complaints about being left with Emma, rather the opposite, herself left in a way she long hadn\u2019t been, not since she\u2019d come of age those years ago at least. And never had it been so strong as it was currently, giving her little rational say in whether she moved closer to the room\u2019s sole other inhabitant. Nor did she much think before beginning to thirstily squeeze as much of the exposed flesh as she could fit in her hands when she'd reached her, nearly drooling as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Annalynn returned, newly dressed in a more casual outfit than her earlier livery, Lucy had managed to focus every bit of her attention on the blob laid in front of her. So, for a moderate length of time, the twelve-year-old simply watched as she had before, though there was enough difference between the Sister\u2019s desperate fondling and her earlier robotic feeding that the child was left well entertained. Enough so even, that the maid soon decided to see what effect some encouragement might have, moving behind her pupil to whisper a few honeyed words to their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t hold back now, no one\u2019s here to judge.\u201d Or \u201cThat\u2019s it, just think of how great it\u2019ll be when you\u2019ve gotten your children closer to this size. So much more youthful flesh to squeeze, play with, and enjoy with them in all the wrong ways.\u201d And \u201cNot to mention how they\u2019ll look when they start shuffling through the halls, wobbling around while they can still move. And then how teaseable they\u2019ll be once they can\u2019t.\u201d  Along with all the other variations, the child had to admit, it was quite fun to work someone up, closer and closer toward a finish with nothing aside from her words and heated breaths, even if that individual was different than the usual one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs anyone does, Lucy had a breaking point, one that, due to her mentioned years of abstinence, was lower than that of the average person. But when she'd finally reached it, then sunk down from her high, the caretaker wasn't given the relief one might expect from such restraints being removed, rather the opposite, a momentarily forgotten aspect crushing into her mind. It wasn\u2019t anything unfamiliar, no, it was merely the Sister\u2019s profession calling out to her, chastising her for her desired promiscuity, and plainly denouncing her recent acts, her sins. The poor woman, who used to genuinely think of herself as pious at heart, simply crumbled underneath that shame and guilt, failing to keep the tears from her eyes, and took no solace in the camouflage those that fell gave her lap. As for Annalynn, she only stared, watching the woman cling onto some belief of self-decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, when Lucy had calmed down to a sufficient point, Sister and servant pair went to collect Sophia, the caretaker left carrying the now comatose child out to a waiting carriage. Though as she did, the woman couldn\u2019t help the twisted cocktail of anticipation and remorse that flashed across her face, pleasantly surprised by how much heavier the toddler proved to be. Not to say it was unforeseeable, with how swollen the girl\u2019s midsection was, truly, it seemed almost possible to treat its taut surface as if that of a drum. Such conduct would be discouraged, of course, giving attention to the high likelihood that such contact would lead its contents to spew. On that note, the two caring for the unconscious four-year-old sent their praises to the coachman, who, though some grace of God, managed to drive the unwieldy vehicle with nary a shake or bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after they had finished their ride to the orphanage, Lucy guided her supervisor around its property, though the pair did run into an interruption as they went through the yard. But even with that, Annalynn had nothing but a smile on her face when she saw the offending tot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there! Who are you miss?\u201d Came the enthusiastic greeting young Sarah exclaimed, curious as any child would be at a visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello sweetie, I\u2019m Annalynn. And who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sarah.\" Came the answer, its speaker taking a moment to collect her breath from her recent running, soon continuing their questions, \"What're you doing here then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m going to be helping your miss Lucy keep this establishment running, and keep you and her together. But there'll be some changes while I make that happen. Okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's fine, I don\u2019t want to leave miss Lucy. What\u2019re those changes going to be though?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see in a bit, I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.\u201d Was the refusal, before the girl decided there was no harm in an innocent hint, \u201cBut I will say this, try to work up an appetite, you wouldn\u2019t want to miss out, would you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay!\u201d With that and nary a goodbye, the toddler ran off, going back to dragging her waiting sister along for their misadventures. Though, in her haste, she hadn\u2019t even noticed how her other sibling looked, let alone what the visitor said next when they turned to their unseeming subordinate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she precious? So much energy, she looks like she runs about like that quite a lot. She does, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... yes, she\u2019s probably the most energetic of these girls. Why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat 'why'? Are you saying I won\u2019t catch you staring when her activities lead her to wobble and sweat along the halls? That you won\u2019t hop over and give her a snack when she takes a moment to regain her breath?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... No, I...\u201d was the pathetic, mumbled response that came from the trapped woman, her face turned to the side in a pointless attempt to hide its coloring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. But really, it would be appreciated if you stopped with this virtuous pretext around me. Have you forgotten your earlier spectacle already?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of that incident did nothing to help Lucy\u2019s confidence, leaving the caretaker speechless, simply blushing as she was accused. She couldn\u2019t deny any of it after all. Still, the woman was only given a few moments to collect herself, Annalynn soon reminding her of her current task, they hadn\u2019t finished the tour yet. So, as they resumed their journey around and through the establishment, the sister remembered something, though given what it involved it likely wouldn\u2019t be any problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, what are we doing in regards to food? We don\u2019t have much of it in our cupboards, there\u2019s barely enough money to buy some of the old produce at the market each week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes, that slipped my mind. I forgot to inform you earlier, but there is a cart or two on the way with such supplies. It should arrive by evening and once it does, I\u2019ll do my part in guiding you to cook more fattening dishes, the master doesn\u2019t like waiting after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Lucy paused, wondering just what sort of dishes she\u2019d be told to make, before moving on \u201cWell, would you like to go meet the other girls? You\u2019ll be living with them for a time, won\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sister, on the other hand, was just mulling in her brain what atrocity she had just committed. However, she was a woman of the cloth that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t any less human than the other people around her, and seeing that mound of flesh that was this maid\u2019s sister made poor Lucy lose herself. Annalynn, on the other hand, was still a precise and calculative as ever; she knew that the sister was pure at heart and was just laying in bed with the devil as a means to save these poor girls from the harsh truths of the world. However, this might be the sister\u2019s intentions, that didn't excuse the fact that these girls will be defiled and corrupted by the lust of the maids and Annalynn\u2019s own master. Just as it was for this Annalynn two years ago when begging for salvation from Mr.Wilkinson, offering her sister as a tribute, Lucy will feel the same kind of grief that the head maid had to endure herself. However, the girl had now been corrupted by Henry and her desires. That was neither here nor there at the moment. Her mission was to get this orphanage in proper working order and assess the children. Something that Annalynn reveled in. Looking around, Annalynn could see why the poor sister had sought out Mr.Wilkinson in the first place. The old wood creaked, moving with the slightest steps of anyone around. Though structurally it was sound that didn\u2019t mean it was entirely in the hard condition being a hand-me-down of a hand-me-down didn\u2019t help at all it, Annalynn wondered if it would be just better to knock it down and start from scratch or try to repair it? The architect and personal friend of Henry always did a great job when it came to the various investments of buildings and land.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMiss Lucy, I would like to inspect the children me, and the other maids will get lunch ready for them as assessing their eating capabilities would be beneficial for us\u201d Anna shooing the sister into the other room to round up all the kids.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes, Miss, I will collect them then.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cVery good off with you then.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy was quite unsure if she was doing the right thing for the children, but it wasn\u2019t like she had much of choice, thank goodness the other children haven\u2019t spoken with Sophie yet as that was a conversation she was dreading but something that she will have to get around to. Sophie was placed with the other maids in the kitchen as she was still working off the large meal that she was forced to eat while the sister her protector rounded up all the other girls, many things ran through her mind as she looked at all the various maids that had come to the orphanage. Sophie didn\u2019t know what to make of them or what their roles were going to be all the girls wanted to do was rest and digest her meal. Watching five or six similarly dressed maids all different ages from six years old to fourteen, Sophia was quite amazed at these skills, nothing was made to waste when it came to their cooking skills. Many different smells had entered the stuffed girl\u2019s nostrils she, making her queasy thanks to her previous sweet meal, Sophia hoped that she didn't have to partake in this meal as well. As uncomfortable as she was the fear of having to indulge in another meal was something that she was dreading, with these strangers making what looked like a banquet only heightened Sophia\u2019s fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy, on the other hand, had her own fears to come to terms with, knowing that this was the only way to save these girls from the harshness that was the outside world was with Mr.Wilkinson\u2019s help that was something that wasn\u2019t going to change, though she shouldn\u2019t dwell on it too much as it would just make her go crazy when she asks questions of a question. Getting Sophia\u2019s sister ready for lunch was the easiest thing to do, they both were the more mature of the girls if Lucy based that on the maturity of a four-year-old that is. The only person she was quite dreading in coming out of her room was Ella the girl was quite hard to control on her own but seeing as the girl was lost to sea for a few months after that tragedy it was only something that Lucy had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, go get Kimiko for me if you would I have to get Ella, you and your sister make your way to the dining room when done with collecting Kimiko\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, is Sophia there too?\u201d Skye asked wondering why she hasn\u2019t seen her sister since they got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she is with the head maid that Mr.Wilkinson was gracious enough to lend to us\u201d, Now get going\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy ordered the two sisters, knowing full well that they would listen to her being as obedient as they were, nothing like the other girls especially the one she was trying to coax out of her room at the moment. Peering inside the room not knowing it the feral girl would jump out at any moment was always heart pumping for the young nun, she didn\u2019t know what to do with the child. The young Scandinavian girl didn\u2019t even know what to make of her new surroundings when first coming to the orphanage and that kind of position hasn\u2019t much changed much for both of them. Sighing finally she had barged in looking for Ella. Looking under beds, in closets, and other different kinds of hiding spots Lucy was quite tired of this game.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A day or two before a daycare\u2019s opening, its owner, George, was checking his e-mail for inquiries from those responding to any of the ads he posted in some of the stranger areas of the internet. Posted there if only because it was the one place George could hope to avoid a lawsuit, if not for his unfortunate habit, he would have had advertisements in a multitude of other places. The unpleasant habit he has is that since he thinks that toddlers are cuter when they\u2019re waddling, he can\u2019t help but overfeed them whenever they\u2019re in his care, often without their consent.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it first reared its head, he was a neighborhood babysitter filling in for whatever parents had plans that didn\u2019t involve their offspring. It had all gone fine, at least until he screwed up, badly, he\u2019d gotten intoxicated on a job, and the liquor, other than unsteadying his steps, loosened his thoughts enough for him to decide to stuff poor little Elise with all she could eat, which ended up being a majority of what was in the fridge. He was, fortunately, able to avoid jail time through an agreement he and the parents came to; he\u2019d reimburse them in any way they wanted, then never speak to them again. The conditions were harsh but undoubtedly justified, and George wanted to put it all behind him, so after doing any chores he was told to do, he moved to another state where he wouldn\u2019t have such a taboo attached to him.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip a few years into the future, and George has managed to get all of the needed credentials to have what he\u2019d grown to want since the incident. A daycare, a place where he could fatten up all the little girls he wanted to, only needing to find understanding parents.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning back to the present, George saw that there were quite a few applications in his inbox, all from parents wanting their children to grow at least a little wider, checking through the attached pictures he decided on five girls he\u2019d accept now and notified the other parents that he\u2019d likely take more once he got used to the new job.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose accepted were:  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet: two-years-old, blond hair, Caucasian, thin;  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother has always wanted a docile little butterball to pamper and spoil, but because of Violet being a picky eater, she\u2019s not exactly the easiest to fatten up, so her mother decided to send her to a professional.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred end weight - none set.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire: three-year-old, auburn hair, pale Caucasian, thin;  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clumsy child with an unfortunate habit of knocking things over while bumbling through the house, her parents while they don\u2019t hold it against her, they don\u2019t really want it to continue, so, thinking that she\u2019d be less active with some added weight, they\u2019ve decided to send her here.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred end weight \u2013 at least enough to deter movement.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella: two-year-old, black hair, oriental descent, chubby;  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she isn\u2019t too much of a bother, she still does enough of what\u2019s expected of a girl her age that her parents are a bit exasperated, it doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re irresponsible enough to prefer if she couldn't run around at all.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred end weight \u2013 at least enough to impede movement.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora: one-year-old, blond hair, Caucasian, chubby;  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Aurora doesn\u2019t currently care about fashion now, her mother knows she will eventually, and with the notable correlation between fashion standards and eating disorders such as anorexia, her mother wants to make sure that Aurora will never fall prey to them. What better way than making her too fat to lose any weight?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred end weight \u2013 none set.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne: three-year-old, brown hair, Caucasian, thin;  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn athletic girl who never wants to sit down, not even for meals, preferring to pace around the room while every so often getting a bite from her plate. Her parents, exasperated from their failed attempts in getting her to stay still, decided that her athleticism was the problem, so she\u2019s being sent here to get rid of it.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred end weight \u2013 at least enough to slow her down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having gathered a rough estimate of how much feed he\u2019d need, George grabbed his keys and wallet, then left for the supplier he'd found on a feederism site, not expecting any questions about the quantity...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later at the opening of his daycare, George met in person with each of the parents and gave them a more in-depth explanation about what he\u2019d be doing to their children, afterward, a few of them asked if they could ever come help out with feeding either their own or any child. Once the others had discussed it, the understanding was that they were fine with anybody feeding their respective kids and that it might be more enjoyable to get personally involved in the process instead of having George to do it all by himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they\u2019d all agreed to come by whenever they had a day off, George brought them inside to see if there were any obvious improvements he could make. Inside, the building looked a lot more clinical and a lot less welcoming, past the entranceway there was a room filled with gurneys arranged in orderly lines, each with a set of bindings and a corresponding pump next to them. Thinking now was as good a time as any, George decided to start, announcing such,   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since we\u2019re here, we might as well hook them up. You can help if you want.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the invitation proved popular, George picked up the rowdiest of the toddlers, Anne, then used her as an example for the parents to see how to strap their own children to one of the beds. Teaching the group how tight they can pull the restraints without cutting off the girls\u2019 circulation and how to adjust the flow of each of the pumps. While each parent was binding their child, immersing the room in a short cacophony of childish resistance, the unfortunate toddlers had no inkling of what was going to happen to them. Nevertheless, the room quieted once the parents had secured the mouthpiece to each child\u2019s face, now waiting expectantly as the mixture of lard and batter began to be pumped into each of their children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mixture reached the girls\u2019 mouths, forcing its way into their stomachs, George led the parents to another room, this one an office, in order to get a better understanding of what they want. Inside the office\u2019s waiting area, George chose one set of the parents to interview, leaving the rest to talk amongst themselves while waiting their turn. The first to be picked ended up being Claire\u2019s, once in the more private area of the office they introduced themselves as Stan and Alia respectively, then started to give George a more detailed explanation for their choice to fatten their offspring. It seemed that little Claire was clumsy enough to be a danger to herself, regardless of how irritating she was to others, so the decision prompting her journey to imminent obesity was as much for her sake as theirs, though they couldn\u2019t deny the thought that she\u2019d be cuter with the extra pudge.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he\u2019d finished with Claire\u2019s, George went through similar conversations with the rest of the parents, getting a better understanding of what each wants from this arrangement and making a list of any change he might make for each of the girls. Having finished all of the paperwork needed, George showed the parents out, telling them that they can choose whether to pick up their child or not. If they\u2019re not picked up, then the girls will be fed through the night, with nary a break to digest nor a chance at escape. Seeing the cars drove off, George when back inside to the feeding area, checking each girl for how much room they had left by pressing lightly on each of their stomachs to feel for any give. Satisfied with each of the girls\u2019 capacities, George decided to slightly increase the flow, pleasantly wondering how long it would be until the girls could be fed at full power\u2026</span></div></div>",

The previously most active ones had gained the most, caused by the combination of being fed more per their parents\u2019 request and being essentially forced to sit around and do nothing more than absolutely necessary while at home.

Though, how to change that? The parents thought, going through whatever options they might have thought up, looking for something useful, something simple. Once one of them had the thought, they were dumbfounded by its simplicity, leave them here, leave them at the place that\u2019s entire purpose was to help them grow.

And much would it accelerate their growth?\u201d  Violet\u2019s mother, Lacy, asked, jumping at the chance to further quicken her daughter\u2019s voyage into obesity.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, slightly amused by the parent\u2019s enthusiasm, needed no convincing, more than willing to help the parents get their children to the preferred size, \u201cAnswering your questions, yes, of course, it\u2019s fine to leave your kids here. Besides, feeding them twenty-four-seven is undoubtedly going to make them all the heavier. Now, who of you want to leave their child with me?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain quickly discussing with each other, the parents soon came to a unanimous conclusion, they were all perfectly fine with leaving their children overnight. Not that it seemed very different from what was happening already, the only difference being that they saved some gas and groceries. With that in mind, George decided to exchange numbers with all of them, thinking it\u2019d be more convenient than e-mail anyway. Once he finished adding the parents\u2019 contact info, he decided to bring up another topic, since it seemed like it wouldn\u2019t take terribly long; what\u2019s to be done when the toddlers are too fat to move? It wasn\u2019t as if he had any qualms about fattening the girls past that milestone, far from, it was only the problems of: how will they be moved, what if they end up too big to take back home, what should be done to feed them at their respective homes, etc.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoicing such concerns to the parents, he asked,   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we doing once your children can\u2019t move anymore? Will you be buying one of the feeding machines to keep them growing at home, or do you want some other arrangement?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge could\u2019ve sworn he saw some of the parents drooling at the thought of their toddler growing too large to even manage a waddle, not that he blamed them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Aurora\u2019s mother, Mary, provided an answer, \u201cI\u2019m fine with that, but I have a couple of questions, how much do the feeding pumps cost, and will you give us the recipe you use for what you\u2019ve been feeding our daughters?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but there isn\u2019t much of a recipe, I\u2019ve just been feeding them lard, originally mixed with some cake batter for flavor, but you can add whatever you want to it for taste. As for the pump\u2019s price, is sixty dollars fine?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you obviously have to feed any other girls that end up in your care, and for what it is, sixty dollars is surprisingly cheap. I assume we can get the lard through you, or will you tell us where to buy it?\u201d  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it might be easier for you to get it yourselves\u2026\u201d Complying to their request, George writes down the address from which the parents can order the mixture that makes up the majority of their young piglets\u2019 diets.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d He said, handing out the slips of paper he wrote the address on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving each parent a copy and seeing them off, he goes back to what he\u2019s being paid to do. Turning each of the girls\u2019 pumps to the next level, then switching off the lights and going back to his office. Thinking that since he\u2019d gotten a comfortable routine so there was no more reason to hold off, he decided to accept a few more customers. Going through his e-mail once again, George looked for any girls that piqued his interest\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Deciding of a singular family was going to be difficult, to say the least, looking over his case notes on all the families and what they were looking to do with each of their daughters it was clear to see that all had different wants and needs when it came to his kind of service but all decided that George and his way of thinking was the best course of action to take in the long run. The first file on his desk was of Violet and her single mother Jean, her husband was lost during a mission in Iraq last year as an IED had hit the caravan that he was protecting, being a horrible wreck from the loss coming from her husband she thought it would have been better to use all of her energy to make sure her two-year-old daughter violet had all she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused Jean to pamper Violet like a princess, but when the girl started to make friends on her own as toddlers do when they socialize it seemed there was a shift in the personality of Jean. Jean seems to have become less compassionate and understanding of the wants and needs of her daughter and more to Jean wants to control every aspect of Violet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day to day. Not wanting a daughter any more only wanting something akin to a pet or a doll when it came to violet, Jean thought it would be best if she went to come to see George and help her little piglet grow as a mean to dominate Violet's life further. George didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know or care to know her reasons for seeking him out, but if it helps Jean cope with and love her daughter more then it was worth it in his eyes. There not being any kind of set weight wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything out of the ordinary for people who are in his kind of work, what was quite strange was the thing that extra payment Jean had made to add personality modifier for Violet. Sometimes there are little special requests added but this was a new one even for George, having Violet see herself as no longer as a human and be nothing more than a piglet or a doll was new to him, to say the least. Trying to make it work for his clients is what George strives for though, there was no challenge that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to face while making his nursery that cater of the whims of their parents a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next child that was sent here by her parents seemed a little more cut and dry, the little girl of three years old was named Claire a girl who had pale skin like the previous girl but what differentiated both girls was one their hair color, Clair was born with fiery red hair which was cut into a pixie cut that was offset by her smooth pale skin, while Violet was a platinum blonde hair was so long that if the girl walked instead of being carried by her mother, then it would be tickling her toes with its length. Claire's parents were what would be called helicopter parents every little move that the girl did they were there to watch her, this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without any good reason as Claire was clumsy was putting it mildly. A few scrapes, bruises, and one black eye littered the girl's body, like a road map to what kind of trouble the girl gets into when she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watched. Not even being apart of any really violent sports George was quite astounded with how beat up the girl looked any parent would be worried if their precious daughter always found herself tripping over air. Calvin and Nicole had every right with the way Claire was watched but this gave them both no time to do anything else that would be deemed adult appropriate, it Nicole isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaning she is watching to make sure that her bundle of joy is secure. Hearing about George and his nursery was like a godsend, most parents would deter from finding out the truth in the matter that George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nursery is used to force baby girls and little toddlers to be little fatties, not Calvin and Nicole they say this as an opportunity, having Claire become more sedentary meant they would have more time to be romantic to each other and less time worried it she had broken another finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0George didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which family he was going to start off with and there were just so many family files that he had to go through, George mulled it over in his brain thinking if he should just pick one of these two girls or continue the search, not wanting to make a mistake he\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..</span></div></div>",
