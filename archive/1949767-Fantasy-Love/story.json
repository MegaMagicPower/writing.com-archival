Maybe we can learn something from each other.'' you say, as you walked up to the Orc, who then held out his hand for you. ''Hey, I'm Thorux.'' the Orc said. ''I'm Jarre.'' you said, as you shook his hand. A warm feeling flows through your body as you held Thorux's hand. Weird. You suddenly notice the difference of size. He is like one and a half head higher than you. You let go off his hand again. ''All right.. let's get started..'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both switched weapons, and explained each other how everything works, and how both your hunting technique is. It's quite funny, though. The War Axe is way too heavy for you to carry so you keep falling, and Thorux really can't draw the bow without almost breaking it, even though he can't almost fit his hand in the bow. After a lot of hunting you both managed to get an boar and deer. ''All right, sweet!'' you say. ''Thanks, Thorux.'' you say. ''No problem. Thank you too, Jarre.'' he said, as you both walked back again to the path you both meeted at. Thorux seemed to be grinning and blushing. ''What's up?'' you ask. ''Well.. I just.. you.. you're..'' he stuttered. You suddenly noticed his lioncloth raising, and suddenly felt a slap on your ass. You blush. ''What the..!?'' you say startled. ''S-sorry.. I can't help myself.. You're just hot..'' Thorux said. You look at Thorux. ''W-wait.. y-you're in love with me..? I..'' you stutter..</span></div></div>",

You climb onto his knee and kissed his big orc lips, and soon felt him joining in on the kiss. His lips felt very nice.. he is such an handsome guy for an orc.. You felt your penis erecting, and also noticed Thorux's lioncloth rising. You grin, stop kissing and look at his lioncloth. ''Heh.. horny huh? Come on, let's find a good place for our private time, we don't want anyone catching us..'' you say. Thorux nodded, grabbed you and held you close, and lifted you to a nearby cabin. ''Here, I found this cabin a while ago.'' he says, as he entered. And as soon as Thorux let you go, you undressed yourself. ''Come on, big boy.. show me that body.'' you say. Thorux started undressing himself, you notice him bending forward, showing off his ass. It was quite hairy and big.. but.. you loved it. ''Whoa.. nice ass, man.. I would dive right in if that was possible..'' you say. Thorux chuckled. ''Heh heh.. all right.. but come here with that ass of yours..'' Thorux said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorux started to lay on bed, and you sat on Thorux's face with your ass. You felt his warm, wet tongue penetrating your asshole, quickly making your dick erect. ''Heh.. you're.. you're good at this..'' you say. ''Thanks.. your ass tastes amazing, by the way..'' Thorux said. You chuckle. With every lick, you felt more and more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of licking, Thorux stopped. ''Well, time for the dick.'' he says. You roll over and bend forward to Thorux. ''Go ahead, big boy.. show me that dick.'' You say, looking behind you looking at Thorux's dick. ''Nice..'' you say. Thorux thrusted his dick into you, and started thrusting back and forth with his dick. You felt the big lump of meat slide trough your anus at immense speed. ''Ah.. c'mon.. harder, orcy~..'' you taunt. ''Not hard enough? That can be arranged..'' he says, as he thrusted even harder and faster. You moan in joy as you felt him thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of thrusting, you couldn't help yourself but to cum all over the bed, and not a few minutes later, Thorux also came. ''Ha.. ha.. that was.. so good..'' you say. Thorux took his dick out of your ass, and held his arm over you. You snuggle up to him. ''Thanks, Jarre.. but.. how are we going to keep this a secret..?'' he asks. ''We'll see.. don't worry..'' you say.</span></div></div>",

Monsters are dangerous and unpredictable, after all, and monster tamers weren\u2019t believed to be very long for this world. Still, it was all you were really passionate about, so it was inevitable that you\u2019d end up a certified beastmaster, renowned across the land for your deep understanding of magical creatures of all kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain category of monster interests you above all others. The few that have integrated into human society; creatures who have the intelligence of humans and the ability of speech, even though postmortem analysis reveals both to be physically impossible. While these monsters are often treated fairer than others by the king\u2019s decrees, they are also possibly even more distrusted, believed to be puppets controlled by human wizards. Thus, in the city of Rothorham, where you now lived, you were one of the only ones to have befriended the few intelligent beasts that walk the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia, the griffon, seems most interested in becoming part of human society. She even has a job; delivering important letters all around Rothorham. Being a monster, most people are loathe to trust her with their mail, but the fact that she can fly from one end of the city to the other in minutes means they\u2019re practically forced to come to her for urgent deliveries. More famously, the lord mayor of Rothorham\u2019s prized possession is Arion, a mythical mare bred by the gods themselves, known for centuries for carrying soldiers into battle at impossible speeds. She spends most of her time in the stables of the lord\u2019s palace, and you\u2019re only called upon to calm her down whenever she becomes disobedient. Being immortal, the poor mare has a lot of emotional issues. Most mysteriously, there\u2019s occasionally reports of a small wyvern wandering around the sewers. A wyvern could be a serious problem, if it becomes aggressive, but at the moment it just seems to be afraid of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day, you have to deal with a new problem. As you sit in your hut on the edge of town, looking through your notes, you can only wonder at what the day will bring...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't like the other women you've met. She stood at 6'3\" and had an athletic body. Her eyes were an emerald green color and her hair was a snowy white blonde. She wore light armor and had a sword strapped to her waist. If memory serves you correctly her name was Kris. You didn't bother asking what her name was short for, but it was an edgy name for such a pristine woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine. How about...,\" You couldn't finish your sentence. You were infatuated with Kris's beauty. You then trying looking towards the ground. However, this gives Kris the wrong impression. She then slaps you across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert! You were totally checking out my boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't looking at your boobs. It's just...,\" You are yet again at a loss for words. You can't put your finger on it, but Kris is starting to look familiar. You can't put your finger on it. Your face turns red as you can't muster any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it? Why can't you look me in the eye?\" Kris said as she impatiently tapped her foot against the wooden floor of the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm in love with you!,\" You blurt out. You then put your palm on your face. Did you really say that out loud. If that's the case then this may be a good night or a totally awkward and embarrassing night. Kris smiles mischievously, however you don't catch the smile since you weren't sure of why you told a woman you barely knew that you loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\", Kris begins laughing. \"So that's why you have been acting weird. I thought you were some run of the mill pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath as the red on your face disappears. You weren't sure if Kris was being coy or if she felt the same way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are good looking, but the question is do I reciprocate your feelings? I may need to take a rain check on that one. My father has been trying to set me up with suitors all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then try thinking of any female knights or nobles that fit Kris's statement in regards to suitors. There are a few, including the princess, but most of them practice magic and you know nothing of the princess except that she doesn't spend her days inside the castle all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a noblewoman. Are you friends with the princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris begins blushing. She then takes a breath before replying. \"Let's just say that I know the princess very well,\" Kris replied while looking at the door. It's obvious that she's dodging the question. \"What do you know it's time that I retired for the night. I hope to see you later Xavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris kisses you on the cheek and makes for the door. You arch an eyebrow at her suspicious behavior. You're sure that she doesn't want to say which one of the princess's friends she could be, yet at the same time she's so mysterious and alluring. You then look out the window as Kris takes off on horseback.</span></div></div>",

She was a little bit short for an elf, had smooth dark tan skin, and  short pitch black hair. Her ears were rather long, and she was quite proud of them. Her clothing was mostly ornamental, considering she lived in a hot climate, and didn't leave much to the imagination, just a white silk loincloth and a white silk piece of cloth tied around her breasts. She had on numerous gold bracelets, anklets, a jeweled pendant, and a cute little silver tiara. A cool breeze went over her skin.<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is the life...\" Luca thought in her head as she popped a grape in her mouth.<br>\r\nThen, out of nowhere, she heard a knock on her door. She nearly choked on her grapes!<br>\r\n\"You may enter!\" Luca called out.<br>\r\nThe door opened and in walked a burly handsome elf man. He was tall, muscular, and wore nice silken robes. Behind him walked her father, The King.<br>\r\n\"F... Father! What are you doing here unannounced?\" Luca said.<br>\r\nThe King laughed.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's my palace, I can go wherever I please, can't I?\" He said.<br>\r\nLuca discreetly rolled her eyes. She hated it when he came in without warning her. She might have put on some nicer clothes instead of lounging in her underwear.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Luca, you need to get married and start making me some grandchildren. I found you a nice partner, Chadzor, Prince of House Pent.\" The King said.<br>\r\nThe burly elf man bent down and kissed Luca's hand.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you, Miss!\" He said, smiling.<br>\r\nLuca sighed. Every damn man she met greeted her this way, and all of them thought she would giggle like a schoolgirl when they did. She was a little bit tired of it.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Dad. I thought my sister Sonia would be getting arranged marriages. She's going to be queen, not me.\" Luca said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't really think you'd get off that easy?\" The King said.<br>\r\nHe looked to Chadzor for a second.<br>\r\n\"No offense to Chadzor, but I want to be friends with House Pent, and the quickest way to do that is to get my second best girl in with their second best boy. That's why I want you to love him. Now.\" The King said.<br>\r\nLuca looked over Chadzor. He was tall and handsome.<br>\r\n\"My Lady, I'd be honored if you...\" Chadzor started to say.<br>\r\n\"Can't you just talk to me like a normal girl? Everybody does the 'Milady' junk and I'm sick of it.\" Luca said.<br>\r\nThe King slapped himself in the face.<br>\r\n\"See, this is why you aren't married yet, Luca.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's okay. I can work with that.\" Chadzor said, grinning.<br>\r\nLuca looked over Chadzor again.<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you're my type...\" Luca said.<br>\r\nChadzor laughed and threw off his robes. Underneath he wore nothing but a small red sack tied around his genitals, barely obscuring them.<br>\r\n\"How about now?\" He said.<br>\r\nLuca sighed. This guy was a real dumbass, but at least he appeared to have a sense of humor.<br>\r\n\"Please... please put your clothes back on. You're making an ass of both of us.\" Luca said.<br>\r\n\"You like my ass?\" Chadzor said, turning around so Luca could see his bare ass.<br>\r\n\"Stop it! That's gross! that's the end you poop from!\" Luca said.<br>\r\nThis might have been titillating if she was familiar with Chadzor but it just came off as rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChadzor quickly figured out this was not going well. He quickly put his robe back on and turned to The King.<br>\r\n\"You said it would work!\" Chadzor said.<br>\r\nThe King only frowned at him ,as if Chadzor had misstepped .<br>\r\nPrince Chadzor turned back to Luca.<br>\r\n\"Listen, the striptease was your dad's idea. I'm not really a dumb hussy-man, honest!\" He said.<br>\r\nLuca knerw this was probably true. She thought it over for a moment.</span></div></div>",
