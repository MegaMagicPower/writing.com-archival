Portals opened letting in hundreds of monsters of much greater size, but these monsters were different, they took the form of giant women. They immediately took to terrorising the world of Galeran. Your name was Alex Feralclaw and you were a nobody, but not for long. If you could get one or more of these monsterous women on your side you could seize power easily. You could become a king in no time flat, the only problem was where to begin. You looked over the information you had gathered on the nearby monsters one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Veny the Slime girl of the swamp was an intelligent slime that grew in size the more magic she consumed. Her last documented size was about 25 ft tall. Her amorphous body let her change shape and color at will, easily trapping many explorers. While she didn't care for the taste of meat she did pose a constant threat to the wizards that depended on the trade routes through her swamp. With every shipment she took she grew a couple feet and rendered all the magical ingredients and instruments she touched inert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nekia the cat girl of the forest was a 50 foot menace to the south. She treated the merchants carts like play things, chasing them down and bating them around. She was extremely intelligent as well, she quickly learned the trade routes and how the merchants might avoid her, she even set traps to make sure they couldn't get away. With her on your side you could easily take down major trade routes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haliera the Dragon queen was a huge dragon to the far East of the kingdom. Like most of the new monsters she would be difficult to tell apart from a human female if it weren't for her size and extra features. In her case she was 100 feet tall with wings, horns and a dragon tail. Like all ancient dragons she was proficient in magic and as the dragon queen she commanded an army of 10 foot dragon girls. Every month her dragons would raid a random kingdom and steal as much treasure as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mersila the sea tyrant was a 300 foot merwoman. She was causing trouble for the fishermen by eating all the fish around the dock to the west. Her size and strength let her easily break open fishing nets and consume her meal. Some fishermen disappearances were blamed on her but more often than not She seemed to eat fish. With her helping you could take out an entire Navy fleet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Desia the colossus was the largest known monster in the world standing at 2,000 feet. She is currently hibernating to the north with her back to the village, making her long red hair and behemoth sized booty easily visible. She wasn't known for being aggressive but the hard part would be getting her attention and convincing her to work with you afterwards. Desia's raw power could easily help take control of kingdoms alone but there were also some religion's forming around her, with a colossus and an army of fanatics at your side you could easily conquer a country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After reviewing all the information one last time you decided to go after...</span></div></div>",

You gathered what little of things you could call yours and set off for the swamp she nested in. On your way out of the village a cloaked figure stuck out their foot and tripped you. You landed face first in the dirt with their laughter filling your ears. \"Going somewhere Alex,\" they said cackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw off Merl,\" you said as you lifted yourself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you make me, oh right you can't you flunked out of the Academy,\" Merl said with her annoying sarcastic voice. You began walking away again only for Merl to appear once more dead ahead of you. \"Seriously where are you going Alex, were going to need you when one of those monsters asks for an offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going on an adventure Merl, you and your precious Academy will be lucky if you never see me again,\" you said pushing her aside and continuing on your trip. There was another reason Veny was your first choice, with her ability to consume magic she could set Merl and everyone else at the Academy of Magical Arts to the same level as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reached the swamp just as the sun was beginning to set. You pulled out the one magical item you had in your bag, a endless ink quill supplied by the Academy. You ventured into the swamp quill in hand looking for any signs of the shape shifting slime. Then it happened, tendrils of translucent ooze shot up from the swamp grabbing and restraining you. They pulled the quill from your hand and released you. Looking up you saw a beautiful 25 foot female with translucent black hair and pale skin standing in front of you. The quill was floating inside of her where it glowed for a moment before being shot out of her, she grew a few inches right in front of you. She gave you a smile before turning around and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you yelled but she kept on walking like she couldn't hear you. \"I...I can get you more,\" you said desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\" She said curiously as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes more, see your on a small trade route but if you go to the source you could consume a lot more magic,\" you explained. She looked at you with a confused expression on her face. \"Do you understand?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade?\" She said confused before pulling a frog from the water and offering it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no trade, it's a gift. I can take you to it follow me,\" you said as you began to walk back to your village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift,\" she said as you felt her stuff the frog into your pocket. It sent shivers down your spine as you felt it squirming in your pocket.</span></div></div>",

The magic Academy wasn't to far from the swamp, you were actually a little surprised she didn't know about it. You two reached the edge of the swamp and began to head back to the village. You could see the Academy at the peak of the mountain next to the two of you. \"We have to go up,\" you said to her pointing to the Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up?\" Veny said curiously as she picked you up and raised you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Higher,\" you said pointing again to the Academy above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up\" Veny said happily as she threw you high into the sky. You crashed through one of the Academy windows and landed on one of the desks. You took a minute to compose yourself and make sure none of your bones were broken, before walking back to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you come up!\" you shouted to Veny. She smiled before walking up the side of the cliff like it was nothing. She squeezed her head through the broken window and then proceeded to squeeze into the room. She looked around the room hungrily, seemingly sensing all of the magical instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift?\" She asked with drool dripping out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes gift,\" you said gesturing to the room. Without hesitation she sprang into action, tendrils shooting from her body and grabbing every magic object in the room. She opened the door and reached into other area's of the school as well, it was less than a minute but you were pretty sure she had already managed to grab every magical item in the Academy. They glowed inside her and she began to grow right in front of you. She grew and grew until she was...</span></div></div>",

You were backed into the corner of the room in order to avoid her. She turned to smile at you once more now that she had finished. \"Can you become smaller?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small...er?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea like my height,\" you said gesturing to yourself. She looked at you confused for a second before a look of realisation spread across her face. You watched her body condense in on it's self, becoming less and less translucent as she did so until she looked like a normal girl. She was still a foot or so taller than you but it would be easier to get her out of the academy now that you could guide her. You brought her out of the room and down the hallway you watched as small tendrils shot out of her and grabbed magical items she had missed, draining them and spitting them out. The two of you soon reached the exit and as you opened it you were shocked to see Merl standing there looking at you. Her purple eyes stared into your soul as she said, \"oh Alex what a surprise, I thought you left for good. Out for a late night study session with your girlfriend are you? You know the teachers don't like it when students trespass at night don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Merl we were just getting things ready for tomorrow,\" you lied as you tried to get past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift,\" Veny said cutely as she placed the slime covered frog in Merl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Merl said monotonously as she crushed the frog in her hand. Rage burned in Veny's eyes as she absorbed Merl into her body sucked her dry of magic and through her towards the ocean all in only a few seconds. She had grown a full foot from that move and was still in her condensed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're going to be good friends,\" you said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend,\" she said softly as you took her hand and led her to your home. You passed out when you got home and awoke to the startling sight of Veny staring down at you, her green eye's piercing the depths of your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Veny?\" You asked wondering what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend,\" she replied cutely as she lifted you from the bed with one hand. You were about to put together breakfast when you heard a knock at the door. It was Merl, surrounded by the Academy teachers and soaking wet. You stared at them for a second in total silence before closing the door. There was a loud bang as one of the wizards blasted the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veny, it's time to go,\" you said in a panic.</span></div></div>",

She grew as she drained the mages of their magical power. She looked at you with a big smile and asked, \"Good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we survive this I promise I'll teach you how to use complete sentences,\" you said trying to make light of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise?\" Veny asked as she gave you a cute look. Her attention snapped back to the mages whose backup had just arrived. She released the now drained mages and grabbed the new ones that had just charged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret this Alex,\" Merl shouted as she ran away from the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" you said feeling as though you had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" Veny said as her eyes seemed to fill with hunger, she grew more and more into her full height. Screams could be heard as people saw her grow. Now transparent again Veny was standing at a hundred feet tall, tendrils shot from her body grabbing any citizen in sight and absorbing what magic they had. She was growing quickly, 120 feet, 130 feet, 150 feet, as she grew she was able to cover more ground and grab more people growing faster. She released those that she drained back on to the ground, now completely void of Magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Veny time to stop,\" you said just before a tendril shot from her and grabbed you. Veny was towering over the village at 200 feet. She released everyone she had drained and turned around to drain another part of the village. You could here them screaming as she grabbed them. If you couldn't reason with her she was going to absorb all of the magic in the village.</span></div></div>",

Her intelligence and stealth would make her a valuable ally. You packed up what little you had and started heading south. A few hours into your journey you found a trading wagon flipped on it's side with the horses missing. You spotted some gigantic foot prints next to it and began to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The prints led to a clearing in the forest where you could see the monster you were after. Aside from her size, extra pair of cat ears and feline tail she looked like a normal human girl. She had Burnett hair, green eyes, decent breasts and a large rear end. Her clothes appeared to be made from various leather and cloth she had stolen from the merchants. You watched in horror as she picked up a horse and ate it like a cat does a mouse. Realizing this was a terrible idea you turned to run away and you stepped on a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this, another knight to try and vanquish me for the good of the people?\" She asked easily spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No actually I was here to ask you a question but it looks like your busy so I'll be off,\" you said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not busy ask away little mouse,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I was wondering if you would like to team up with me,\" you said shaking in your boots. Nekia burst out laughing for a solid minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so... And what could you possibly have to offer me,\" she said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all of the trade routes from the village north of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need those, I get enough food with the trade routes I know already, but you are funny. Tell you what little mouse, well play a game if you can avoid being caught by me until the sun sets over the horizon we can be friends, but if I catch you I'm going to do whatever I want to you,\" she said licking her lips. \"I'm only going to give you a one minute head start so you better get going.\"</span></div></div>",

There was no way it had been a minute yet, Nekia was trying to cheat you into becoming her next meal. You could see her cat ears poking over the tree tops as she came running in your direction. You could see a river not to far away so you made a break for it. \"There you are,\" she said teasingly just before you jumped into the lake. You dove underwater and swam upstream, a shadow loomed above you and you swam harder against the current to escape her. Just when you saw giant fingers pierce the waters surface next to you, you made your move. You flipped over and swam with the current instead of against it, getting a good view of Nekia's butt as you swam away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You quietly broke the surface of the water as she pulled out her hand triumphantly. \"Got you, huh, where did my mouse go?\" She continued searching upstream for you while you slowly and quietly got out of the stream.

You ran through the trees as fast as you could, hearing them crash behind you as Nekia broke them down chasing after you.

You walked into the clearing, Nekia was taking a nap in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You set down the sack before going and touching her nose. She jerked her head back surprised, taking a look at you she relaxed, got up and stretched. \"So what is it that you decided to bring me?\" Nekia asked happily as she brought her head down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are called pastries, our bakers make them almost every day. They go stale sooner than it takes for merchants to traverse this trade rout so I doubt you ever get them.\" You said holding one out to her. She opened her mouth and waited for you to put it in. Remembering how she devoured the horse, you decided to toss the pastry in rather than get your hands close to her mouth. You could immediately tell by her face that she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, these are great, you said that the bakers make them?\" She said as she emptied the sack of sweets into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and we can get more if you help me, it'll be our deal, you help me and I'll get you pastries,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, what do you want first?\" She said excited to have more pastries. You saw this coming, she wanted to do something now to get them as soon as possible, the problem was you didn't have any money left. You took a minute to think before responding to her saying, \"there's a trade caravan coming in from the east, if you scare them away then their goods should be able set us up for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds easy enough,\" Nekia said as she got up, grabbing you as she did so. She began to head east with you in her hand, keeping her head low so that people wouldn't spot her from a distance. She peeked over the trees every so often to check if she could see the caravan, until finally she spotted it. She set you down on the ground before running in through the trees at breakneck speed. \"Oh great lunch has arrived!\" She shouted off in the distance. You could hear the commotion as the horses scrambled to avoid her. You began making your way over, you could hear the panicked cries of the people as they tried to escape with what they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the goods, save yourself!\" One of them yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, running away? I just need something to eat,\" Nekia said. As you approached the edge of the road you could make out the scene in front of you. Some of the horses had broken free of their harnesses, some of the people were trying to ride away and Nekia had two of the horses in her hand. One of the wagons was trying to make a U-turn and get away, but Nekia was easily keeping up with it. \"Where do you think your going?\" She asked playfully. Giving in the merchants abandoned their wagon and tried to run away. Nekia easily took another one of their horses as they ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did pretty good,\" you said as you began to rummage through the abandoned caravan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's pretty easy when your a fifty foot monster. So how many pastries do you think this can buy?\" She asked smugly as she ate one of the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't all go to pastries, were going to need supplies,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supplies for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been terrorizing the same trade rout for awhile, they'll be hiring protection soon, probably wizard's because most weapons are ineffective on you. If you want to stay alive you'll either need help or to switch trade routs,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a slime girl that can eat magic, she would be the most obvious option.\" You said collecting the money and valuables from the loot. Nekia thought to herself before saying...</span></div></div>",

She stopped and looked at you, waiting for you to disclose the information you posses. You panted between breaths as you explained, \"You've been targeting kingdoms randomly each month but if you raid selected kingdoms at specific times and intervals they will have more gold for you to take. For instance the kingdom of Vander gets large shipments of gold and jewels in on the first of every other month as payment due to it's exports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Haliera responded actually looking impressed. \"And is it like this for other kingdoms as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no, I can explain but can I get some water first?\" You asked still sweating. Haliera spread her wings and took off into the sky. The gust of wind from her wings flapping was like a cool breeze. A few minutes later she came back with cauldron in her right hand and her left clenched into a fist. She opened your cage and set the cauldron inside, and then re-barricaded the door with the rubble. She hovered her left hand over the cage, opening it she released a fist full water (for a 100 foot giantess).

You heard her take in a deep breath and stretch, \"hmmm, what's this?\" She asked as she easily picked up your boat and brought you to her face.

I'm sorry what was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alex... Alex Feralclaw,\" you said with a bow, much to her amusement. She began to walk to the docks with you still in her hand. She rose more and more out the water as she approached the docks, by the time she got there only her feet were still submerged under the water. She gently set your boat down on to the docks and said, \"alright Alex, go get those harpoon's for me and I'll snap them in half.\" You did as she said, it was the dead of night so you didn't have to worry about people seeing Mersila or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One by one you assembled the enchanted harpoon's and brought them back to Mersila who snapped them like twigs.

You held your breath as water rushed by you. About a minute later she surfaced again, but this time instead of sky you saw a cavern lit by glowing moss. \"Isn't it great, I think there's a hole somewhere to let in air from the surface so you can stay here as long as you like,\" she said as she set you down on the ground. You looked around in amazement at the beautiful spacious cavern that Mersila called home. The floor was covered in sand from the beach that she must have brought here herself. The water Mersila was swimming in looked like a small pond on the edge of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Mersila said as she got out of the water and stood tall in the cave. Her head was about 50 feet from touching the roof of the cave. You were now able get a good look at her body in the light of the glowing fungus. Her body was physically fit, she had shark like fins on her arms and legs and her green hair looked almost like seaweed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" You asked her.</span></div></div>",

The sand castle was about 40 square feet with no roof and a single archway pointing towards the water. There was a ramp to let you go up and walk on the walls if you wanted, but other than that it was surprisingly barren. As if reading your mind Mersila said, \"I know it's not much to look at, but I have big fingers so if you want more you'll have to add it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mersila, it's pretty much perfect, I just need a place to store my thing's,\" you said as you approached on of the walls and started to carefully carve out a small space.
