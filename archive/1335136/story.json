He had been staying with Bulma and her family while waiting for the Dragonballs to reactivate, and it was kind of boring. At the moment, it was even worse, because there was no food in the house, and Goku was incredibly hungry. Bulma and her mother were currently out of the house shopping for food, and Bulma's father was currently working on some new capsule. Needless to say, Goku was more or less alone. Sighing, Goku continued wandering throughout the house, looking everywhere he could for something to eat. \"Where's the food?\" he mumbled to himself. Eventually, he came across a big white box. Goku stared at it before recognizing it as the same thing that had been in Roshi's home. Laughing, he pulled the door open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to see that there was no food in there. Hanging his head in disappointment, Goku continued on. He was about to leave the kitchen when he suddenly noticed something on top of the kitchen table. Puzzled, he stood on his toes and grabbed it, realizing it was a capsule. Curious, he threw it down on the ground, jumping back momentarily at the large puff of smoke. When the smoke cleared, he saw a box that was similar in shape and build to the food box, but pink-colored an smaller. Curious but excited, Goku opened the door. To his delight, the box was filled to the brim with all kinds of food. Giggling with delight. Goku immediately dug in. The food was among the most delicious he had ever tasted, and therefore barely noticed a few things that were happening to him. His stomach began expanding, and his sash began to stretch and tear. Hearing it, Goku hastily undid his sash, his belly peeking out the tiniest amount as he did so. As he continued to eat, his pants got even tighter, so he mindlessly reached down and unzipped his pants. As soon as he did so, more of his belly poked itself out from under his shirt. Ignoring this, he continued eating from the box, which seemed to endlessly be replenishing itself. Oddly enough, the only part of his body that seemed to be growing was his stomach; all the other parts of his body remained their original size. His shirt steadily began riding up, eventually resting a couple of inches above his belly button. Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

What was more, the contents of the box seemed to have followed suit, at least in a way; cakes, ice cream, meat, pies, fruit, fish, and countless other kinds of enticing and delicious food had seemingly appeared out of nowhere, adding to shelves that had, minutes before, already been completely occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Goku ran his eyes over all of this, his still-open mouth twisted upwards into a smile. He'd never seen so much food in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't waste any time; he sprang at the box, grabbing onto the topmost shelf with one hand. Using the other, he began shoveling delicacies into his mouth. After a few seconds of this, Goku found, to his delight, that he could actually clamber up onto the shelves, once he had sufficiently cleared the perch of foodstuffs. Sitting in this position, his arms began grabbing at anything within reach. Fish, entire chickens, even a container of gravy...nothing was spared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the top shelf was cleared, Goku clambered down onto the next shelf, where he repeated the process. Then the next shelf, and the next... soon, the entire food storage unit looked as though a pack of hyenas had been through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, Goku cleared the last shelf and  slid to the ground. Moaning due to the incredibly stuffed feeling he was experiencing, he slumped down, sliding until only his upper back was against the now-empty box. He placed both his hands on his belly, massaging it gently. The boy's stomach had extended several inches outwards, looking for all the world like a fleshy orb. His shirt had ridden completely up to his chest, and his pants became stretched, despite being completely undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, though, Goku couldn't be happier. \"That was so yummy...\" he murmured dreamily, grabbing his engorged gut and giving it a shake. He giggled; that was a funny feeling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku spent a few minutes playing with his belly, expressing no end of amusement with the bloated protrusion, before he finally decided to stop. Grunting with effort, he got to his feet, he large, exposed belly throwing off his balance a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku waddled away from the box, arms out at his side to keep his balance. Though he had a fair amount of difficulty making his way about without falling, he didn't mind; after all, that was the best meal he'd ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of waddling about, Goku...</span></div></div>",

He felt pretty weird this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku yawned and raised his arms, which felt heavier. A lot heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down at his legs, but instead of seeing them, he saw his large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Goku mumbled as he touched it, feeling the softness of it. Then he felt his face, and extra skin that shouldn't have been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku sat up shakily, panting as he did so, as he had been weakened by this gain, and he ran to the washroom to look at himself in the mirror. Well, he wasn't really running. More of a fast waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Goku finally made it to the washroom, he was sweating profusely from his face, and panting heavily. He then looked at Bulma's full body mirror to see his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's face had been quite chubby before, but this was overkill. A large amount of soft fat had been added to his cheeks and under his chin, making him unable to see his neck, like it was a large circle attached to a round body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved down his body, he saw his arms, their fat pressed against his sides, squishing outwards, and his hands looked like mini-sausages attached to large buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to his large middle, he saw how destroyed his uniform now was. The belt seemed to have been ripped off by the sheer pressure of Goku's weight, tearing his Gi in two, revealing his man boobs and large blob that hung over his waist area, that blob having covered his developing chest and stomach muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his legs. Some of their fat poked out through holes in his destroyed Gi, showing off his fat pale skin, which jiggled everytime Goku moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need new clothes,\" Goku mumbled as he felt his stomach, \"Maybe I can ask Bulma for some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~When He Found Bulma~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bulma!\" Goku called, waddling quickly over to Bulma, panting, \"Do you have any clothes that would fit me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey... Goku...\" Bulma mumbled as she looked at the obese Saiyan boy, who had once had lean figure, \"I think I could find somebody to make you new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a bunch!\" Goku laughed, his second chin jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Goku,\" Bulma chuckled as she left her room to go to the local tailor, \"I just need you to come with me for this, as he needs to figure out your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" and with that, the two left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're growing so fast Gohan! In fact, I think we should go to Satan City this weekend for some new clothes. After all, I can't keep sewing them back together now can I?\" said Son Chi-Chi to her son Gohan who was currently in nothing but white briefs and a too small T-shirt. Currently, Chi-Chi and Gohan were having a conversation while she mended his shorts, which had torn earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was finishing her task, Gohan started to think on his growth. Normally, Gohan was used to growing, but not like this. For instead of gaining muscle, he was now gaining some very unwanted fat. When this had started two weeks ago, they had been visiting Bulma and her husband Vegeta, who had been the one to give him an explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a Saiyan reaches puberty, they start to store fat for one year in response to the major growth spurt and power increase at the end. This of course meant that they would need a lot of excess energy, about 25 to 200 pounds of fat, with age having no factor. They could be 12, like Goku was while was going through his phase, and gained only 20 pounds, or like Gohan, who although he was only a year older than Goku was at age 13, was already past 15 pounds and was showing no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't believe this.' thought Gohan, 'It feels wrong having all this fat. I'm starting to feel so powerless and weak.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd poor Gohan was starting to look the part too. His once handsome and chiseled face was starting to round out to the point of resembling his cherubic features of seven. His well toned abs were covered in a thick layer of flab which poked out of his shirt and hung slightly over his briefs. His arms, which once had the strength to lift a hundred thousand boulders easily, were becoming soft and jiggly. And legs that could run around the globe in a minute were plump and were quickly losing their tan, becoming more pale then he had seen in a while. Also, his bottom, which used to be what most girls would consider a finely made sculpture, was transforming into a quivering mass with dimples that shook a little bit if you looked closely enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on top of his jock-gone-to-fat physique, the half-sayian's power had diminished to the point where he couldn't turn super sayian 2 and could only hold super sayian for a short while. The reason behind his power drain was due to the fact that his body was turning most of his power into more fat. By the end of his growth, he would only be as strong as Krillin, which was quite weak for him considering who his father was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But right now, let's me cook dinner. We can discuss you're new clothes later. Now go get Goten for me outside and I'll make your favorite dishes.\" heard a startled Gohan as Chi-Chi gave him back his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And try not to tear your shorts again soon. We still have to make them last two more days.\" said his mother as she was exiting his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom, be right back.\" he said after regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nFlying out of his bedroom window, Gohan quickly found his brother and took him home. After eating an enormous dinner, (which he know would show up again later somewhere on his body) he dressed in his pajamas and started to sleep when Goten came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gohan, can I sleep here tonight? There's a weird noise coming outside and I'm scared,\" said a frightened Goten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan, who knew that it was just the tree scratching against the window since Goten's room used to be his own, was too tired to turn away Goten and let climb into his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Goten, climb in,\" said a yawning Gohan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Gohan,\" replied his grateful brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Goten climbed into his bed, he realized that it was more cramped than expected and as he accidentally brushed his hand against Goten's belly, he found out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten was chubby. In fact, he wasn't chubby. He was just plain out FAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Goten was a sayian, it was not unexpected when he started to talk complete sentences at three. However, it was unusual to already be chubby this young, human or sayian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It can't be genetics, I am, or I was never fat nor was dad. And mom's pretty thin for her age. It could just be overeating. I mean, with all the food mom feeds him, it's no wonder that...he's...fat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course! Mom's always trying to making him eat more at every meal. And he always gives him snacks all the time. Plus, he's never gotten any formal training before. And if he only eats a fraction of what I eat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Goten, why don't you take off your shirt, it's kinda hot tonight,\" Gohan said suddenly as an thought, one that he hoped wasn't true, came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is kinda hot. And this shirt is starting to feel tight. Okay Gohan!\" replied an eager Goten as he stripped off his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shirt came off, Gohan's fears were confirmed and he recoiled at the thought of what it meant for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten's little body was not a pretty sight. His stomach was huge blob that hung over his pants and down towards his crotch. At his sides were a large bunch of rolls which made up his love handles. His chest was composed of two flabby sayian boy breasts that rested on his gut. His neck was virtually non-existent and his face was plump with round cheeks and a generous second chin. And his arms which should have started to show signs of muscle, was instead thick and look as if he wouldn't be able to cross them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he turned around, Gohan could also see how fat his back was. He also managed to see the top part of his butt stick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Gohan, I find so much better now! Good night!\" Goten said as he rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Goten,\" Gohan said absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If mom did that to Goten, then who knows what she's gonna do to me. She's obviously gonna try to fatten me up, especially since I've gained weight. And since I know I eat more than Goten...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, he slowly raised his hand to touch his new acquired belly, which he swore was growing bigger while his hand was on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm probably gonna be a lot bigger than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he raised his shirt and examined his belly, which made tiny ripple as it shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And mom's got the entire year. Oh Kami, I'm not just gonna be bigger, I'm gonna be HUGE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan thought about that a bit more, before he decide to plot on how to prevent his mother's plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love her and all, but I will NOT get any bigger than I have to!\" said a one very determined Gohan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to...</span></div></div>",

We are looking for new clothes for my son\", Chi-Chi said, looking at Gohan's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ashamed by his increased girth and the way the lady looked at him made him even feel more embarassed. His soft belly made his vest strain to keep closed and his well-rounded love handles poked out a bit. Goten looked at him and was impressed by the new features of his big brother. He had never noticed Gohan's weight gain, up till now. Gohan felt so uncomfortable that he moved his arms around his waist and grabbed his lovehandles to cover them up. This made him look even fatter, because his gut was sticking out from the bottom and was slightly hanging over his pants.<br>\r\n\"Ok, well I can see he's a bit chubbier than the average teen.....\" and she walked through the store to grab some shirts and jeans and returned, \".....so I think he will definitely fit those,\" she said and handed Chi-Chi one jeans and two T-shirts. \"I hope so, because this is our last chance today to find clothes for him that will fit,\" Chi-Chi whispered and gazed at Gohan.<br>\r\n\"Those are awesome and I think I will fit them. I would really like to try these on,\" Gohan said and walked to the changing room.<br>\r\nA few minutes later he came out of the changing room with the jeans on and a white tee. \"The jeans really suit you,\" the lady said and nodded at Chi-Chi. His slighty thicker thighs fit the XL-sized jeans, but the waistline seemed a bit too snug. But that was ok, because it made him look cute. His bellybutton was shining through his white tee as a dark hole, but it actually seemed to fit fairly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued within an hour.....
