I've never seen anything like it!\" Twilight Sparkle mumbled to herself as her eyes reached the bottom of the dusty, wrinkled page. The book she was currently reading from was very old, which was obvious from its many ripped pages and horribly stained cover. She had found it in the library's basement, and upon seeing that it was a spell book she decided to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can read its supposed to boost the users magic capabilities! That's amazing, oh the Princess will be so proud when she sees what I can do after this!\" Twilight squealed to herself, sounding very similar to a school yard filly. The lavender unicorn quickly went about setting up the spell, which only required a large open space. Since the library was absolutely cluttered in books, she decided that the basement would be a much better alternative. She hummed to herself as she skipped down the stairs, completely unaware that the title of the spell had faded long ago as did much of the description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stood in the middle of the mostly empty basement. It was very damp, and a bad stench hung in the air, but the unicorn pushed the thoughts away. She placed the book in the centre of the room and closed her eyes in concentration. The spell was definitely a hard one, but she was sure she could manage, she was the Princess's personal student after all. After a minute of silent concentration, a bright light flashed and her horn began to crackle with an intense magical energy. A few more seconds passed as the light grew brighter and brighter, very soon the magical energy reaching its climax. It exploded in a white light and Twilight was thrown across the room and into the basement wall. She slumped to the ground and sat there for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fluttered open and she looked around, she didn't feel any different. \"Did it work?\" She asked herself as she got to her hooves. Her body was unscathed and everything else in the room looked in order. \"Maybe if I try using some magic?\" She levitated a dozen books of the wall and looked at them with a frown. \"What gives?! That spell didn't do anything! Stupid book...\" She growled at it before leaving the basement and ascending the stairs. Little did she know, her stomach was already churning and going through a large amount of gastrointestinal distress.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight entered the main room of the library to find it just as she had left. \"Well after that disappointment I really could use some cheering up... Maybe I should go see what the others are doing?\" After a moment of thinking Twilight decides to go to... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Ponies were everywhere going about their daily business. Pushing through some of the larger crowds she started her way towards Carousel Boutique, which was just a short walk from the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Twilight pushed open the door to Carousel Boutique, the sound of bells echoing through the shop as she entered. The first floor was devoid of anypony so she headed up the stairs to the unicorns bedroom/ workshop. \"Rarity?\" Twilight asked, pushing open another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Rarity inside her bedroom working on a dress. Hearing her friend, she turned around and smiled. \"Twilight! How nice of you to visit! Could you please just wait one second while I finish this dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Rarity!\" Twilight quickly said before pacing over to her. \"Is this the last of that order you said you were working on?\" She asked as she looked the elegant dress up and down. It was made of red and blue silk, and all along it was embroidered with a variety of sparkling gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually! This is the very last dress so after this I'll be all done. Good thing to, I've been working non stop for days, I could use a break...\" Rarity sighed as she went back to her work. Twilight began pacing around the room and looking at the other dresses while she waited. Suddenly however, she felt a cramp in her stomach and she crouched over in pain. An ominous gurgling filled the air as she placed a hoof on her poor stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, to caught up in her work, didn't even notice her friends distress. Twilight let out a groan as she felt the cramp move down to her haunches, she then very quickly realized she was about to rip some serious flank. Her best plan of action was to bolt it to the bathroom, but just as soon as she moved the build up of gas was released in a spluttering, wet fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's head snapped up from her dress and turned around to look at her friend practically sprawled out on the floor. Twilight gave her a sheepish grin, her face a very dark shade of red. Before she could say something, Twilight quickly spoke up. \"I'm so sorry Rarity! It's just I feel so- ugh...\" Another cramp coursed through her body and she collapsed on the ground, flank high in the air. She clenched her eyes shut in pain as she ripped another fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity placed a hoof over her nose and frowned in disgust. \"Twilight! Please if your going to-\" She stopped herself after getting a whiff of the now tainted air and gagged. \"Augh, that is absolutely disgusting! Get out!\" She snapped at her friend as she pointed a hoof at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, still a beat red, quickly jumped to her hooves and galloped out of the bedroom. She stormed down the stairs and outside onto the street, releasing farts with every step she took.<i> Oh that was so embarrassing! I don't get it, why am I, </i> Twilight paused her thoughts a moment to let out another rank fart.  <i>farting so much? I didn't eat anything that would have upset my stomach...</i> She thought about it, then suddenly the answer hit her like a ton of bricks. <i>That spell! It must have given me all this gas! There must be a way to reverse it, I'm sure the book has a counter spell in it somewhere... Now I just need to get back to the library without anypony noticing this awful gas... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she notice something, she notice that the plants around her to wither away by her awful stench. Twilight gasped in horror, \"Oh my, this isn't good, if I don't get rid of this gas soon, the plants will be destroy.\" said Twilight as she was more worried. Twilight dashed to her library and went inside quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Twilight was in her library, she tries to find the book that she was using earlier. \"Come on, where is it.\" Twilight said as she dug throughout the books. Then she remembered that the book was in her basement. She went down to find it. Twilight found the book, it was on the floor were she last use it. \"Oh, good it still here.\" said Twilight. Twilight open the book and starts reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Spike was sleeping and woke up. \"Huh, what going on\" said Spike as he trying to get over his sleepiness. Spike went to the main living room and saw a large pile of books. \"Whoa, Twilight is properly doing some advance studying, I better leave her alone. I need my sleep.\" said Spike as he when back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was still reading the book. However, she couldn't find a proper cure. \"I don't understand, this book is not helping. It's useless.\" said Twilight as she threw the book in a trash can. \"What do I do, now. I don't want to be gassy forever.\" said Twilight as she accidently farted again. The stench filled the basement, Twilight started coughing and fanning the air as she couldn't take it. \"Ugh, It like the smell get stronger each time, I better do something now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tries getting help, but by who?  </span></div></div>",

Disappointed Twilight frowns and began to turn to take her leave, but just then the door opens. Twilight perks up and turns back towards the door only to be hit by an odorous fragrance that wafts out in her face which smells vaguely of rotted veggies, moist garbage, feces and soured milk all mixed up and turned into a personal nasty shake. And Twilight couldn't take it. She began teetering to the left and then to the right... And then down face first in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision blurs and in front of her she can see yellow hooves and hear a distorted voice say, \"Oh my...\" Before succumbing to unconsciousness. Her tail in the air flowing back down behind her rump.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight awakes in Fluttershy's cottage sprawled out upon her back on the couch. The lingering smell from earlier still burning away at her nostrils. She flinches and sits up hoofing away at her muzzle trying to get out that burning sensation, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What made this horrid smell! It's worse than my gas... Oohh... Speaking of which,\" Twilight had thought for a moment that her gas subsided, but nope. It was just biding its time. She sprawls out on her tummy and lets her flatulence boom forth. Her tail blowing and smacking against her back from the tremendous built up pressure. She slowly edges her rump up in the air letting the rest of her gas flow. She groans and sighs heavily as her cheeks jiggle and clap together the sound becoming deep and moist by the moment. Finally, a last few little toots squeak out like rubber toys. Satisfied with her relief she smiles, but grimaces as she slowly wafts her hoof in front of her muzzle, \"Better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, are you alright?\" Fluttershy stands with her head slightly tilted having seen Twilight let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine for the moment. I actually need your help. I have this horrible spell cast on me that won't stop making me fart. I was wondering if you could teach me how to hold in my gas while I'm around others,\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it would be better if she went to somepony else for help. No. She can't give up just yet. Her talent is magic. If she couldn't rid this spell's effects herself than that wouldn't make her very good at her talent. She must keep searching. Her stomach made a voracious grow as she reached out a hoof for another book. She quickly retracted it and held her stomach in pain. It's getting worse. Much worse. Just then, she bellowed out not one, not two, not even three, but four farts, consecutively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was very high pitched like a flute, and a little airy at the start. The second one was lower, though not by much, but had air towards the end rather than the start. The third one was brief, thankfully, but boisterous in noise, it might of been able to wake the dead. The fourth one was the nastiest of all, it was long, boisterous, and VERY wet. She could have sworn she may have just unintentionally made a mess on the library floor, but upon glancing behind her, she found that to not be the case. Phew. She wiped sweat from her brow. This gaseous problem of hers needs to be stopped. NOW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting and taking some time to rub her poor tummy, she stood and began searching through her books once more. Certain that the answer lies somewhere here in this library. She had to take a moment to fan vigorously at the air. The spell must have enhanced the stench of her farts. There's no way they would ever be this bad on their own. She sniffed. Is that... cauliflower? She doesn't remember eating anything with cauliflower in it. No matter. She was too engrossed in finding a counter spell to really care. Ugh, she thought as her stomach made more beastly roars.</span></div></div>",

One would have mistook it for a soup can, other then the fact it had no labels and there was a small sealed opening on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grin crossed Rainbow face as she stared at her friend with the same mischievous look she always got when they were about to prank somepony. \"Awesome! But who are we gonna get? It's gotta be somepony good, if its just some random pony it won't be that funny...\" The two mares stood quiet for a moment in deep thought, thinking just who would be the best choice to prank with their new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity!\" The two mares said simultaneously, both of them wearing mischievous grins as they looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One tea please!\" Rarity said to the mare behind the counter in front of her. She smiled back before grabbing a steaming cup from behind her and placing it in front of the white unicorn. She placed a few bits onto the counter before grabbing her cup and leaving the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nothing like a nice cup of tea to start off the afternoon...\" Rarity said to herself as she sat at one of the tables outside of the store. She sat silently, watching the many ponies go by on the street. She was interrupted however, when Pinkie popped out of seemingly nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Rarity! How's it going? Nice day we're having isn't it? I hope it doesn't rain later, cause then I'd have to stay inside away from my friends and then I'd be sad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white unicorn stared at her friend for a moment, wondering how best to respond to her seemingly endless rambling. \"Uh... right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Rarity, Rainbow Dash was hovering right behind her, the can of farting power held firmly in her hooves. Making sure that the unicorns back was completely turned, she unsealed the lid and poured some of it into her friend's still steaming tea. It quickly disappeared into the drink and Rainbow smiled as she held a hoof up towards Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie saw the signal then immedaitly cut of their conversation, \"Well it was great talking to you Rarity but I gotta go! I er, left the oven on back at the bakery! See you later!\" She said quickly before rushing down the street. Rarity merely shrugged and took a sip of her tea, not noticing the dark of fart powder. After a few minutes her tea was gone, and she looked at the time only to be severely shocked. She was late! Getting up from her table she galloped down the street and started towards...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They seems to be a large amount of crates as well. \"Hello, Applejack\" greeted Rarity. \"Oh, Howdy Rarity.\" said Applejack. \"How's the business going in the boutique.\" asked Applejack. \"Fine, Just made some glorious outfits this morning. You should try them on yourself. \"Thanks, but I think I pass.\" said Applejack. \"Suit yourself\" said Rarity. Then the two ponies started working. Applejack and Rarity started pushing the crate. The crate was moving slowly. Rarity used her magic and tries to lift the crate. But even her magic was giving her some difficulty. \"Ugh, how can you even do this.\" struggled Rarity. \"Dunno, practice.\" said Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 2 and half hours later. They were finished. \"Whoo, What a work out!\" said Applejack as she was fanning herself with her cowboy hat. She saw Rarity out of breathe and collapse on the floor. Applejack just chuckled \"Heh Heh, Don't worry partner. I know what will cool you of. Applejack came back with 2 full glasses of cool cider. They both drank the cider and decide to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were resting. Rarity felt a strange feeling on her stomach. She places a hoof on her stomach. Suddenly her stomach started growling loudly. Rarity tries to get up, but she accidentally farts loudly. Rarity blushes and tries to fan the smell away from Applejack. But it was too late. Applejack sniffed the air and glares at her friend. \"What is that smell?\" asked Applejack. \"What smell? I don't smell anything.\" said Rarity giving Applejack a sheepish grin. Suddenly, Rarity farted again. Applejack heard it and started laughing. Rarity blushes again. \"Stop it. It's not funny!\" said Rarity with completely humiliation. Applejack continue laughing and sniffed the air again. \"Phew!, Rarity. For a glamorous pony. You sure know how to make a big stink.\" said Applejack as she chuckled and fanning the air with her hat. \"Oh, it wasn't my fault, I don't even know why I so gassy.\" said Rarity. \"Okay, I'm sorry\" said Applejack. Rarity was glad she apologize. But then Applejack lifts her right hind leg, farts loudly, and resumes laughing. Rarity went back on being angry. \"Applejack, that was so disgusting!\" said Rarity as she covers her nose. Applejack kept on laughing. Rarity was never more humiliated than ever. She left the barn, sobbing, and went back to her home. \"Wait, Rarity come back.\" said Applejack. Applejack felt bad and decides to help her.       </span></div></div>",

What brings you here.\" said Sweetie. \"Is your sister here? I really got to talk to her.\" said Applejack. \"Sure, she's inside, but I think she feeling depress.\" said Sweetie. \"Depress?, really?\" said Applejack. Sweetie nodded yes. \"Well, I better check up on her.\" said Applejack. \"Okay\" said Sweetie. Applejack went inside the Carousel Boutique, she went upstair and finds a door that leads to Rarity's room. Applejack  knocks on the door lightly. There was no answer. Applejack tries turning the doorknob. But the door was locked. \"Rarity, I know your in there. Open up, I need to talk you.\" shouted Applejack. Then the door opened slightly, Applejack opened the door. She saw Rarity sitting on her bed with her head hung down. \"Rarity?\" said Applejack softly. \"What are you doing here?\" asked Rarity. \"I thought I would check I on you.\" said Applejack. \"For what?\" said Rarity bitterly. \"Because we are friends.\" said Applejack. \"You laughed at me.\" said Rarity. \"So, I was laughing with you, not at you.\" said Applejack. \"Really?\" said Rarity. \"Yeah, I mean everypony farts at least one time at their life time. Nothing to be ashamed of. Look Rarity, What I'm trying to say is that I'm sorry for my behavior yesterday. Can you forgive me?\" asked Applejack. Rarity thought about for a second and then smiled at her friend. \"Sure, apologize accepted.\" said Rarity. They gave each other a hug for a few seconds. Suddenly Sweetie Belle came in to the room. \"Hey, what did I miss.\" asked Sweetie Belle. Applejack and Rarity just chuckled. \"I don't know what this is about. But look Rarity I got your mail here. said Sweetie. \"Oh good, put it on the counter over there\" said Rarity. Sweetie Belle did so. \"Well, I'm glad your feeling much better.\" said Applejack. \"Not quite\" said Rarity. \"Say what now?\" said Applejack, a bit confuse. \"I still feel gassy.\" said Rarity as her stomach growled a bit. \"Well, that's easy. All you need to do is let it all out.\" said Applejack. \"Oh no, I can't. It's not ladylike.\" said Rarity. \"Well, how the hay are you going to get rid of your gas?\" said Applejack. Rarity tries to think, but her gas was getting her difficulty. Rarity was in pain as she tries to continue to hold in her gas. \"Come on Rarity, your poor stomach is suffering because you just won't fart.\" said Applejack. Sweetie Belle overhear the conversation. \"Eww, you have to break wind. But I heard you it's not healthy to hold in your gas.\" said Sweetie. \"See, even your sister agrees with me.\" said Applejack. Rarity then finally gives up. \"Okay, fine I would do it.\" said Rarity. Rarity prepares to fart and said \"Are you sure about this.\" said Rarity. \"Go ahead. Rarity we are prepare.\" said Applejack as she and Sweetie took cover. Rarity told a deep breathe and releases a loud and rumbling fart. An awful smell filled the room as Sweetie and Applejack were coughing. Rarity was shock and embarrassed at the loud sound that came from her rear. \"Oh my gosh, I didn't think it would come that loud.\" said Rarity. Sweetie and Applejack continue coughing and covered their noses to avoid breathing the near toxic gas. They dashed outside and gasped for air. \"I'm so sorry about that girls.\" said Rarity. \"It's alright, you didn't mean it.\" said Applejack. \"But I stink the entire Carousel Boutique.\" said Rarity. \"It's okay.\" said Applejack. \"You didn't mean it.\" said Sweetie. \"I just wish their could be a way to show how I could make it up.\" said Rarity.

Fluttershy sighed with relief following the minute of farts she'd blown onto Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     By now, Angel was unconscious, but Fluttershy would have none of that, and woke him up with a bucket of cold water.  \"That was just the tip of the iceburg.  I'd imagine you wish you took that last chance now.\"  Angel only has time to sob before Fluttershy's flank is resting on his face again, continuing to assault him with the worst odors to ever be spawned in Equestria.  Another 10 minutes pass, at which point Angel feels like being forced to share living quarters with her skunks would be heaven in comparison.  The farts show no sign of stopping, and Fluttershy has to momentarily stop due to an aching stomach.  \"They seem to be getting worse.  That's unfortunate for you, Angel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Through watering eyes, Angel swears that he could see a yellowish cloud permeating the room.  Fluttershy's flowers were starting to wilt, and the wallpaper was starting to peel.  \"I need to do something about this, I don't want to gas out anyone besides Angel, after all.\"  Fluttershy begins looking for a means to keep her fumes boxed around Angel, at which point...</span></div></div>",

He shook his head, knowing full aware of what would happen next, and braced himself. Fluttershy gave a disapproving shake of her head, \"I've tried asking you nicely, Angel. Why won't you just tell me what that leaf was?\" She readied her body with a heavy grunt. Angel missed his chance to get out of this one. Fluttershy unleashed a nasty big wet one, the hot gas protruding from her plot and filling the box to it's limit. Angel began to gag, and cough as he got to his feet and started hopping around the box trying to knock it over and escape. But Fluttershy proved to be too heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box wouldn't budge. Slowly, Angel began to lose consciousness and started wobbling about on his feet until he gave in and fell on his face. With his eyes half open and his breathing slowed, he raised a front paw to the air and brought it down. He couldn't go anymore. All of his oxygen had been deprived from him. Soon, he blacked out. His leg twitching. Fluttershy didn't realize he had already passed out cold. She had been too busy concentrating and blasting out tons upon tons of huge juicy raunchy farts. They were getting wetter and wetter. Most of them had started sounded like hooves pressing deeply into mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hind leg raised up high, she let loose one last massive bubbly fart by thrusting her hind leg back down, squeezing it out with pure force. This caused the box she sat on to finally give out to her weight and collapse, causing her to fall plot first onto Angel's back, making a small audible crack. If Angel hadn't been out cold, he would have cried in pain. One thing is for sure. When he finally wakes up, it will mostly likely be with a high pitched whine. Fluttershy stood on all four, and turned back to look at Angel. She never meant for it to lead to this. If only he had told her what that leaf was.</span></div></div>",

He was forced to have to smell it full on. He closed his eyes, tears beginning to run down his cheeks, both from sadness due to his situation, and from the stench itself. Fluttershy continued her explanation to Rarity, who was now wafting a hoof in front of her from the fart that had just recently protruded from Fluttershy, \"Angel thought it would be fun if he played a prank on me.

Something less extreme and not so... boorish. \"Fluttershy, if I may make a suggestion. Why not some other means to get him to tell you what the leaf was? This is highly unhygienic,\" Rarity said. \"Oh, but I tried asking nicely. He just wouldn't listen to reason,\" Fluttershy said. \"Why not go ask Zecora.

Where is it? But why would they bring a cake? It's not my birthday! Or is it? Did I forget it again? I --\" Pinkie's excited speculation was interrupted when she noticed Mr. Cake pointing at a nearby table. She followed his hoof and her jaw dropped when she saw the most delicious looking chocolate cake she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie ravenously devoured the entire cake in mere seconds. While the cake was delicious, she noticed something peculiar about the taste. It had a vague flavor of something she had eaten before, but she couldn't quite place what it was. She quickly gave up attempting to place what it was when a customer came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to Sugarcube Corner!\" Pinkie Pie exclaimed, licking some frosting on the corner of her mouth. \"What can I get you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a dozen cupcakes and a --\" the stallion began<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's eyes widened as her stomach gurgled. She figured out what the taste was. She recalled a time Rainbow Dash slipped some farting powder into her milkshake once when she wasn't looking. She remembered how loud, long, and frequent her farts were <i>then</i> and she could she ate a lot more of it this time around. While she and Rainbow found it hilarious, she was aware that many other ponies didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get all that?\" the stallion asked, noticing the blank stare on Pinkie's face. She hadn't paid attention to his order. She was too busy focusing on holding in the painful amount of gas that had quickly developed in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. and Mrs. Cake, can I have the rest of the day off?\" Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Mr. Cake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain,\" Pinkie gulped. She felt like she was about to explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are starting to act a little strange,\" Mrs. Cake observed. \"And you haven't used a sick day in months, so I don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Pinkie exclaimed as she raced for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried to Rainbow Dash's, uncharacteristically stopping to chat with nopony else along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow!\" Pinkie called up to her fellow prankster, \"Rainbow Dash!

Pinkie pointed her rear at Rainbow and finally let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash stared at Pinkie's rump in astonishment. This was the loudest she had ever heard Pinkie - or anypony, for that matter - fart! A broad grin had spread across Rainbow's face that widened the longer it lasted, but she was too transfixed by the fart to manage a laugh. Pinkie breathed a heavy sigh of relief and giggled a little before turning back around to face her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the cake!\" Pinkie grinned. \"You used so much farting powder I'm probably gonna be having good ones like that all week!\" She giggled.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow opened her mouth to say something, but was soon interrupted by the deep, loud sound of Pinkie's behind. As the fart increased in length, Pinkie's facial expression changed several times. She started off smirking, but this slowly transformed into a very amused and very proud grin. Eventually, however, the sheer relief she achieved from this fart quickly made itself known, as she closed her eyes and opened her mouth slightly. Once it was over, she laughed profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow had also made numerous facial expressions during this fart. She started off laughing, but after several seconds her giggling came to a halt. After several seconds, her mouth fell open as well. Even though she had witnessed what farting powder does to her friend (who is already gassy to begin with), she wasn't expecting a fart this long! She was shocked and impressed. After shaking her head in disbelief, she returned to laughing with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, that was awesome!\" Rainbow exclaimed. \"I mean, how do you --\" Pinkie raised a hoof to gesture her friend to be quiet. Rainbow quickly complied and a series of shorter farts exploded from Pinkie's behind. Rainbow quickly laughed and tried to count how many farts Pinkie had ripped in succession, but after the tenth, they had become so close in succession it was difficult to tell where one ended and one began. It was certainly safe to say, however, that in this brief span of time, Pinkie had farted more times than most ponies do in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie both fell on their backs, both with tears in their eyes from laughter. When their guffaw came to a halt, Pinkie declared, \"I have <i>got</i> to find out who left me that cake!

She could tell it was going to be huge. <b>PPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT!</b> a lengthy fart slowly - and quite noisily - made its way out of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash began laughing wildly. Being a tomboy, she always found farts hilarious - especially her own! This was one of those days where she had eaten nothing but food that she knew would give her more gas than usual. On these days, she skipped her afternoon nap and instead preferred entertaining herself in that time by listening to her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA APPPPPPPP!</b> An even louder, longer fart shortly followed. It was much deeper in pitch and, to Rainbow's surprise, didn't even seem to smell. She giggled to herself. That one had to have been a record-breaker for her! Her stomach was still rumbling quite violently, churning with gas. Not that Rainbow minded, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted a hind leg, getting ready to let another one rip, but then thought for a second: why not fly somewhere where people can hear her farts? As amusing as she already found them, she always preferred doing it near others. Partly because Rainbow always loved getting recognition for what she's good at but mostly because she always found people's reactions make her farts that much funnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's belly roared as she soared off, contemplating where to go. On one hoof, she always loved farting near Pinkie Pie because she not only laughed with her but she would often fart as well, which Rainbow liked. The two of them also frequently got into farting contests, which Rainbow always won and she loves winning! On the other hoof, Twilight Sparkle was always fun to prank because she was such an easy target. She hadn't even heard of \"pull my hoof\" and Rainbow always had it in the back of her mind to show her what it was someday. Of course, Rarity's obsession with all things ladylike lends itself to some of the most amusing annoyed reactions Rainbow had ever seen. She couldn't tell how much longer she could hold this next one in; she had to make her mind up and soon! Where did she go?</span></div></div>",

Her stomach loudly gurgled. Pinkie Pie smiled at her, which wasn't unusual considering how Pinkie Pie smiled more often than not. However, this smile had a certain slyness to it that seemed to suggest she heard the gas building up in her friend's belly. Rainbow Dash was tempted to just let it all out right then and there, but the last time she did, the Cakes threatened to ban her from the store for grossing out so many customers, especially after she encouraged Pinkie to join in, who promptly started farting in random ponies' faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, outside! I love outside! Let's go outside!\" Pinkie Pie yammered on in her signature style. \"Hey Mr. and Mrs. Cake! I'm going outside!\" Pinkie Pie called. She continued ranting, using the word \"outside\" more times than Rainbow Dash could bother counting before the two made it out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the streets of Ponyville were rather empty around this time. Most ponies were either at school or work. The two didn't bother walking that far away from Sugarcube Corner before Rainbow Dash's belly started roaring yet again. \"Sounds like you've got a good one brewing in there, Dashie!\" Pinkie Pie merrily remarked as she followed closely behind Rainbow Dash. Before Rainbow Dash knew it, she felt something brush up against her butt. Rainbow glanced behind her and saw Pinkie Pie's face with an eager expression on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself back there?\" Rainbow teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will once you give me something <i>to</i> enjoy, silly!\" Pinkie retorted. Ever since their first farting contest, Rainbow Dash noticed Pinkie Pie seems to oddly enjoy receiving farts in her face, sometimes even deliberately getting in positions in which she's staring down Rainbow's business end. Rainbow Dash didn't mind this habit, as she thought it was kind of funny, but she couldn't comprehend why someone would want to smell her farts like that. She just shrugged it off, though. Trying to figure out Pinkie Pie is a lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want <i>this</i> Sonic Rainboom in your face, be my guest,\" Rainbow Dash joked, \"but don't say I didn't warn you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, an explosion came from Rainbow Dash's behind. Her fart was so loud that it blew Pinkie Pie's hair back, making it even frizzier than it normally is. It was also incredibly long. Rainbow Dash regretted not timing it. She was sure this one was the longest one she'd ever heard. There were several instances throughout the fart when the gas coming out seemed to slow down and begin sputtering, only to pick up again and start coming back full force, even louder than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Pinkie Pie laughed uncontrollably throughout the entire fart's duration and for several seconds after it. Rainbow Dash let out a huge sigh of relief. The fart took so much out of her she had to sigh again before she joined Pinkie in their fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, did I ever tell you you're the funniest pony I know?\" Pinkie Pie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only every time I do that,\" Rainbow Dash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Pinkie Pie mused, seeming to have forgotten these numerous occasions. \"Anyway, I guess that makes it my turn! Mine won't be as good as that, but...\" Pinkie turned around. Unlike Pinkie, Rainbow Dash backed away from her friend's butt. She found the sound quite amusing but was never comfortable enough with the smell to have one right in her face like that. Pinkie's fart wasn't anywhere near as loud or as long as Rainbow Dash's, but it was still significantly noisier and lengthier than most farts Rainbow Dash had heard, including some of her own. The two burst into a fit of laughter and took turns farting before they inevitably ran out of gas. The two began walking back toward Sugarcube Corner as Pinkie was getting ready to get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, wouldn't it be great if we never ran out of gas?\" Pinkie mused as they walked together. \"Of course, I guess that'd be like magic or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!\" Rainbow Dash exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everyone say that?\" Pinkie asked, sounding vexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I think of it before? I bet there's some spellbook somewhere that has a spell for that sort of thing. We could get Twilight to cast it on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then maybe she can cast it on herself, Applejack, Rarity and Fluttershy and we can have a six way farting contest going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Rainbow Dash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one problem... how in Equestria could we convince Twilight to cast something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me some time to think,\" Rainbow Dash answered, \"I'll think of something by the time you get off work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okey dokey lokey,\" Pinkie Pie replied in a singsong tone as she nonchalantly hopped back into Sugarcube Corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash flew back to the cloud she normally naps on. She thought for a while. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rainbow Dash moved her cloud directly above the Ponyville library, waiting for it to empty. After Spike and Twilight left, Rainbow Dash was delighted to notice they left the door unlocked. She entered the library and directly high tailed it to the magic section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read the titles on most of the books, noticing several with obscure subject matter such as <i>Magical Alternatives to Juggling</i> or <i>The Unicorn's Guide to Checkers: It's Only Cheating If You Get Caught</i>. \"If they have entire books about stuff like that, somepony somewhere has to have written a fart spell,\" Rainbow thought. Towards the bottom of the shelf, she noticed a yellow book with a dusty spine. Blowing the dust away, she noticed the bold red font on the spine that read <i><b><span class=\"clred\">50 MAGICAL PRANKS</span></b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash got a good feeling about the book. Glancing at the table of contents, she saw a lot of classic practical jokes with a magical twist, including ones similar to the ones she pulled with Pinkie, such as making regular ink temporarily disappear. She smiled as she read the list of pranks in the book. Unfortunately, however, it didn't seem to have anything related to farts. Then she noticed the table of contents was continued on the next page. She flipped the page and right at the very end, she was grinning widely when she read \"<b>Magical Flatulence: Why Settle For A Whoopee Cushion?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash did not hesitate for a second. She quickly turned to the page as fast as she could and read on. From the description, the spell could make its target even gassier than Rainbow Dash imagined. The author included a story in which it caused one pony who hadn't eaten anything out of the ordinary to experience its effects for several consecutive hours, producing extraordinary farts every other minute! \"That settles it. Twilight is casting this spell on me and Pinkie!\" Rainbow Dash thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight would never cast something like that. I'd have to trick her into it somehow. Maybe if I replace the instructions to a spell she's trying to learn with the ones from this... or maybe if I -- \" her train of thought was interrupted when the door flew open and in walked Spike and Twilight with pastries from Sugarcube Corner. Rainbow Dash nervously gulped. If she saw the spellbook, she'd recognize the instructions so switching it wouldn't work. It was the only way Rainbow Dash could think to do it, however, so she quickly shut the book and put it back on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here?\" Twilight Sparkle called, slightly startled. Regaining her composure, she further queried, \"And what book is that? I can't imagine what you'd want to read in the magic section...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just... uh...\" came Rainbow Dash's nervous attempt at an explanation. But she couldn't think of one. Twilight started walking closer to the shelf. Rainbow Dash couldn't have Twilight seeing the book! \"Uh I was just leaving, I'll catch you later,\" she said, starting to fly. Rather than flying out the door, however, she deliberately flew into the shelf, sending it and all the books on it crashing to the floor with a heavy {b]THUD! \"Oops that wasn't the door! Clumsy me!\" She apologized in a nervous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle gave her a blank stare as she stood back up from the crash. \"How naive do you think I am?\" she flatly asked. \"Don't you think telling me the truth of what's going on would be a lot easier than sneaking in here, lying to my face, and then filling Pinkie Pie in on your harebrained scheme?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What did Pinkie Pie tell you?\" Rainbow Dash sighed, annoyed. How much did she blab?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just told me you two are planning something that involves me. She didn't go into the details, though. So, what, may I ask, warrants all this secrecy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I put this in a way you will understand?\" she thought aloud. \"Pinkie Pie and I have a certain... 'interest',\" Rainbow Dash began, standing up. Twilight Sparkle cast a spell to lift the bookshelf and began putting books back on the shelf. \"This interest of ours is something we think would be even better with magic. But we don't think you'd be into it at all. So I figured the only way we could get help from the best spellcaster in Equestria was to well... trick her into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed. \"Thank you for the compliment, but you being really vague. What is this interest and what makes you think I'd dislike it so much that I'd refuse to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow took a deep breath and uttered her one word answer. \"Farting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Twilight tilted her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie and I love farting,\" Rainbow Dash reiterated. \"We joke about it and have farting contests all the time. We figured that someone like you would think it's weird or gross so we didn't wanna just ask if you could cast a spell to make us <i>really</i> gassy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest. I don't understand why someone would think <i>that's</i> so fascinating, but I guess my interest in learning new magic and your interest in... <i>that</i> overlap here.\" Twilight answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this going where I think it's going?\" Rainbow Dash asked, picking up on the accommodating tone of Twilight's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I've learned about being a friend is not judging my friends for their interests,\" Twilight elaborated. \"I may think your interest in... <i>that</i> is weird but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things about me that you'd find weird, so who am I to judge?\" She paused, then summarized, \"If you two want me to cast that spell, I will. On one condition: just don't, ahem... do <i>that</i>... near me. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Rainbow Dash answered without thinking. \"Oh, I can't wait to tell Pinkie Pie! Thanks, Twilight, you don't know how much this means to both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash sped off, finishing her weather duties for the day as she flew a few celebratory laps around Ponyville. She landed again in front of Sugarcube Corner, where Pinkie Pie was leaving the store after her shift ended. Rainbow Dash filled Pinkie Pie in on her deal with Twilight Sparkle. Pinkie Pie was overjoyed, even by Pinkie standards. The duo rushed back to the library as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was reading the book at her desk when the two walked in. \"Oh, hey, girls, come on in, I think I just about have this spell down,\" she answered. \"You know this spell is simple yet it combines elements from other spells in rather creative ways that -- oh if only you understood magic you'd know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie stood side by side as Twilight Sparkle cast the spell on them. Soon after, Rainbow Dash felt like she was about to explode! \"Did it work?\" Twilight asked, seeing Rainbow wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... yeah! There's definitely a lot of gas in there, alright!\" she choked out, doing the best she could to hold it in to stay true to her deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Pinkie grunted, \"I never thought anypony could be this gassy, even with magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash contemplated their next move. She could either go back on her word and experience instant relief from the painful gas there or she could stay true to her word and let it build up even more while the two go somewhere else. Decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

After a pause, she further stated, \"No, really, if anyone asks what made you like... <i>that</i>, don't tell them it was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie started down the street, which was busy now that work and school were over. Pinkie Pie following incredibly close behind Rainbow Dash, her face mere inches away. Rainbow Dash even felt her face make contact with her rump a couple of times. Many of the ponies gave the two strange looks, but they kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going anyway, Dashie?\" Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna get somepony good. Somepony who won't expect it,\" Rainbow cryptically answered as she led the two further down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked down the road, Rainbow Dash felt Pinkie Pie extremely close to her butt the whole time. \"As much as I love farting, sometimes I think she likes it even more than me,\" Rainbow thought, knowing the reason why Pinkie Pie chose to walk so close behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led Pinkie Pie, who was being unusually quiet, down the street. On the way, Rainbow Dash carefully decided which of their friends would make the best first victim. When she finally made her mind up, she came to a stop outside of their friend's place. When she came to a stop, Pinkie Pie apparently wasn't paying attention and she wound up bumping into Rainbow's bottom, almost knocking loose the fart Rainbow Dash had been doing her best to hold in throughout their walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful back there! We're here,\" Rainbow Dash announced, gesturing with a hoof to the building they were outside. Pinkie Pie turned and noticed they were standing directly outside of...</span></div></div>",

If there was one thing that was causing her discomfort, it was the flatus incessantly bubbling in her belly. She knew Rarity would never wittingly tell them to fart, but this indirect cue was all that she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked toward Rarity, savoring the moment. After a few seconds, Rarity turned away from the dress she was working on and found herself facing Rainbow Dash's backside. Rainbow Dash took this opportunity to rip the biggest fart she could muster - which wasn't difficult in the slightest thanks to Twilight's spell. Her fart was so long that partway through it, Rarity had the time to cast a spell to turn Rainbow Dash around. Her croup wasn't free of faces for long, however; soon after Rarity had cast her spell, Pinkie Pie had taken her usual place in her behind, giggling at the seemingly impossible amount of gas Rainbow Dash had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted, Rarity was severely annoyed by this. All throughout the fart, she had made disgusted \"Ugh\" noises and desperately trying in vain to fan away the smell that now filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh,\" Rainbow Dash moaned after the insanely lengthy fart came to its end. She wanted to laugh, but the fart and the sigh of relief took all the wind out of her. She merely smiled contently to herself as she watched Pinkie Pie literally roll on the floor laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, Dashie, again!\" Pinkie Pie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't encourage her,\" Rarity irritably told Pinkie Pie. \"And you,\" she turned her attention to Rainbow Dash. \"How could you just... befoul my shop? My home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me to make myself comfortable,\" Rainbow Dash casually responded. \"How can I be comfortable when I'm holding that in me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I didn't mean --\" Rarity began to answer. But Rainbow Dash didn't listen. She was too busy unleashing another extraordinary fart. It was shorter than her previous one (although still quite long when compared to an ordinary fart) but what it lacked in its relative length, it more than made up for in volume. The thunderous fart caused a rumbling sensation in the room. Rarity shook her head and made another disapproving sigh as Pinkie Pie continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rainbow Dash's fart was over, Rarity's face was red with anger. \"If all you're going to do is pass wind, then get out!\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you haven't heard mine yet!\" Pinkie Pie protested, merrily skipping over to Rarity, then turning her back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>GET OUT!</b>\" Rarity repeated, enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey contemplated her order for a second. On one hoof, they found her reaction priceless, but on the other hoof, they didn't want to lose a friend over their fart jokes.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow just chuckled. \"Yeah I sure and plus its just gas, it will pass\" said Rainbow as she farted again. Pinkie Pie started gigging. \"Yeah, I sure your right\" said Rainbow. Then they went off to visited someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Rarity's Boutique, Rarity was trying to clean the air with an air fresher.

Then finally after spraying the air, Rarity sniffed the air. \"Ah, Much better\" said Rarity as she was relief to not to inhale anymore horrid odors. But then she soon realized that her Boutique wasn't yet odor free. She noticed that her latest design have been ruined by Rainbow Dash's stench. Rarity sniffed the designs and gag by smell. \"Oh, my perfect designs, they are ruin,\" said Rarity with sadness.

When the flatulent duo reached the farm, they saw Applejack working hard as usual. She was bucking apples from trees. Which gave Rainbow Dash an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Applejack!\" Rainbow called as she and Pinkie approached their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy you two,\" Applejack greeted in her southern drawl. \"I'm afraid I don't have much time for chitchat. Just look at all these apples I have to buck!\" Rainbow and Pinkie looked around. Most of the trees in the orchard were full of apples. \"It doesn't help that Big Mac's gone and hurt himself again,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can help you,\" Rainbow Dash announced. Just when Applejack started to thank her, Rainbow continued, \"but let's make this interesting.\" She walked over to a nearby tree teeming with ripe apples. \"Five bits says I can knock all the apples down from this tree without bucking it. Or flying up there and knocking the apples down. Or touching the tree or the apples at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack thought for a second, repeating Rainbow Dash's bet conditions under her breath to try to find some sneaky wording Rainbow could possibly exploit as a loophole. \"And Pinkie Pie? She won't do anything to the trees or apples either?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't. It will be 100% me,\" Rainbow Dash confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easiest five bits I ever made,\" Applejack said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Rainbow Dash began pushing with all her might, resulting in an especially loud fart that initially hurt a little on its way out. Rainbow ignored the awkward feeling in her backside and continued farting as loudly as she could. Though it was no easy feat to produce such a noisy one, even with the help of Twilight's magic, Rainbow Dash heard the sound of apples falling to the ground behind her and smiled when she realized she won the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and Pinkie laughed together, both at the fart itself and in surprise that Rainbow actually won the bet. Applejack, on the other hand, merely stared at the blue pegasus with her mouth and eyes wide open. Whether this facial expression was from disbelief, disgust, or amazement, however, Rainbow could not discern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone owes me five bits!\" Rainbow proudly exclaimed as she stopped giggling. As Applejack continued to look at her with a blank stare, Rainbow asked, \"Want anymore help? Me and Pinkie might as well do something constructive with all this gas.\" Pinkie hopped to a nearby tree and, like Rainbow Dash, farted as loudly as she possibly could, knocking apples to the ground. \"Good one, Pinkie!\" Rainbow chuckled. \"So, how about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack finally broke her silence to answer Rainbow's offer. </span></div></div>",

Along the road, Pinkie Pie still followed very closely behind Rainbow Dash. Rainbow farted in Pinkie Pie's face several times as they walked, much to the amusement of both. Some of the ponies they passed along the street got some laughs out of it as well; they hadn't heard anyone fart as long or as often as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a few feet from Fluttershy's abode when Rainbow Dash realized that Pinkie Pie <i>still</i> hadn't farted since the spell was cast on her. \"She must have a really good one built up!\" she thought. For the first time since they left Rarity's, Pinkie Pie glanced away from Rainbow's behind and saw where they were. She stopped in place. \"What? No, Rainbow Dash, no no no! I told you even our most harmless prank will upset Fluttershy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Pinkie Pie!\" Rainbow Dash urged, \"We don't have to do it in her face or anything.\" Pinkie Pie thought for a second, her hesitant expression looking only slightly more open to the idea. Rainbow Dash sighed as she thought of the perfect thing to convince her. She didn't want to say it but she knew it would be the only thing that would change her mind for sure. \"In fact...\" she gulped, almost stepping down from her offer. \"I came here to let you fart in <i>my</i> face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie's eyes widened as her face transfixed back into its usual smile. \"Really?\" she asked, beaming. Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes and nodded, trying to pretend it was the reason she had brought her there. \"Well why didn't you say so!? I'm so glad I've been saving this one up, then!\" Pinkie Pie then enthusiastically hopped the remaining distance to Fluttershy's door. She knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy opened the door. \"Oh, hello Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash. Is there something you want?\" she asked in her usual soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie opened her mouth to speak several times, but all she could do each time was laugh. \"Oh Rainbow Dash, I can't tell her!\" Pinkie Pie said while grinning, \"let's just show her already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Rainbow Dash said, reluctant, wondering why she even suggested this in the first place. She walked behind Pinkie Pie and sat down a few inches from her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little closer, Rainbow! I can't feel your face in there yet!\" Pinkie Pie playfully called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't be serious,\" Rainbow Dash thought. Rainbow Dash sighed and scooted as close as she physically could get to Pinkie Pie's rear, her face now making contact with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, pardon me, but what are you--?\" Fluttershy began while watching their unusual behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, pardon <i>me!</i>\" Pinkie Pie joked, forcing as much gas as she could out of her rump. It was as loud as - if not louder than - Rainbow Dash's room shaker at Carousel Boutique! Rainbow Dash felt her mane blowing from the wind, much like it does when she flies. The sheer noise the fart made was so amusing that even Rainbow Dash, who didn't want it in her face, couldn't help but laugh at it despite the foul stench making her want to gag. Pinkie Pie seemed determined to make this fart last as long as she could, as it's not every day she gets to fart on Rainbow Dash. When it was over, Rainbow Dash glanced at the clock and saw that over a full minute had passed since the fart began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie laughed so hard, she wound up farting again. Which made her laugh harder. Which made her fart again. This pattern kept up for a while, Rainbow Dash laughing with Pinkie after every fart. She certainly seemed to be enjoying Pinkie's farts in her face lot more than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time Fluttershy gave them a strange look. She didn't seem as grossed out as Rarity, but she certainly didn't seem to find it funny. She seemed more confused than anything. \"Um,\" Fluttershy meekly protested, \"my pets have such sensitive ears and noses I think they'd appreciate it if you stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okey dokey lokey!\" Pinkie Pie agreed, not wanting to put Fluttershy through more than she was comfortable with. \"Come on, Rainbow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash stood up. She coughed at the smell that was still strong in her nose and then wordlessly followed Pinkie Pie out of the cottage. The two began walking back toward Ponyville side by side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you farts are funnier when they're in your face, Dashie!\" Pinkie Pie winkingly said, referencing how much more Rainbow Dash had laughed at her farts than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do admit, they're louder when you're right next to the source and feeling my mane blow back like that was pretty funny!\" Rainbow smiled, reflecting on the fart from a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was hilarious for me too, Dashie!\" Pinkie Pie enthusiastically smiled. \"I'm usually on the receiving end of these things but it was so fun to unleash <i>my</i> party cannon in your face for once! We're going to have to let me do that to you more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I'm not sure if I liked getting the full force of the smell,\" Rainbow complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to it,\" Pinkie Pie assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so... by the way, Pinkie Pie, did you know that first fart lasted over a minute?\" Rainbow Dash said, still in shock at how long the fart lasted. \"And that was just that one fart, Celestia knows how long all those others were that kept coming out when we were both laughing our tails off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like with this spell I can finally give you some competition for once!\" Pinkie Pie bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't get used to it! I got a monster brewing in here!\" Rainbow Dash assured Pinkie. Pinkie Pie took her usual spot behind Rainbow Dash, but just before she could try to top Pinkie Pie's super long fart, she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" the voice of a certain familiar unicorn called. She stopped and turned to face the source of the voice. It was...</span></div></div>",

After a moment, her face lit up and she resumed eye contact. \"Oh, <i>that!</i> Come now, girls, do you think I'm so petty I'll let a little crude humor stand in the way of our friendship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye--\" Rainbow began but Pinkie, who was now standing by her side, hoofed her in the side to silence her before she could answer the rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I find your obsession with bodily functions childish and uncouth, but when I think about it, it's harmless. I just...\" Rarity tries to think of something. \"Just what!\" asked Rainbow, growing impatient. \"A surprise.\" said Rarity. \"I like surprises!\" Pinkie Pie merrily announced, jumping up and down excitedly. \"What are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and Pinkie followed Rarity down the street a little to Carousel Boutique. \"After you, girls,\" Rarity announced, opening the front door with a spell. As soon as she entered, she cast another spell to shut and lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly is this surprise?\" Rainbow asked, eying Rarity a little suspiciously when she heard the door lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't tell you, silly! Otherwise it wouldn't be a surprise, duh!\" Pinkie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand next to each other as close as possible,\" she instructed. The two did so to the point where they were physically touching. \"Now close your eyes,\" Rarity further instructed. Pinkie immediately did so, but Rainbow shot Rarity a distrusting glance. \"Close them, Rainbow Dash, otherwise neither of you get it.\" Rainbow sighed and did as she said. Even if she was planning at getting back at them, what was the worst that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a couple seconds of silence as they listened to Rarity move around a little. After what felt like an eternity, they heard it: an incredible fart. One that easily rivaled the ones they had been ripping since Twilight cast the spell on them. Rainbow's eyes shot open instantly, watching in disbelief as the usually prim and proper unicorn let this massive one loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fart reached its conclusion, Rarity explained the obvious, \"Twilight Sparkle told me all about that spell she cast on you. I asked her to cast it on me after I told her what you did. Now the two of you are stuck with me till this spell wears off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe farted in their faces yet again. This one was fairly short in relation to the ones Pinkie and Rainbow had heard from their own behinds, but it was very loud and filled the room with its smell. Rarity shot the two a very self-satisfied grin as she observed her friends' reactions.</span></div></div>",

Rarity gave Rainbow Dash a mischievous grin. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, girls. I thought you didn\u2019t mind passing gas.\u201d said Rarity. Rainbow Dash tries to get up, by using her strength and said. \u201cWe don\u2019t, but we didn\u2019t expect it to be so deadly smelling\u201d. \u201cWell, get used to it, because you are staying here until this dreaded spell wears off.\u201d said Rarity as she aims her flank at Rainbow and farts on her. Rainbow continues gagging as she tries to fan the smell with her hoof. \u201cNo way, we don\u2019t have to stay here. Right, Pinkie.\u201d said Rainbow to Pinkie Pie. But she discovers that Pinkie has already passed out by the strong smell. \u201cPinkie!\u201d said Rainbow with horror. \u201cOh dear, I didn\u2019t think my gas is that powerful.\u201d said Rarity, feeling slightly concern. Rainbow lifts the unconscious Pinkie as she heads to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rainbow Dash tries to open the door, she discovers it was locked. \u201cHey, Rarity the door is locked. Can you open it.\u201d said Rainbow. Rarity just stares at Rainbow Dash and laughs at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d asked Rainbow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think, I would leave you unpunished just because Pinkie is knocked out.\u201d said Rarity. \u201cCome on, Rarity. What is with you, you can\u2019t trapped us like this.\u201d said Rainbow. \u201cYes, I can.\u201d Said Rarity evilly, as she then levitated a small silver key with her magic. The key caught Rainbow\u2019s attention. \u201cHey, that must be the key to the front door.\u201d said Rainbow. Rarity puts the key behind her. \u201cWhatever do you mean, darling?\u201d said Rarity, pretending to not know. \u201cNice try, Rarity. Now give me that key.\u201d said Rainbow as she attempts to grab the key. But Rainbow ends up getting farted on by Rarity again. Rainbow started gagging again as her vision became blurry by Rarity\u2019s flatulence. Rarity then runs away, with the key still with her. Rainbow regains her sight and follows Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of chasing each other, Rainbow manages to trap Rarity in a dead end. \u201cHa Ha, gotcha now.\u201d taunted Rainbow. Rarity whimpered with fear as Rainbow gave her a satisfied grin. Then, when all of a sudden Rainbow Dash heard a slight chuckle from Rarity. \u201cYou just won\u2019t give up.\u201d said Rarity. \u201cHuh?\u201d said Rainbow, confused. \u201cThe reason why I\u2019m doing this is because you and Pinkie befouled my home and also many of my latest designs\u201d said Rarity. Rainbow gave Rarity a sheepish grin. \u201cHeh Heh, sorry.\u201d said Rainbow. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you apologize. But you are still punish for doing it any way.\u201d said Rarity. \u201cCome on, Rarity. Can\u2019t you just let this one slide.\u201d pled Rainbow. \u201cNope, my mind is made up.\u201d Rainbow growled with frustration. \u201cSo might as well make yourself comfortable, and I also hiding this key in a safe place as well.\u201d said Rarity as she galloped away. Rainbow follows her and said \u201cGo ahead, I would find it eventually.\u201d When Rarity heard this she turned around and said \u201cWell, if you\u2019re going to be like that. Then I guess you lead me no choice.\u201d Then without hesitation, Rarity puts the key in her mouth and swallows it. Rainbow gasped with shock as the key went through Rarity\u2019s esophagus and into her stomach. \u201cNoo! What are you doing!\u201d shouted Rainbow as she tackled Rarity to the ground. \u201cSpit out the key, I mean it.\u201d Shouted Rainbow with rage.  Rarity used her magic to make Rainbow get off her. \u201cStop it, There will not be any rough housing in my boutique.\" said Rarity. \u201cAre you insane, you just swallowed the key.\u201d Shouted Rainbow. \u201cYes, I did\u201d said Rarity, calmly. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Rainbow. \u201cCalm down, darling. At least it now in a safe place.\u201d Said Rarity as she giggled and rubbed her stomach. \u201cWait, what do we do now?\u201d asked Rainbow. \u201cWell, my suggestion would be to wait and let nature takes it course.\u201d Said Rarity. \u201cVery funny.\u201d Said Rainbow, not amused. \u201cWell, it might take a while. So let\u2019s make the best of it.\u201d Said Rarity as she walked away. Rainbow then had a sly look in her face and decides to strike. \u201cNot if I have anything to do about.\u201d Said Rainbow as she was about to tackled Rarity again. But Rarity stopped her as she once again farts on her face. Rainbow collapses to the ground, defeated. Rarity just chuckled and said \u201cPlease, don\u2019t try me. As long as the spell is still effect and the key is in my stomach, you are going to be here for a long time. Sorry about that.\u201d Rarity then walks away, with Rainbow Dash on the floor being unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without hesitation, Rainbow flew up toward to the window and tries to open. However, the window seems to be trigger with an alarm. As Rainbow opened the window, a loud siren noise was heard.

Rarity cast a spell to turn Pinkie around so the fart was now in Rainbow's face. Stifling a laugh, Rainbow physically turned Pinkie back around. Rarity and Rainbow continued trying to force Pinkie's behind in the other's face like this throughout the entire fart, until it eventually ended in Rainbow's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir constant spinning of Pinkie Pie caused the fart to distribute around the room quite rapidly. It had mixed with Rainbow Dash's previous farts, resulting in a very potent smell. Rarity gagged while the flatulent ponies laughed at both their farts and at Rarity's reaction. Rainbow Dash whispered something that made Pinkie laugh and Rarity uncomfortable, as she could tell it was something related to their gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and Pinkie both approached Rarity, who was now regretting standing so close to the corner of the room.

Rarity had been gagging too hard to focus on casting the spell she had used before.

Anyway, time for plan B.\" Rainbow flew through the Everfree Forest and stepped inside Zecora's hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecora, Twilight sent me because she has this problem that's too embarrassing for her to go out.\" Rainbow lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight Sparkle is feeling bad?

She was hoping you'd know what it was and if there's anything that can settle her stomach,\" Rainbow said, finishing her fib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard of this red fruit.

She gathered all she could carry and flew back to her cloud. She squeezed in a short nap and had a dream about ripping the longest fart of her life in Twilight's face. She was a little disappointed when she awoke to find out it was a dream, but was still amused at the thought and prepared to make it a reality. She eyed the berries near her, tempted to eat every last one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could give into the temptation, Pinkie came merrily skipping along. \"Rainbow Da-ash!\" she called in her typical sing-song voice, \"did Twilight know that spell we wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Rainbow answered, flying down from her cloud and standing next to her friend while carrying a small hoofful of the berries, \"but I found out about these berries that are supposed to make us super gassy.

Ready to eat some?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie thought for a moment. \"You know what I think would be fun?\" she smiled, \"Getting the others in on this!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know where they grow,\" Pinkie chimed in a singsong tone that emphasized the rhyme. \"We can get more than enough to whip up a batch big enough for all six of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how am I gonna carry them all?\" Rainbow wondered aloud. \"It wasn't exactly easy carrying the few I've already got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me,\" Pinkie insisted. \"Wait here a sec.\" Pinkie skipped along the dirt road to Sweet Apple Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pinkie was out of sight, Rainbow looked at their current collection of gasberries. \"If I'm gonna be getting more of these things, I'd better make sure they actually work,\" she pondered. She ate one, not knowing what to expect. The sweet, somewhat sour taste reminded Rainbow of raspberries. \"Hey, these aren't too bad,\" Rainbow thought, shoving another into her mouth. Then another. Before she knew it, the berries in her hooves were gone. She flew back to her cloud and gobbled down the rest of the berries, licking the juice from her lips. \"Those were delicious!\" she thought, landing back on the ground. \"Although, I don't really feel any different. Maybe Zecora lied. Or maybe I just got the wrong berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie walked back into view, this time with an empty bushel on her back. \"Here you go, Rainbow,\" Pinkie said, again, singing the rhyming phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow sighed, ready to update Pinkie on her lack of gas. \"Listen, Pinkie, I --\" she began. But she was interrupted by a very loud gurgle from her belly. Rainbow Dash moaned in discomfort. She had so much gas she was in pain! Pinkie dropped the bushel and rushed behind Rainbow Dash as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's fart was extraordinary in all regards. After already going on for several seconds, she heard Pinkie deeply sniffing the gas between fits of giggles. \"Keep going, Dashie!\" Pinkie cheered, \"This one's a real stinker!\" Rainbow never understood why Pinkie found the smell so funny, but these kinds of remarks would always make her smile mid-fart. It especially made her smile knowing they were going to be extra smelly for Twilight when she'd make good on her promise! Toward the end of the fart, it began to sound much deeper and louder, prompting Pinkie to laugh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this sprawling burst of gas came to an end, Rainbow wanted to laugh, but she couldn't. She was too busy sighing in relief and catching her breath. She finally caught a whiff of the smell and Pinkie certainly wasn't lying. She proudly grinned. She didn't like the smell of other ponies' farts, but she could definitely appreciate her own! She finally started to laugh when she heard Pinkie still sniffing the air near her behind. Her laughter was short-lived, as she forced out a shorter, but still loud and foul fart when she heard Pinkie inhaling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be the best party ever!\" Pinkie enthusiastically giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow nodded in agreement while chuckling. She picked up the bushel and was ready to go to the Everfree forest. Before she took off, she smiled and said, \"Hey, Pinkie, check this out! Up up and away!\" After the 'away' she took flight. She farted the instant she took off and circled around Pinkie Pie a few times, encompassing her friend in a thick cloud of her gas. Pinkie fell to the ground laughing when this fart was over, but Rainbow fluttered closer to the ground, hovering with her butt just over Pinkie's face. Rainbow inhaled deeply, then all of a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>PPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhhh,\" Rainbow deeply sighed before joining Pinkie in a hearty guffaw. Still laughing, she flew back to the Everfree Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry back with those berries!\" Pinkie called between laughs, \"I wanna fart just like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backtracked to the bushes and began loading the bushel up with gasberries, occasionally stopping to fart. When it was half full, her competitive spirit started to rear its head, \"You know... if everypony's gonna be super gassy, I need to be super-mega-ultra-hyper gassy! One for them,\" she said dropping a gasberry in the bushel, \"one for me,\" she said popping another into her mouth. When the bushel was full, she ate a few more on the bush she had been picking and flew back to Ponyville, her belly roaring with gas now that the other gasberries were starting to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's window was open so rather than lugging the bushel of flatulent food up the stairs, she decided to just fly in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again, Rainbow Dash!\" Pinkie greeted, \"the party's gonna be at the library if that's alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect,\" Rainbow smiled while setting the bushel down, still looking forward to getting her revenge on Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, you didn't need to fill it, Dashie,\" Pinkie added, noticing how many gasberries she had picked, \"that's gonna be way more than enough. I guess we can eat the leftovers at the party,\" she thought aloud. \"So... meet us at the library in two hours,\" Pinkie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow flew back to her home and decided to take another nap before the party. When she awoke, she realized she nearly overslept and arrived at the library just when it started. A bowl of punch and a larger bowl of the leftover gasberries sat on a table in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about this party seems... unusual,\" Rarity declared. \"It's rather tame for a Pinkie Pie party,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Pinkie, where's the party cannon?\" Applejack half-joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got your 'party cannon' right here!\" Rainbow boasted with a wink as she entered the room. She flew next to Twilight, who was just about to be the first to take a sip of the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, <i>please</i> don't tell me you actually --\" Twilight Sparkle began. Before she could finish this sentence, however, Rainbow turned around and forced out yet another extremely powerful fart. Twilight cast a spell to teleport a few feet away, but Rainbow Dash followed her, still farting. Twilight tried teleporting away yet again, but made the mistake of teleporting next to Pinkie. Just when she was going to cast her spell again, Pinkie grabbed Twilight's horn and interrupted the spell. \"Pinkie, let go!\" Twilight begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Pinkie declined as her flatulent friend caught up again. Rainbow ended her current fart and again, put her rump in Twilight's face. Twilight struggled to break free from Pinkie's grasp, but the earth pony was too strong for her. The other three friends just looked at each other confused, unsure of what was going on and whether they should interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow released a torrent of short, gassy bursts until it caused Twilight to gag. Just when she heart Twilight was about to inhale, she lifted a hind leg and proudly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPP PPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRTTTTT!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis long, deep, growling fart caused a rumbling sensation throughout the entire room. Partway through, Pinkie began laughing so hard, she let go of Twilight's horn, allowing her to teleport away. She made up for this mistake by leaning into her friend's behind, Her revenge on Twilight may have been a little shorter than she would have liked, but at least she was still farting in somepony's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you'd want to be <i>away</i> from this, Twilight!\" Pinkie laughed as Rainbow's fart came to a halt. She inhaled the air deeply as Rainbow, again, was too out of breath to giggle, herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Rainbow Dash is just going to continue being rude, I think I can speak for the rest of us when I say this party is over!\" Rarity declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fluttershy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tried to say something but wound up coughing as soon as she opened her mouth; the smell was still lingering in her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't really a party without y'all,\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Pinkie exclaimed, finally stepping away from Rainbow's behind, \"You haven't even had any punch yet! It's a new recipe and I think you'll really like it!\" Pinkie said, trying to save the party. \"Plus I don't think Rainbow has anything left in her. Do you, Dashie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'm just getting st--\" Rainbow began. Pinkie tapped her with her hoof. \"I mean, yeah. Sorry about that, I guess I got a little carried away. But you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the party, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four ponies looked at each other trying to decide what to make of this.</span></div></div>",

Sure, I'm sure I speak for the rest of us when I say we wouldn't want her doing that in our faces, but if it's what Rainbow and Pinkie like to do when we're not around, more power to them. It's not like it hurts anypony or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's face lit up, when she saw her opportunity. \"Sounds like somepony learned about friendship!\" She smiled as she rushed to the punch bowel and poured six glasses of the gassy drink, surprisingly managing to carry all six at once. She gave all of her friends a glass and kept one for herself. \"To friendship!\" She exclaimed, raising her glass in a toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To friendship!\" Rainbow, Twilight, Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy chorused before drinking the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, this punch is simply divine!\" Rarity complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's delicious,\" Fluttershy nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Applejack concurred, \"you've really outdone yourself this time, Pinkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have this punch at every party,\" Twilight assented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>totally</i> should!\" Rainbow winked at Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Pinkie replied with a smile, \"there's plenty more if you want a refill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes and a couple more glasses of punch, the flatulent effects of the drink began to show. A look of discomfort spread across everypony's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, how much longer am I gonna have to hold this in?\" Rainbow whispered to Pinkie in the corner. She was still significantly gassier than all the other ponies, thanks to all the berries she had eaten earlier in addition to the punch. \"I feel like I'm about to explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait a bit,\" Pinkie whispered, pointing at Fluttershy, who was wincing in her struggle to hold in her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls... I'm not feeling so well,\" Fluttershy meekly panted, clearly uncomfortable. \"Maybe I should just--\" she began, but she was unable to contain it any longer. Fluttershy blushed at the loud noise that had come out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Fluttershy, I never knew ya had it in ya!\" Applejack joked. \"Try topping this one!\" Applejack raised a hind leg and unabashedly ripped a long, deep fart of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rarity asked, sounding disgusted, \"You want to turn <i>that</i> into a contest? How uncouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all clearly full of gas right now,\" Applejack stated, gesturing to all her friends who were clearly struggling to hold in their flatulence. \"We might as well try to make the best of it,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree,\" Rarity said, \"we need to find a remedy for this. This amount of... ugh, gas... is simply not natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" Applejack rolled her eyes. \"It's perfectly natural and the only way to get rid of it is to let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir argument raged on for a little longer until they finally asked the other girls what they should do. What do they decide?</span></div></div>",

She knocked on the door which was promptly opened by a small purple dragon. \"Oh, hey, Rainbow Dash, what's up?\" Spike answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash glanced past Spike to see whether or not Twilight was within hearing distance of their conversation. From the doorway, Rainbow Dash could see Twilight sitting at her favorite desk. It didn't look like she was within listening distance and she seemed too wrapped up in the book she was reading to pay attention to what was being said, but Rainbow Dash kept her voice down just to be safe. \"Spike, you know that... 'present' I gave you for your birthday?\" Rainbow Dash smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dumbbell?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, the other one. The one I gave you when Twilight wasn't around.\" Rainbow whispered. \"You know, the one where you pulled my hoof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! That was awesome, Rainbow, I still laugh my tail off thinking about it,\" Spike chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Rainbow Dash concurred with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe anypony could have that much gas!\" Spike recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better believe it. Because I've come to do the same thing to Twilight and this one is gonna be even better!\" Rainbow Dash boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Spike gasped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike! Wasn't there someone at the door a minute ago?\" Twilight Sparkle called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's still here! It's Rainbow Dash!\" Spike shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't wait to see the look on Twilight Sparkle's face!\" Spike quietly mused as he followed Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh,\" Rainbow Dash shushed him. Even though she agreed, she didn't want to ruin the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Rainbow Dash,\" Twilight warmly greeted when she entered speakingdistance. Twilight used her magic to get a bookmark to mark her place and shut her book as she turned around. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everyone else was busy and I was in the neighborhood so I figured I'd drop in,\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm <i>not</i> busy?\" Twilight asked, shooting a glance to the mountain of books on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, sorry.\" Rainbow stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Twilight assured. \"Is there anything you want to discuss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash's stomach began gurgling yet again as if to remind her why she was there. Twilight didn't seem to hear it, however. Rainbow made a contemplative expression as if she didn't have any specific reason for coming over. \"Well there is one thing...\" she began. She extended her front right hoof. \"Pull my hoof,\" she asked. Spike, who had been standing behind her during this conversation, moved in front of her and stood next to Twilight as soon as he heard Rainbow Dash ask this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle hesitated. \"What on earth is that supposed to accomplish?\" she pondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just pull it,\" Rainbow impatiently urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight reached out with her front hooves to pull it. Right before her hooves made contact with Rainbow's, she quickly withdrew them and asked, \"Is this some sort of trick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it were, why would I tell you?\" Rainbow Dash dryly interjected. \"Anyway, I asked Spike to do this and he liked the, um, 'end result' I guess to speak Twilightese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike, is this true?\" Twilight asked, giving her assistant a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Twilight, you'll love it!\" Spike assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle finally gave Rainbow Dash's hoof a gentle pull. This was immediately accompanied by bombastic flatulence. Rainbow Dash's fart was so noisy it shook the walls with such force that books fell from shelves. When the incredibly long fart finally came to an end, Rainbow Dash and Spike gave each other a high five (or, rather, a high hoof and high claw) and laughed at the unbelievable amount of gas Rainbow had. Twilight, on the other hand, had a much less favorable reaction. In addition to the sheer force of the fart causing her library to become disorganized, the air in the library was thick with the stench of Rainbow Dash's fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash plotted her next move. On one hand, she thought staying would be fun. At least Spike seemed to be enjoying himself almost as much as she was and the shocked expression on Twilight's face throughout the duration of her fart was priceless! On the other hand, she knew this probably already put her on thin ice with Twilight and part of her didn't want to ruin their friendship completely just because of her love for fart jokes.</span></div></div>",

But she was interrupted yet again. Only this time, it was the other end of Rainbow Dash that cut her off. The sound and smell of her fart quickly filled the library. Twilight was coughing and gagging a little, but Spike didn't seem to mind. Like Rainbow Dash, he found it more funny than gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be a fart cloud on my cutie mark!\" Rainbow Dash bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Spike agreed. Rainbow Dash and Spike amused themselves with more of Rainbow's farts which were almost always accompanied with a joke of some kind by one of the two and were always followed by a guffaw from both. Twilight returned to her reading, apparently attempting to ignore them, but having visible annoyed reactions every time Rainbow farted. Rainbow's farts were so frequent that they interrupted Twilight Sparkle's concentration so much she almost never turned a page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shot the two a frustrated glare after one of Rainbow Dash's particularly long farts. Rainbow just moaned ecstatically (that fart was the most relieving thing she ever experienced), smirked and said, \"Oh, come on, Twilight, don't act like you <i>don't</i> look forward to your own big farts. They always feel so good and you know it! Twilight just blushed and went back to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like the twentieth fart from Rainbow Dash since she entered the library (although no one was counting), she made another comment about Twilight farting. \"I'll bet you've been building up a good one over there since I've come in here.\" Twilight pretended not to hear her and turned the page in her book. \"Hey, Spike, you're around her almost 24/7,\" Rainbow Dash continued. \"What are her farts like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, usually, they're --\" Spike began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike! Don't answer that!\" Twilight blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I can fart without shame, why can't you?\" Rainbow Dash asked. She ripped a short, but very loud fart to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this sudden obsession with <i>my</i> farts?\" Twilight asked, face still red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trying to give you a chance to prove you're not a total egghead and that you like something awesome for a change,\" Rainbow Dash shrugged. \"I mean, there's no reason for you to hold it in when it's just me and Spike since we obviously don't judge over that stuff.\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight moaned in immense relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, feels awesome, doesn't it?\" Rainbow giggled. Twilight didn't answer. She merely blushed and quickly adopted a facial expression that seemed as if she was wondering why she even did what she just did. \"I gotta say, Twilight, I'm impressed. That wasn't quite as long as my or Pinkie's best ones,\" she bragged, \"but for someone who hasn't trained like we have, you've got potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i>Trained?</i>\" Twilight panted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah,\" Rainbow Dash answered in a tone as if Twilight had just asked if the sky was blue. \"We gotta train if we wanna be the best. You can train with us if you ever wanna learn how to fart like, say, I don't know,\" she said, her voice starting to wander before punctuating the sentence with a proud \"<i>this!</i>\" The room started to shake from the deep, heavy rumble. Rrainbow proudly grinned as Spike burst into guffaw. Spike's laughter grew wilder when Rainbow Dash smirked and began pushing harder, making the floor shake even more violently. Eventually, Rainbow Dash started pushing softer and softer. It sounded as if the fart was dying down, but after several seconds of near-silence, she pushed her hardest yet. After this final push, her fart reached an abrupt halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Rainbow Dash, that was amazing!\" Spike cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash did not react to this. She felt so much satisfaction that again, all she could do was sigh. \"Aaaaaaaahhhhh, <i>yes!</i>\" she moaned. \"Oh my gosh, that felt <i>sooo</i> good!\" she sighed. Once she caught her breath, she giggled. As her laughter started to die down, she broadly grinned. It was everything she could hope for in a fart: that breathtaking feeling of relief and an extremely comical sound.  \"C'mon, Twilight, don't you wanna learn to fart like <i>that</i>?\" Rainbow proudly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight rolled her eyes, unimpressed. \"Actually, I -- \" Twilight began. But she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat interrupts her?</span></div></div>",

Twilight could taste every single particle of the fart on her taste buds, and it was anything but tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight began spitting at the floor, and heaving, as if about to vomit, trying everything to get that rancid taste out of her mouth.

It wasn't solid waste, nor was it golden shower, but it WAS a bit of back-wind. \"Ooh! Ouch, that smarts!\" With her belly still rumbling, Lyra bend forward, flank high up in the air. It exploded a green miasma of smelly gas. What made it worst was it was a loud, juicy fart. Lyra felt embarrassed, but the worst was yet to come. It stank of pure oblivion, but she soon felt bliss. \"What's going on in there?\" said Bonbon, who was a little worried. Lyra opened her eyes, and her stinky farts were coming out slick and fast. She felt so weak, she didn't notice Bonbon was knocking on the door again. \"Don't worry, Lyra, I'm here. Would you KINDLY open up?\" \"*Cough* I... *gag* I can't breathe... *wheeze*\" Lyra was really having it rough, but she soon opened the door. Bonbon covered her nose almost immediately; the bathroom almost turned GREEN from the stench! Derpy was behind Bonbon, trying not to laugh. Lyra hoped that was the last of it, but a small squeak came out of her bottom. \"More...?\" panted Lyra.</span></div></div>",

Silence fell. \"Way to clear a room Lyra,\" cooed Bonbon, giving off a little smile. \"There was gas everywhere inside my belly,\" giggled Lyra, \"I could feel it, it felt good to finally let it out!\" They both laughed it out.

She made her way to a little quaint cottage over near the Everfree Forest. Fluttershy would be the perfect victim for another of Lyra's pranks. She made her away around the back of the cottage, trying not to be seen. The gratuitous amounts of animals in her way made things a tad bit difficult. She nearly tripped several times. She peeked inside through a window. She could see Fluttershy minding her business, fluttering around doing some house cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fluttershy made her way to one of the other rooms, allowing Lyra to be free from her possible prying eyes, she slowly and quietly opened the window. She tip hoofed inside and waited around the corner for Fluttershy. She let out a small inaudible giggle as Fluttershy made her way back to the main room, smiling. Lyra quickly turned about and stuck her plot up and ripped a nasty gaseous cloud, just as Fluttershy made her way back. However, much to Lyra's surprise and annoyance. Fluttershy didn't react. She merely stood right where Lyra farted, and marinated in the hot gas, \"Oh, hi, Lyra,\" Fluttershy made a bemused face, \"what are you doing in my home? If you wanted to visit, you really should have knocked first. It's not nice to sneak up on other ponies. What if you had startled me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra wasn't paying any attention to Fluttershy's soap box. She just stood slack jawed. She didn't understand how come her rank stench didn't make Fluttershy cough, or gag, or at least respond in disgust. Then she took a glance around the cottage, taking notice of a family of skunks, several mice, among other assorted critters. She face hoofed. Of course Fluttershy would be able to take her stinky gas. She's used to nasty smells. She shares a cottage with animals. Loads of animals. Lyra's prank was a complete bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her head in disappointment and took her leave from Fluttershy's cottage. Leaving Fluttershy rubbing her head in bemusement.</span></div></div>",

His body quivers with pleasure from the sulfur stench lingering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight takes notice of Spike sniffing away delightfully, and raises her plot up, backing into his nose. Spike squints his eyes, awaiting the blast. Twilight pushes out a few good grunts, and sputters out a little bubbly fart, that tingles Spike's smelling senses. Twilight keeps grunting hard, and spews forth a long winded wet stinker that engulfs Spikes head in a rotted stench. Spike's legs tremble, giving out from the pleasure, and he falls to his knees, still huffing in large amounts of her potent gas lingering about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I agreed to this.

Spike could still smell her delicious farts dancing around her flank like a fog. It had him spellbound. He was quick to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Twilight! Please fart in my face!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled before replying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Spike. You've convinced me. Lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike wasted no time situating himself on the floor, a fart-eating grin plastered across his face. Twilights fuming plot hanged above him, eclipsing his face with two large mounds of purple flesh that would soon cover his entire face, and then some. He had always enjoyed the smell of Twilight's small SBD's, and her huge, wet bombs were only ten times more delicious. He couldn't wait for her to use his face as a seat and cover him in her farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked back and saw Spike staring up at her fat, smelly plot with glee. She wiggled her hips and Spike followed with his eyes, as if her fumes had brought him under some sort of curse. She did this until her gut audibly groaned with unreleased poots. She could feel all of that gas churning and bubbling in her distended stomach, begging to be spewed all over Spike's awaiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more time left, Twilight sat on Spikes face, her cheeks smashing into his with a 'fumpf'. Spike could still smell the residual stink from her earlier farts, which only served as a warning of what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike could hear and feel Twilight's stomach groan loudly from the gas trapped inside it. He wanted nothing more than for her to blow her stink all over his face until she was empty. Twilight started to grind her crack on Spike's nose, egging him on even more. He responded by bringing his claws up to massage her fart-filled stomach. His strong hands mashed her stomach up and down, making it groan even louder. The increased pressure was to much for her to handle. Twilight blew a rank, smelly fart all over Spikes face, which Spike began to fervently sniff.  followed by an even larger one that felt like it made the ground shake. Twilight's eyes rolled up into her skull, the feeling of sweet release overwhelming her. She let out another loud, bombastic fart that mixed with her previous expulsions.        Twilight's farts enveloped Spike's head in a cloud of wonderful, delicious stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike continued to grope and mash Twilight's distended stomach, making her moan in gastric bliss as her gas chamber was massaged so roughly. Spike always loved to smell Twilight's farts, but now he was getting a front row seat! She continued to cover both of them in a cloud of blissful stink, her gut seemingly never running out of fumes to blow over Spike's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight continued to add fumes to the gas chamber that was her library, until her stomach returned to a more manageable size. She lifted her prodigious rear off of Spikes head and turned around too see him with a blissful expression on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight hears a gasp, and looks up to see somepony staring at them in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although it would be wise to make sure the locals were not made aware of her presence in broad daylight, one look at Twilight Sparkle's face, nestled within a book as she entered her home, melted away all sense of logic in her mind and replaced it with a burning hatred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That blasted brat and her little friends didn't hesitate to make me look like a fool back in Canterlot,</i> thought the Queen. <i>I'm simply returning the favor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taut and bloated belly gave another resounding growl in approval of her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinister smirk, Chrysalis extended her wings and gracefully glided downward until she touched down directly in front of Twilight's door. It glowed a dark green as Chrysalis swung in open with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, who had been attending to her books before Chrysalis's grand entrance yelped in surprise and looked back to see where the noise had come from. The moment she laid her gaze upon the obsidian alicorn, her pupils dilated in pure shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch-Chrysalis?\" Twilight stuttered Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the flesh,\" she said, her words dripping with malicious poison. The Queen took a step forward, which seemed to rouse Twilight from her stupor. The two activated their horns almost simultaneously, both sending out blasts of magic heading directly towards each other. Chrysalis effortlessly dodged the blast meant for her while Twilight was knocked back into her bookshelf, causing multiple novels to topple down and litter the floor around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis gave another devilish grin, and cockily sauntered over to her fallen prey, the plump pillows of flesh on her backside jiggling and jostling to match her stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her head until she came face to face with the purple mare. \"Twilight Sparkle,\" she breathed, \"the ringleader of the group of ponies who humiliated me, brought down by a single blast. How pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight feebly whimpered, \"But we defeated you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis chuckled and turned around, presenting Twilight with her massive rump. \"One thing you'd ought to know about Changelings, my dear, is that we're quite the persistent bunch...\" Ever so slowly, she lowered her butt until it made contact with Twilight's face. \"...and I'm the Queen of them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Chrysalis has Twilight right where she wants her, how should she go about letting the gas fly?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

And a very familiar orange farmer pony was there doing what she always does best for her family's business/ livelihood. Now wiping the sweat off of her forehead and said, \" Whew, maybe later I should take a break, that's what Twilight's been tellin me to do more often. *Sigh* I understand that everypony even my big brother is looking out for my best interest and I appreciate that, really I do. But nothing ever beats the pure feeling of inner satisfaction with a hard days work. \" Not far away from her, someone was watching her, waiting for the sun to go down the rest of the way, waiting for the farm pony to finally turn in for the day and go into the barn to lie down. The Queen made sure that she wouldn't be detected by anyone while on her stakeout. \" Mmm... There she is, that Applejack who hangs out with that wretched Twilight Sparkle. Memo to myself, take care of her later, but for now.....*evil chuckle*\" The sun finally going down, thus ending yet another day of apple bucking, plenty of apple trees ready to be harvested tomorrow. \" Hoo wee, it's sure getting late out, I suppose now would be the best time for that break. Man I am bushed, I guess i'll head into my barn to rest up fer a bit before heading inside to go to bed.\"  Just what the Queen wanted her to say, waiting for her golden opportunity to make her move, now the sun finally went down completely, and Applejack started to head inside her barn to rest for a bit. This was so perfect, thought the Queen, Wasting no more time at all, she makes it to the barns entrance, finally the moment she was waiting for, Applejack has started to does off on some hay, lying down, face up. This was even more perfect, because the Queen is now right next to the sleeping farm pony. She had already had cast a sound-proof bubble spell over the barn, just for good measure. Then she charged up a paralysis spell to keep her new (toy) where it should be, under her rump, where it belongs. Once that is done the farm pony's body went all stiff, unable to move her body at all, causing her to wake up. \" W.what in tarnation, why can't I move my body ?\" Said Applejack in a almost panic state, her true night terror, staring her in the face, with a sinister smile, filled with silght anger and mostly sultry in her eyes and said. \" Because you're under the effects of my paralysis spell, lovely isn't it ? \" \" Queen Chrysailis, what in tarnation are you doing in my barn, haven't you learned your lesson last time, or was one flank kicking not enough fer ya ?\" \" SILENCE YOU INSUFFERABLE, ORANGE PONY. I have come here for some good old fashioned, delicious, stinky revenge.\" Was Applejack hearing her right, did she actually say stinky revenge ? \" Um... pardon the question, but what did ya mean by stinky revenge? \" This had only served to make the Queen chuckle to herself as she had said, \" Fool, don't you get it, i'm going to sit on your face and fart you into submission. I hope you like big, bouncy butts, because mine is going to really enjoy your face.\" \" N.now wait a minute Chrysailis, I know that we didn't really start off on the right hoof. But maybe you and I could put this whole thing behind us and um...hopefully be friends, sound good ?\" \" Mmmhhh...you know what's going to feel really good in a minute, my butt on your face Applejack.\" Seeing no way of escape, she was being forced to stare at the Queen's giant, obsidian cheeks. And with a look of utter terror and helplessness, she said. \" P.please no, don't do this, we could be friends, and could get along.....mmpphhhttt.\" Was all farm pony could say before the Queen's massive rump had plunged Applejack's face into her sweaty, damp, dark, deep, stinky crevice. \"Mmmmhhhpppppttttt.........Mmmmmnnnooooo.......Mmmmhhhhlllpppp.......Mmmmmmm meeee......Mmmmmaaaaaaaaaaa.\" screamed Applejack under the Queen's rear end, flailing her head in a vain attempt to get fresh air. But failing miserably. this action had only made the poor farm pony's head to slowly sink deeper into the Queen's stinky depths. The wicked Queen is now humming and cooing to herself, clearly enjoying the farm pony's (treatment) torture. Any and all protests that were coming from Applejack were mostly muffled and being absorbed by the thickness of the Queen's massive hindquarters now on her face. Now came the Queen's most favorite part. Her tummy starting to bloat out more, causing a loud, violent rumble all around Applejack's face. And to the farmer's horror, she farted. It wasn't very loud, but what it lacked in volume it more than made up for in stink. The farmer was now moaning in sensual agony under the Queen's mighty rump. The foul odor swamping her sense of smell, probably forever. Applejack didn't know what was worse, The smell of her farts, or the depth of her butt cheeks. The fart itself absolutely reeked of various cheeses, especially gouda, processed beef, five types of beans and with a hint of digested veggies, the worst being cauliflower, broccoli and whatever other vegetable that she had eaten earlier today. The sheer power of the first butt blast had sent Applejack into a dazed stupor, feeling nauseous, light-headed and about ready to pass out altogether. But the Queen was never going to allow this and she had released a small poot in Applejack's face. Enough to snap her out of her dazed stupor. Clearly the Queen wanted to savor this moment, This fart however had everything that the last one did but also a tinge of rotten eggs, onions and spoiled dairy. This staggering odor being made worse by the sadistic Queen now grinding, grounding and smearing more and more stink on her face. Effectively, making it worse for the poor farmer pony. Applejack was now in sulfuric hell right now, believing that a a cave of skunks combined with a dumpster would be paradise in comparison. It's about to get even more worse as the Queen has now begun to bounce and grind her head even deeper into her rancid crevice. All the while, releasing several wet, warm and smelly farts into the farm pony's tortured nose. Further increasing the overall humidity as well as the stink. \"Mmmmmmmmmhhhhppptttt\" Applejack kept screaming under the Queens foul rump, unable to catch a break or even a bit of fresh air. All of which are completely tainted with harsh stink.The Queen is now openly laughing with sadistic glee as she only plans to make this worse for poor Applejack's nose, which at this point, is numb and burns. Now the Queen was preparing for her skunky finale, pressing Applejack's face in so deep that now her nose is starting to poke and prod at her sweaty, rancid, foul, greasy pucker. Once inside, Applejack's eyes wen't wide with tormented horror, She wanted to die right now it was so bad. But knowing our Queen, she would never let that happen, instead she said. \" Well now Applejack, you really do make the best fart cushion, I could only imagine what gassing your friends must be like. Soon I shall find out....*evil cackling* \" While Applejack's nose was inside the Queens rancid pucker. Everything that she was forced to smell has come back to her three to four times more potent. Now the Queen was grunting, then she blasted Applejack's face with a bombastic butt blast that had all the putridity of every other fart imaginable. But with now a staggering combination of pure manure, sulfur and lastly, burnt rubber. This was it, Applejack couldn't take it anymore, now completely falling unconscious under the Queen's almighty, skunky rump. \" Well that was fun, maybe i'll take you as my trophy/ royal consort then move to the rest of your friends, taking all of them too. Yes I think I shall do just that......*evil laughter*. now finally getting up from the apple farmer's face. She used a shrinking spell to put Applejack's unconscious body into a small bottle, with a couple of holes in it so she can breathe inside of it during travel. And in her stead, ordered one of her Changeling's to disguise as Applejack and take her place as the farm new hand. now on her way out she visits.............<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now inside, she scans the room. Sewing supplies, mannequins lined up in a corner, some of which still had some clothes on them, probably for testing. So far so good, thought the queen. \"She must be in her room then. *Sinister giggle* I hope her snout is ready to experience all the noxious hell that my big, stinky, sweaty rump will have to offer for her. Not that she'll ever have a choice in the matter.\" Chimed the Queen, all too happy to follow through with her torture plan. She cast a sound-proof spell inside of Rarity's room for safety on the Queen's part. Next she summoned a magic inhibitor ring to prevent her new (toy) from getting any funny ideas of escape. The Queen has to have her fun after all. And lastly, she cast a spell on herself that will produce more toxic fumes for her obvious funtime with Rarity. Now standing on either side of Rarity and her bed, she turned around to present her large, obsidian, booty right in her face. Now the Queen is ready to sit down and claim her prize. \" Wow, I can't believe she's such a deep sleeper, all the easier to gas her though.\" Now she started to sit down on the poor unicorn's face. The squishy, bouncy, moistness and smell of her skunky butt on Rarity's face was more than enough to make her wake up. When she did, she was confused as to why she felt a odd weight over her face. But then she noticed a foul smell which made her nose twitch and her head to raise up only to get wedged in deeper into her soon to be stinky, torturous prison. Now fully aware of her current situation. Rarity begins to panic, knowing full well where she is now. And to no ones surprise, she screamed. \" MMMMMPPPPPHHHTTT........AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.......MMMMMMMMMM\" Trying to flail and lift her attacker's rump, too heavy and too smelly. Not only that but all that effort in shoving and flailing only served to make the Queen's giant rump to wobble, jiggle and bounce all over the fashionista's disgusted face. And churning her foul gas inside of her to be released faster. \" I bet that view must be just grand to look at, well it's about get even more grand in a minute.\" Then she lets rip a booming swampy blast that hit Rarity head-on like a fright train. And oh boy did it reek of rich sulfur, eggs, cheese and spoiled dairy.Going even more deeper into her rancid hindquarters, Rarity's body is starting to convulse under the Queen's massive, humid bottom. This torture has lasted for about an hour now. Fart after rancid fart, has now made Rarity sick to her stomache. Fresh out of tears due to crying too much from the smell. The Queen just Laughed and released yet another bombastic, butt blast in her tormented face. Her senses are now plagued with the smell of rotten cabbage, raw sewage, rich and thick manure. And last but not least, death. Raw, sharp and haunting. Now the fashionista's head is spinning, her vision is blurring and she feels her consciousness slowly being snuffed out from her. Then she passed out under the sadistic Queen's rump. \" *Hmpt* Well at least you lasted a little bit longer than the farm pony. But still very disappointing all the same, oh well off to see the rest of your friends.\" The Queen then shrunk Rarity's unconscious body and put her in the bottle next to Applejack. She then ordered another Changeling to take Rarity's form and replace her. Now leaving Carousel Boutique she plans to go where.......</span></div></div>",

I wonder just how sweet she'll think my butt is on her face...*sinister giggle*.\" Now in Sugarcube Corner, she's scanning the room. Aside from the most delightful sweet smell of pastries she has ever had the pleasure of smelling. \" So it is all true after all, Pinkie Pie being one of the greatest bakers in all of Equestria. Well I wonder just how good my delicious baked goods will smell like for Pinkie.\" Now inside of the Bakery, all is quiet and dark, which is a sure sign that everyone's is asleep. Good, thought the Queen, Now making it up to Pinkie's room. After she cast the sound-proof spell in her room, to avoid any and all disturbances from outside her room. she then charged up a paralysis spell to bind her body in one place, this caused Pinkie to stur in her sleep, now opening her eyes only to find that she can't move her limbs. \" W.what's going on....why can't I move my body?\" she then hears a evil yet sultry cackle in her room. \"Who's there?\" She asked, hoping to get to the bottom of this.\" Why hello there Pinkie, It sure has been awhile hasn't it?\" that voice sounds so familiar to the pink pony. Then it clicks, \"Queen Chrysailis, why are you in my room? Did you want to have a late-night party with me?\" \"Why yes Pinkie I would love that. but this party will be a very special one, just for you. doesn't that sound just wonderful to hear ?\" The pink, party pony nodded her head in agreement, However not knowing what exactly this (party) would be. Sadly, she's about to find out the stinky way. But then, Pinkie begins to notice a jar of what would appear to have been two, tiny ponies trapped inside. \"Hey wait a minute, is that Applejack and Rarity you got trapped in there, that's not very nice. You let them go right this instant. You meanie, buggy-pants.\" \"You're in no position to be making any demands. Besides, you'll be joining them in captivity soon.\" \"What do you mean by that....\" was all Pinkie was able to get out before the Queen released a quick sbd in her room, which stunk of strong, rotten cabbage, This caused the Party pony to move her nose into her pillow and gag. \" Eww....smelly, smelly tooties, why are you doing this to us ?\" \" Because you six have ruined my plans for taking over Equestria so now it's payback time....*evil laughter*\" \" Noooooo.....it's really stinky, please stop it. They're so foul, *ach*...*cough* *cough*.\" The queen now has her massive rump over the party pony's face. Pinkie really started to notice the strong, pungent stink that only an ass could provide. \" Get ready to go into my rump and smell everything I have to offer you. Because you're never leaving me once I have knocked you out with my stink.\" Pinkie was terrified now, staring at her soon to be stinky demise.\" P.please don't, i'm begging you. They're so toxic, and gross.\" \"Will you just shut up and just take them down your nose already.\" Now she sat down on Pinkie's face. quite literally burying her face into her giant, swampy butt crack. \"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGHHHHHHHHHH\" Pinkie moaned in utter agony under the Queen's foul rump. causing the Queen to snicker at her sensual pain that she's being forced to sniff down her nose. Then the Queen farted again, this time making the stink a lot worse for the poor party pony. \" That's right, breathe them all in. It'll all be over soon.\" Two hours have passed and so did the Queen's gas. Pinkie was now becoming green in the face. Getting weaker and weaker from constantly sniffing her captor's nasty wetness that is her massive, juicy rump. Now the Queen is pressing and squishing the party pony's face so deep that her nose is beginning to poke and prod into the Queen's greasy pucker. Now the foulness has increased tenfold for poor Pinkie. More and more raunchy, wet, smelly blasts of anal air going into Pinkie's nose. \" Aw what's the matter Pinkie, do they sting and burn your nostrils every time I let rip ?\" Pretty soon the party pony's breathing has slowed, her vision becoming all blurry and her head spinning from the smelly torture. Then, she passes out, unable to take anymore of this foul torment. \"Well the verdict is out on my baked goods, looks like she loved them,,,*evil snicker*, now to put you with your friends, my new butt slave.\" She shrunk Pinkie's body and put her inside the bottle, along with the other two already inside. Then, she get's another changeling to replace Pinkie. Now leaving Surgarcube Corner she goes where..............</span></div></div>",

Aw... isn't that just adorable, thought the Queen.Then to her left, a staircase leading upstairs. Going up the steps, she sees a faint glow above. \"That must be her room.\" muttered the Queen. Once inside, that faint glow turned out to be a night-light, in the shape of a butterfly. \" Well, well, well, aren't we just so comfy in here, what kind of cold, heartless, monster would deprive her from this moment of peaceful slumber.....I would.\" that last part said in a almost sing-song tone. Now inching ever so closer to Fluttershy's bed, she staring at her sleeping form. So peaceful and gentle and so blissfully unaware of her soon- to-be noxious fate. The Queen put up the usual sound-proof magic barrier to suppress any and all noise from reaching outside her magic bubble. Based on what i've heard, she isn't the best flier in Equestria, perhaps the worst flier...period. Thought the Queen. So maybe I wouldn't need to use a bind spell.....meh.....Just for good measure I will. With this done, Fluttershy's wings were now magically bound together, unable to fly and with the Queen now positioned over her sleeping form, unable to move. With the Queen's large, bouncy, obsidian buttcrack aimed for the poor pony's face, she begins to take her seat. The humidity, sweat and unbearable stench of the Queen's royal rump now on Fluttershy's face. This causes her to stur from her slumber, wondering why she can't see anything and why it feels like a toasty sauna in her room. Then she feels a violent rumble all around her head, then a warm, fetid breeze going up her nose has woken her up fully now. Now full realisation  hitting her, knowing full well where she is now. Her breathing becoming progressively more rapid with every passing second, her sweating bullets from sheer fear only adding stinky fuel to the Queen's very nasty fire. \"MMMMHHHHHPPPPHHHHTTTTT........MMMUUUUUAAHHHHHH\" moaned Fluttershy, unable to breathe in anything except for harsh , toxic fumes. Now bouncing and grinding Fluttershy's poor head in deeper, swallowing her face in complete and utter stinky darkness. Now becoming too weak and helpless to even consider trying to lift the Queen's massive, plump, stinky, rump. Any other hope of escape now snuffed out completely. Fluttershy has no choice but to inhale the Queen's awful butt breeze. Fluttershy's eyes were starting to tear up and burn from the horrible stench that she was forced to endure. \"*evil laughter*... Now this is a really, really comfortable seat, more so than that farmer pony.\" Fluttershy's eyes widened upon hearing this, now broken into full-on tears, knowing who she was talking about, she begins to kick and flail in a vain attempt at escape. This however, only did more harm than it could ever have done good as now Fluttershy's face was going even more deeper and deeper into her new foul, thick, meaty, stinky flesh prison.this also made the Queen laugh with sadistic glee as she continued to bounce, grind, smother and smear more and more retched stink into the tortured pony's face. Fart after rancid fart, more and more thick gas swamping her sense of smell, most likely for good. rotting cabbage, turned dairy, foul eggs and a faint tinge of sulfur. \"Well, do you like them so far Fluttershy? \" The pegasus trying her best to shake her head in disagreement. \" Well too bad, you better start getting used to smelling them, because once i've knocked you out with my sexy, stinky rump. I'm putting you inside of this bottle, along with the rest of your friends to become my personal stink toys.\" Now on the verge of borderline passing out, Her body is beginning to convulse and twitch under the Queen's skunky rump. At least two hours of stinky torture later. Fluttershy is barely hanging on, causing the Queen to resort to more drastic measures. Now pressing down on Fluttershy's head so hard that her entire head got stuck inside of the Queen's rancid pucker, devoid of any clean air. Now  the poor pegasus could smell everything times ten. Her vision was blurring, she was dry heaving due to not eating anything before bedtime. Her head was spinning due to lack of clean oxygen. And she was now fading out, falling into a forced sleep...she faints. Now the Queen shrinks her body and puts it inside of the bottle. She assigns another changeling to tkae her place and then heads out to go where........</span></div></div>",

Well I do believe that's that then.\" She makes it to the rainbow pegasus's  cloud home. For a cloud house, not too shabby thought the Queen. However it pales in comparison to my beautiful hive/castle though. Now arrived at her destination. She finds it rather easy to enter her home considering that her front door was slightly left open for just anyone to enter. \"Oh...second house in a row that has there front door partially open, I swear these ponies are just plain stupid.\" Turns out  that Rainbow's living room just so happens to also be her bedroom of sorts, this works just fine for the Queen though. As she is now standing right next to her bed, readying up her spells to cast. First came the sound-proof spell, then came the bind spell because the Queen knew just how well Rainbow could fly. \" Alrighty then, time for some fun *sinister cackle*\" Now she began to sit on the poor pony's head, The large, bouncy, thick, smelly cheeks that were slowly consuming her face. Then came the foul stink that invaded her nostrils and caused her to wake up. Only to find something absolutely horrible  in front of her, pulling her face in deeper. \"Mmmmmmpppptthhhhhhh\" moaned Rainbow. Then the Queen farted and it was big and bad too. Still that pungent fragrance of rotten, swampy, cabbage, with a sickening combo of re-fried beans, a blend of rich spices, processed meats, assorted cheeses (especially gouda), digested veggies and lastly just a tinge of rancid sulfur. \"Mmm...* evil snicker* stinky, stinky my tushie all over your face.\" Rainbow's struggles slowly getting weaker from just that first wiff of gas. Her anger eventually turning into stark fear. fear for her nose. Then more and more toots being ripped in her terrified face. Her nose is numb and it's starting to burn from the stink being so nasty. \" Well I think it's high time I try something a little more....interesting....*sinister giggle*\" Before Rainbow could process what the Queen had meant by \"interesting\" the worst most possible thing had happened to her. Her body is beginning to shrink down to at least half the size of Scootaloo's body. And now the Queen's horrible, greasy pucker was beginning to swallow Rainbow head inside, up to her wings that are bound together for obvious reasons. You can now see the tormented pony's tail and hind-legs now wiggling, trying to in vain to escape her now very stinky situation.  This still hadn't stopped the sadistic Queen from releasing more and more wet, smelly farts right in her face, inside of the Queen's rancid tunnel of doom. The stink had gotten worse for Rainbow by tenfold while being subjected to foul, skunky hell. Rainbow's body was violently convulsing inside the Queen's rump, her left hind-leg twitching randomly just as her vision is now beginning to blur inside of the Queen's noxious cavern. A few more bombastic, butt blasts later and now the smell is like death, raw, sharp and haunting, with a nasty combo of vile sewage, pure manure and a very nasty mix of eggs, spoiled dairy and lastly burnt rubber, that became way too much for the now traumatized Rainbow Dash to endure much longer. Now she passed out inside of her tormentor's stinky cave of doom, unable to get any clean oxygen at all. Now the Queen has pulled her shrunken body out of her rancid plothole with a disgusting pop noise. Shrunk her down even more to put her inside of the bottle containing the rest of her friends. \"*Evil laughter* now that's what I call a relaxing massage. You did good Rainbow, really good in fact. I think that being my personal royal butt-plug would be just right for you.\" Now leaving a changeling to replace Rainbow Dash. She goes where..........</span></div></div>",

Noticing that her door is indeed locked. normally this would have been a problem for the wicked Changeling Queen. However, it's good to have the ability to teleport using magic. Once inside. She scans her surroundings, books, books everywhere. even the floor was almost completely covered in books. \"This pony really needs to find a better hobby than this, pretty soon she shall *sinister giggle*.\" making her way upstairs, now reaching her room and going inside. She sees the dragon quietly and soundly sleeping in the same room opposite her. Then a devious idea formed inside of her head. First she made a magic inhibitor ring and quietly slipped it on her horn, then she cast her sound-proof bubble spell. but this time however. she gave the bubble an illusion of a perfectly sound asleep unicorn, still in bed. So the waking drake doesn't get suspicious.\" Now that that's done, it's finally time to claim my prize and sate my revenge on you Twilight Sparkle.\" The Queen now positioned her butt right above the sleeping pony's head, then roughly ploped down, instantly burying her muzzle into her noxious, plump, sweaty rump. Twilight immediately waking up to a ungodly, horrible stench invading her nostrils. And warm, soft, squishy, doughy obsidian rump. \"Mmmmmmmmmmmpppppphhhhhmmmmm\"  screamed the now terrified lavender unicorn under the Queens vile rump. The Queen is now bouncing, grinding and smooshing her face in more, pressing her muzzle into her pucker already. Her nose has been assaulted with the absolute pungent odors from hell itself. The worst was yet to happen for poor Twilight, as the Queen now blasted her with a thick, moist, cheesy fart. right in her face. Twilight began to flail and punch the Queen's thick, soft, bubbly butt cheeks. This had only served to make her Butt cheeks wobble, jiggle, slosh, and bounce all over the disgusted unicorn's face. The lavender unicorn first moaning in utter sensual agony, now full on crying due to the fart smelling strongly of foul cheese.\" You know what they say Sparkle, revenge is a dish best served stinky *evil laughter*,\" Now that the Queen has finished smothering the poor lavender unicorn's face, but not without releasing a few more rotten poots in her face. She lift's up, Twilight then begins to greedily suck up any bit of air she could to fill her lungs with.\" Not yet Sparkle, I have one more surprise for you.\" she then levitates a small bottle containing five ponies inside. This for obvious reasons has made the lavender unicorn gasp with sheer and udder horror at the sight before her. \"Girls...no, you let them go right now Chrysailis. or i'll...i'll\" \"You'll do what to me Twilight, hurt me, I wish you luck with that. *sinister giggle*\" \" You see these ponies here, soon after I knock you out with my sexy stink, you're going in there with them.\" Then before Twilight could even rebutt that last statement. She starts to shrink down to the size of a mouse. Everything's gotten bigger and more fouler as she got smaller. Now her body is wrapped up in a sickly, green glow. being lifted up the Queen's foul rump once more. Except this time, her entire body is getting wedged inside of the Queen's nasty rump. \"Noooooooooooooooooooooo\" Twilight screamed as she was being carried off to her stinky doom. Her top-half of her body completely stuck inside of the Queen's rancid, greasy, pucker. Then the Queen starts to move her body in and out like a makeshift dildo of sorts, all the while farting in the tormented unicorns face. Twilight at this point actually considered death to be her savior right now, this stink was so horrible. But the cruel Queen wouldn't let that happen. \" Ooh yes, how does that smell Sparkle, is it too much for you to handle, would you like me to end it for right now in one big, gassy blast ?\"<br>\r\nTwilight thought about it for a moment, being instantly knocked out by one of the Queen's worst farts imaginable, or slowly but surely be awake while the Queen uses her small body as a butt-plug.\" Well too bad Sparkle, I am the one who gets to decide your stinky fate *evil cackle*\" More and more bombastic, butt blasts continued to bombard the lavender unicorn's face, sending her into a forced haze. Then another ripe, thick, cheesy fart snapped her out of her haze, she begins moaning again, unable to take much more of this.Now the Queen prepares one final gas bomb for poor Twilight. This last one was not only extremely cheesy, but also swampy, humid, moist and windy, but also stunk completely of sulfur and manure. Right in Twilight's weakened face. This was it, now the lavender unicorn was finally given a forced sleep. \"*evil snicker* now that is what I call stinky revenge\" Now she puts Twilight's body into the bottle with the rest of her friends. \"Ahh...it's good to be the Queen *evil laughter*.\" She de-odors the room with her magic, summons another changeling to take her place and then heads back to her hive fortress.</span></div></div>",

Last I had checked, Chrysailis has captured all of us, then...\" Twilight droned off, realization hitting home as to where they're now. Now upon further inspection, they also found out that they're trapped inside of the same glass bottle that Chrysailis had used to do her kidnapping with. Then they all heard and felt the vibrations of massive hoofsteps in their general direction. All six ponies were looking up to their captor with extreme terrified looks of forlorn and helplessness. The queen's giant hoof tapping up against the side of their glass prison. \" Good you're awake, all of you elements will be here forever, so I would start getting used to this new lifestyle\" said the queen. \" Let us go right now Chrysailis, or you'll be sorry.\" threatened Twilight. \" Oooh i'm absolutely terrified, quivering my hooves in fear.\" the Queen said sarcastically. At this point Twilight was just bluffing and both she and Chrysailis knew it. \" Um...Twilight, ah seriously hope you got a plan to get us out of here\" said Applejack. \"Yeah, I have an appointment with being in the wonderbolts and being the best, I can't do those if i'm stuck here.\" chided Rainbow. \" I'll try to think of something girls, I just need a little more time.\" said Twilight. \" Well, think all you want, but you're never leaving here\" snapped the queen.\" You let us go, you awful, awful hideous bug\" Insulted Rarity. \" Hideous bug am I \" the queen said angrily. \" Well then, I do believe that you'll be first to receive your \"treatment\" as the queen said this, her horn glowed a sickly green and she turned around so the rest of the mane six could see her massive, obsidian backside. Rarity could feel a tingling all around her body and in a flash, she was outside of their glass prison. And slowly moving head-first into the queen's royal rump. \" Wait...nonono, I didn't mean that, i'm sorry for calling you hideous, don't do this again please\" begged Rarity. \" Too late for apologies Rarity, you're going to stew in my rancid stink now\" Said the queen, wearing a now very sinister grin over her face. The other five girls had to watch in horror as their fashionista friend started to slowly sink into the queen's foul rump, screaming all the way in. \" Mmmmmmhhhhhhttttppppptt\" Screamed Rarity as she was flailing and kicking in a vain attempt at escape. Sadly, this only made her situation worse for her as she sank in faster, into Chrysailis' stinky rump of doom. \" Oh no Rarity, you'll pay for this Chrysailis\" snapped Twilight. \" And just how're you going to make me, twilight\" asked the queen. Then the queen had an equally as awful thought enter her mind. \" How about I make an example out of you next Twilight\" Said the queen gleefully. \"No, take me instead\" snapped Rainbow. \" Ah the element of loyalty, never ceases to amaze and annoy me. But no, not yet, first Twilight then you.\" Said the queen. \" I'm sorry girls, but we may not be getting out of here anytime soon.\" said a now defeated Twilight. \" So, does that mean you're ready to accept your new place Twilight\" asked the queen. \" *sigh* yes Chrysailis, I am.\" said a near hopeless Twilight. \" Wait Twilight no, we can still think of a way outta this, please don't do this sugarcube\" begged Applejack. \" I'm sorry Applejack, but Rarity needs me, she's suffering in there, i'm not going to just abandon her in there\" reasoned Twilight. \"How heroic, but pointless all the same\" said the queen. Twilight began to feel a tingling around her body, then in a flash, she was now outside of their glass prison, just like Rarity. And now slowly being carried of to her doom, with a look of horror and slight determination, she presses on to her \"treatment\". But the closer she got, the more it stunk, like rancid garbage with a hint of sulfur. Twilight's nose started to scrunch up at the foul odor. then in no time at all, her body made contact with the queens giant, squishy, stinky backside. now it just got worse for her, sinking in deeper into her now stinky doom. \"Mmmmmmmmggghhhhh\" screamed Twilight helplessly, as she sinks into the queens rancid buttcrack. Right next to Twilight was Rarity, close to passing out already due to the stink being so bad. \"T,twilight, no you shouldn't have done this\" Said Rarity in a weak tone. \" Well I didn't really have much of a choice *cough*, but that doesn't matter now, I'm here to help us escape Rarity\" said Twilight. \" I can hear you two talking you know. better hurry up on your little escape plan, cause i've got a big one brewing inside me\" Said the queen. \"Oh no, darling we have to hurry, I don't think that I could handle even one blast of her gas let alone any more\" said a now scared Rarity. \" I'm trying Rarity\" said Twilight. \" Almost ready you two, o.oh I feel it coming, and it feels like a real boomer\" said the queen. A violent rumble vibrated around the two trapped ponies inside of the queens rancid crack. \"There's not much time left Twilight, please do something\" cried Rarity. \" Rarity i'm trying as hard as I can, i'm sorry\" said Twilight. \"Time's up, now for the really fun part\" said a very gleeful Chrysailis. The queen grunted and then released a really big butt bomb into the two ponies' noses. \" Ahhh.....that felt sooo good.\" said the now very satisfied queen. \" Oh Celestia above, it burns, my nose it burns\" cried Rarity. Twilight was now dry-heaving due to not eating food before bedtime. \" *ack* I think some of it got in my mouth\" said Twilight.\" the other four watching in horror at their friends' torment. \" You're next Rainbow, come on, you and my butt have much to discuss about good manners\" said the queen. Then Rainbow's body started to tingle all over and in a flash, appeared outside of their glass prison. \" You'll never take me alive, you ugly bug horse\" said Rainbow now looking at her tormentors massive rump and slightly shaking in fear at what's to come. \" Oh really, wanna bet, pet\" said the queen.\" I'm not your pet, none of us are, let us go now\" demanded Rainbow. \" Big words coming from such a small pony\" Taunted the queen. now the pegasus is slowly lifted into the queen's foul rump as well. sinking into the queen's butt flesh and into her rancid crack. \"Mmmmmaahhhhhh\" Screamed Rainbow, in obvious agony at the now increased horrible stench. \"Muhahahaha,,,,that's right elements, suffer inside my mighty rump\" said the queen with a evil smirk adorned on her face. Now next to Twilight and Rarity, Rainbow begins to actually cry due to the stench being so foul.\" Rainbow, you're here too huh\" said Twilight weakly. \"Well rarity wasn't kidding when she said she couldn't handle the first blast\" said Twilight, her eyes now drifting towards her unicorn friends unconscious body and then to Rainbow's. \" It can't end like this Twilight, it just can't\" sobbed Rainbow. Now the queen uses her magic to teleport the other three ponies outside of the glass prison. Her massive rump in their faces, Futtershy already passed out due to the stress of the situation. Another rumble shook the three trapped inside, then without warning the queens rips another butt blast in their faces.\" Ugh, by Luna's starry mane, that's foul\" Said Rainbow now moaning in utter agony.\" I.I know *cough* Rainbow\" said Twilight, her eyes now watering at the powerful odor. This second blast was enough to wake Rarity up to a more than foul smell invading her nostrils. \" Ugh...no I don't want this anymore, please Chrysailis, have some mercy on us\" begged Rarity, now on her last legs. \" Darlings, I,I cant take much more of this putrid torture\" moaned Rarity. \" We have to press on girls, harmony will prevail, it has to. and now Applejack was next to get sent into soft, stinky darkness. \"Nooo...not me, please not again\" cried Applejack. now getting pressed into the queens foul rump and screaming.\"Mmmmmhhhhhnnnooooo\" screamed Applejack as she was slowly sinking into the queens rancid asscrack. then appeared next to the rest of her friends. \" Applejack, not you too, what about Pinkie and Fluttershy, where are they \" asked Twilight.\" All three of us were taken out of that jar and were placed in front of this *ugh* horrible rump\" said Applejack. \" well now Pinkie, Fluttershy, that's four down, two left to devour into my stinky rump. Pinkie's hair has now deflated into straight, long hair. \" P,please Chrysailis, no more torture, we beg of you\" begged Pinkie but to no avail as she had heard Fluttershy mutter something under her breath. \" T,this is it, we're goners, it's hopeless, we cannot escape our fate\" Said a broken Fluttershy. \" No Flutter shy, I refuse to admit defeat when w.we smile, we can also have hope...oh who are we kidding, get this over with Chrysailis\" Said Pinkie. \" With pleasure Pinkie\" said the queen as she pressed  the last two ponies into her rancid, royal rump. Now all six of them were in there, there was no escape now and the queen knew that she'd won. \" And now to hammer in your new place as my royal fart play toys, i'm gonna release another foul blast, this one feels the mightiest\" chimed the queen. Now the queen grunts a third time, then lets loose the absolute bitter stench from hell.Every vile odor imaginable went straight into their noses. The mane six are now too weak to escape have no choice but to accept their new lives as Chrysailis' new fart toys. \" Ahhh....I love it when I win, *muhahaha* this day has truly been just perfect\" said the queen, reveling in her victory. And as if to seal the deal in further, she lets out one final, bombastic, butt blast in the six ponies faces, Now all of them have fainted, unable to brace the stinky storm anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   - Bad End - (literally)</span></div></div>",

The bathtub bubbled more than a jacuzzi as she sighed with great relief, releasing more and more gas. Then, she heard an ominous sound and quickly closed herself up.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" She said to herself. She released another strong fart and she heard it again. Then she noticed some water leaking out of the side of her bathtub. Now she knew what was happening. The tub wasn't able to maintain all of her farts being released into it. Luna tried to not fart for a moment so she could fix it with magic, but her plot wasn't agreeing with her. Since she was scared, it was much easier for the strongest fart she had in the bathtub came out. It shattered the tub and water went all over the bathroom floor. Luna was still farting the entire time.<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOODNESS!\" She yelled as the tub shattered. She quickly sat back on her plot and held in as much as she could. However, the gas seemed to be stronger than ever now, and it still wanted out.<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Most people think of successful gamblers when the term is mentioned, but there's another group the uses it equally well. Politicians. And now, Princess Celestia drew upon every last one of her thousands of years of experience to put together a poker face capable of hiding the worst build up of gas ever in her lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK so not the wost Ever, but this is definitely up there.\" Celestia thought, \"though this takes the cake in terms of bad timing.\" Looking to get out of the crowd somewhat, the princess made her way towards a small gathering that included her new captain of the royal guards, and to her surprise, several of her sister Luna's bat-pony guards as-well. Intrigued by the gathering, Celestia drew close enough to make out their words over the noise of the crowd, (and the incessant rumbling of her bowels)     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that Shining Armor is up at the Crystal Empire with Princess Cadence, there was a opening for the position here and...'   \"And you were the lucky son of a colt she chose huh? Gratz man. \" \"Thanks but it was actually the rest of the guards that chose me, not the princess.\" \"Dang you guys are lucky that way.\" \"Why, does Luna rule you guys with a iron hoof?\" \"Luna doesn't rule us at all.\" \"Yeah, when she's not dream-surfing, she's futzing around with old spells and such, or working with the plants in her private garden.\" \"What's she got growing in there?\" \"Nothing good for ya from what I've heard.\" \"Yeah yesterday some poor housekeeper was taste-testing something she made, and wound up with some major bad gas. Like everything in the room shook bad.\" \"Ugh note to self, never accept food from Luna.\" \"Speaking of which, shouldn't Luna be here?\" \"I believe she's sick, ate something wrong at breakfast or something.\" \"I guess being a Alicorn doesn't make you immune to food poisoning then?\" \"I guess not.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would have been nice to know Before i had that slice of cake.\" thought Celestia grimly, \"And here i thought you were giggling because not one day into my diet I'm already skimping on it! I swear Luna when i get my hooves on you I'm going to...\" \"groan\" \"gurgle\" \"rumble\" Celestia's musings were cut short as painful cramps rocked her midsection, drawing her attention back to the massive fart building within. \"Hold it, hold it, hold it, come on Tia you can do this,\" thought Celestia desperately \"come on, come on\" The cramps subsided quickly, but not before making Celestia aware of just how much gas she truly had. Quickly glancing around the room, she spotted a clock mounted on the wall, and upon seeing the time, formed a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so the party ends in just under two hours, but with Luna feeling \"sick\" i can leave to \"go check on her\" in a hour or so, find her, drop flank right on her star-manned little head for doing this to me, then return and close out the party. I just have to not let rip till then...\"                      </span></div></div>",

The reason for the high speed travel was simple. Celestia had gas and it was Luna's fault. The hour between that revelation and now had been brutal. Painful cramps, self-entitled guests, and the asinine questions and comments the latter had posed throughout had just about done her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you Princess Celestia\", \"What's on your mind Princess Celestia\", \"What are you doing after the party Princess Celestia?\". The questions had never ended. Fortunately she had provided a intelligent response to each, rather then a truthful one. Celestia smiled to herself. \"Bloated like hell\", \"How badly i have to fart\", and \"Punishing my sister for giving me gas\", wouldn't have gone over well. \"Would have been funny though, that's for sure.\" \"On the bright side, no one complained about my leaving to check on Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the last staircase, Celestia at last saw her goal. Luna's Room. The twin of the one she slept in. And there, signifying Luna herself was within, a quartet of bat- pony guards, standing at attention outside the door. Approaching the door, Celestia went over the plan once more. \"Enter room, find Luna, fart on her head, leave. Though if she's actually sick I'll simply use her bathroom, rather then her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping short of the doorway, Celestia inclined her head to the guard, who bowed in return. \"Greetings soldier\", she said, \"is my sister within?\" \"Greetings your Highness,\" he replied, \"Luna is within, but she is sick and resting, and so not to be disturbed.' Celestia frowned, \"Not to be disturbed?\" \"Are you denying me the right to see my sister?\" \"No no nothing like that.\" the guard replied hastily, \"You of course may see her if you so desire.\" \"Excellent.\" Celestia hummed. \"Then would you be so kind as to get the door?\" \"Yes of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards quickly moved to the door, opening it. As they did so a sound emerged from within, one that set Celestia's teeth on edge.             </span></div></div>",

There was her sister, supposedly to ill to attend a major court function, sitting on her rump, bags of chips and bottles of soda scattered about her, playing a Video Game. \"Unbelievable, completely freaking unbelievable.\" she muttered, \"Its about what i expected, but still...\" Fortunately Luna had neither seen nor heard Tia's entrance, her T.V. facing away from the entrance, and Luna's ears were covered by a headset, into which insults, warnings, and commands were being shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, get some\", \"Look out, on your left\", \"He's been there the last ten minutes, so try a different pathway already ya newb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newb\" thought Celestia, \"That's what you are for trying to pull one over on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at the bat-pony guards, Celestia saw expressions of shame and embarrassment on each of there faces. That could only mean that... \"Are you guys in on this as-well?\" she asked. \"Yeah kind of.\" one guard replied \"We were suppose to warn Luna you were coming so she could get ready, but i guess we missed our cue.\" \"And what was your \"cue\" exactly?\" asked Celestia, her voice carrying the sweetness of poisoned honey, \"Well to be honest, we were listening for a sound.\" \"And what sound was that exactly?\" Tia asked, Was it something like a explosion?\" \"Um well not exactly\" the guard replied nervously, \"It was more of a ...um...well...\"<br>\r\n\"A fart\" Celestia finished, \"A massive, built up, castle shaking fart, wasn't it?\" \"Um yes.\" replied the guard, not daring to meet her gaze. \"but you see princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Celestia interrupted, \"I'm not in the mood for apologies, only punishments. And I know just what it's going to be.\" her voice turned venomous. \"You can listen for your \"cue\" from near point-blank range.\" The guard ponies developed looks of terror as the weight of Celestia's words sunk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, Celestia strode into Luna's chamber, with only one thought on her mind, \"It's time.\" \"After nearly 7 hours of torture, of gas cramps and rumbly bowels, of inane conversation with inane ponies, of planing revenge against Luna, all while trying to prevent a digestive blowout, the time is now.\" \"It's time for vengeance.\" \"It's time for relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's time... to fart.\"        <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Not that Luna seemed at all suspicious, as she was busy with her game. In fact, it seemed as though the main reason Celestia was moving so slowly was to savor the moment. When she was right behind Luna, her stomach gurgled very loudly. Fortunately for her, Luna was too busy shouting orders at her teammates to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia slowly turned around, almost accidentally farting as she shifted positions. \"Hey, Luna!\" Celestia called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, still focused on her game, simply said, \"Not now, Celestia.\" After a brief moment, this sentence processed in her head, she said, \"Wait, <i>Celestia!?</i>\" Finally, the moment Celestia was waiting for: Luna had turned around, facing her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia slyly smiled as she unleashed as much gas as she could. The sheer force of it not only created a rumbling sensation in the room, but it blew Luna's headset off and blew her mane back. Luna soon coughed on the stench, gagging too much to focus on casting a teleportation spell on Celestia or herself, trapping Celestia in a magical forcefield that would trap her in with the smell, or any other spell that would be useful in the situation. She could only endure as Celestia bombarded her with more and more loud and long blasts of flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia took a break from her farting to turn around. She giggled a little as she did so. \"Oh, Luna, I'm not sure whether I should be mad at you or thank you. After all, your prank was actually a bit fun once it backfired, if you'll pardon the pun.\" A brief, but very loud fart emphasized this joke, prompting Celestia to giggle a bit more before concluding, \"Yes, fart jokes are loads of fun in the proper time and place, but royal events where your reputation is on the line are hardly the time or the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time Celestia was finished speaking, Luna had finally stopped coughing enough to speak. Celestia wasn't ready for what she was about to say.</span></div></div>",

However, as quickly as this expression arrived, it left. \"Don't play dumb with me, Luna.\" Celestia took a couple more steps toward her. \"You and I both know that cake was specifically made to give me lots of gas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not,\" Luna firmly insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stared into her eyes for a few seconds that seemed to pass slowly. She knew her sister's tells. She was just waiting her to blink more than usual, to touch her hoof to her face, or another thing she does that would indicate she's lying. But Celestia just couldn't discern anything out of the ordinary. She was telling the truth. \"Oh my... sorry, Luna.\" Celestia blushed. \"It's just... I could have sworn you were the one that played this prank, so I figured it'd only be fair to fight fire with fire. Or, in this case, fight fart jokes with fart jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don't worry about it. I know if somepony tried to gas me up like that and I thought I knew who did it, I probably would have done the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear there are no hard feelings. But if you're telling the truth - which I think you are - there are a couple weird things that don't add up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard some batpony guards mention something about you being sick and that's why you weren't downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange,\" Luna said. \"There was a pony napping somewhere who needed my help and advice. So I was appearing to him in his dreams; that's what I was busy with,\" she explained. \"I wasn't playing games the whole time if that's what you were thinking,\" she said, \"I honestly just started. I figured by the time I got downstairs, you guys would just be wrapping up so there wasn't much of a point of showing up right at the end. Perhaps the pony who said I was sick was in on it,\" Luna speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Celestia said, still examining Luna's body language to detect a lie but not noticing anything that would indicate one. \"Still, you personally gave me that piece of cake, yourself and it was the only thing out of the ordinary I've eaten today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>did</i> set it down in the kitchen for a couple of minutes,\" Luna recalled. \"Somepony probably tampered with it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Celestia said. Her stomach rumbled a little. \"I still have a bit of gas left over, but I should be able to hold it till the party; it's about over anyway. Will you help me find the prankster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Luna said. \"In fact, perhaps I'll have a little snack beforehand to show whoever's responsible why you don't put the blame on a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled. \"Great! I'll come get you in a little bit.\" Celestia started to leave, but right when she got to the door, she turned around and said, \"By the way, you should probably go ahead and get started on that snack. Something tells me it won't take us long to find our culprit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Celestia's way downstairs, she noticed the batponies by Luna's room were now nowhere to be found; they were obviously in on it. But they probably weren't responsible for the prank itself, she reasoned. After all, they had been posted there all day; none of them could have done it. Celestia kept her eyes open for anypony suspicious when she made it back to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say we have to end things a little early,\" Celestia called out. A few ponies in the crowd loudly grumbled. Celestia, however, was unwavering. She stood up straighter and lifted one of her front hooves, assuming an authoritative pose. \"I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but there is an urgent royal matter that I must attend to.\" A couple of the complainers seemed reluctant to leave. Celestia was tempted to let loose one of the obnoxiously powerful farts she was currently capable of, thanks to the anonymous prankster, to urge them out quickly. But, fortunately, they listened to their princess and left on their own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile watching the ponies leave, Celestia made a note to look for anypony suspicious. Perhaps this was some tactic by one of Canterlot's enemies to ruin her reputation. But Celestia soon abandoned this theory when she couldn't spot any strangers. Remembering Luna mentioning whoever did it had to have gone into the kitchen at some point, she knew this meant one of two things: it was either somepony on her kitchen staff or somepony who didn't belong there who somehow managed to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the guests all left, Celestia stepped into the kitchen. There, the head chef, Cinnamon Swirl, was managing the closing ritual of making sure everything was clean, food was stored properly, etc. \"Cinnamon Swirl,\" Celestia said. He was so busy it took him a moment to realize whose voice it was who said his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Princess?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have a couple questions. First, did you see anypony who wasn't on staff enter the kitchen at all today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a pink earth pony,\" he said. \"She seemed to be trying to taste the desserts. But we quickly got her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Balloons on her cutie mark, I'd imagine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch,\" Celestia said. \"Anything else out of the ordinary happen today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Aside from us being understaffed thanks to Pumpkin Spice leaving early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And when did she leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long before that pink pony showed up, now that I think about it,\" he said. \"Sometime around noon, maybe twelve thirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia remembered this was pretty close to the time she ate her cake. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's all for now. Thanks,\" Celestia said. She hurried up the first staircase she could find and navigated the corridors to Luna's room. She smiled when she saw Luna had taken her earlier advice; Luna was just finishing a surprisingly enormous bowl of beans when Celestia came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Celestia,\" Luna said, \"Did you find out who did it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've got it narrowed down between a couple people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is Pinkie Pie,\" Celestia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight's friend?\" Luna asked, clearly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded. \"She was apparently trying to get her hooves on the sweets. Which definitely sounds like her, if you ask me. Of course, given her history of pulling practical jokes, trying to gas somepony up by messing with the cake definitely sounds like her as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Luna said. \"But knowing Pinkie and how much she loves cake, don't you think she'd rather eat the cake than use it to prank somepony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fair question. Anyway, our next suspect is Pumpkin Spice. She works in the kitchen and mysteriously went home shortly after I ate the cake,\" Celestia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's either some poor timing on her part or she had something to do with it,\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters investigated a bit further and shared their rationale a bit more before deciding on who to punish for the prank. They ultimately decided on...</span></div></div>",

Actually listening to the conversations around her. \"It's no use.\" she thought, after counting the same batch of tiles for the third time, \"I've gotta fart so bad right now, it's not funny.\" A glance at the nearby clock crushed any hopes of holding it till the end of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninety minutes till the end of court, but i cant hold it that long.\" Celestia thought, \"I feel like I'm about to blow any second.\" As if confirming her diagnosis, a series of groans, rumbles, and gurgles emerged from her midsection, each on pointing to an ominous and forgone conclusion... \"I cant hold it anymore,\" Tia desperately thought, over the building rumble of her bowels, \"It's gotten too big, and the pressure is too much to hold back any more,\" Tia closed her eyes as the rumbling reached a crescendo, \"I I'm gonna... gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT! The massive fart burst forth from Celestia's rump in a cloud of wall-shaking, eye-searing, nostril-burning foulness. \"My eyes!\", \"Help Me!\" \"Cant B-breath!\" The cries for help were lost beneath a cascade of flatulence, each one more pungent and foul than the last...  BBBBWWWAAAAAPP! FFFFAAAARRRTT! PPPOOOOOTTT! PPPPOOOOOT! FFFFAAARRTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last rumbles of gas died away, Celestia sighed with relief, \"No matter who, what, when, where, and how you are, releasing a fart you've held in for that long feels oh so wonderful.\" \"Not that i would recommend holding it cause of how much pain that caused but...\" groangurglerumblegroan... Celestia gripped her midsection as a powerful cramp moved through it, transitioning into a rapidly building fart. \"At last\", she sighed, \"The Big One, the monster fart that's been brewing within me all day.\" \"You've been a distraction and temptation all day, now i can finally release... you...\"             <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPP PPPPPP!

All of Canterlot shook, and still Celestia farted, unconcerned with anything except the sense of relief she now felt. \"Finally.\" she muttered, After all that time of feeling it groan and churn and rumble within her, Celestia had at last released what had been plaguing her throughout the majority of this court function and at last she could... wait court function?? Court Function!?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of dread settled over the princess. How could she have forgotten? She'd been in the midst of court when her bowels betrayed her, and had lost herself in the sense of relief. Now though, reality rushed back in with sickening clarity, shrouding her in shame and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened?\" \"How could i let myself fart not once but multiple times?\" \"And that last one... i should have gone someplace like the Saddle Arabian desert, or someplace equally remote before letting that rip.\" she sighed \"I've got no choice but face the consequences of what happened here with whatever pride and dignity i have left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA amusing thought crossed her mind, \"Unless everypony here got knocked out with that first blast and doesn't remember what happened but, somehow i doubt I'm that lucky.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her head from the floor, Celestia opened her eyes and saw...<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she started suppressing laughter as she remembered an anecdote that was particularly hilarious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. One of my favorite foods is Cloudsdale Chili. I'm sure you've had it before.\" Rainbow paused briefly. Spitfire nodded. \"When most people cook it, they soak the beans a few hours beforehand because it causes less gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the record, every time I've had Cloudsdale Chili, it's been with soaked beans and I still got tons of gas,\" Spitfire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded. \"Yeah, but it's because just about all the ingredients cause gas. Onions, garlic, those peppers...\" Rainbow trailed off for a second thinking of the other ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always imagined Cloudsdale Chili was invented as some kind of experiment; whoever came up with that recipe was probably trying to find a way to make earth ponies fly or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Rainbow Dash exclaimed before giggling a bit at Spitfire's joke. \"Anyway, back to my story: when I make Cloudsdale Chili, I don't soak my beans, so I'm sure you can imagine how much gassier it gets then. And I tend to add more beans than the recipe calls for. Anyway, a whole pot of that stuff tends to last me a few days. On the third day of that being most of my diet, I kind of forgot my friend Rarity was supposed to be fitting me for a dress she was making me as a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh,\" Spitfire said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when I remembered I was supposed to meet Rarity, I tried to get it all out of my system. I mean, I know she gets grossed out by that kind of stuff and I wasn't in the mood to get in an argument with her. Plus she was doing something nice for me, so I thought I might as well try my best to make things easiest for her. But you know how Cloudsdale Chili is. After trying to get it all out, I was still full of gas by the time I made it to Rarity's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there I was, trying to hold it in. It was going fine for the first half hour or so, but then I felt like I was going to explode. And it just so happened that around that time, Rarity decided to start working on the stitching in the flank.\" Spitfire shook her head once again. \"I swear I'm not making this up! But almost as soon as she started working back there, I just couldn't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thought I did it on purpose. Probably because she didn't think one that loud or long could slip out on accident and I'm sure me laughing my head off didn't help things either. So to prove to her it was an accident, I said, ''That was an accident. This is on purpose,' and showed her what a <i>real</i> Cloudsdale Chili fart sounded like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire and Rainbow Dash laughed. \"Yeah. Remember how I said she's grossed out by that kind of stuff? You should have heard her!\" Rainbow cleared her throat and began speaking in her best Rarity impression, \"'Rainbow <i>Dash</i>, how dare you conduct yourself in such a crude manner! Get out of my shop this instant! Why, at this rate, you'll be lucky to get a gift at all!'\" She started speaking in her regular voice again, \"On the way out the door, I told her the look on her face was enough of a gift to me. I didn't get a good look at her during the first one since she was behind me, but during my second one, she seemed grossed out as usual, but after a while she also started looking kind of scared. Like she was afraid I was never going to stop farting or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After three days of Cloudsdale Chili, she's lucky you <i>did</i> stop farting,\" Spitfire joked. \"I was a little surprised when you said you could fart as loudly as I did earlier, but if you eat like that, then I probably have some catching up to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you should have fighting chance when we get down to the pool. I haven't gone <i>too</i> crazy with gassy food today,\" Rainbow Dash said. Her stomach loudly gurgled. \"Then again, I'm still the gassiest pony I know,\" she bragged, proudly rubbing her belly with one of her front hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did Rarity ever finish that dress?\" Spitfire asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rainbow said. \"She stopped talking to me for a couple days - which was probably for the best for her because I still had some Cloudsdale Chili left over - but she gave me this mushy little talk about how she thought I was immature for finding that kind of stuff funny, but she would be more immature to walk away from a friendship over something like that. But enough of the sappy stuff. Did that remind you of a good fart story?\"</span></div></div>",

I'd never assumed it had to do with your... little gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sit back, because this one's a doozy. About two years back, the team and I had just finished up a show at the Summer Sun Celebration. It was hot, we were all sweaty, so team showers were in order. I was feeling particularly gassy that day, so I figured I'd let a few out in the showers, no biggie. After all we've all passed gas around eachother in the locker rooms before, haven't we?\" Spitfire glaring knowingly at Rainbow, who returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So me and a few others are sharing a shower, I believe it was Fleetfoot and Cloudchaser, and I'm lathering up when I feel one coming on. And it came out big, I mean the entire shower rumbled a little, it was spectacular,\" Spitfire giggled as she continued to tell the story. \"So the others laugh a little and go about showering. It smelled, sure, but it's not like we weren't used to bad smells or anything. So we keep showering and I start to feel even more gas. The more I farted, the others started egging me on, and I started to play around with it. I farted into the water at the bottom of the shower in an attempt to make some bubbles, lathered my ass in liquid soap trying to get the same effect, and even let some go into a sponge. Everything from loud and thunderous to the classic silent but deadlies. It was so much fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow giggled at the various ways Spitfire used and manipulated her flatulence. She thought the two of them should take a shower together some day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as time went on, the smell only got worse and worse, to the point where the others started to ask me to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, of course not! I just kept going, loving it, but unfortunately the smell got so bad that the other two split, and soon enough I found out that I had evacuated the locker room single-handedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's mouth was agape. \"You evacuated an entire locker room with just your farts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. From that day on, I got stuck with the nickname 'Assfire'. I have to admit, I'm a little proud of it. And besides, now the team knows my true strength,\" Spitfire concluded, with a bit of a joking tone on that last point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I don't think even I could top that.\" Rainbow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been about 20 minutes.

She rushed back to where she saw Rainbow Dash and the group of ponies who had gathered around her to listen to her farts. Just as she had hoped, everypony was still there. In fact, the crowd had grown considerably in the short time she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and most of the other ponies were too busy laughing at her previous effort to notice the notorious blue unicorn approaching. Trixie hadn't heard many of Rainbow Dash's farts, but she could tell by the discussion of the crowd that she had quite the reputation for them. Trixie listened to the chatter of the crowd. \"You guys told me she was gassy, but I wasn't expecting <i>that!</i>\" one astonished newcomer exclaimed. \"That wasn't even one of her longer ones!\" another laughed. \"I'll bet she's the gassiest pony in all of Equestria!\" another murmured. Rainbow Dash seemed to be waiting for the crowd to settle down - she really wanted them to listen to this next one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, once the ponies who had gathered around her had gotten quiet enough for her to speak over them, Rainbow Dash called out, \"I think you're all gonna love this one!\" Rainbow Dash turned her back to the group, causing all the ponies in the front row to step back a few inches, obviously in preemptive attempt to avoid the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rainbow Dash could even think about farting, however, she was interrupted by a cry of\"Hold it!\" from Trixie. Rainbow Dash seemed to recognize the voice immediately. She turned back around and watched Trixie make her way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie, I'm kind of in the middle of something here,\" Rainbow Dash sighed once she was face to face with the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware,\" Trixie announced. She stood next to Rainbow Dash and faced the crowd, adopting her signature booming voice. \"I just wanted to prove I am still the best at <i>everything{/i]!\" Trixie boasted. Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes. \"I said it once before and I'll say it again: anything you can do I can do better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash chuckled a little. \"Yeah?\" Rainbow Dash said, turning back around. \"I doubt you can top <i>this!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further interruption Rainbow ripped the most enormous fart Trixie had ever heard in her life. The deep fart was so noisy that Trixie could swear she felt the ground beneath her shake a little. Then there was its sheer length. Trixie did not time it, but it felt like it lasted an eternity. Trixie's jaw fell agape in disbelief as it was still going strong after several seconds. Rainbow was clearly putting everything she had into this! Then the thick smell hit, causing Trixie to gag a little. She knew farts didn't smell good, but she wasn't expecting such a strong stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed and cheered after Rainbow Dash's fart came to an end. Of course, after sighing in relief, Rainbow Dash was laughing harder than anypony else. She shot Trixie a challenging glance and then continued to laugh a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Trixie asked in a voice she hoped would be perceived as unimpressed. \"The great and powerful Trixie farts like that in her sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was unsure if she would be able to top such an incredible fart even with magic, but since she had already bragged, she had no choice but to give it a shot.</i></span></div></div>",

It actually sounded like she was serious. Humdrum gulped. Praying for the power ponies to barge in at anytime now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mane-iac turned around and lifted herself up with her hair. Her flank less then a metre from Spikes face, making him blush. She then farted directly into his face, making him cough at the stench and for her to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. When I turned into this, those chemicals didn't only give me controllable hair. They also gave me something a bit...smelly.\" She told Humdrum as she blasted his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that stinks.\" Humdrum said as he coughed on the fumes he had to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That was what I was hoping for. Right now I'm having my goons prepare a weapon that will spread my dealt gas throughout maretropolis! All shall fall as they smell my stench!\" The mane-iac laughed as she looked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But until then, you get the privilege of being the first to smell my glorious air.\" The Mane-iac letting out a rather long fart this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumdrum was still hoping the power ponies would burst in at any minute now.
