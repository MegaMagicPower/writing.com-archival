Each sister had their own unique special ability and together they lived happily with the other tree spirits far from civilization.

So they took on human forms and set out for civilization. Upon arriving in populated lands they soon caused a ruckus. At first they only used their powers to awe the humans but soon were met by the rigid ideals of the human's religions and had to fight for their survival. Finally they fled back into the forests as the humans pursued. In response to the actions of the sisters, they were imprisoned by their Mother, Nature, in a glass bottle and buried for all of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere they waited for many years before their Father, Time, came upon them and offered them freedom if they agreed to give up their forms and powers. They accepted his offer and so he freed their minds and took them off to live with him at the edge of infinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the sisters had left their glass prison, their human bodies and powers remained behind in the form of a pure essence. And so, as the years passed, the bottle waited until one day it was freed from its dirt prison by a young boy. The boy carried the bottle with him to the grocery store where his father worked where he left it behind. That is where Joshua Tanner found the bottle when he was out shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua mistook the bottle for a bottle of syrup so he bought it and brought it home. There it sat for a few more weeks until one day Joshua opened it for use of waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first question is, was Joshua alone when he opened it?</span></div></div>",

She had bright, scarlet red hair, done up in a bun and held in place with twigs with little maple leaves still attached. She was wearing sparkling red eye-shadow and lipstick and was wearing an ankle length, brilliant red, asymmetric cut dress that almost seemed to have been made from sewn together, oversized maple leaves. On her feet were a pair of red high heeled shoes with maple leaves forming the buckle strap across the ankle. Beyond the clothes and slight makeup on her face, her skin was naturally radiant but was of the usual caucasian skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that there must be some strange sort of trick going on you look down only to have a head's eye view of the woman's body. Your eyes widened as you realized the two mounds in the top of the dress were your breasts and that the rest of the gorgeous body was yours as well. You start to freak out and hold up your new, thin arms in front of your face. It was then that something even more shocking happened. A glowing maple-leaf shaped forcefield appeared the instant you had raised your arms. The forcefield was about two feet tall and three feet wide and hovered just above and in front of your head. In your shock you wished that the forcefield would go away and it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you say, trying out your new voice at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then thrust your right arm outwards and will a forcefield to be projected in front of your palm. You jump slightly when a forcefield suddenly appears. You wonder how much control you have over the forcefields so you try to make it smaller and watch as it changes size to match your desires. Willing it out of existence you start to wonder if you have any other powers. This prompted a sudden change in your body and you looked back at the mirror only to see the new reflection of...</span></div></div>",

Her round face with short, pointed nose and small mouth was staring back at you with burgundy eyes. She was dressed in a dark green t-shirt with purple highlights around the neck and arms. Her red shorts were contrasted by a pair of glossy, dark green flats with little yellow gems on the toe. Her legs were shaved and bare and on her hand she had a cherry shaped ring. You begin to wonder who this strange woman was when you realized you were looking in the mirror. You stand up and step towards the mirror, confirming that the short woman you saw was yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" you blurt out in a playful sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning on a heel you stare back out the open window at the back yard. As you began to panic, thanks to your strange new body, you felt as though the tree outside had just greeted you in a friendly manner. Looking back at the mirror you wonder if this all was a rather bizarre hallucination brought about by something you ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what could cause this kind of hallucination? What?\" you scream out in your new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began to become hungry, thanks to your pouring over what could have caused you to imagine what you were just now going through. That was when something very strange happened. In the reflection you watched as a small bud grew, flowered, withered and became a cherry. All this happened, shockingly enough, in your new hair. Feeling for it you pulled and picked it off, feeling a slight tingle when you pulled it free of your head. Holding the berry in front of you, you confirmed that it was indeed a cherry of some sort.</span></div></div>",
