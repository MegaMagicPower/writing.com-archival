She's wearing a purple and white corset which stops above her belly button and shows some part of her large breasts. She's also wearing a mini-skirt of the same colors and heeled boots. Of course, she's got a witch hat on her head! <br>\r\nKarmilla is very ticklish on her belly, especially on her cute innie but she also likes to tickle people! Sometimes she gets tickled, but sometimes she manages to tickle people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty witch just bought a new grimoire! She wants to try all the potions but realizes she doesn't have enough ingredients... She has to go to magical places and find magical creatures in order to convince them to help her!

The mermaids enjoyed spending days like these sunning themselves, chattering and gossiping on the huge rocks of Mermaid Lagoon, and several were relaxing when Karmilla arrived on her broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted, observing them. There were four or five mermaids, pretty ones, in all: the first with short, blonde hair and blue eyes; the second with long, black hair and almond-shaped eyes; the third with medium, red hair and green eyes; the fourth with long, brunette hair and grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d they replied, regarding Karmilla with cautious eyes. Witches were distrusted by lighter creatures such as elves and pixies, which didn\u2019t help in collecting ingredients ;;at all \u2014 in fact, it was a hindrance, as these creatures had powers of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the witch smiled. \u201cI needed mermaid\u2019s tears for my potion.

She splashes over to the young witch, smiling mischievously. \"But mermaids don't just go around crying! We might need a bit of help.\" She twirls her hair in her fingers, staring at Karmilla with eagerness. She stretches out, giving the witch a good long look at her taut, shapely belly. \"I just wonder how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla can't help but stare at the mermaid's vulnerable midriff. With a nervous smile, she slowly reaches out her index finger towards the blond mermaid's inviting bare navel. \"Well...I think I might know a way to get you crying. But first, I must ask...\" She buries her nail deep into the aquatic vixen's cute little belly button and wiggles it all around. \"...are you mermaid's <i><b>ticklish</b></i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blondie mermaid squeals at Karmilla's ticklish touch. \"Ohohoho yehehs VERY ticklish heheh!\" She hugs her self and splashes all around, giggling and tittering up a typhoon of ticklish laughter. She makes no attempt to escape Karmilla's clutches- in fact, she seems to be relishing the torment. The other mermaids seem a bit less enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is <i>enough</i>! You will cease tickling Talasi <i>at once</i>!\" The grey eyed brunette loudly declares. Karmilla, startled, immediately retracts her tormenting finger from the wiggly mermaid she now knows as Talasi. The witch's supposed \"victim\", however, is less than amused with the other mermaid's \"rescue\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Kelspa! Are you afraid of a little tickling?\" The blue eyed mermaid crosses her arms, clearly annoyed. \"I was having fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaid called Kelspa blushes and looks away. \"Tickling is not fun! And it is beneath proud daughters of the sea to be touched by...<i>land dwellers</i>.<br>\r\n She says with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's not very nice!\" Talasi yells. \"Don't be mean to this girl just because she's a land dweller!\" She smirks with a sudden conclusion. \"I think miss hoighty toighty is just <i>too ticklish</i>! Is that it? Is mean, more-important-than-you, daughter of the sea Kelspa just a ticklish little minnow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face red, the haughty mermaid stretches up to her full height in an attempt to seem imposing. While a valiant effort, her blushing combined with a slight shaking betray her clear nervousness. \"No! I am not a ticklish little minnow!\" She angrily points to Karmilla. \"Fine then! Land dweller! Tickle us for your needed tears! I'm not afraid of you!\" The flustered witch can only nod at the angry mermaid's shaking finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Talasi clasps her hands together in happiness. \"So, land dweller...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karmilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Karmilla. We'll let you tickle us to tears.\" She winks at the tickle witch with a grin. \"Don't worry, we're all super ticklish.\" Karmilla looks down at the gathered mermaids. Talasi seems practically bouncing at the chance to get tickled. Kelspa glares at both the witch and her happy-go-lucky friend with pure contempt and nervousness. The red head shyly sways from side to side, both slightly fearful and a bit hopeful. The black haired mermaid's expression has remained a blank neutrality the entire conversation, and she continues her robotic gaze at the young witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Karmilla!\" Talasi giggles. \"But before we do this...\"</span></div></div>",

Full of colorful flowers and leafs, it was certainly the most beautiful palace she'd never seen! The pretty witch managed to meet the Queen with the help of the nice Elves guards who led her to the throne room. Once again, Karmilla was shocked because of the beauty of the Elf queen! She had the prettiest face and the best body ever! Her long black hair was reaching her thin exposed waist. Her shiny purple eyes were staring at Karmilla and her red luscious mouth was closed. The Queen had a long flowing silk skirt of white trimmed with gold lace, slung low on her hips.  Her short bodice matched, stopping short of where her ribcage ended, showing her perfect belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... Hello...\" Karmilla started, pretty impressed. \"I came here because I need some ingredients for my new potions... And umm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they?\" The Queen asked, her voice as beautiful as her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some strand of Elf's hair...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust witches....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!

It's not like she was asking for something really hard to get! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok..\" Karmilla replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" The Queen exclaimed. \"Drag her into the secret room\" She ordonned to guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karmilla's heart pounded once she noticed large fans being brought in her direction. Her naked, drenched body writhed in nervousness as the witch had no idea what their intentions were - an irritating fact about elves was that they were very mischievous and unpredictable in certain occasions. Her torso shimmered and her mug reddened as she was quite humiliated; standing in a humongous bathroom completely uncovered and observed by countless fully dressed elf maids with orders to make her undeniably suffer for their own pleasurable goals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down, or else we'll squirm about,\" the senior-looking one scolded whilst simultaneously poking her sides. Instantaneously, Karmilla erupted with winsome giggles - her boobs bouncing in the process, capturing the occupants' attention. During the installation of the blowers in front of the restrained captive, the oldest elf took advantage of her immobilized form by pinching and prodding her bare abdomen with glee. Her short fingernails oscillated her hypersensitive stomach from top to bottom consistently, smearing mild weight to generate the light, yet tingling sentiment on her delicate moist skin. Much to the torturer's delight, Karmilla was unable to suppress the boisterous guffaws from flooding the entire room as her taunt and vaguely toned belly was beguiled by hungry digits eating at her flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee eeehe ehehe heheheheheh! Nooe ehe heie heie ehieheiehe heehieheheoehoeheoehoeehehe oeo heoheheh eeh aheieh aehaha please! HE haha haha hahaahoa hoaoahaohahoaa I can't theheheheheh eheieheoehoeheoe!\" her ravishing mirth incited the creatures to continue even further. In due course, the ventilators were set accordingly and the titillation ceased impermanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla subsequently experienced cool air brushing her petite physique. It turned out that the vanes were harmless after all and it only served as freshener for her damped epidermis to evaporate. The necromancer utilized the opportunity to relax her poor sore muscles for the gruesome events to come. Her arms stopped bickering, her legs halted wobbling and her midriff refrained from suctioning. The witch enjoyed the peaceful moment with the materializing wind blowing against the contour of her membrane. The personage felt her strength recovering from the onslaught and her previously aching throat returned to its natural state. Karmilla discerned intrigued looks from her captors, but paid no concern to them for the time being. Her survival came first before her embarrassment and she needed to find some darn scenario to get her out of this mess - potion and ingredients be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough drying,\" the elf captain ordered the abeyance. The servants promptly obeyed to their superior and excused themselves from the emplacement. The strict and menacing commander switched her gaze to the aghast captive. \"It's time for you to get dressed, you little tramp. Her highness is awaiting in <i>that</i> room and she will not tolerate lateness. I'd hurry up if I were you, unless you want more punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla grunted and snatched the attire from one of the assistants' grasp. Her cheeks flustered as she changed in front of the hefty audience, and she quickly embraced the tight and skimpy costume. The assembly fit her like a glove, but it barely covered her figure. Her golden pants were very baggy and only attained a few inches above her groin. Her red crop top merely hid her ribcages, but everything below was left revealed to the world. She was not procured any sort of shoes, and the exclusive accessory consisted of a pearl necklace that she enveloped around the designated part. The worst apportionment was that her midsection, most ticklish spot, was utterly helpless to any sort of attack. The sovereign must have evidently schemed that precise element and the enchantress had fallen into her trap. The belly dancer outfit would definitely play a role in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, looks like our little slut finally got into her birthday suit,\" the same elf jestered demeaningly. The other underlings snickered at her and some squeezed her flanks as the slave walked past them. Unwilling tittering flew from her mouth like drool and her torment began once more. Standing in front of the headmistress, said person handcuffed Karmilla's hands together to prevent any struggling. The aged individual took the opportunity to skidded her nails on her glamorous and slender tummy, really digging into her integument as she tickled her venter thoroughly. Tears transcended the witch's sockets as she was subjected to another round of anguish with no hopes of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her assailant grew bored and led her through the palace's hallway. The castle had many doors in its premise, but the main attraction had yet to arrive. Ultimately, Karmilla and her subduers established themselves in front of a wide entrance that was guarded by two wardens. With a nod, they opened the giant doors and shoved the convict into its devices. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scenery displayed in front of her was quite intimidating; The Queen was sitting on her throne, alongside her favorite guards located near her in case of assassinations. The wide and open space was where Karmilla presumed that she'd be tortured in. Elves were dining and merely chatting along on the side seeing as it was a buffet. Waiters were serving drinks and exquisite food whilst the witch would be utilized as merriment for the domestics. All of a sudden, the conversations were dropped and their eyes laid on the newcomer - sizing her from top to bottom, partially exhibited due to her peculiar outfit. Males were getting enthusiastic as they contemplated so much bare skin and exchanged perverted grins amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like our entertainment has just showed up,\" the commander in chief shouted in her loud, booming voice. Her attire adjusted for the convenience as well; she wore a long, green dress that trailed behind as she took a step. A large portion of her cleavage was brandished with her gown, freely bouncing around as The Queen moved. \"Fellow elves, fairies, ogres and vampires, this little whore barged into <i>our</i> castle and demanded <i>our</i> belongings. After a polite refusal, she had the audacity to insult <i>me</i> and thought she could easily leave without any apologies. Such insolence needs to be punished before this criminal disrupts our population even further...who's with me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoisy yells of approval and excitement echoed through the site in a wildfire. Dozens of 'Yeah!', 'Teach her a lesson!' and 'Make her suffer!' were stated from the entire population - even children desired her retribution. Karmilla gulped and she knew that it was a big mistake to come her first, but it was too late to emerge with that realization - she'd have to deal with the consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In addition, we've discovered her deadly weakness. It seems that the hussy is remarkably<i> ticklish</i>...\" once the empress finished the sentence, resounding wails of 'Ooo' and 'Aaa' in the accommodation. \"Feast your eyes, my people, as she will be tormented in that department for your enjoyment. Guards, tie her up if you please...\" Her loyal attendants obeyed without any hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...let go of me!\" Karmilla clamored as the guardians seized her arms and dragged her to the center of the arena. Stationed at the core of the gridiron, metal chain shackles were established on the ground. Two henchmen grabbed her ankles forcefully and ensconced them into the restraints, locking them with a key. \"No...what are you doing? This is illegal; release me at once!\" Her efforts were discounted by the abettors, whom simply recouped their duties. Two more steel manacles were levered from the ceiling, reaching down to an appropriate levels for proper use. Her upper limbs were wrenched against her will and smuggled through the handcuffs. Her physique was stretched to its maximum extent and competently debilitated. Her butt stiffened and her torso rattled in a futile rebellion; the residents relished the sight of her sexy bod being paraded in all its prime, and her pitiful struggles as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've also taken the liberty of crafting a special lotion for this specific occasion,\" Her Highness explained to the dazzled audience. \"It will be the first time testing it out on our lovely victim.\" Many dependents stalked towards Karmilla in a hassle, a bottle of baby oil in their possession. Said person incontestably petrified as the elves were right nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe individuals dipped a massive amount of the fluid in their palms and mixed them in for good measure. The treatment began once they connected the liquid with her biceps, spreading the oily substance all over her naked flesh. The succulent had a rancid smell to it, but the sentiment was sort of pleasurable. However, her opinion changed once she felt tingling awareness on her epidermis; whatever they were doing, it made her even more volatile than she was prior to this. The consciousness heightened once they advanced to her ticklish armpits, diffusing the grease on her deep hollows. Guffaws developed as their fingers started to lightly scratch while concurrently dispersing the pomade around her contour. The servants compressed the container once more and the baby oil descended into their open dukes. They progressed to her thighs and legs, sweeping the texture thoroughly and exotically. Grunts of frustration with a mixture of recreation spurted her throat, moderately reveling in. Although, her anxiety spiked up after Karmilla became conscious of the remaining area that was not excoriated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...not my belly, I beg of you! I'm so ticklish th-guh!\" her plea was impeded by four metacarpus slathering the article on her denuded stomach. Not a single sector of her midriff was left uncovered by the concreteness - even her back and spine were touched up. Giggles surfaced with mere rubbing and god knows what would happen if they commenced tickling her. Karmilla could feel her tummy growing thrice as sensitive as before, twisting and turning in her posture. Her knuckles tightened and she yanked at her arms, attempting to block the throbbing gut reaction. \"Hehehe hehe ehoehe ahaha ehiea heieah ehheheheh ehehehehe pleahahaa hahaahhahse ehe heoe hee oho ahoaehoaeoaehaha I can't! Hehe ohoeeh eha ahhahahae iea ihaehieaieaaaaaaa NO!\" A finger entered her navel and twirling around her innie, sometimes probing the delicate knot. Karmilla blatantly screamed in agony as her belly button was assaulted with the moist phalange, transferring the precipitation to her umbilicus. The extremity retracted from her crevice whilst the witch breathed in relief. It was horrible, but it had not even begun yet. She had doubts whether she'd even survive the ordeal, swallowing her saliva in uneasiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Various creatures were living there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise was in fact a pretty elf who was picking flowers. She started to sing and the beauty of her voice really surprised Karmilla.

Good thing the creatures know the way to get out of there because she was completely lost! Then she realized how quiet the Dryads were and froze. <br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a big ivy wrapped around her arms and legs. She was pressed against an oak and, because of the ivy, couldn't move anymore. Her magic broom was too far from her and the branches tightened around her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pausing for a moment to circle around their bound prey, taking in every exposed and bound-taut inch of her body, the dryads simply thought in menacing silence for a good few seconds. To Karmilla, these felt like some of the longest seconds of her life - gasping then panting and trying to take in all that had just happened. She'd admitted to a secret desire of hers to complete strangers, and now she was helpless and wanting more before people more than willing to give her just that... to say she was anxious was an understatement, but that came with it an odd feeling of excitement. Though she wouldn't admit it again - or at least she <i>hoped</i> she wouldn't - she wanted more, and that was plainly written across her adorable, flushed-red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, looks like she's having fun...\" the youngest remarked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's learned her lesson... but it's so clear she wants more...\" another added, matching her sister's grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... so it's rude of us to keep her from what she wants...\" the eldest concluded, drawing in with her twiglike fingers wiggling. Karmilla braced herself for the worst-- only for it not to come, even after a couple seconds of silence. \"But... say... we still don't know why our bewitching friend happened by here, do we?\" she started again, leading the brunette to peek an eye open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we ask you a few questions about exactly what brought you here? In exchange... we'll give you <i>all</i> the fun you want...\" the eldest dryad suggested, and Karmilla's eyes widened in shock and... a bit of pleasure. She had to admit, she was good at this... and more would be so much fun... caught simply dreamily gazing at the trio of dryads before her for a good few seconds, each simply giggled at her nonverbal response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're so eager... why don't we get started? Question one...\" is the last thing Karmilla coherently managed to hear before the tickling began again. A single prodding finger started to wiggle around in her little belly button immediately, daintily scratching at its walls and sending her into hysterics. All the while, five fingers each danced on her sides, forcing her hips to sway and swing entrancingly, egging on her tormentors. It was the youngest that was the trickiest, she managed to notice - she darted around from place to place testingly, stroking in the pits of her arms and drawing teasing circles around her nipples with single fingers and toying with the pits of her knees and making her soles dance and playing games with her little toes. She even seemed eager to swap places with her elder sister, tickling blubbering answer after blithering reply out of Karmilla's poor little sensitive innie. Unfortunately, she never got the chance, as Karmilla was to be given no breaks - no release, so she would remain putty in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd remain she did, begging and crying and squealing all with a big, silly smile plastered across her face as she did. Karmilla couldn't even remember what she was saying seconds after it came out, but she could feel the pleasantly agonizing experience every last nerve ending in her delicate little body was suffering. Eventually she became nearly hypnotized by the state of forced laughter she was left in, simply watching the ever-moving lips of the elder sister acting as her interrogator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla laughed and sobbed until she could do neither any longer, and could swear she felt something damp between her legs, though what that was, she couldn't quite tell. When the tickling finally stopped, her giggling didn't, but she could finally make out what she was saying and hearing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Awww, how adorable... couldn't hold it?\" The youngest dryad teased, eying her between the legs. Paling then flushing again with embarrassment, Karmilla managed to find the energy to look away if only for a moment. \"Clean her up and get her dressed,\" the eldest said to the last in an authoritative but warm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven she was looking away, she didn't notice until the last second that the youngest was closing in on her - and planted a little teasing kiss on her lips, tongue worming between her lips for a moment. Little moans left both of them as the split-second kiss occurred, and... once it was over, Karmilla felt something sweet and thick settling on her tongue. \"Good, isn't it?\" she commented with a little giggle, and Karmilla couldn't help but nod. \"Swallow. It'll be good, I promise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist in mind or body at that point, Karmilla swallowed, and immediately began to feel dizzy and even weaker. Everything started to get foggy, and her body wouldn't respond even as she started trying to squirm and thrash in the ivy binding her body - but, in a matter of seconds, her eyelids drooped and shut and her jaw slacked, put to sleep with a little gentle nudge from the dryad's sap. Had she been more coherent... she might have remembered a kiss from a dryad tends to have <i>unique</i> effects on non-dryads... unconsciousness being a likely result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she wakes, what awaits for Karmilla?</span></div></div>",

Below her was a bed, similar to her own, and on her body was just the same clothing as she always liked to wear. Eyes flying open out of shock at her last memory, she tensed and panicked for a moment... then started to catch her breath, letting out a sigh after she finally did. It was a dream, surely. She'd dreamed of similar things before, but it had never felt so... real, so intense. She adjusted herself a little and heard something odd, but disregarded it. Maybe she could stand to give herself a little bit more relief on a regular basis - she'd been so focused on her progress with magic and on this thing and the other that she must have been letting herself get pent-up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But something felt odd. She never slept with her arms up and legs apart, and she felt something odd, something tight and thick, around her upper arms and lower legs, binding her from wrist to elbow and ankle to knee. She was spread in something of an X on the bed she was laying in, and no matter how hard she pulled, it seemed like she wouldn't be able to get anywhere like this. She felt ivy under her skirt tightly weaved against her skin, where she normally swore she wore clothing. It was her grunts and struggling that led someone into the sort of bedroom she found herself in, a familiar face - the eldest dryad from earlier, still as shapely and seductive as ever, fingers teasingly wiggling at her sides. \"Good morning, Karmilla,\" she murmured, and Karmilla felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand for a moment. <i>how did she know her name?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories started to flood back - answering questions through tickle torture for what felt like hours and hours. She gulped and shot back, \"what are you doing to me? Why are you keeping me like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is simple,\" the dryad replied quickly after. \"You told us a few... interesting things, and so I'd like to learn a little more. Maybe get my hands on a few things... and on you, of course.\" She giggled in amusement and sat down on the bed, between Karmilla's arm and leg, resting perpendicular with her chest pressed to Karmilla's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how rude can I be? I've not even introduced myself,\" she noted, and then shrugged. \"My name is Azalea. I suppose I owe you that much, after everything you said and offered.\" Karmilla gave her a confused and shocked look, at that - what <i>had</i> she told these dryads that was so important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to thank you for being so kind as to offer us your grimoire. And I have to agree... you're a much more suitable little ticklee than anything...\" she started again, one finger tracing little circles around her navel. Karmilla gasped and bit her lip, unable to hold back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I did what--? Ehehehe...!\" she started to pull and yank at the new vines that restrained her arms here, but they wouldn't budge - and seemed to give less and less slack as she fought them. \"No...! Lehehehet me go...!\" she tried to say, but could barely do so while holding back laughter. Even just this light touching was driving her crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not sorry,\" Azalea replied, continuing without pause, eyes gazing at her little innie, almost entranced. \"My sisters already left to gather your--\" she pauses for a moment. \"Sorry, <i>our</i> things. Guess what? You're moving in!\" she cooed, bending down to plant a raspberry on her tummy, wiggling her tongue into her belly button afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHAHP!\" Karmilla nearly screamed, but got an eerie feeling like nobody heard her except herself and her tormentor. \"I don't wahahant this-- let me gohoho!\" she begged, gasping for breath between helpless laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you <i>do</i>,\" Azalea noted without missing a beat. \"You asked for it yourself, don't you remember? 'I want to be yours! Let me be your tickle-slave forever, please!'\" she added, half-mockingly taking on Karmilla's own tone. \"You kept shouting that between answers after a while, you poor little thing... you really DO like it, don't you? Tell me, how long have you been burying your cute little desires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla simply blushed heavily and looked away, trying to put on a strong face - but that only provoked Azalea to start gently stroking under her arms, forcing a smile to crack her attempted tough expression. \"C'mon, I know you heard me...\" she prodded, slowly adding one finger after the other to the wiggling set in each pit. \"If you don't answer, I'll just have to get even worse... <i>but you like that, don't you</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little \"pfffft\" slipped out which Karmilla couldn't help. She started to kick and squirm and wanted to get free, but no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't. \"It doesn't matter. You've already agreed to make us all the potions we'd like from your little grimoire, and I know how adorably sensitive your precious body is... so we can make you cooperate. It just might take a while.\" Something about this was... oddly pleasant, for Karmilla. While she enjoyed her freedom, and wanted to work at her own pace... something about this seemed like it might just be ideal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... will you be my <i>willing</i>, well-behaved little tickle toy? Or will I have to <i>make</i> you behave?\" Azalea asked, eyes finally shifting to meet Karmilla's. Though she felt a little odd doing so... she had to think about it. She could keep fighting it... but did she want to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I...\" Karmilla started, voice shaking a little out of embarrassment. \"Okay, okay! I'll be...\" she continued, turning red in the cheeks and starting to look away. \"a tickle-slave... <i>your</i> tickle slave,\" she finished meekly, unable to help a little smile from crossing her face. Something about saying that was exciting, even if she couldn't manage to say it in much more than a whisper. The light teasing being dealt to her navel didn't help her ability to hold back, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you, now?\" the drop-dead gorgeous dryad teasing her looked... shocked, for a moment, then started to giggle. Karmilla gave her another confused look, then asked, \"what's so funny?\" finally able to speak coherently thanks to Azalea being too distracted to keep lightly tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying it like that... you're so adorable,\" she observes, then shifts a twig-fingered hand up to pinch Karmilla's cheek. \"I'm going to keep you having the time of your life for a <i>long</i> time... you've made a very good decision, and I'm sure you'll agree soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of exactly what her new playmate means, Karmilla tilted her head - then watched she stood and walked over to a drawer in a table on the other side of the room. She rooted through it for a moment, then rose back up, clutching a bundle of toys to her chest - which she set on top of the table, afterwards plucking a select few from the ensuing pile including three dainty rings, a small perfectly-rounded amethyst, and a white belt with a similar amethyst buckle, all matching her outfit. \"What are those?\" The brunette witch asked, hat tipped back and pressed to the bed's headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few rewards for being so... well-behaved,\" Azalea replies rather vaguely before flipping down the front of Karmilla's corset, revealing her breasts while leaving the rest on. This was... uncomfortable, and provoked a shocked squeak from the witch, but she could get used to it if she had to. Fortunately, she didn't - instead a moan wiggled its way out of her as she felt the tiny little rings get fit onto her nipples. Oddly enough, they weren't uncomfortable. In fact... they were oddly pleasant, even as they tightened and loosened seemingly on their own, trying to find the right size for a perfect fit. While she was distracted by the two forming correctly on her nipples, she didn't notice one other slipping under the ivy formed between her legs, the last ring shifting shape to cup her little button down there, eliciting a <i>much</i> more shocked and excited moan from Karmilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're only getting started,\" Azalea mused before taking the amethyst in hand. She then pressed a hand down on Karmilla's stomach after flipping her skirt and corset back into place, stretching her navel and earning a few giggles from the sensitive little living toy she'd just earned. As she did, she fit the amethyst in on one side, then stretched the others to ensure it would be perfectly snug. It was... oddly pretty, looking at it from her bound position, Karmilla had to admit - but she sensed something magical about what she was being put into. What precisely, she was too groggy to realize, but something was amiss here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly came the belt, which the dryad looped into her skirt before fastening and locking at the deep purple buckle with a twigged finger. The lock didn't quite function like a standard one - it demanded a dryad's finger, it seemed, so Karmilla had a feeling she wouldn't be getting this off any time soon unless she asked very nicely and offered something very enticing to one of the dryads. Any hope she might have had to lead them on and make them believe she was willing, only to escape when their guard was down... was likely dashed, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the lovely little implements I've placed on you will be activated if you obey orders. Depending on how nicely you behave, they will turn on for longer. The jewel in your cute little belly button will vibrate, tickling you. That belt activates all the other ticklish nerves in your body... and we know how much you <i>love</i> that. As for the rings... those will ensure you get lots of pleasure out of the experience. If you don't love it already, you'll learn to. If you'd like... since you were so forthcoming with information about your magical findings and abilities, I'll even give you a test run,\" Azalea concludes after explaining in-depth the assortment of glorified behaviour correctors now attached to the ticklish witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla is immediately left conflicted - her new playmate seems interested in watching her squirm and hearing her giggle, that much she can tell from the look on her face. Getting in good with the eldest of the dryads could be good for her... but if she has any hopes of escaping, they might melt into obedience if she starts to enjoy her predicament. She could refuse, if she finds a polite way to do it - phrasing it like <i>I want to save it for when I earn it</i> could do well enough. Or... she could ask to be unbound during and after her test run. Having a look around here from outside what seems like a prison cell of a bedroom could help her escape - or, if she's feeling particularly well-disposed to her captors, she could help them sort her former things and continue work on potions and projects she'd been working on previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

What she's thinking <i>may</i> just decide her fate now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she genuinely find the thought of this arousing - or maybe she's interested in acting subservient, from here on out? After all, she did just catastrophically fail even the most basic of tasks as a witch. Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to toss the hat in and really, truly give into this whole 'being tickled forever' thing. She'd already admitted she liked it, too, and had even agreed to stick around. She also didn't really have anything to head back to, if Azalea was to be believed - her things were no longer <i>her</i> things. So why not let the dryads do the thinking from here on out and act as something of a stress relief toy? It seemed a pretty decent living, at least at a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she trying to <i>seem</i> obedient in the hopes that she can escape, even in the equipment she's been given? Surely she hadn't practiced and studied magic all this time for nothing - to be a <i>toy</i> for the rest of her days. Sure, this sounded slightly appealing - slightly - and while she may have admitted she enjoyed herself, who said she wanted to spend forever doing the same thing? She certainly didn't. If she played her cards right, maybe she could escape with enough of her things to start back from scratch again... or maybe she could even find a way to best her captors to get <i>all</i> of her things back, and then some! Wouldn't that be a dream come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr... maybe she's just ready for it to be over? She may have had all her fun, and maybe she's ready for the ride to be over with. Have a little fun with the girls, live out the rest of her time as their tickle-slave simply and uneventfully. Maybe she's ready to surrender all agency in her life for this, including any potential chance at helping or hindering the dryads' progress with her own books, material and experiments. Maybe she's looking around this very room right now and thinking that it would do as a pretty nice home for the rest of time - that she wouldn't mind letting this be the end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which of her thoughts is correct - or, at least, what's <i>really</i> going through her head, as she answers Azalea's question?</span></div></div>",

This coming from the same girl that loved her little lesson so much, she even...\" Azalea murmurs, hand reaching down under her skirt - she doesn't finish her sentence, trailing off and gently stroking with a pair of fingers against the ivy formed tightly to her body beneath her skirt. It feels... <i>good.</i> Distractingly so, even better than she would go down there herself. It didn't take long for it to hit her, what exactly she'd been made to do by her tormentors - she'd proven she liked it, in words and in actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can make you do that again, and again, and again...\" Azalea comments, as if reading her mind - though Karmilla was certain dryads could do no such thing. \"Until you come to accept what you love, and start playing nice. I think I'll leave you with a little something for now, let you think and laugh on your own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this that the shapely dryad shifted to a bedside table a few steps from the bed itself - really, it was more just a table at this point, occupying a far corner of the almost prison cell-sized room. It had a few drawers, all of which were locked and could not be opened by a key - instead requiring a twiglike finger be placed in what would otherwise be a keyhole. Opening one such drawer, Azalea began to hum and ponder over exactly what to subject her defiant closeted tickle-lover to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she could simply let the vines themselves have some fun. They would feed off her sweat, tears, fluids and magical energy, ensuring she'd be kept entertained until she ran out of all of those. She could also rub a bit of numbing salve into her navel and fit that old tickling piercing into it - but that thing couldn't really be deactivated, so she would just be stuck with it for who knows how long, and after that numbing salve for handling the piercing itself wore off, she'd probably run the risk of completely losing it. Lastly, she could always loop that tickle belt she'd been keeping around Karmilla's skirt. Her sides and stomach were ticklish enough as it was, and that could be turned on and off at Azalea's will - it would be a nice way to keep the brunette witch disciplined. But which to leave her with? Which would tickle her into submission and keep her sane enough to be useful?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karmilla felt weird when she woke up. She took few seconds to notice she had been freed from her bounds but was too dizzy to run away. The three Dryads were smiling in front of her, patiently waiting for her to stand up. The brunette did so and rubbed her head, the diziness was fading away as the oldest creature came to her. The two others helped her to walk and this sudden kindness felt odd to the witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, take a look at you\" said the Oldest by bringing her close to the river nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was so clear she could see her reflection without any problem. At first, the brunette was too shocked to say a word but after few seconds she yelped and looked at her face and body, terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin became greenish and her hair was made of leaves. She put her hands in front of her eyes and realized her fingers were thin and very twig-like. She had been released from her clothes and her womanhood and nipples were covered by leaves and branches. On the top of that, her legs were longer, her breasts bigger and her belly button deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the....\" She gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You became a Dryad.\" Stated the Oldest with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's fine. You'll see, life as a Dryad is cool!\" the Youngest said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... What... Will I ever...\" Karmilla stuttered, a thousand of questions were running into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually we didn't intend to transform you but it seems like you reacted to the sap this way... Maybe your witch's blood. We usually have fun with lost humans you know and the only effect to them is deep sleep...\" The Third said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette started to whine, completly lost and the Oldest made her stand up, patting her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" She said, trying to calm her down. \"After all, is your witch's life worth it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Karmilla started, wiping her tears. \"I never thought about it... I mean, I never had the occasion until now to be something else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how to think about this. This situation was too new for her and she just felt lost. As a witch, she had to pass a lot of exams, graduate from University, find a job.... A lot of stress ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is Dryad's life?\" She asked after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We live in the woods, harmonizing with nature\" The Youngest said, with cute gestures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talking trees looked much more friendly now that Karmilla was part of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a Queen and what could be considered as a city, all made of plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we should bring you to her.\" The Oldest said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch sobbed again, still unsure about her future. Will she ever be able to come back to her previous state? What if the Queen orders her death? She wasn't a real Dryad after all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop cryyiiiing...\" The Oldest sang with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped her long finger inside Karmilla's deep and lovely innie and wiggled it very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\" The young woman roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly button was deeper, the finger managed to reach a place that couldn't be touched before and much more ticklish. The wriggling sent her to hysterics as she was jerking her upper body, trying to escape. She felt like she was more ticklish as a Dryad. The creature eventually stopped and Karmilla panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" she said. \"Dryads are ticklish but you are far more sensitive than us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was already deathly ticklish as a witch\" her sister commented. \"Maybe her witch's sensitivity and her Dryad's sensitivity just added up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be right. So I guess, pleasure has been multiplied as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla didn't agree but blushed. Which made her light green skin became dark green. Dryads giggled and dragged her deeper in the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Queen will love it. You will have a wonderful ritual!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the woman could ask more details about the ritual, she had an idea about it though, Dryads' pace went faster as the dragged her further. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is she from another tribe?\" She asked with a clear voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dryads explained the situation and Karmilla bowed. The Queen stood up and came closer. The brunette gulped and tried to smile. The Dryad looked at her with piercing eyes. She was different from others. She was slightly taller and her greenish skin was lighter. She had a huge wooden crown on her head and her leaves-hair was set up in a complicated hairstyle. Unless other Dryads, her nipples and womanhood were covering by flowers, and not leaves. Her deep belly button looked delicious and her heavy chest followed the rhythm of her breath. Her round butt was totally naked and her long legs were slim. She grazed Karmilla's rim and she giggled loudly, squirming her body and jiggling her boobs. The Queen smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. If you became one of us, it means you were fated to be a Dryad! Welcome among us, my dear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Dryads in the palace applauded and the Trio squealed with happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can see, your sensitivity looks very exciting. To be honest I would love to test it. However, since you're a newcomer in our society, I will let you decide.\" The Queen spider tickled Karmilla's naked side, who shrieked, before going back to her throne. \"Do you want to let me have fun with you or do you want to have fun with your first lost Human in the forest?\" She sat and her busty chest bounced as her butt touched the structure. </span></div></div>",

Karmilla entered, a little bit nervous, and waited for instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lied on the wooden bed, as being told by the Queen, and got restrained by plants as soon as her sensitive skin touched the furniture.  She didn't protest but slightly gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen gazed at the young woman and pondered. Her breath made her belly quiver slightly, making her lovely innie move. The shape was perfect and the depths inviting. Was it because she was a Witch before? The Queen couldn't tell for sure, but this belly button was certainly the hottest she had never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla patiently waited without moving as the Royal Dryad tried to make a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be better to play with some insects in her cute navel? The Idea was tempting. Many fluffy creatures were waiting for the occasion to titillate some skin. As the Dryad was about to open the chest containing them she stopped herself and thought of something. It had been a while since her own belly button hasn't been tickled. She had a personal tickler but maybe the former witch's approach would be more innovative? </span></div></div>",

The fingers slowly grazed her lower belly, sending the witch\u2019s belly into quivers as the ticklish sensations from her belly made her giggle. Just as she thought the Dryad had forgotten about her belly button, she felt one of those long, dry fingers begin to circle her belly button\u2019s rim. She gasped and broke into giggles as she pleaded \u201cHEHEHEHEHhehehehhe PLEEEEAAASSEEE HEHEH NooOt myyy Bbelly Bbbuttooooon hehehHEHEHE!\u201d. The Dryad only smiled wider as she dipped her finger into the sensitive tummy button of the Karmilla. The young witch broke out into loud belly laughs as her most sensitive spot was explored, and the other dryads slowed their tickling to watch their comrade utterly break their tickle toy with just one finger to her belly button. The navel-tickling dryad smiled smugly at her sisters, saying \u201cNow we HAVE to keep her, after all, we can\u2019t let a tickle button like this go to waste\u201d-and she turned towards towards Karmilla as she dug her finger just a little deeper into the witch\u2019s sensitive navel- \u201ccan we now?\u201d. Karmic last could only shake her head in hysterical laughter as she pleaded through teary eyes \u201cHAHAHAHAH NOOOOOO PLEEEEAAASEEE HAHAHAHAH LEEET MEHEHEHEHE GOOOOOOHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d The Dryad\u2019s sisters immediately dig into Karmilla\u2019s sides and the navel-tickling dryad added her left hand to the witch\u2019s quivering lower belly to tickle with strokes and scratches. Karmilla\u2019s laugh went up an octave as the Dryad said \u201cNow don\u2019t you go begging us to be released anymore! You are OUR toy and OUR slave, you don\u2019t get to be free anymore. Not when such a delicious belly button is ours to tickle however we want!\u201d Karmilla nodded wildly, hoping agreement would stop the incessant and maddening tickles. Karmilla shakes her hips as the Dryad\u2019s finger twists faster in her belly button, and the dry bark of her finger titillates every one of the sensitive nerves in the witch\u2019s tickle button. The Dryad\u2019s finger delves deeper in to Karmilla\u2019s belly button and plumbs the girl\u2019s most sensitive depths by swirling her fingertip across the smooth bottom of Karmilla\u2019s belly button. With this, Karnilla\u2019s laughter reached the silent stage and her head began to swim from the lack of oxygen. The Dryad noticed this and said to her sisters \u201cWe should bring her back home, she\u2019s almost ours to play with forever\u201d. Hearing this, Karmills used all of her fading strength to struggle against her bonds one last time, but to no effect. Her struggles only shoved her belly forwards, pushing the dryad\u2019s finger deeper into her belly button, allowing it to stroke the unbelievably, indescribably ticklish folds that surround her navel knot at that core. Her screech of silent laughter was not unnoticed by the Dryads and the lead one remarked, as Karmilla\u2019s oxygen finally failed and she slipped into unconcioisnedd after this new wave of tickled, \u201cHer core is her weak point, that reaction was amazing. I can\u2019t wait to dive in and discover the ticklish secrets it holds. This little witch and her tickle button were the catch of a lifetime!\u201d And with that, Karmilla succumbed to darkness. Do the Dryads wait for her to wake up in their home deeper into the forest, or do they wake her up along the way as they are eager to explore the ticklish core of Karmilla\u2019s button? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karmilla awoke to feel herself being jostled and carried by the dryads. She was on a stretcher made of bark and leaves, with her wrists tied to its frame. The head Dryad, hearing the witch\u2019s mumbled groan of awakening, turned back to smile at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said to her sisters carrying the stretcher \u201cset our friend down. Since she is awake now, I see no reason to have a little fun before we get home. Come to think of it, I know a way to keep this little witch occupied for the whole trip!\u201d, as her face breaks into a wicked smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters out Karmilla down and step out of hearing range for a moment to converse. All Karmilla can overhear are faint whispers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked last time...\u201d \u201cyes but last time was a different type of navel...\u201d \u201cbut it got that girl to submit didn\u2019t it sister?\u201d \u201cYes yes, fine. But what type of...?\u201d \u201cI think I know just the one\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryads returned, each smiling forebodingly. One ran off to the trees and seemed to be rummaging behind a log for a while. She returned and Karmilla gulped in confusion and fear when she saw what the dryad held in her fingers: a wriggling, fuzzy worm. Karmic last started up at her captors in confusion. She was still face up on her stretcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryad holding the worm saw this look and smiled, saying \u201cyou might be able to guess what we plan to do with this little worm. The last girl we had come though here had a navel too thin for us to tickle. Her belly was wonderful but her true weak point was barred from our fingers. My sisters and I found another way to drive the girl wild. Our fingers couldn\u2019t fit in her belly button, but a worm like our little friend here could. Oh how she squirmed and laughed all the way home! We\u2019re betting this little thing will draw the same effects. Let\u2019s try it out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the dryad dropped the little worm right next to the belly button of Karmilla. Her sexy hips shook and she was almost belly dancing out of her skirt trying to get the worm to leave her belly. She looked down in fear as the little thing squirmed over her rim and began its descent. She looked up at her captors for pity just as the worm began its path across the inner walls of her belly button. Giggles erupted immediately from the tickles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahahahahpllleeeeeaaaaseegeeetiiitouuutthehhahahahHAhahahaha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryads only giggled and bent to pick up the stretcher to continue their walk. They knew that wasn\u2019t the last plea they\u2019d hear, indeed the worm hadn\u2019t truly even begun to torture Karmilla. Eventually she\u2019d reach the point behind begging when she just would accept the work that danced across her most ticklish depths. But there\u2019d be a while before then, so the dryads began walking and enjoying Karmilla\u2019s ever growing desperate laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worm dove deeper into the witch\u2019s ticklish tummy button. The tiny creature wriggled across the walls of her belly button and stroked the soft crevices found there. Karmilla\u2019s laughter ratcheted up a notch and she began to shake her head and hips in a mad hope to dislodge the worm. That hope died as her back arched and her laughter rose to hysterical levels when the worm finally reached the folds at the bottom of the witch\u2019s belly button. Her hour glass figure shook with laughter as her tummy quivered from ticklish sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for about 30 minutes of torturous laughter the dryads adored until they all smiled wickedly as they saw their tickle slave reach a new level of belly button tickling. The young witch\u2019s body tended and her belly button shivered vulnerably as the worm squirmed across the tender knot at the core of the witch\u2019s belly button. Her eyes flew wide and her head shook from side to side as her laughter caught in her throat. The dryads merely laughed and knew their captive was going to enjoy the looong walk back to their home. The witch glanced down at her belly button as the tickle button at its core was stroked by an unseen yet deviously small creature. She threw her head back as the worm traveled over a particularly soft fold in her belly button and she tried to struggle in her bonds in the hopes to end the insane tickled to her belly button. All thoughts of resistance failed when the worm again wriggled across the tickle core of her belly button. The little slit in which this button was found, her navel clit, was tickled by this worm incessantly. The boisterous laughter of Karmilla often arching up into silent hysterics was the only sound as the dryads marched towards their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla could be heard from her stretcher letting the world know her belly button was being tickled. Her laughter was automatic and out of her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHhahahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHPLEEEEEAAAASEEEEHAHAHAHAHAHHhahahA\u2014\u2014-\u201c and the silent laughter again took her pleas away as the worm seemed to always know just when to stroke the folds to reveal the witch\u2019s tickle button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus this continued until the dryads reached their home, an overgrown cave that led into their spacious subterranean home. Here they can finally enjoy their new tickle slave directly. Do they...</span></div></div>",

She didn't have time to wonder how the talking tree managed to come behind her without a sound that the creature spoke again. \"...Waiting for a delicious flesh like yours..\" with that sentence, she slightly wiggled her slender fingers on the witch's sides, making her yelp and giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla quickly stepped aside and had no doubt about the Dryad's intentions who were looking at her, smiling, with luscious glee in their eyes.

When she couldn't hear their curses anymore, she went behind a bush and looked around her. No Dryads in sight. They probably decided to find another victim. After all, many creatures were coming through the forest. Even humans who wouldn't be able to defend themselves like Karmilla would. She was a witch after all, she could have cast a spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette caught her breath and waited for a while. She then walked again, still looking for the ingredients of her potion. She needed it to pass an important test of the Magic Academy. Though, she never have thought it would have been that complicated to find those ingredients.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch froze when she heard a soft sound. Quickly hiding behind a tree, she took a glance. She saw a woman who didn't seem to notice her presence. Long black hair reaching her hips and small face with sensual crimson lips were already gorgeous enough, but Karmilla couldn't help but stare at her perfect body. She had big perfect round breasts, a small waist and a perfect hourglass figure. No to mention her oval and deep belly button with a crimson jewel in it, the brunette wondered about her legs but a bush was hiding the girl's lower body. However, the glowing golden skin of the stranger made Karmilla realized that she was totally naked, which was quite unusual. There was no river in sight, why would she put herself naked in the middle of the forest? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger streched out with a sensual moan, her boobs bouncing and the red ruby stuck in her belly button moving erotically, making the witch shivers a little bit. This creature was so stunning, it was hard to feel nothing about it, even as a straight girl. She was definitely not human. Humans could be good looking, of course, but they would never be as gorgeous and sensual as magic creatures. The girl, still looking like she was not noticing the witch, started to move away from the bush and Karmilla's jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower body of that girl was like a snake! She was a Naja! The witch gulped. Naja were, as most of magical creatures let's face it, gorgeous but could be lethal. They were half snake after all, most of people couldn't consider this animal like a friendly pet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this one could be different. After all, Karmilla was a witch which were supposed to be old ugly women hiding in the woods and all dressed in black, but she was totally different from that stereotype, like many of her friends by the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naja was moving away, it was time to make a decision. Maybe she would help?</span></div></div>",

Karmilla got onto her knees and starting looking into the bushes in front of her. She jumped as a boney finger poked her butthole through her underwear. Karmilla was quick to her feet to see a troll standing behind her. It was roughly her height, maybe a bit taller. The troll wore rags that barely covered his greenish-grayish skin and a bow on his back.<br>\r\n\"Did you poke my butt?\" Asked a curious witch. The troll stood there silently, occasionally looking down to her exposed innie.<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a nice butt.\" The troll replied in its deep voice.

You trolls are too big!  You can tongue and finger my anus, but that\u2019s the extent of it.  Capiche?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll was already drooling copious amounts of sticky saliva from its gaping maw as it shook its head in a vigorous, \u201cYES!\u201d while touching itself in a vulgar fashion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamilla turned and spread her legs apart while bending over and grasping a thick tree trunk.  The troll behind her was breathing heavily as she felt her panties pulled down around her knees, and then his thick lips and wet tongue began lapping around her ass-cheeks, furtively inserting it in between her long legs and then gently into her anus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was repulsed by her partner, the feeling was enormously pleasurable, and Kamilla took to moaning and arching her back in ecstasy while the troll inserted its tongue further into her anus.  She could tell by the rapid panting that the beastly creature was enjoying itself enormously, and was surprised when suddenly, the tongue grew inside her, ballooning into a thick round mushroom-like tip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  What are you doing, troll?!?  I want your tongue out now!\u201d, demanded Kamilla, as she tried to pull her bottom away from the engorged tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh cah hep it!  Mu hong has a haw-on!\u201d, cried the troll as it tried to pull its enlarged tongue back out of the pretty witches bottom.  Yanking back, actually pulling the young witches feet clean off the ground, the troll was again and again met with resistance as the bulbous head of its tongue kept him from pulling his tongue free of Kamilla\u2019s tender bottom.  Each attempt ended with her screaming and a slapping sound as his face again wound up mashed in between her smooth round cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamilla was yelling at the hapless troll, and didn\u2019t even hear him as he tried to interject: \u201cLate!  Late!  Ah hang ang igea!\u201d he explained as he began running his fingers all up and around Kamilla\u2019s hips, belly, and midsection, driving her into fits of ticklishness which only served to tighten her anus rather than loosen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!  Stop it, troll!  Anywhere beyond my butt was NOT part of the bargain!\u201d Kamilla cried in between laughing spasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOgay!  Ogay!  Gug wha we gui goo naw?\u201d, as his drool got all over her legs and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir little tryst had now gone past the allotted time limit, and the petulant young witch wanted to be free of this slimy, hardened protrusion poking into her butt, so she screeched, \u201cI don\u2019t know!

Karmilla closed her eyes, bite her lips and let another moan come out from her mouth. It has been a long time since she hasn't felt like that. However, being turn on by a creature, and worse of all a troll, was quite disturbing. The troll started to kiss, lick and gently nibble her lower belly, just underneath her perfect innie and she couldn't help but giggle because of the ticklish feeling. It slightly tickled her butt, making her giggle even more before coming back to the fingering (which had stopped few seconds ago) that Karmilla received with a surprised squeal. The brunette looked down to the troll's face and saw a luscious light she was used to see in male's eyes. She moaned a little bit louder, without thinking that anyone could hear her, when its finger squirmed even more quickly than its previous pace. She felt sweat on her torso and suddenly felt the urge to take off her skimpy revealing corset. However she needed to focus on what would happen next. Her body was speaking itself but her mind wasn't sure about going further with such a... creature. She was about to try to make a decision but the troll decided to scratch its claws on the pale and delicate skin of her butt, tickling her even more. She was still standing in front of it, squirming and making her boobs bounce, her butthole fingered and tickled and her belly button licked in a fast way. Half-giggling cutely, half-moaning, she had hard time to make a decision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regardless of the old woman's creepiness, Karmilla certainly necessitated the Troll's tooth for her magic potion and it was better to acquire it from her than the strong, fearsome ogres out in the village. Besides, she was younger and definitely capable to overpower the elder witch in case of combat...right? Erasing any doubts from her mind, Karmilla entered the lovely beldam's accommodation and the sight was definitely not something she would expect; for instance, it was much wider than what it gave impression of from the outside. A big cauldron alongside various ingredients on shelves caught her attention primordially on her left where the Troll teeth were most likely located. The setup was appeasing, being a fellow witch and all, and she wouldn't mind resting here for a few moments. Her eyes scanned the room in search of what she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a few of them on that shelf over there,\" the old crone pointed to the designated furniture in the corner. Karmilla followed her direction and slightly widened her eyebrow; the shelf was displayed at a considerably high height. How did that old conjurer manage to put them there with her small stature - it should be close to impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit high...\" Karmilla stated with incertitude. Nonetheless, there was no backing out now. Her objective was directly in front of her now and there was no obstacle that would hinder her achievement...or could there? With a tiny exhale, she stretched and brought her arms towards the ledge in order to seize her item. Karmilla was on the tip of her toes as she touched the tooth but didn't completely have it in her reach. Unknowingly, though, she didn't perceive the other occupant approaching her from behind and observing her proliferation. The old witch crouched underneath and positioned herself in front of the juvenile where a large portion of her stomach was visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a lovely tummy you have my dear!\" the old hag admired from beneath as she stared at the captivating piece of flesh exhibited. With the breadth, Karmilla's corset was raised even further - showcasing more of her milky white skin - and her belly button took the shape of an oval instead of its usual circular form. The view was simply magnificent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...thanks...\"  she replied, feeling a bit awkward and embarrassed at that juncture. Karmilla also realized how vulnerable she was but it was a tad too late to grasp that knowledge. If the girl released her hold of the teeth container, it would surely fall and break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly button looks so amazing as well. Do you clean it often?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do clean it a lot but it rarely gets dirty.\" The conversation was getting pretty weird at this point. Why is her helper so engaged with her navel? There was a strange gut feeling that told her to abandon everything and run but she couldn't do that. Her goal was right before her orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so...\" An uneasy silence installed shortly after. Karmilla merely shrugged and extended her scope to the bottle but a tingling sensation stopped her dead in her tracks. The adjacent witch was poking her abdomen consistently! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeehee! Plea-pluhease! Hahaa ahahahahahh stahahhahahap! It tickles eheheheeaho heoehehehe!\" she spontaneously burst in adorable giggles that made the tormentor grin in delight. It looked like she found motivation to resume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it now? Coochie, coochie, coo! Look at your tummy go! Coochie, coochie, coo...I simply can't resist!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ancient witch placed a single index at base of her midsection - the center of her hip line. Like a vigilant serpent, she dragged it upwards and avoided her umbilicus for the time being. The maneuver gave chills down the victim but it was not over. As the senior's digit attained her solar plexus, it swooped directly to her waist and offered it a good squeeze. Karmilla's titters evolved into barbarous laughter that echoed through the compartment. Her torso jiggled like jello yet that didn't stop the ravaging fingers from tickling her sides by pinching the elegant curves of its delineation. If that wasn't bad already, the torturer implanted her face on her breadbasket and divulged a loud raspberry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha ahhahahahahahha! Hohoahaha haahhahahahhaahaha I can't! Hehee ehehe eheheheheheoahoaeah ahahahahahahha!\" How unfortunate for Karmilla that the assailant was attracted to that specific spot rather than the rest of her physique - the one most sensitive area of her entire embodiment. \"Youuaa ahaahahahahhahahahaha are so cruel! Ohohahahaha ahahahahahah ohahahaahha my gahahahahahhahwd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cruel?!\" the decrepit sorceress repeated as if that was the worst insult in her book. \"Trust me dear, I can be crueler than this if I really wanted to. But I just want to feel your soft flesh for now, we can have more fun later,\" she added whilst yanking her mini-skirt down a bit to expose more of her refreshing skin to toy with. \"My, my...if you were this ticklish then why would you ever wear like that? You're just asking to be tickled.\" How true that statement was. Nevertheless, Karmilla was not given time to respond as the opposing witch took out a weapon that made her mouth partially drop at the parade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The magic ropes managed to strech her arms above her head, lifting her corset even more, and giving her nice belly button this oval shape the old woman liked so much. Karmilla mentally cursed, she could have cast a spell too if she wasn't so deadly afraid of tickling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag approached with a sly smile on her face, holding the huge feather and moving it in the air in order to tease the sexy witch who bite her lips nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my my....\" She sighed. \"Why are you trying to escape? I know you are looking for it.

Some even tickled Karmilla's thighs. A feather sneaked into the brunette's cleavage, making her squeal even more, making the hag smirk with the tought of having found a new soft spot. The previous feather, which was the biggest, removed itself from her lovely belly button and went to her hips. Just as the young witch thought her soft innie would be finally left in peace, several small feathers went straight into it and wiggled with strengh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!!!\" Screamed Karmilla, tears running down her soft cheeks. \"STAHAHAHAHAP!!\" She gulped. \"NOT MY HAHAHAHA BEEELLYHEHEHEHEHE BUTTOHOHOHON HAHAHA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My poor baby girl.\" sighed the hag with a smile on her face. \"I've never seen someone THIS ticklish in this specific place.

Amazed by the perfect roundness of them, the hag suddenly raised her hand and all the feathers stopped at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette panted and gasped for some air. She stared without saying a word at the oldest witch, not knowing if she had to thank her for stopping the tickles or be ready for another round.

Karmilla gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my...\" smiled the hag as she let her nails slightly scratch the bare top of her boobs, making her victim giggle. \"They're really lovely\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young witch didn't say anything, kinda happy that the tickles finally ended, at least for a while. Noticing some sweat between her boobs, the wicked witch tried to remove it with her index, making Karmilla squeal and squirm, trying to avoid that physical contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. As I thought, a new soft spot.\" Smiled the hag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word and with just a huge smirk, she let her finger slipped between Karmilla's breasts, making her gulp.

Just like when her innie was ravaged by the hag's fingers, even if she wouldn't admit it.

NAHAHAHAHA!!!\" screamed the young witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag added her fingers on her boobs' sides, making her poor victim scream and squirm even more. The oldest witch was enchanted by the view of her breasts still dancing, those lovely nipples tickles by feathers and her tiny waist with this so cute innie that was just asking for tickles. She stopped to tickle Karmilla's boobs for a while and went back to her belly button, stucking her index in it, scratching the core of it, making her scream again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAHAHAHAHAAP!!! PLEHEHEHEHEHEHEAAAASE!!\" She begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag licked her lips. </span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t go!\u201d, the old crone pleads as she advances closer to Karmilla, hands outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly darting away from her grasping fingers, Karmilla tries to keep smiling at the creepy old lady even as she backs away, excusing herself.  The old crone seems to be growing, becoming scarier before her very eyes, so the younger, inexperienced Karmilla breaks into a full run away from the witch, off the trail and into the woods, with the old lady in pursuit, calling out for her to stay and be her guest in an increasingly menacing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong-legged and agile, Karmilla initially seems to leave the hag behind her, as she can hear her calls recede into the distance.  However, a thick mist rolls in and the sounds in the woods she suddenly finds herself lost in begin to echo and fade in and out, becoming almost frighteningly loud at times, then almost muffled, so that she can\u2019t even hear her footsteps.  Judging at least some of what she\u2019s experiencing to be spell-work, Karmilla attempts to cast some protective spells as the dense forest gets increasingly foggy all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if she blinked onto the scene from nowhere, the old witch is right in front of Karmilla, looking crazy-eyed as she instantly begins tickling her entire exposed midsection, ruining a spell Karmilla was whispering.  Karmilla shrieks with laughter and instantly flees the insane old biddy again, running as fast in the opposite direction into the mist as her sturdy boots will take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla runs and runs, and doesn\u2019t stop running  away into the foggy, troll-infested hills, away from the old crone intent on touching her smooth, flawless belly with those gnarled old fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Karmilla slips on a mossy rock near a creek and falls off the trail, landing in free fall onto some sort of sticky net of some kind, dangling at a slight degree over a small, dark crevice.  Screaming, she tumbles down, landing trapped on her back, her arms and legs splayed in four directions, as the line still reverberates with the sudden impact from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the sticky bindings seems to only make matters worse, so Karmilla takes a moment to try to gather herself.  She is dangling splayed out across a sticky mass of  rope-thick silky strands over a dark vale.  \u201cThis is NOT provident\u201d, thinks the arachnophobic young witch, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just conjure up an unbinding spell to counter this trap.  If that doesn\u2019t work, perhaps more of a slippery magical trick to free myself from this awful web\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Karmilla feels a tension on the web above her.  She looks up and screams in terror at the ugly, big-bellied black spider appearing from the rocks.  It\u2019s the size of a hog, with eight looong spindly legs\u2026and the face of the ugly old witch glaring all green down at her!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She can feel the reverberation on the webbing with each suspended step across the lines, and when she dares to look up again \u2013 THE WITCH IS RIGHT IN HER FACE!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karmilla screams loudly and madly attempts to free herself again.

Struggle with all your might, my pretty one!  It gives me the greatest thrill when in this form.\u201d And Karmilla again sneaks a terrified glance up to see that the spider is still straddling the web directly above her, staring intently at her flexing tummy as she breathes in short bursts, scared out of her mind by the long, icky black legs that appear to be collecting webbing from the spider\u2019s bloated abdomen for some undoubtedly nefarious use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease!

Don\u2019t you wish to stay and gossip with an old lady, lonely here on this forlorn mount amidst the stinking trolls and mountain goats?\u201d, she asks, then covers Karmilla\u2019s mouth with one of her awful appendages while another ever-so-slightly glances its tip slowly along Karmilla\u2019s taut belly, causing her to flinch and make a spastic sound before the witch begins to tickle her torso in earnest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karmilla is now thrashing and crying-out in laughter under the huge spider leg covering her mouth, while two of the witch\u2019s legs begin teasing and poking all over her smooth, sensitive midsection, causing even more screams of laughter and contorted movements fighting the web as the old spider-formed witch laughs and asks, \u201cPlease dearie!  At least favor me with the spell a pretty thing like yourself would be using a troll\u2019s tooth for, pray tell?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHee Hee!

Ahahahahaha\u2026nononooo!\u201d, was all that Karmilla could get out before the witch was ruthlessly tickle-attacking the pretty younger witch again, this time, another spider arm began tickling around Karmilla\u2019s tender armpits and exposed areas of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The older witch is delighted at Karmilla\u2019s sensitivity as she glares down, obviously relishing the sight of the young beauty desperately trying to shield her helplessly caught body from her leisurely dalliance, It\u2019s been a while since I studied my arcane spell-casting texts, but weren\u2019t troll teeth typically used for necromancy and other black arts?  Now, why would a tender, darling girl like you need to be dabbling in such dark arts, child?\u201d, but she continued teasing and prodding her, so Karmilla could only manage more spurts of \u201cStop!\u201d and \u201cNooohohoho!\u201d before falling into silent laughter at her terrible plight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without a second thought, the other trolls cheered it on as if they hadn't a choice. Karmilla laughed as loud as she could whilst squirming. Her knees began to weaken and her body slouched over, the only keeping her up was the troll behind her. It then adjusted so that her torso was straight and it could tickle her easier. Karmilla could the tip of the troll's finger push against the back of her belly button, this really tickled her. Karmilla kicked her legs in the air and tried to rip its left arm off of her torso, but to no avail, she was too weak. The troll's finger continued to circle around inside of Karmilla's now sore, innie belly button until it glew red. The troll pulled out its index finger and held it up high as a sign of a victory. Once again, the others mindlessly cheered it on. Karmilla panted and once again, only the troll held her up.<br>\r\n\"Remind me to do this next time we meet.\" It said as it helped her onto her own feet.<br>\r\nKarmilla was still trying to reclaim her breath.<br>\r\n\"Gorgorth, escort her to the village!\" It ordered. Within an instance, a troll stood before her.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! Follow me, witch.\" The troll demanded. Karmilla was determined to speak to the trolls at the village, but had fears that the haggard old witch will strike. It was after all getting late. As she began walking off, still in a state of indecision, the leader of the group smacked her on the butt. In anger the witch turned around to see the troll wiggling its index finger in the air.</span></div></div>",

Karmilla gulped just before the troll stuck its finger nicely into her belly button. Karmilla squirmed with an outburst of laughter. She must've been tickled so many times, but each time feels like a first. The troll continued to push as far into her belly button as possible, only to cause her to laugh even harder. The troll pulled its finger out and stood up. Against all odds, Kamilla stood tall and proud, only to fall to back onto her butt from exhaustion. <br>\r\n\"Now, a deal's a deal.\" The troll said to the panting witch. Karmilla had her hand on her belly, covering up her navel because it was stinging more than usual. The troll stuck it index and thumb into its mouth and forced out a tooth.

Who would be awful enough to hurt that little belly button?\" She cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman brushed her fingers against the witch's flat belly and she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehehe stahahap\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla wriggled her body which made the ederly smiles even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexyyyy\" she said before doing it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rehehehehally hehehehe sthahahap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I stop to brush.... I go for the real tickling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo hahahahaha!!!\" Karmilla laughed when the old woman started to scramble her fingers all over her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this button dooooo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT THE B-HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! STHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAP!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make you laugh until you cry, darling!\" The old woman said with her finger in her belly button, wriggling like a crazy worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen?</span></div></div>",

Her body had all the right curves and she was wearing a very sexy and very exposing red leather dress. The witch was amazed : vampires were full of sensuality. The girl put an hand on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeees?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette explained everything about her potion and the vampire pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I give you some vampire's blood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Because you're nice?\" tried Karmilla with an uneasy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire laughed so much that it shakes her whole body, her breasts bounced like basket balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampires are not nice, darling... I thought that, as a witch, you would know about that...\" she said in a seductive way. \"Let me lee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman started to touch Karmilla's thighs who thrilled, surprised. Then, she lightly grabbed her boobs, making them bounce a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" the witch tried to move back, but the vampire's grip straightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, darling! I'm trying to know what kind of payback you could give in exchange of a little bit of vampire's blood... Don't struggle back, it gives me the urge desire to bite your pretty neck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla gulped and the woman laughed. Then, her hands slipped on the witch's exposed belly and she gasped. The vampire's eyebrow raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Are you ticklish?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl was about to answer but the creature wriggled her fingers all over her tummy, making her squirm and laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greaaaat, darling...\" The woman smiled. \"Ok you enter in the Castle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla was dragged into the mansion and then gulped.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karmilla braced herself glumly as the vampire tugged her eagerly along, delicate hand fixed to her bicep with a supernatural grip. The pretty lich was chattering eagerly about all the fun they'd soon be having together, and Karmilla already felt nervous about what was doubtless to come. At this point, however, she wasn't entirely certain she could back out at all, and was too scared of that possibility becoming confirmed to try just then. By way of a distraction, she tried to examine the interior of the rarely-visited fortress for anything that might be of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridewell's ceiling was high and vaulted over a cavernous entrance hall, only the few odd glimpses of the elaborate stonework visible in the shadows. The walls descended precipitously, racing the heavy chains of a few iron chandeliers on their descent to the marble expanse of the endless floor. Huge tapestries, fresh despite a no-doubt advanced age, cushioned he walls, providing a welcome backdrop for the erected suits of armour enshrined in alcoves beneath them. Occasionally, a vampire fluttered through, in human or bat form, rarely pausing to give Karmilla and her host more than a hungry glance as they went about their business. Despite the echo produced by the chamber's cyclopean scale, the room was eerily quiet and seemed open to the chill of the cold mountains outside.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Asked Karmilla, voice quiet in the preternatural chill. Already she wished she had something more extensive to cover herself with -a motion redoubled as vampires leered alternately at her exposed neck and belly. Even as she made the query, the vamp broke off the main hall and led her into a comparatively modest but even more luxuriantly furnished parlour.   <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Oh, to say hello to some friends of mine,\" Said Ms. Vamp cheerfully. Now confident that the witch wouldn't escape, she relinquished her death grip on the human's arm and slid her hand around the witch's slender waist instead. Karmilla felt the hand resting on her bare side acutely, heavy with potential menace. \"Ah! And here they are!\" The parlour was narrow but long, with full-length windows overlooking a breathtaking mountain view lining one side and bookshelves the other. Comfortable divans, chairs, and tables formed neat squares periodically. The nearest one was occupied by two lounging vampires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, Tania?\" Asks one of the two corseted beauties, dense mane of raven curls falling over one ivory shoulder as she sits up eagerly. \"A new toy?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks tasty,\" Notes the other, lying idly back opposite with her sculpted arms folded idly behind her head. Karmilla couldn't help but notice the way the position emphasized the alluring swell of her bound breasts, or called attention to her bare and silky underarms. \"Where did you find her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the doorstep, ladies.\" 'Tania' sat primly down on one of the remaining couches, easily pulling her increasingly nervous guest down beside her. \"Witch, I'd like you to meet my friends; Chernova and Anastasia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the busty one,\" Interjects Anastasia cheekily, arms shifting under her head for greater comfort.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you wish!\" Says Chernova, reaching smartly across the table to flick her in her open underarm. Anastasia leaps up, putting one hand to her mouth. \"You're only the ticklish one here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, ladies,\" Says Tania languidly. \"I believe it's our little magical sweetmeat here who owns that title. This is, ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karmilla.\" Said the witch, crossing her arms between her legs nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-you.\" Said Tania. \"Now, what Karmilla here needs is a few drops of vampire blood. I think we can arrange that- in exchange for adequate compensation, of course. I think we all know what form that may take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ticklish, witch?\" Asked Chernova eagerly. \"And where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm... Horribly ticklish.\" Sighs Karmilla, averting her eyes and shifting nervously. \"Especially on my -feet.\" She said, deciding that if she could spare her belly and underarms, than that would be a small victory at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're lying.\" Said Chernova slyly, and Karmilla felt herself jump at the sharp and suggestive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, really,\" She blushed. \"I can't stand having my feet tickled at all. It's pure torture! It-gah!\" She fell into a laugh as Tania suddenly fell to squeezing her bare sides, smiling with the relaxed certainty of a cat toying with a mouse as the poor witch shrieked. With the vampire's nails squeezing and scrabbling over her midriff, Karmilla curled up like a louse, rolling off the couch altogether in her desperation to get away. Tania didn't pursue, but swapped confident looks with her companions before all three turned their gaze to the flushed and panting witch.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clam down, girl,\" Said Tania sweetly, helping her back to her feet. \"I promise that we won't be take more than a few hours.\" She pulled Karmilla down on top of her, the human like a doll in her firm grip. \"Now, lean back, stretch out, and prepare for some laughs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavy with anticipation and fear, Karmilla complied, feeling the cool air brush soothingly over the flushed skin of her belly as her skimpy corset rose up. In sync, Anastasia and Chernova rose and stepped up to opposite ends of the couch. Carefully, they seized hold of Karmilla's graceful limbs as they tentatively approached sliding them neatly into the concealed stocks located in the woven woodwork below each armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecurely fasted, stretched and helpless, with her belly arched invitingly over Tania's lap, Karmilla began to realize fully how helpless she was. Overhead, Anastasia playfully pushed her hat down over her eyes, as her counterpart at Karmilla's feet teasingly withdrew her heels. Chernova flicked one nail over the slender pale feet so revealed, grinning predatorily as the witch jumped and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania gently rested her fingers on Karmilla's taut belly, revelling in her terrified shiver at the preemptory contact. Slowly, she began to trace her fingers of the trembling flesh, hearing Karmilla immediately break out into involuntary titters with delight. Gently, Anastasia took her cue to begin scratching away at the trapped witch's underarms; Chernova, at her arches. For her part Karmilla could do nothing but lie back and take it, an excruciating prospect  for the horribly ticklish girl. She bucked and thrashed under the steadily intensifying, electrifying tickling, feeling the merciless grip of the elegant restraints rendering her prostrate. Tania doodled contentedly over her belly, saving the navel for later even as she probed in suggestive ellipses, alway coming within a hairsbreadth of the sensitive hollow while leaving it unmolested. The suspense with each revolution was hideous.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

She didn't want to hear that kind of things but she couldn't escape by the door to explore another part of the Castle. She was about to go back to the window when someone turned on the light. Karmilla gulped and turned around to see two vampires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was dark-haired and red-eyed, as every young vampire he was quite hot. He licked his lips while staring at Karmilla's body.

What should we do, Serena?\" the guy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dying to know what is hiding behind this sexy corset\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla gulped as the blonde's hands approached. But the witch moved back and Serena's fingers only managed to brush her exposed belly. The brunette giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Serena asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an invitation to play....\" the guy whispered in a sexy way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo\" whimpered Karmilla. </span></div></div>",

He was probably his best partner and she knew it would be hard for her to resist to him. When he suddenly appeared in front of her, she gulped. Still hot as hell, with a perfect body and perfect face like most of vampires, he scratched his soft dark hair that was slightly coming in front of his sweet golden eyes and his usual smirk came accross his face. He looked up and down  at her  while smiling and Karmilla knew he was also missing their relationship. She blushed when his sexy smirk became wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo....

Since she was able to enter the castle undetected and the window was open, she found her luck was increasing so climbing through the window she decides that maybe there's some blood in here and that's worth looking around for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the bed, she gets to her knees and looks under it but sees nothing more than some old dusty books \"wardrobe it is\". Heading to the wardrobe, she opens it seeing a large variety of revealing outfits \"wow\". Looking at the outfits, she almost forgot as to why she was in a vampire's bedroom \"blood.....right\". Searching through the wardrobe, she starts to become frustrated having not found what she wants \"come on, there has to be some stored in here\". She was about to grab some of clothes out of the wardrobe but the sound of a door closing behind her stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we have here?\" gulping, she turns around to face a blonde woman in only a dark red robe \"looks like I have a young witch in my bedroom\". She steps toward her \"a witch who is close to becoming a vampire if she doesn't explain to me why she's in my bedroom looking through my clothes\". \"I just need some vampire blood for a potion I'm making\" the woman folds her arms across her chest \"and what makes you think I'm just going to let you have some\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarmilla wasn't sure what to say so she said the first thing that came to mind \"I'll do anything you want\".

Reluctantly, she walks over to the bed and sits next to the woman \"so what exactly are you willing to do in exchange for some blood\" \"I don't know.......whatever you want I guess\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman's eyes longer over Karmilla's body, she notices how revealing her outfit is \"tell me witch........have you ever been with another girl?\" she softly touches Karmilla's hair before dragging her hand down her chest before coming into contact with Karmilla's belly making her squirm and smile. \"Oh is the little witch a bit ticklish?\" \"just a little\" she replies \"how about we have ourselves some fun\".

Sometimes she gets tickled, but sometimes she manages to tickle people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules :<br>\r\n-Tickling is allowed elsewhere but please try to focus at least a little bit on the belly area<br>\r\n-NO RAPE(S) but sex (even lesbian) is allowed. Just avoid sick things (like necrophilia for example)<br>\r\n-No gore/kill/torture (except tickles of course)/sick things<br>\r\n-You can choose to give her a navel piercing or not. <br>\r\n-Try to avoid one sentence chapters. <br>\r\n-HAVE FUN!</td>",
