Ah well, it paid enough to keep your hobby going at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly every person in this world is supposed to go on their own 'magical' pokemon journey, and while on this trail you occasionally ran into the passing kid trying to catch a pokemon. Not you, you never did that. You found yourself helping at home too much around that age and just never got out and did it. You never much regretted it, but when you saw pokemon in the wild when you walked this trail your mind drifted to what it might've been like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pack was digging into one of your shoulders as you went to adjust it again when you heard a rustle from the bushes. You stopped for a second to look, and a quiet moment passed before you decided there was nothing there. Probably a pokemon you thought. You continued until you found a nice boulder to take a slight rest on and sat down, opening your pack to pull out an energy bar and bottle of water. You quietly indulged yourself in the food and drink as you let your mind drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese hikes helped you to refresh yourself, get away from the hustle and bustle, and occasionally see a pokemon, maybe pet it or give it a bit of food before it went on its merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished the bar, watching the trees and the wind rustle the grass and such before you took the empty bar and wrapper and placed them into a part of your bag to dispose of when you got back to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoisted the bag onto your back and continued on, whistling a little tune to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kept on for a while, and you reached the end of where you normally hike and circle around, it was where the trail ended...a portion of trees continued on and you never ventured into it yourself. You didn't really know of anyone that had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to turn around before a thought came to you...maybe you should check it out...you'd been doing this same hike for a long time, seeing something new would be fun right? Maybe you'd see a type of pokemon you'd never seen. Heck, who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that that you decided to step off the trail. You ventured into the grass, past the unknown treeline and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed relatively normal too, just more berry bushes, more trees, more of the same, you hadn't seen a pokemon when you felt something odd coming over you...your vision felt like it was blurring and your pack was getting heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be getting tired...\" You mumbled to yourself when a bout of lightheadedness took you as well. You went to set your pack down and when you did you collapsed forward, onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes the darkness of night was around you, that was the first thing you noted. You went to get up and for some reason noted that you didn't have any clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" You yelled out. Did someone rob you of the clothes on your back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and found yourself standing on some sort of tarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the distance to see a canopy of...some sort too. It looked denim? You looked around, though the night was dark your eyes adjusted quick thanks to the star and moonlight above and the grass...looked tall. Some taller than you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the tarp and saw a familiar design on it...the one on your shirt. You looked back again to see a rising monument...that looked like your pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was registering in your brain that something bizarre had happened...you'd shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not possible...\" You whispered out, afraid of the truth as a breeze blew by and you rubbed your arms shivering. Damn you were cold too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay...calm down...\" You said to yourself. You needed a plan.</span></div></div>",

You were impossibly tiny. The chance of someone passing by overnight was quite low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, what could you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... think...\" you murmured to yourself as you started walking in circles, trying to collect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do something to at least survive throughout the night. You could have done a lot more to improve your situation when you were a lot less cold and able to think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour freshly awakened mind told you that the wise thing to do here was trying to remain awake for the night; you knew for sure this place housed many pokemon, and you couldn't be sure of what they'd have done if they found you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a nearby bush began rustling, drawing your attention while also making you spring up in alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turned your head to the source of the noise, discovering a few bushes rustling indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought it was because of the damn wind that  threatened to send you straight in a state of hypothermia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you realized that it wasn't the wind; on the other side of that bush, you noted with curiosity mixed to sheer terror, there was some sort of yellow light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid screaming, giving away your location to whatever - or whoever - was approaching as a result, you bit your tongue and sprinted in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, like a child playing hide and seek, you dove right behind your now monolithic bag, your heart beating faster that normal and your brain racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, the leaves of the bush parted ways as a figure finally came out. It was a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou analyzed it carefully while trying to remember its name;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quadruped, had two big ears, red eyes, dark-furred body and, bizarrely, was covered in yellow rings, which emitted that yellow light that warned you of the pokemon's presence. You finally remembered the name of the Eeveelution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an Umbreon. And it looked a lot less adorable and a lot more dangerous than its pre-evolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type stopped in its tracks as it noticed your bag, abandoned in the middle of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could never have seen the real reason behind its loneliness in a patch of grass... or could it? Umbreon were dark-types, could they see through darkness as well? You struggled to remember, but couldn't really think straight while the ground shook so loudly as the Umbreon approached your bag, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered from your hiding spot to see the gigantic Eeveelution getting dangerously close to your location, though it was headed for the opposite side of your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think of anything smart that could have pulled you out of this mess, the Umbreon halted its walk right in front of your bag and neared its muzzle to it, beginning to sniff it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choked back a sigh of relief as you kept staring at the beast from the other side of the monumental bag, the light emanating from its rings blinding you. It felt like staring at the sun in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have easily eaten you if it spotted you, you reasoned. But if this Umbreon was innocuous, at least to you, it could also have helped you sort out this messed-up situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid giant suddenly stood on its hind legs, while its fore-legs pushed against your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the Umbreon dove its head inside the opening of the bag without spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you felt the need to sigh. It hadn't noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, from this angulation and from the Umbreon's new position, you had a pretty view of its hind quarters, and you noticed, enlightened by the light of its rings, a thin, damp pink slit jumping out on the endless black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously at the realization that this Umbreon was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the giantess, she seemed to have lost interest in your bag; you could tell by the way she pulled its head out of the opening, shook it several times before falling back on all fours, causing an immense earthquake to shake the ground beneath your feet while also making you fall down as well, though you landed on your rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" you murmured before noticing the immense wall that was your bag trembling beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you watched with horror as it began falling down, probably from the impact of Umbreon's paws on the ground, though you doubted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no time to think about possibilities, you were about to be crushed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you screamed in alert as you ran from the looming bag; you barely made it out from behind it as it fell down, causing yet another tremor that shook the ground beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" you sighed in relief, before remembering what situation you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lungs and heart freezing, you gingerly looked upwards; predictably, the Umbreon heard you screaming and was in alert as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed her nose upwards and began sniffing the air, before looking back down at the ground. Ironically, it seemed to have taken a lot of interest in the patch of grass you were currently hiding in, though you were hidden by the towering, leafless green trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the giantess bent and started scanning the ground, searching for the source of that smell she picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. If you weren't able to decide what to do earlier, this was the proper moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never.</span></div></div>",

It no longer mattered what you wanted, she knew you were there and you very much doubted you could get away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her staring at you was an altogether different experience than when she was unaware of you. The staring contest into her looming, far above face only reinforced how puny...insignificant you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw tried to work, though the cold made it hard and you found that fear was gripping your throat, though with a squeak you did manage the words. \"Please d-don't hurt me...\" You said and the Umbreon tilted her head as she regarded you. A shadow loomed closer as she lowered her head to you, you winced and stumbled back, falling flat on your butt as she sniffed at you with her nose, sucking in air around you as she took in your scent. You were pinned down by her wet nose to the ground as she pushed you down with it gently, sniffing harder while keeping you safely pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push her nose away though it was ultimately futile, as her minimal effort was more than enough to outmatch all of what little strength you had right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of this she lifted her nose off of you and now you had damp liquid from it coating you, making you shiver even more. The Umbreon seemed to notice how cold you were at least, and she lowered her head once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now...?\" You asked in fear, and that's when you noted that her mouth opened and you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't!\" You said, as her maw got closer and you got up to run, though by the time you did a slimy muscle scooped you up, her tongue, and you found yourself in a moist, dark cave...her mouth...looking at teeth that could dice you up instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat me please! I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon had no intent to eat you before she picked you up, she was going to carry you away.</span></div></div>",

The drops of saliva that kept falling from the palate, soaking you to the bone, didn't really help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike the freezing outside, the insides of the Umbreon's mouth were warm, the risk of freezing to death was null in here. That obviously was a dumb thought, because you could die in two different ways in here: either torn apart by the teeth or falling down into the stomach, into the Umbreon's digestive tract, which was going to be your end unless you found your way out in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the thought of crawling through this beast's intestines surely didn't seem appealing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" you cried once more while doing your best to stand back on your feet; the slippery tongue made such task practically impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ungracefully flipped over and fell on your rear into a small puddle of saliva under the large red muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the tongue was on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began licking you as its owner tasted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart began beating faster. Was this Umbreon really going to eat you? You only came to the woods to take a break and you end up eaten by a random pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grave was going to be a stomach, and no one would have ever known you were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought sure left a bitter taste in your mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt movement and the mouth shook all around you; the Umbreon was probably walking around, you figured while the tongue swept you up and took you on top of itself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva build up all around. Thinking about, you had been in here for a while already, why didn't the Umbreon swallow yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were given no time to ponder about it, because the tongue suddenly moved again; it rose rose up, shoving you against the palate, crushing you in between tons of sticky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!\" you screamed once more as you fidgeted, desperately hoping to convince the giantess to not eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no way out of here unless the Umbreon willed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Or unless you used your intellect to find your way out of this mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be more useful alive! I-I... I can be a pet or something, just don't eat me!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of submitting to this dark-type wasn't really one you'd call appealing, but is was surely better than melting away into a stomach, spending you final moments wondering what did you do to deserve all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to make a second offer, but you were immediately silenced by a particularly big drop of saliva falling right on your head and into your mouth, choking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly disgusted, you spat out the saliva that wasn't yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the Umbreon kept walking through the woods as she headed home, thinking about her latest catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrunken human no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the little guy struggle and plead inside her mouth, and she somewhat enjoyed it, like she enjoyed his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as much as she wanted to swallow right now, Umbreon was a lot more interested in examining the little one when he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just needed to get home, or other pokemon could have stolen you from her. No one was taking the human she had taken for herself until he was in the relative safety of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type moaned as she tasted you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sure getting hard to fight back the urge to swallow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity of you pointlessly fighting back the giant tongue passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried countless other times to convince the Umbreon to let you go, most of those ending with you getting a mouthful of spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten, tired and unable to formulate anymore pleads, you simply laid still on top of the tongue as it tasted you repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have the strength to fight back anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your surroundings began to shake once again, like they hadn't in a while now; the tongue began moving beneath you as it dragged you forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, you bitterly thought, you were going to be thrown in the back of this beast's throat, only to be then swallowed, providing the Umbreon a nice midnight snack before she resumed her nighttime walk, completely forgetting that you ever existed while you faced a painful death in her stomach before your corpse was disposed of in the most humiliating way you could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch thoughts, you figured, were worthy of the most obnoxious nightmares of the human mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was no nightmare, it was the hard reality: you were about to be eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with horror as the tongue rose up again and... cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of the slippery cave rapidly dissipated as cold air entered; you began sliding forward, carried by a thick glob of saliva. Then, something hard under your back as your location was shifted from the Umbreon's insides to a stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes met with the sight of the dark-type giantess staring at you, those bright red eyes of hers focused on your form and a curious expression on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took notice that you were inside of a cave. Not exactly the warmest place you could think of, but surely better than the frosty forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back at the Umbreon with the same interest, wondering the reason why she hadn't eaten you like she probably intended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hit you: this giantess probably never wanted to eat you, she just took you away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what reason, you could only wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes once again locked with the red ones of the Umbreon that kept staring at you, examining your naked, saliva-covered body with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could at least understand that, it's not every day a pokemon can meet a shrunken human. And, most importantly, it's not every day a human gets to randomly shrink down, although, between the cold and the near heart attack you got from being almost eaten by the same Umbreon, you quickly decided that you already had your taste of being small, and you didn't like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red gaze of the Umbreon was truly unnerving though, which was empathized by the fact her oculars were absolutely gigantic. Plus, it didn't speak a word and the silence only contributed to make you feel even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep your mind off things for at least a moment, until the Umbreon decided to do something with you, you decided to take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cave seemed deserted, but it was really big, you noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knew, maybe there was another or more inhabitants inside?</span></div></div>",

If you leaned a but closer, your head could touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flared up to an almost steaming level. You tried to crawl backwards, away from the giant organ, but your back came in contact with something hard. It felt... wrinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reddened face became white as a sheet all of a sudden as you realized you were also in proximity of the Umbreon's anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified: in front of you, the chance of being shoved up the giantess' vagina; behind, the dreadful thought you could be sucked up her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only hope was that the Umbreon stood up again, or at least didn't fidget around too much, because if she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the dark-type stared nervously at the pink and white Eeveelution that came from the depths of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon stretched a bit, probably woken up by Umbreon herself, returning to the cave they both shared after her nighttime walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh... you're back...</span>\" the pixie yawned as she moved closer to her dark-type counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're back early tonight...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flustered Umbreon rose her forelegs a bit, shrugging. She didn't quite know how she could explain the shrunken human under her butt if Sylveon knew of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing seemed to hide her catch for now. Hopefully, Sylveon wasn't going to find about the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid fairy-type moved closer to Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you alright? You look weird...</span>\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I don't know what you're talking about. I'm fine.</span>\" Umbreon replied nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your current entrapment, you could hear muffled voices, but you couldn't distinguish the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably the Umbreon that was currently putting you through this and whoever was in the cave with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your stay under her rear, your trap grew hot to unbearable levels, while the dark fur that tickled every side of your body was becoming damp with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to struggle under the crushing weight, but only managed to squirm pointlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr almost pointlessly, because your struggles to break free from the Umbreon tickled her in the most sensitive area of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type yelped as her cheeks grew red - the critter was tickling her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't do something soon, Sylveon was going to find out about her catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, are you feeling fine? You're all red!</span>\" said fairy exclaimed, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon hastily formulated a plan - this was her only chance to make the shrunken human quit struggling. She would have all the time to examine him attentively later, when Sylveon wasn't around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, you needed to stop tickling her, it was getting really bothersome as well as making Sylveon wonder what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Umbreon, what's going on?</span>\" Sylveon asked, growing more and more suspicious of Umbreon's weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type fidgeted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">It's-</span>\" she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon's flustered gaze went from Sylveon to a random corner of the cave; predictably, the fairy-type followed Umbreon's gaze and turned around to check whatever was making the dark-type so agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the pixie distracted, Umbreon took the opportunity and hastily lifted her rear in mid-air; for a moment, you breathed fresh air again, free from the crushing pressure of the large butt and from the giant tail that kept tickling your feet throughout your whole time under the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greedily inhaled as much air as you could before looking at the looming crotch that hovered above you: it was lowering again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you tried to move, but the huge behind was already coming back down on you...</span></div></div>",

Breathing has never felt better in all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up as your vision starts to clear, just in time to see a giant, black blur coming straight at you again. However, you realize that now you're sitting up, meaning your body is above your waist, where Umbreon's anus was not 2 seconds ago. The horror of your predicament hits right when a soft but firm texture hit's the top of your head, putting weight on your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure started to build up very quickly, but since you were straight up, you couldn't fall over quick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight ended suddenly, as you feel the muscle give way. You feel the smooth muscle slide over your face, open quickly over your shoulders, and glide down your body, stopping at your waist, squeezing hard when it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon, knowing she had to quickly stop her catch from tickling and stimulating her, quickly stood up while Sylveon was distracted. However, she knew she had less than a second to sit back down before Sylveon looked back, not even enough time to readjust her hiding place. She just had to hope that the human either took a hint, or knocks him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylveon turned back, Umbreon quickly sat back down. Right before hitting the ground, she felt something touch her butthole. Realization hit quickly, but she had no time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced at the pain from her hole being bore into, until she felt it relax and give way, sending her catch into her. She felt his body quickly glide through her sphincter, horrified at what happened. However, her face started to blush, and she couldn't deny it felt pretty good. She hit the ground with him still stuck there, and she subconsciously clenched around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What happened? What are you hiding?</span>\" Sylveon exclaimed, shacking Umbreon from her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\"> I... I don't know what you mean!</span>\" Umbreon stammered back, knowing she messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Come on sister, I know you better than that. Besides, I saw you wince when you sat back down. You're hiding something under you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic sets in as you refocus on your situation. You're halfway stuck inside the colon of this giantess, with your legs still on the outside. Your feet are still being tickled by Umbreon's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprisingly, it doesn't smell nearly that bad inside her. Of course it smells, but not nearly as bad as you thought it should. Makes sense for a pokemon that only eats berries. However, the fact that shocks you more is that you can breath inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat still doesn't change the fact that you have no intention of being shoved into the backside of this Pokemon. You start squirming, but your arms are pinned to your sides, and you can't get any leverage to push you out of her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You better not be sneaking another Hondew berry. You know those are my favorite</span>\" Sylveon admonishes as she starts to walk around Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon panics as she feels her catch's feet beneath her tail, knowing he can be seen from under her, and this would be very difficult to explain. While he begins to wiggle, stimulating her more, she knows she only has one option left.</span></div></div>",

Not only could you understand them talking about making you their pet, you found yourself agreeing with them! While the concept of being a pet made you uncomfortable the Umbreon made a fine point; you had no idea how the human world would react to you. However, one thing that was for certain was this Sylveon and Umbreon both expressed a desire to keep and protect you. In this circumstance it was a lucky blessing they found you and not some Pokemon that would have saw a shrunken human as a potential snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon chuckled. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Poor little guy probably has no idea what we're talking about.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing against the fur of Sylveon's head you took the chance to get in on the conversation and spoke up. \"Actually, I can.\" Sylveon's velvety ribbons shifted against you and you soon found yourself before her large blue eyes again. Even though they seemed friendly you still had to swallow down your fear as you looked up at her huge face. \"Um... I was hiking in the forest, passed out and when I woke up I was like this. Now, and I don't know why, but I can understand you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sylveon looked shocked but as Umbreon walked over she appeared to be very amused. Apparently being able to understand them made you much more interesting and you began to feel crowded as the two Pokemon took up your peripheral vision. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You can? What do you think about being our cute little pet?</span>\" The Umbreon asked in a playful, mocking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Umbreon...</span>\" Sylveon scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably for the best,\" you sighed. Both the eeveelution's eyes widened in surprise and the Sylveon pulled you closer, eager for an explanation. \"Umbreon was right, I'm not sure what they would do to me if they found me like this. It's the safest option for me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looked absolutely delighted. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Well if you want you can absolutely stay with us! We're going to take good care of you, <i>right</i> Umbreon?</span>\" The dark-type gave an exaggerated nod in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you,\" you muttered. The fact that you willfully agreed to become a pet was catching up to you and It was almost unbearably embarrassing. Although, even as you felt your cheeks burning there was one more aspect that needed to be discussed. \"Umbreon, what did you mean when you said I was going to pay you two back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type gave you a toothy grin. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Wouldn't you like to know,</span>\" she teased. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You'll find out soon enough.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed at her before she turned back to you. \"<span class=\"cppink\">The next time I see Alakazam I'll ask him to look into what made you so small, okay?. He's really smart!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ribbons shifted against you and she gave a soft smile. \"<span class=\"cppink\">That's a task for another day, though. For now I guess you're going to be spending time with us.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Pass him here, I want to play with him.</span>\" Umbreon said. You flinched as she started moving her head closer to you but you were lifted out of reach by Sylveon's ribbons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't you think you should ask him first? Maybe he would like to spend time with me, instead.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">But he's our pet,</span>\" Umbreon said as matter of fact. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Why would I have to ask him?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed at her again before pulling you close. \"<span class=\"cppink\">She means well, honest.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Fine,</span>\" Umbreon conceded. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Who do you want to hang out with first, little guy?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you would rather spend some time alone to come to terms with your new size, it would be rude to reject spending time with the two Pokemon that were going out of their way to help you. The obvious choice would be the one that was acting more protective and sympathetic, the Sylveon. While you just met, you could tell she would treat you right and not force you more out of your comfort zone than you already were. Then again, you were still considering going with Umbreon. She clearly had grievances against the human race that would reflect on how she plays with you but it might be good to let her get all those feelings out of her system sooner rather than later. The dark-type was even staring at you intensely as if she was trying to will you to pick her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhom do you pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you were deep enough in the cave that the only source of light were the glowing yellow rings adorning the dark-types body. Their light reflected off the cave walls and you could see that you were in a small chamber that was apparently the end of the cave system. While you were taking in your surroundings you were interrupted when Umbreon impatiently wiggled her back. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Climb down.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to annoy her you began to climb down. It was easy going at first but as you cleared the bulk of her back and got to her sides you had to clench fist-fulls of black fur in your hands to keep you from falling. Slowly but surely, you scaled down the Pokemon until your feet contacted the cool stone floor, stumbling back as Umbreon suddenly stood on all fours. She leisurely circled around you like a predator eyeing up its prey before she came to a stop before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon was staring at you and her red eyes were piercing you to your very core. The only sound in the cave was the sound of her sharply breathing through her nose and you couldn't read if her expression was angry or excited. Whatever it was, it was making you incredibly nervous. \"Um... Umbreon, I've never had a Pokemon as a pet owner or as a trainer,\" you reasoned. \"And I wasn't planning on being one.\" She kept silent as she watched you. You were fairly certain that's what this was all about, the idea of humans owning Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her unchanging expression and the fact she was walking closer to you told you that your attempts at calming her down have failed. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I'll be honest, I don't like humans. Every now and then I like to daydream of going into one of your towns as a giant and teaching you all a lesson. That will never happen, of course, but it seems fate gave me the next best thing. A little human of my own to play with!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled as she walked over you. Her paws were to the either side of you and you had to crane your head right up to see her smirking down at you. As you tried to open your mouth to plead with her all the wind in your lungs was knocked out as a paw bumped into your chest sending you falling back onto the floor. The fall left you dazed and it took you a few seconds to recognized the paw she pushed you with hanging mere centimeters away from your face. All things considered you considered this outcome but the brash treatment still caught you off-guard. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't worry, i'll try not to hurt you <i>too</i> much,</span>\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the paw rapidly descended onto you and once again the pressure forced the air out your lungs. At your size it was large enough to encompass most of your body and the sheer weight of it rendered most of your struggles useless. Whatever whiffs of cool, damp air you were getting from the cave were replaced with the stifling scent of grass, dust and whatever else was on her pawpads. The paw above you was merely pinning you down and while you wanted to beg for mercy, you couldn't find your voice. Whether or not it would have stopped her was up to debate but right now panic began to course through you as you felt her applying more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were beginning to see stars form in your vision, she released that pressure. In a panic you desperately tried to push away at her but only succeeded in trapping your arms between her toes. The Umbreon, clearly enjoying herself, repeatedly pushed you down into the floor. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You like that?</span>\" She chided. The dark-type was constantly changing her angle of approach, sometimes dragging you around a little bit or clenching her toes around your limbs. It was a constant barrage of attacks that only relented for a few seconds whenever she felt like she had to change what paw she was to smothering you with. This continued for a while and every minute under felt like an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your whole body was wet with perspiration from her body heat and your muscles were aching from the abuse, you couldn't even find the strength to mutter a cry for mercy if you wanted to. You soon found yourself submitting to assaults and as minutes ticked by you mentally checked out. So checked out you didn't even realize she wasn't stepping on you anymore. It felt like forever since you smelled the damp air of the cave. Sitting up took a surprising amount of effort and it took you a moment to regain your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you saw Umbreon sitting on her haunches in front of you but your eyes hadn't readjusted to the golden illumination her rings were producing. The fact that they were flickering darker every few seconds didn't help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes adjusted you saw that Umbreon looked... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked fearfully up into the gaze of Umbreon, hoping that the torture was over. You tried to stand up from your sitting position, only to grunt in pain as you looked at your left leg. A welt was already starting to form there that made it hard to stand. You didn't think it was broken, but you were going to be bruised and sore for a while. With a silent gasp you fell back onto your butt, trying to scoot away from this titanic beast, when you looked into her eyes again though she looked...a bit surprised as she looked at you. It wasn't like the intense look she had been giving you since she took you into this area of the cavern. Though your vision was dim, you almost felt like you saw her gigantic jaw working, almost like she was about to say something, but the words died on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments of silence passed before you heard a murmur from her. \"<span class=\"cplum\">What am I doing...? What would Sylveon say...?</span>\" She sighed as she looked at you with something you hadn't seen before. You didn't think it was kindness...more like pity. Honestly at this point it was hard to get your brain to connect what was happening. A dark paw started to approach you once again, and you choked out a scream as you tried to crawl away again, the sheer primal terror it brought to you was something you didn't expect. The scream tore away from you on instinct and it burned your already sore chest as it escaped. Umbreon's mouth tried to work again, before she pulled her paw away from you as she laid down on her belly in front of you, encompassing your vision as you panted, unsure of what her next move would be. Your entire body ached and was soaked, either from her perspiration or your own sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm done little guy, i'm not going to hurt you anymore. Promise.</span>\" She said as you looked into her red eyes. They seemed to be full of regret as you sat in the silence of the cave. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Please come closer...if you can at least. If not then trust me to help, alright?</span>\" Umbreon said, trying to coax you. You just sat there in silence, trying to decide what to do as Umbreon sighed, shutting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know that so far i've been a bit of a jerk to you. I have my...look, I really do hate humans, your kind...</span>\" For a second her eyes opened, and a spark of rage flickered, making you flinch back, once again sending a surge of dull pain through your aching body, making you wince, and as she saw this that spark of rage dimmed. \"<span class=\"cplum\">But that isn't fair to you, is it? I know there's good humans out there...few in number maybe, but there...I took out my frustrations on you. I guess that isn't fair.</span>\" Umbreon said as you gulped. Umbreon and you just looked at each other, she was slowly scooting closer, and you didn't try to get away. Soon you could feel her exhales through her nose as you truly hoped that it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your leg as she got closer, the glow from her rings letting you see it in full as it looked quite rough. Your own jaw started to flap a bit as the titanic head got closer and closer. Umbreon could see your face, taking in the full effect of pain and fear that covered your features right now. She once again spoke, her warm breath blowing through you as she did. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I can take you back to Sylveon if you want. It's only fair...I can help you get back on my back and then you can be done dealing with me if you want, at least dealing with me away from Sylveon.</span>\" She said. It almost looked like she wanted to say something else, though you weren't sure. She was leaving it up to you? Not that you were gonna dare complain to her right now, you weighed the options carefully. Umbreon did seem to be done with the torment, as brutal as it was. Maybe let her say her piece, talk to her? Then again, right now the idea of getting the hell away from her to the obviously nicer eeveelution was a tempting offer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Umbreon looked extremely frustrated with herself and showed genuine grief over what she did to you. While the pain all over your body was saying otherwise, you thought that it would be best in the long-term if you stayed with her and try and help her get it off her chest. \"Did you... Did you want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon looked taken back by your question. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't too well versed in comforting people that were upset let alone a Pokemon many times your size but you tried anyway. \"I've heard talking about whatever's upsetting you can help. We're going to be spending a lot of time together, I think, so it might be for the best if we talk about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to your feet you severely underestimated how sore your legs were. The cold ground was too rough and even though her treatment of you was sending mental signals to avoid anything large, black and furry but you were severely craving something warm and soft to lean against. \"<span class=\"cplum\">What are you doing?</span>\" She asked, bewildered at your boldness. You didn't answer but instead shuffled over to her and pressed your back into her fluffy chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you hate humans because they catch Pokemon?\" You asked. Umbreon sighed and you felt yourself being lifted up, the sudden movement making you let out a worried murmur. You soon found yourself nestled between her arm and chest, surrounded by comfortable warmth. From your position you could see she was just staring at the cave wall slowly breathing, she stayed like that for a while as she presumably worked up the courage to talk about her issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sylveon likes to tell me that Pokemon that are caught by humans actually enjoy their time with them. I don't see how they could, though, It's demeaning! No offense.</span>\" She vented. She remained silent before you could hear a sniffle above you followed by a long, drawn out sigh. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I don't know why but I'm going to tell you something. I've only ever told Sylveon about this.</span>\" A deafening silence followed before she continued. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Both my mother and little brother were caught by trainers. A similar thing happened to Sylveon but I guess she has a more positive outlook on life, I guess.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a wet drop on the stone floor caught your attention, a single damp spot that was reflecting the yellow light in the cavern just below the giant Umbreon's head. You struggled for something to say to cheer her up. \"Most of the Pokemon in the town I've seen were very happy. You can actually get in a lot of trouble for mistreating Pokemon in the human world, it's seen as a very bad thing to do and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon cut you off. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm just as bad as them, then. I did that to you because I thought it would make me feel better, but it didn't. In the end it just made me feel like the evil version of humans I have in my mind. I'm no worse than them.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to lie, what you did was pretty rough.\" You croaked as Umbreon looked down at you with a sad frown. Clearing your throat you continued. \"But I think the fact you feel bad about it makes you better than them. You can tell what you did was wrong and I can forgive you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon looked puzzled. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Y-you do?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you don't do anything like that again, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I won't, I promise!</span>\" For the first time after you've seen her in this funk she smiled at you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise!</span>\" You could feel another black arm wrap around you as you were tightly hugged against her huge furry chest. Slapping an arm against one of her limbs you begged for release. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh, sorry.</span>\" She chuckled as she relented. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I swear from now on I'm gonna be the best owner ever!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her neck was nuzzling against you. You got the feeling she still wasn't prepared to forgive humanity as a whole yet but you felt fuzzy that you made her at least accept you. She held you in that firm embrace for a while, her body heat giving you a comfort it didn't provide before. Letting her hug you, as if you had a choice, you realized you were incredibly exhausted. Soon that yellow light that painted the cave faded as you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you woke, just like that. You weren't sure if you fell asleep for only a moment because of the dark cave interior but it seemed Umbreon was asleep too. Still, you felt incredibly refreshed even if your body was still aching a bit. Stretching and working the cricks out of your back roused the fluffy world around you and soon you could see a pair of happy, drowsy red eyes looking down at you. \"What time is it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">No idea,</span>\" she groggily replied. Carefully sliding you off her body she stood up to her full height and stretched. You could practically hear her muscles groaning as she limbered up above you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Are you alright to climb up? Sylveon's probably wondering if I ate you or not so we better get back.</span>\" She half-heartedly joked as she sat down again with her back facing you. Knowing she wasn't as dexterous as Sylveon with her ribbons this was probably the better way to get on top of her. Walking up and grabbing onto her black fur prompted her to slowly rise up and while you felt gravity threaten to take you down she was soon upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to the entrance of the cave felt quicker than you thought and all of a sudden you were beginning to see orange sunlight paint the cave walls rather than Umbreon's glow. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, about time you two resurfaced.</span>\" A familiar voice called out. Sylveon was looking at Umbreon with a smile but her eyes betrayed she was obviously annoyed. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I waited for you to come up and let me get acquainted with the human but you ended up spending the whole night with him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">My bad.</span>\" Umbreon nervously chuckled. The dark-type moved to a corner of the cave and was apparantly searching for something but you couldn't see past her neck what for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">There's no berries. That was your job yesterday, remember?</span>\" Sylveon said before she locked eyes with you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Anyway, I'm going out to see Alakazam about your whole shrinking ordeal, if you want to come.</span>\" She was giving you an enthusiastic smile that said that she really wanted you to come. \"<span class=\"cpink\">It would probably just be a quick talk with him and Umbreon has to go out to get food anyway so...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was heavily implying she wanted to spend time with you she still wasn't forcing you. You could insist on spending time with Umbreon gathering food but you felt like that would make Sylveon feel disappointed. She looked really eager to get to know you and was apparently going out her way to discover the reason you were in this situation, after all. It would only be fair to spend time with her after spending most of yesterday with Umbreon despite what happened.  Either way, it looks like both of them were going to leave the cave for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at Sylveon, who for her part did seem eager to talk to you. Being there with Alakazam would also probably be a good idea, giving it a better idea of what happened from your perspective. \"Yeah, i'll go with you Sylveon. I'd like to meet Alakazam myself.\" You said as Sylveon nodded, a noticeable sheen of excitement in her light blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's decided then, Umbreon, remember to-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'll keep an eye out for a hondew berry.</span>\" Umbreon cut her off as Sylveon just smiled towards her roommate. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I really appreciate it. Alright then, i'm gonna grab you now little guy.</span>\" Sylveon approached Umbreon's back as you looked at the titanic white and pink pokemon. One of her ribbons extended out and gently grabbed you. It wrapped around your chest, in one particularly sore spot that made you inhale sharply, though you hoped neither pokemon noticed, though you did wonder if this topic would be brought to Sylveon's attention at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were lifted, Sylveon nodded to you, as you were close to her head. The ribbon holding you then turned and took you towards her back, where she deposited you into her plush white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Alright then, i'm gonna head out. Don't let Alakazam be weird to him.</span>\" Umbreon said as she made for the cave entrance. You were left perplexed by her final statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what did she mean by that?\" You asked as you heard Sylveon's voice from ahead of you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, Alakazam is a very nice pokemon, he can just be a bit...intense to some. Kinda like Umbreon in a way.</span>\" Sylveon said cheerfully. A flash of last night entered your head from when she was circling you like a predator before you shook the image away. Umbreon wouldn't do that again...she said she'd be the 'best owner ever'. Though you weren't ready to adopt that kind of terminology quite yet, especially if you could get some answers about this shrinking thing from Alakazam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Umbreon left, Sylveon turned her head to try and look at you, a small frown on her face. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Was last night okay?</span>\" She asked, almost worried. You hesitated before you nodded. Sylveon tried to look you over, as you looked at yourself. There was no denying the bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I'll fill you in as we move I guess? It isn't bad...\" You said as Sylveon nodded, turning her head and heading towards the entrance of the cave. As the wind from the early morning outside touched you, you shivered, reminding you of your current nude status...you laid against Sylveon's fur as much as you could, shivering before one of her ribbons covered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Better?</span>\" She asked, having clearly felt and heard you. You nodded, before realizing she couldn't see you. \"Yes, much better, thank you.\" Sylveon nodded happily as she kept moving, her ribbon sheltering you from the cold wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So what exactly happened little guy? With you and Umbreon. You two were gone for a long time, and Umbreon can be rather much.</span>\" Sylveon's tone was kind, but you thought you heard a tone of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you looked up to her neck. \"Well...I guess Umbreon isn't so keen on us humans, right?\" You said nervously. Sylveon stopped walking at this point. \"<span class=\"cpink\">What did she do?</span>\" You couldn't see, but Sylveon was frowning, afraid of the answer she'd get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first...I won't lie, yes, I got these bruises from her. She said she was being gentle, and I do think she was holding back, but she wanted to hurt me. Take out her frustrations on me.\" Feeling the stiff pain from what she did to you as you did. \"But she...after it she felt really bad. We talked, and she was really sorry about it. Don't be too mad at her, she told me why she feels that way...\" You said, hoping you hadn't caused some sort of rift between these two pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see Sylveon's face, but she did let out a sigh. \"<span class=\"cpink\">She leaps before she thinks a lot of the time. I'm gonna give her a good talking to later.</span>\" Sylveon said ominously. But she turned to smile at you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">But like I said, ultimately she's not a bad pokemon, if you're worried about it, don't be. Umbreon's done a lot of dumb stuff.</span>\" Her smile turned into a frown pretty quickly though. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I know she won't do it again, but she needs to make it up to you. And i'm gonna make sure of that.</span>\" Sylveon then turned her head and started walking again. You sighed with relief, hoping the matter was settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the walk was pretty uneventful, though quite long as you wondered just how big this forest was, or how far away this Alakazam was as you looked up to see early morning was passing, possibly even approaching noon. Sylveon for her part just kept prodding you about your life or the human world, you were happy to answer her, but after a time it grew a bit monotonous. It was the most random stuff too, though you were thankful she wasn't asking TOO many personal things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around the time when you were explaining what a milkshake was that Sylveon stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay little guy, we're here.</span>\" Sylveon said as her ribbon pulled away from you. You sat up, and Sylveon lowered her head, letting you see past her neck to a waterfall...and in front of it, a meditating Alakazam with rocks circling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" You muttered. You'd heard that Alakazam was one of the most powerful and smart psychic pokemon around, and you figured that had you not been as small as you were, you'd still be awed and impressed by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sir Alakazam, I come with a question.</span>\" Sylveon said, a rather formal tone considering how she'd been talking to you up until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alakazam didn't move at first. It just kept meditating with the boulders circling him, after about a minute, you swallowed...Sylveon never moved, nor did the Alakazam. You wondered if you should speak up before you noticed the boulders dropping, one by one. It was when the last one dropped that Alakazam slowly opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Sylveon. And a human hmm?</span>\" Alakazam said. You gulped, it already knew you were there. Before you even had time to blink his towering form was right in front of Sylveon, him eyeing you. He looked like he was scrutinizing you as you almost felt the urge to try and turn tail and run. Not that it'd get you far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opted to give a nervous smile and wave, as the Alakazam, without changing a single muscle in his face, lifted a hand up...and waved back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">This is most curious. I have never seen a human this small before. Or this naked for that matter.</span>\" Alakazam mused, you blushed as you tried to cover up, though the Alakazam paid no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Umbreon found him like this yesterday, he says he was just taking a hike when he shrunk, he has no idea how it happened, nor do we. He\u2019s able to understand pokemon now too.</span>\" Sylveon said. Alakazam's expression grew even more intense as he closed his eyes, clearly thinking on things. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I see...i've sensed odd things going on in the forest of late, but this is well out of the realms of what i'd expect.</span>\" Alakazam backed off a bit as a psychic aura formed around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Here, I think I can help you.</span>\" He said. Your heard soared at this. Was he going to grow you!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes glowed as you felt your skin prickle from the intensity that he was exuding...You felt a grin form on your face as a flash of intense light surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, smiling stupidly before you opened them...only to be greeted by the same intense sight of the towering Alakazam, with you on the titaness that was Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" You looked down to see...you were in clothes? You had a jacket on too, shoes? It all fit well...you frowned a bit before looking to Alakazam, which made you jump back in fright. He was giving you the most giddy, eager smile you'd seen from any pokemon...you thought ever. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Well? Is it to your satisfaction?</span>\" He asked, almost like a child asking for praise. You blinked in surprise before smiling. \"Um, yes it is! I had been very cold up until this point with no fur. I really appreciate it!\" It wasn't a lie, and having him happy might lead to better things down the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlakazam nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I could tell! No point hiding things from me! You'll find that those clothes are quite durable too! And very easy to clean!</span>\" He seemed quite proud of himself. Sylveon raised her head, though with how big Alakazam was in his close proximity you could still see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sir Alakazam, we do appreciate this, but we were hoping you might have a solution related to his size...maybe?</span>\" Sylveon finished the statement unsure of if it would go anywhere as Alakazam adopted a serious expression once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm...that might be more tricky...</span>\" He said. You hoped he'd have an answer... </span></div></div>",

What I can do, however, is investigate whatever happened to you and try and find a solution that way.</span>\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?

Alakazam humbly waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It's a puzzle and I'm interested in solving it. I've sensed strange energies and heard tales of odd goings-on all around the forest recently but I'm not sure if it's the work of an exceptionally powerful Pokemon or if its some other phenomena. I looked past it because it was mostly benign but if its starting to produce more severe incidents like this then I can't ignore it. No doubt if I can discover the cause of your shrinking a solution should show itself. Hopefully.</span>\" He explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words made you optimistic but that last part he added made you feel a tad anxious. There definitely was a possibility that even if he does find the cause he still may not be able to find a way to get you back to normal. He meant nothing by it but it was the truth, you just had to hope he found a solution and live with the possibility that he might not. You gave him a weary smile and thanked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Can you tell me about what happened?</span>\" He asked. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Any little details would be helpful.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember just hiking just like I usually do. I decided to walk off the trail and go deeper into the forest and not long after my vision blurred and I collapsed, waking up later like this. Then Umbreon found me.\" You explain. Biting your lip you try your best to recall where exactly you collapsed. There were no landmarks, the only thing setting that area apart would be your backpack and even then a Pokemon may have moved it. \"I can't remember where It happened. And when Umbreon found me...\" You suddenly recall the hot, damp insides of her mouth when she decided a mode of transportation for you and shuddered. \"...I couldn't exactly see where we were coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlakazam tapped a claw on his chin as he took in the information, or rather lack of. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm. Then I'll start the investigation by asking Umbreon about it. I'll find you if I discover something new.</span>\" The psychic type before you suddenly vanished in an instant making both you and Sylveon jump in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I hate it when he does that...</span>\" She grumbled to herself. Turning her head to you she perked up. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I think that went well. He may have not been able to grow you back but its good he's looking into it, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" you agreed. It was reassuring that possibly the most wisest and intelligent Pokemon in the forest was helping you. With that, Sylveon turned around and started walking  back the direction you originally came from. You were a little bit relieved that the fairy-type didn't instantly delve back into asking questions about every insignificant detail of human life, instead choosing to cheerfully hum to herself as she walked. Sitting on her back you scooted up till you were by her neck and leaned onto it, reclining in the cool shade the back of her head cast on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite cozy sitting on her back listening to her hum. You just sat back in her fur as she leisurely walked and took in the sounds of the forest. You had to admit, despite being shrunken and all the drawbacks it offered you really liked that it gave you an opportunity to relax in the plush fur of a Pokemon like Sylveon. Her fur was so soft and luscious that it actually took away the stress of your situation. One of your friends that had an Arcanine talked about something similar, although this was way more extreme compared to that. You heard a giggle. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Having fun back there?</span>\" It took a second to register what she was talking about until it clicked that you were running your hands through her fur without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly laugh it off and stopped. \"Oh, sorry.\" Your face was burning as you blushed. <br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><br>\r\n\"You can keep doing it if you want, it feels nice.</span>\" Sylveon cheerfully said. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I heard humans like doing that to Pokemon. Petting, is it called?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" While you enjoyed the texture of her fur and she gave you the go-ahead you were too embarrassed to continue. You let out a sigh and sat up so you could take in the sights around you as a distraction. The first thing you noticed was that you were on a much different route than the one Sylveon initially took on the way to see Alakazam. The trees were more sparse and there was an abundance of different colored flowers bushes scattered about. There was still a bit of morning dew that hadn't evaporated which made the leaves and flowers shine in the sunlight. In all your time hiking in this forest you never saw a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are we going?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon stopped and turned her head to the side to look at you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Huh? Oh, we're...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

You frowned at this. \"Why not just take this route in the first place then?\" You asked as Sylveon giggled. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I wanted to spend time with you, and get to ask you some questions. You spent all night with Umbreon you know! Besides, I also wanted to give Umbreon a bit of time to herself as well, she's probably hunted for berries and gotten interrogated by Alakazam at this point.</span>\" Sylveon responded as you watched the world pass by you. You had to admit it was a pretty part of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I think the three of us could also stand to explore the forest together after we've eaten, no?</span>\" Sylveon said kindly as you thought about this. You did enjoy hiking and taking in nature. This would certainly be that on another level. You smiled to yourself as you put your arms behind your head, leaning against the soft fur of your current companion. \"That does sound fun.\" You admitted to yourself. You were also needing something to get your mind off of the doubts that were taking space in your head. Alakazam wasn't sure if there entirely was a solution for your shrinkage. It was entirely possible you'd be spending the rest of your life at this size...as the pet to pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point you sat up and started to see familiar territory, it seemed Sylveon was getting closer to home when your stomach started to growl. Hunger was starting to rear its ugly head when you realized it had been a long time since you'd eaten anything...or drank anything either. Sylveon looked at you with a smile as you rubbed the back of your head. \"So uh...i've never eaten a berry before. Think it'll be okay for humans?\" You said, and at that her eyes widened. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh...I never even thought of that little guy!...Oh no...</span>\" She seemed to be deep in thought as you started to see the cave, and she approached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't worry, we'll figure it out, okay?</span>\" She said as the sun grew dim and you entered your new home. Sylveon paced about before calling out Umbreon's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, the dark type padded out from some corner of the cave as she regarded Sylveon. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey there you two, finally back?</span>\" She said in a tired tone. You couldn't get a good look at her right now, but she sounded worn out. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, we took the scenic route. Have good luck on the hunt?</span>\" Sylveon asked before Umbreon grinned. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, got a good haul this time, no hondew berry though. Sorry...</span>\" Sylveon frowned at the lack of her favorite berry before giving a carefree smile. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, so long as we're stocked up...though we do need to figure out a few things...</span>\" Sylveon looked at you before Umbreon padded over to look at you as well. You met her giant red eyes as she blinked down at you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You got clothes?</span>\" She asked before you smiled. \"Yeah, Alakazam helped me with that...though he couldn't grow me.\" You said, before Umbreon smiled down. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Eh, don't worry about that. Worst case scenario you've got us taking care of you. Alakazam grilled me about finding you as well, I told him what I knew and he teleported off to who knows where.</span>\" Umbreon said as Sylveon took a few steps, causing her to be facing Umbreon eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I also know about what happened last night...Umbreon, I can't believe you-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know! I know...</span>\" She tried to get in your view again as she made eye contact. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Look, I really am sorry about last night. It's not something i'm proud of and I don't want it to be what you think of when you see me.</span>\" Sylveon once again adjusted herself and at this point Umbreon huffed in annoyance at the fairy type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Still Umbreon, you need to-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Take him around that corner Sylveon.</span>\" Was all Umbreon said, wearily. You could tell she sounded tired. Sylveon gave Umbreon a suspicious look before you felt yourself moving again, with you now seeing Umbreon as she passed by. The titanic dark type did look tired from what you could tell, and as you rounded the corner, you gasped at what awaited you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it's monolithic, towering glory...there it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bag!\" You shouted in elation as Umbreon padded over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">It was damn heavy. I don't know what you humans pack in those things or why you think you need them. But I wanted to do something for you...I still feel bad about last night.</span>\" Umbreon looked down and Sylveon for her part leaned into the dark type, causing you to roll a bit down her fur. You could reach out and touch Umbreon if you wanted right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's a sweet gesture.</span>\" Sylveon said smiling as Umbreon nodded. \"Thank you so, so much!\" You cried out, leaping onto Umbreon's back at this point. Her fur wasn't quite as nice as Sylveon's, but you didn't care right now, you had your stuff back. This also solved the food problem for what would probably be months! At least until some of it expired but considering your size, the stuff in there would last for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">It was my pleasure little guy, told you i'd be the best owner ever.</span>\" Umbreon said, blushing a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched Umbreon and Sylveon embracing, something connected in your head, and that's when you decided that maybe you should ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um...Umbreon, Sylveon...what exactly are you two?\" You asked as Sylveon eyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What do you mean?</span>\" She asked and you scratched at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...what are you to each other...you know?\" You asked. \"Just friends or...?\" Sylveon's eyes widened as you gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave was silent for what felt like forever before you got a response.</span></div></div>",

You recall what Umbreon shared about their parents and managed to piece together that she may be referring to that. In front of you Umbreon began to turn her head to the side so she was looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yep, known each other for a really long time. Chances are we'll go our separate ways when we find our mates but 'till then we're helping each other get by.</span>\" She paused for a moment as she laughed. \"<span class=\"cplum\">But I think I know what you're asking and let me tell you that we're not shy-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ahum,\"</span> Sylveon coughed. She was giving Umbreon a stern look but the slight blush showing through the white fur of her cheeks betrayed her. \"<span class=\"cpink\">It's really not that serious a relationship. Anyway, we need to get you some food, don't we?</span>\" The fairy-type said to you, apparently eager to change subjects as she turned to move towards the bag, prompting Umbreon to follow suit. You weren't sure if Sylveon was downplaying the scope of their relationship or it really was that casual but you decided to let it go for now. For now, her suggestion of food was sounding fantastic, a fact emphasized by a pain in your empty stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon stood over the bag and started prodding through it with her ribbons before she turned to you with a confused look. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Um, what does human food look like again?</span>\" She hesitantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look for something in a shiny plastic wrapping, it should be kind of rectangular.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her prodding she eventually produced a wrapped granola bar. \"<span class=\"cpink\">This?</span>\" She asked. You gave her a nod and she tried her best to open it, wrapping her ribbons around the bar and clamping her teeth on the end of the packet before giving it a quick tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it, thank you!\" You said as Umbreon lowered herself down. Carefully sliding down her fur you walked over to the bar which, as expected, was relatively quite huge. The small tear was enough for you to reach in and grab some of the bar that had already crumbled off. As you ate you saw that Sylveon also retrieved a plastic water bottle and was attempting to open it. During you walk to Alakazam she asked about it and thought that carrying water like that everywhere was neat. You were about to interject and tell her how to open it when you heard the plastic cap starting to click open. She then poured a small amount into the cap and set the water down, proud at her accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again.\" You said, giving them an embarressed chuckle as they both happily watched you eat, their tails wagging enthusiastically behind them. Thankfully they soon decided to go eat their berries and you were left alone with your food. After eating and drinking your fill you hopped up on the still-wrapped segment of the granola bar and waited for the two Eeveelutions. Umbreon was the first of them to finish as you saw her scarf down her small pile of berries although the way she quickly turned and strutted over to you made you think she wanted to get her paws on you before Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Get on, little guy. Sylveon says she wants us all to go exploring today.</span>\" Umbreon said as she lowered herself down to let you climb up. With you secured on her back the dark-type walked over to Sylveon who had apparently finished her berries too. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Are we all ready to go?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Of course!</span>\" Sylveon cheered. \"<span class=\"cpink\">We should choose somewhere to go first, though. Last time we picked a random direction to explore we ended up doing walking in circles.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon nodded. \"<span class=\"cplum\">True. We could take a walk up the mountain a short ways, I heard it has some really cool rock formations and has an amazing view over the whole forest.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's uphill, though. We could always just visit the lake?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">We've been there heaps of times, though.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon huffed. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Well in all the years we've been here we never explored the other side of it. The waters so nice and clear, too!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stared at each other before they turned to you. It would seem that they both just silently elected you to choose where to explore. Both the options sounded nice, in all your time hiking you never went deep enough into the forest to go up the mountain nor see this lake they were talking about. You could even try suggesting that they pick a random direction to explore again, too. You have started getting used to riding on Pokemon's backs and think you could be able to orientate yourself back to the cave if they went along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you suggest the group goes?</span></div></div>",

You didn't get to really see something like that often, and you wouldn't mind going for a quick dip in there either, though that part could potentially be hazardous for someone as small as you. Still, you weren't gonna pass the chance up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see the lake, if that's okay.\" You said smiling, Sylveon smiled at this too though Umbreon rolled her eyes. You gulped, hoping you hadn't annoyed her, but she smiled a bit after at you and Sylveon as she relented. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Fine, the lake DOES sound nice. I just don't want to run into that jerk...</span>\" Umbreon muttered as Sylveon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">He's not THAT bad, besides, we can always ignore him too.</span>\" She said, you blinked at them, but decided against prying. \"<span class=\"cpink\">And that aside, we can explore the other side of the lake too! we haven't been there, and we might meet some new faces!</span>\" Sylveon said before they turned their attention back to you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">You wouldn't mind meeting other pokemon, right?</span>\" She asked before you shrugged. \"So long as they're friendly, I guess not...\" You said with a bit of trepidation. You trusted these two, but you couldn't just discount the fact that there were some hostile pokemon out there, and that Umbreon herself started out somewhat hostile to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, no one's gonna mess with you if i'm around so don't worry.</span>\" Umbreon said confidently as Sylveon nodded. \"<span class=\"cpink\">You're totally safe with us!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at this. \"Sure, could be a lot of fun then.\" It was then that your furry surface started to move as Sylveon and Umbreon started moving towards the cave entrance. You grabbed a fistful of dark fur to orient yourself as Umbreon moved, a bit quicker than you expected when you were out of the cave, with Sylveon bringing up the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Full speed ahead!</span>\" Umbreon cried out as you saw Sylveon giving you what you assumed to be a sympathetic smile as you tried to keep your grip. The world around you was moving way too fast for you to keep up with right now, and you certainly didn't like the idea of falling to the hard ground from this high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Maybe you should slow down a little? You don't want to buck off the little guy, right?</span>\" Sylveon said. You immediately noticed things slow down as Umbreon started to keep pace with Sylveon. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Fine fine.</span>\" She said as you sighed with relief. Umbreon looked back at you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">That wasn't THAT bad, you had fun, right?</span>\" She said as you rubbed at your neck. \"It was certainly surprising.\" You said to her and she just frowned. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Fine, i'll keep it slow for you two.</span>\" She sounded like she was huffing, but you were starting to get the idea that this was just how Umbreon was. As you looked around at the sights, wondering how far the lake was you felt your mind starting to drift to town. '<i>I wonder if anyone is looking for me?...I kinda doubt it. Curtis is probably pissed...</i>' Your thought drifted to work as you figured your boss was thinking you flaked out, but it wasn't likely you'd suffer repercussions for that anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You alright?</span>\" Sylveon broke your concentration as she looked at you. You offered her a smile and waved it off. \"Ah, fine, just thinking about town I guess. Work, human junk.\" You said. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Sounds like junk.</span>\" You heard Umbreon say and Sylveon glared at her. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't be rude like that, this is a big change for him!</span>\" She said and again you waved it off. \"Nah, Umbreon isn't that far off, I wasn't exactly a social butterfly, kept to myself, did my job, and enjoyed my hobbies, pretty much it. Just wondering if anyone has noticed if i'm gone yet.\" You said and Sylveon gave you a sad look. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Really?</span>\" She said. You failed to see why she was sad though as you shrugged. \"Really.\" Was all you finished. She looked like she wanted to say something else, but didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Well, you're better off forgetting that crap, you're our pet now, and you don't need to see any other stinking humans.</span>\" Umbreon said, a little more forcefully than you anticipated. You didn't respond though, your future was up in the air in your mind, but that wasn't something worth thinking about when nothing could be done right now about it. Instead you opted to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the lake good to swim in? That sounds refreshing.\" You asked and Sylveon smiled at this. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Probably, it's a nice day out! Right Umbreon?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, if you want to freeze your furless butt off be my guest.</span>\" Umbreon smirked, but you just rested on her with your hands behind your back. \"I'll just use you as a giant towel when I need to warm up.\" You said and Umbreon chuckled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Right, like that'll be possible with my wet fur.</span>\" Umbreon said. \"So you're getting in the lake too?\" You asked and she smiled. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Well if we're going to the lake, may as well right?</span>\" She said and Sylveon seemed to physically relax now that the mood seemed brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only about a 40 minute walk to the lake you noted, and most of that time was filled with Sylveon and Umbreon talking to each other about stuff or pokemon you honestly had nothing to chime in about. This was fine by you as you looked around at the newer parts of the forest. If you'd gained anything here it was an appreciation for new scenery. This forest was pretty nice, and pretty isolated from people too, though you wouldn't be shocked to see some kind of trainer at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And we're-oh...great.</span>\" Umbreon sounded annoyed as you looked to see the lake. It was then that you thought you saw the subject of her annoyance. And it was...</span></div></div>",

Floatzel leaned down and gave her a quick hug and a greeting. \"<span class=\"corange\">What are you two doing all the way out here? Going for a dip in the lake? The water's really good this time of the year!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Maybe. We're just doing some light exploring,</span>\" Sylveon said. The Floatzel gave her a toothy smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">That's great! I need to do some more exploration sometime, all I know is the lake. Hey, I got some sweet berries in my cave if you want some?</span>\" Floatzel rambled. You could definitely see why Umbreon could see this Pokemon as annoying. He had a lot of energy and it showed as he talked to the two Eeveelutions. From your first impression he did seem nice, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Your cave is under water...</span>\" Umbreon grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, right. Well anyway if you're heading to the lake you better not take that path right there. Dragonite is washing himself and he seems pretty upset about something so you should probably take a small detour. I thought he was going to attack me!</span>\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Thanks for telling us.</span>\" Sylveon nodded. \"<span class=\"cpink\">He <i>has</i> been a bit testy lately. I wonder what's upset him?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel softly laughed and he opened his mouth to say more but his eyes wondered over to you sitting on Umbreon's back. As if he was suddenly frozen, he stared at you with his mouth agape before he finally snapped out of it. \"<span class=\"corange\">What's that?</span>\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of Pokemon were locked in a brief silence before Umbreon spoke up. \"<span class=\"cplum\">A human.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel bent down and leaned in close to you, his face dominating your vision. For the first time since you've met him he was acting more calm and composed. \"<span class=\"corange\">I can see that, but why is it small?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We don't know yet. He just shrunk and then Umbreon found him.</span>\" Sylveon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Huh,</span>\" he murmured. You could feel Umbreon tense up as the Floatzel studied you from a variety of different angles. As for you, you weren't sure if you should be worried about this Pokemon or not. Umbreon was clearly feeling cautious about him interacting with you but looking over at Sylveon you saw she was giving you a reassuring smile. \"<span class=\"corange\">Can I... Can I hold him?</span>\" Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><br>\r\n\"You can, just be very careful with him.</span>\" Sylveon said. You were slightly surprised that you weren't given a choice, it seemed she did really trust him to behave. Meanwhile Umbreon was staring daggers at him. Even though she made no move to stop Floatzel from picking you up her face was clearly communicating that she would react violently if he dared to hurt you. You braced yourself as he reached for you with a cream-furred paw and plucked you up off of Umbreon's back. His short stubby fingers wrapped around you and he used another paw to make sure you were safe from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Wow.</span>\" Floatzel muttered. His paws were trembling slightly and his expression was fluttering between amazement and nervousness. You were happy that he was at least worried about the prospect of hurting you but it was obvious he was stoked at the fact he was holding a miniature human in his hands. Those two mixes of emotions he was showing told you that he understood the sheer gap in power between the two of you. \"<span class=\"corange\">I want one.</span>\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Find your own. He's ours.</span>\" Umbreon stated. Floatzel laughed off the comment and gently placed you back down on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What, like a pet?</span>\" Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yes. He's our pet.</span>\" She confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cborange\">Huh. I know a lot of Pokemon that would kill to have their own pet human. I wouldn't mind having my own little human, that's for sure!</span>\" He laughed as he excitedly fidgeted in place. He turned to Sylveon. \"<span class=\"corange\">So you're going to see the lake huh? I know a <i>really</i> good spot to take a dip if you want me to show you.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Umbreon quietly groan but she looked to Sylveon to see what she wanted to do. As for yourself, you weren't sure about him. Floatzel was staring at you with a strange look on his face. For whatever reason you think him simply holding you gave him some sort of a rush. Besides that oddity he did come of as being quite nice... Regardless, you waited for Sylveon and Umbreon to come to a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long before you saw Sylveon smiling as she looked to Floatzel. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Actually, that does sound quite nice, we'll get to see a new part of the lake, right Umbreon?</span>\" She said enthusiastically before Umbreon sighed, and you could feel her tense up below you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Sure, fine.</span>\" She said, not sounding all that enthused by it at all. Floatzel took his eyes off of you for a second before flashing a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Alright then! Trust me, you're gonna love this spot!</span>\" He said as he waved the two giant Eeveelutions in a direction and you felt yourself moving again. Floatzel started humming a tune as he was in the lead and Umbreon groaned at this. You couldn't see any of their faces, but you could imagine Umbreon barely suppressing a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Try to be nice Umbreon, he's being nice to us.</span>\" Sylveon gently said as Umbreon grunted. She quietly mumbled something, mostly you figured to Floatzel wouldn't hear, but you didn't catch it. You were wrapped up in your own thoughts when it came to the water weasel...he DID seem nice, and he didn't do anything to you, but something about the way he looked at you felt off. Not necessarily evil or malicious...just off. You frowned as you thought back to what had happened last night, but shook the thoughts. Everything had been fine so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So I haven't seen you two in forever! You should come around and visit more often!</span>\" You heard Floatzel cheerfully speak up ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, we could think about it, but we don't explore much around the lake much. Part of why we're here is we wanted to show the little guy the lake, he was curious to see it.</span>\" Sylveon said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I wanted to explore the mountains, but these two outvoted me.</span>\" Umbreon said sounding defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" You muttered before Floatzel stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Wait...can he understand us?</span>\" Floatzel said as you felt him approaching again and looking at you. Umbreon's body language went rigid you felt as he got close and you looked up at him. He was still giving you an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I can.\" You said up at him and he opened his mouth in shock. \"<span class=\"corange\">That's so cool...</span>\" He said in awe before clearing his throat. \"<span class=\"corange\">Well it's great to meet you!</span>\" He said in a friendly tone and you smiled up at him. \"Nice meeting you Floatzel.\" You said politely. You mentally felt calmer at this, he was being nothing but nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Great, you've met, now show us this really good spot at the lake.</span>\" Umbreon said before Sylveon interjected. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't be so rude Umbreon...but yes, I am eager to see this spot too!</span>\" Sylveon said excitedly as Floatzel smiled. \"<span class=\"corange\">Alright, alright. We just gotta keep taking this path.</span>\" He said as you saw him leave your vision to start down the trail again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested your arms behind your head as you relaxed into the dark fur of Umbreon, waiting for your destination. You almost felt yourself frown though, you'd not gotten much exercise because of this shrinking thing, and were starting to feel a little restless as you idly started tapping your leg in impatience. Umbreon didn't seem to notice as you did this at least, but now you were more eager than ever to go swimming and use some pent up energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So little guy, I got a question for ya!</span>\" You heard from up ahead, which got your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You can ignore him if you want.</span>\" You heard Umbreon say as Floatzel chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, don't be such a spoilsport! Just curiosity is all, but why are you so small anyway?</span>\" He asked in a relaxed tone and you frowned at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...don't really know Floatzel, it happened recently while I was hiking, I passed out and woke up this small.\" You said. You didn't feel the need to elaborate on the details more than that, but it seemed to satisfy the guy at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Wow, that must be rough...</span>\" He sounded sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">We're taking good care of him though, so it all worked out.</span>\" Umbreon said with a bit of ease in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And Alakazam is looking into what happened as well.</span>\" Sylveon said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, if he's on it then it's only a matter of time!</span>\" Floatzel said enthusiastically. You smiled at this, he was a nice enough sort you'd decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh hey, we're here! Come on girls! And human dude!</span>\" Floatzel rang off enthusiastically as you felt the ground beneath you speed up. Umbreon was going at a quick pace again, though luckily not too fast to buck you around or off. As you sat up you tried to look ahead, but Umbreon's head blocked your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh wow, look at that view Umbreon...</span>\" You know Sylveon wasn't mocking you, but it kinda felt like it. \"Well I can't see...\" You muttered before you were lifted up by one of Sylveon's feelers. She smiled at you before raising you to let you see...the lake was gorgeous, with nary a speck of any other living being, no evidence that anyone at all had been there. It seemed to stretch out as far as you could see...though honestly, you didn't consider yourself a good judge on distance right now. The water itself looked inviting as well, clear as could be, you felt like you'd be able to see the very bottom of the lake if you wanted to go out far enough. The area around the lake looked free of sharp rocks or annoying vegetation to trip over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it looks so inviting...\" You murmured before you felt yourself being lowered. You found yourself down on the ground this time, forced to look way up at these titanic pokemon. It was then that you felt a rumble as Floatzel dived into the water, causing some tremors for someone of your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Come on in! The water is great!</span>\" You heard him call before Sylveon looked down at you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">So who do you want to watch you while we all swim?</span>\" She asked and you looked at her confused. \"What do you mean? Can't I just break off and swim on my own?\" You asked before Umbreon interjected. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You ain't swimming alone, no way. You'd be easy prey for even a stupid magicarp.</span>\" Umbreon said before you grumbled. You'd kinda wanted some time to yourself, even if what they said made sense. Independence was a luxury you didn't get to have as a 'pet' though you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, I can watch him if you want!</span>\" You heard Floatzel call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey, back off of our human!</span>\" Umbreon retorted before looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, this wasn't what you had in mind, but if it at least let you get in the water...</span></div></div>",

Obviously, logic led you to think that no one would be wandering these woods at such dark hour of the day, but then a fainter voice set some hope in you. Hope that someone might be out here camping, and that they were still awake to 'receive' you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs gladly as someone would ever help a shrunken, naked person...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chance, a very faint one, that you might have found a kind soul that would be willing to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole hope made you place your hands on your shoulders in an attempt to warm yourself up and start walking towards an imprecise direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided, though, that you didn't have to get too far from your back. Getting lost further in this forest would mean sinking deeper into this mess, and you definitely didn't want anything else to deal with right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step you took felt heavy, the cold penetrating your skin like a billion tiny pins, though you gritted your teeth and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with your reduced size, you didn't get too far from your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen minutes passed, before you heard a bush rustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw a figure pushing a bush aside to make way for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was undoubtedly a Pokemon, one you could easily recognize. Black fur, red 'feathers' on top of its head and... very sharp claws, as well as sharp clawed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense to find a Pokemon like that in such a cold night, given its nature, though the sight was 'chilling'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile were known to be very cruel hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as it took a few steps towards a nearby tree and started clawing into the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, it stopped, appearing satisfied with its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">There.</span>\" the creature spoke, sounding vaguely feminine,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I hope those dorks don't mistake. Like last time.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this told you two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne: the giant was a actually a giantESS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: how in the world could you understand a Pokemon!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible! One moment you're hiking in the woods and then - bam! - you're lost, small and able to understand Pokemon! Just what was with this cursed forest!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps back, astounded by this odd turn of events. Then, you saw the Weavile making looking to your bag, which got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hmm? What's this?</span>\"  she asked to nobody in particular, unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strolled over the bag and began examining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you had the craziest idea you could ever get: if you could understand the Weavile, then maybe you would be lucky enough for the Weavile to understand you. If you could convince her that you weren't food, and that you needed help, maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you seriously considering getting help from a deadly predator? Evidently, you were, because your legs began moving on their own, towards the dark-type giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even knew it, you were back where your bag and your discarded clothes were, by one of the clawed toes of the giantess, who was intently examining your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Some human idiot must've dropped these...</span>\" you heard her muttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hey!\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, no one would hear you, but as luck may want it, Weavile had a quite sensible hearing. They had to, or they wouldn't be such efficient predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when the giantess began looking around, you called again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-eyed Pokemon turned her gaze down at her feet, where she saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Huh?</span>\" she squinted, trying to see you better; when she did, those same eyes of hers widened,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">A human?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in silence, intimidated, as the giant being bent, carefully bringing her clawed hand down, scooping you up as carefully as she could in order not to accidentally gut you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were safely sitting in the middle of her palm, away from the tips of those razor-sharp claws, Weavile brought you closer to examine you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. You really were a very tiny human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Well,</span>\" she began in a tone that couldn't mean anything good,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">What do we have here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human!\" you replied, maybe a bit louder than you should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know that, you id- huh?</span>\" Weavile abruptly trailed off,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Did you just answer me?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the giantess looked amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You can understand Pokemon?</span>\" she asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently.\" you replied, feeling slightly calmer,<br>\r\n\"Though I'm not sure since I really just met you so far,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weavile squinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Okay human, why are you so small? And how can you understand Pokemon?</span>\" she inquired, before adopting a suspicious gaze,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You're not one of those 'pure-hearted' nimrods that can talk to Pokemon, are you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement left you a bit uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... no? I'm not even a trainer,\" you explained, trying to keep calm,<br>\r\n\"I don't know and... I don't know. I don't know why I'm small, nor why we're having this conversation. The only thing I know is... I need help. So, um... could you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile blinked a few times, as if taken aback by the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed you would be too if you were a Pokemon and a human, who notoriously caught Pokemon, asked you for help. But then again, you were no trainer and she had no reason to hold anything against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts came to an end when you saw the Weavile smirking.</span></div></div>",

Welcome on board, human!</span>\" she said, grinning mischievously, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm sure you and I are gonna get alone just fine, even if you're a bit of a dope.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to smile at her words, but all you could manage was a forced smile that didn't really look so convincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Weavile didn't seem to notice. And, if she noticed, she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Well then, let's get outta here, before the others find me. Wouldn't want them mistaking you for food. Will I be damned if those incompetent Sneasel eat you instead of me.</span>\" she said, sending shivers running down your back as she began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" you stopped her, pointing to your bag,<br>\r\n\"Please, bring that. There's stuff I'm going to need inside, if you're going to k-k-\" you couldn't bring yourself to say it. It took a huge effort to,<br>\r\n\"... Keep me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile looked at the bag, then groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry, but I gotta go hunt. That thing would only slow me down.</span>\" she bluntly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on!... Er, I mean, please!\" you said, causing the giantess to huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know you from five minutes and you're already being a pain in my...</span>\" she murmured the last part, before saying,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Fine. Guess it can help me carry you.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile nodded, before lowering the claw you were on inside of one of the empty pockets of your camping bag, securing you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Happy now?</span>\" she said, somewhat annoyed, before adding, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'll be hunting for the next hour or so, so... I don't know, think 'bout life or something.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of suggestion was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pocket you were in was closed, before its insides shook as Weavile scooped up the bag and slid it over her shoulders, feeling it heavy on her back, though not that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she moved over to a nearby tree, surprised to see that, despite the weight, her speed was pretty much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, feeling your world shaking, you sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long night... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left trapped in a dark corner of your bag for who knew how long, presumably hours, with the surroundings constantly shaking, tossing you back and forth with the confines of the pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not what you had imagined, but you supposed it was better than riding on Weavile's claws, where you would have surely been sliced in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was grim enough that you were glad to be in this shaky pocket right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime drew on without a word from your new 'caretaker'. You couldn't even think straight, because you couldn't keep your focus for more than two seconds before a strong motion threw you to another corner of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it all eventually came to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your lone pocket stopping, before the opening above you opened and light peered in, before it got eclipsed by Weavile's grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry about that,</span>\" she apologized,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">But hunting requires focus. I couldn't talk to you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" you replied as you came out of your own bag, immediately taking notice that the Weavile's claws were covered in what appeared to be-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away, pitying the poor creature that was no longer among the living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you realized that you were hungry as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you do me a favor?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a few snacks in my bag. Can you get them for me? I'm starving.\" you told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh. Sure, I guess.</span>\" she replied, kneeling to open up your bag... at least to try to, because she couldn't figure out how to zip it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Darn thing...</span>\" you heard her muttering, before she finally had enough and slashed the upper part of the bag, ripping it open and digging inside, while you watched in silence. If this was the way she treated stuff, then you pitied yourself for how she was going to treat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating your fill, you turned to the dark-type, attempting to strike up a casual conversation, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... guess I'm staying then.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile nodded her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down a moment, before asking her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile began snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Dude, you're a little human! How many Pokemon can say they got their own shrunken person? How cool is that?</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began tapping your fingertips on the floor of the cavern Weavile had brought you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wait, 'theirs'? You mean I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile nodded her head with one, eager motion, excited at the idea, while you weren't really sure you liked to be considered her property. The way things were going, it was pretty clear that you were 'hers'. Her belonging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was a pretty hard one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what am I to you?\" you asked, before noticing her staring at you, perplexed, and adding, <br>\r\n\"Like, a pet or... I dunno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ah. Didn't think about that...</span>\" she admitted, before falling into thought, letting the silence fall as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept staring at her, until she looked back at you and said, </span></div></div>",

Looking at more of its body, you notice a slit in between the hips of the Lycanroc, confirming the gender to be a female.

You dig your head into the fur, feeling how surprisingly soft it feels, when you feel the motion of the Lycanroc starting to move. You look up to see a glimpse of the Lycanroc's head. Though she's still smiling, she doesn't seem to be looking at you at the present moment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shimmering oceanic blue where you had first witnessed your own reflection give off an expression of confusion and terror had given you the initial impression that this was Azelf, Phione or some other blue legendary seen through your now distorted world view. Eventually your higher mental functions came alive and told you that this had only been its eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your mind found it difficult to process what you were witnessing. This elusive creature had been known to strike awe into the most hardened men when seen at a distance, and now you were taking it all in so close and larger than life. The most troubling aspect was the color of this creature. It was pink; you understood that much. But it was no shade you had ever seen before. It was not covered by skin. It was not covered by hair. It was simply an unnaturally clean and bright pink, almost like a cartoon character come to life. One would have to be blind, deaf and dumb to miss that this was not a regular Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mew. Stunned to an almost religious degree, you did nothing as the legendary's hand grasped your sides and lifted you up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Hello, human,\"</span> the Mew spoke with a sweet voice, not sounding too loud but covering you in further its non-descript breath, <span class=\"cpink\">\"You must be very startled by my apperance, but if you remain calm then all will be fine. Do you understand?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't, but you found your head nodding up and down anyway. A suggestion crept through your mind that all was fine, there was nothing to worry about, just admire the view and take it easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet little Mew placed you back down on your old clothes and then proceeded to rummage through your belongings. This was fine. Nothing to worry about. You took the opportunity to the admire the view of the legendary's unremarkable backside, with its long tail waving back and forth in excitement. How lucky you were! Instead of trudging through the night like a putz, you got to meet up with Mew! You couldn't wait to tell everyone at the bar about this! You decided to take in every feature so you could explain this in as much detail as possible. Mew picked up a a bag of snacks that you had brought and smiled, placing it beside its unremarkable backside. Its unremarkable backside covered your view as the Mew went on and you began to make a mental note on its unremarkable backside and the rest of its far more interesting body, starting with its unremarkable backside. Its? Uremarkable? Backside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first feeling of something being amiss crept up your spine. You had always considered legendaries to be genderless, and like most others you had never been able to confirm this theory with hands-on experience. That was until now, and there was no denying that this Mew was female. For with her backside in view, there was a view that had seemed unremarkable before but now appeared to be the most interesting aspect of this creature. Mew's tail shone. Mew's hind legs shone. But Mew's vagina was as common and predictable as they come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes remained glued to Mew's womanhood as her butt waved back and forth and your cognition slowly began to kick into gear again. Suddenly your brain was suggesting that this sweet little Mew was a, in fact, a gigantic creature that whose tail's invoulentary twitch would be enough to send you flying whatever qualified as miles at this size. As logic follows, this would suggest that this situation was not alright at all! The only view you were \"admiring\" right now was of the callous legendary stealing your shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew hummed cheerfully to herself as she ran inventory on her haul. This was the best idea ever! Why fight a trainer's six Pok\u00e9mon and risk capture when you could just shrink them from behind? A little psychic suggestion to keep them from freaking out and she was free to take whatever she wanted! Food, snacks, bottles of who-knows-what; even those interesting human gadgets appealed to her, though she handled them with care as to not get swept into a Master Ball by mistake. She hadn't made it this long by being careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the giant smirking to herself and get ready to do something about it when suddenly your body enters shock. You sieze up and fall to the side, an unimagiable cold crushing your body from all sides. It felt like being frozen in ice and you remembered your earlier concerns about hypothermia. But this was worse than anything you could've ever imagined! You couldn't even move! Wheezing and gasping your last breaths, you attempt to cry for help. To someone. Anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"There! Thank you for y-\"</span> Mew started as she turned around, seeing the human now dying on his old clothes. Her mind racing in panic, she quickly scooped up his tiny little body and examined it closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire world wooshed by as you narrowly escaped the jaws of death. In an instant your body thawed out, and you noticed the non-descript scent of Mew's breath like a wind of life. Heat radiated from the ground, and you felt your body tickled by very fine hairs; thin even at your size. And above you was Mew's gigantic face, her massive eyes staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicting thoughts arose within Mew. Observing the naked man, it appeared that his metabolic system was designed to dissipate heat through the surface of his skin. Now that he was so much smaller, his body couldn't compensate and he would most likely freeze to death. If it wasn't for the heat coming form her body, he would already be dead. This was not what she had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tremble, both out of fear and residual cold. Mew was staring at you, but it was impossible to tell her intentions. Nothing about the way someone walks can tell you where they're going. She is capable of speech however, so you consider the option of talking your way out of this. You decide on how to go about your persuation attempt...</span></div></div>",

She briefly looked at her human victim, and the sight alone was enough to strike guilt into her: he looked like he was almost frozen (as he was certainly going to be if she didn't hurry), his eyes were completely void, his teeth chattering, producing a low sound that only made the legendary increase her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your brain rapidly shutting down, you looked at the very agitated legendary that was carrying you to an unknown destination, floating at full speed through the forest with the stuff she stole hovering behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't looking at you and, for a moment, you thought about shouting to get her attention, demand her to let you go, appear as imposing as possible right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decided against it; an angry legendary was the last thing you needed right now and, to tell the truth, you didn't feel like you had any more strength to shout. The wise thing to do was to keep calm, pretend to be still under the Mew's spell and ask questions when you weren't about to die in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you saw her gigantic blue eyes gazing down at you as she checked if you were still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made eye contact with the Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whe-\" you started, but trailed off as cold penetrated your mouth, invading your insides as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Save your strength human, you'll need it,</span>\" the pink giantess said, concerned,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't worry, all will be fine. Just stay calm...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't conceive how she was asking you to \u2018stay calm\u2019 right now. If you weren't about to enter hypothermia and shrunken to a pitifully small size, you would have certainly freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted, and you felt like your brain was frozen, like you had just eaten a lot of ice cream too hastily. Each thought now hurt your head, the unrelenting cold stung you from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your consciousness slowly waned. You took one last glance at the gigantic Mew, before everything became dark as you passed out from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mew, she finally made it to a small cave and rushed inside, finally finding shelter from the grip of cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for her, of course. Her fur kept her perfectly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for the human she had shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, fighting trainers and their pokemon bothered her, but she never came even close to killing anyone! She never even thought about such thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bad, the legendary set the stuff she took - stole - on the stone floor of the cavern, before she finally looked at her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she punched in the stomach, her eyes shrunk at the sight of the naked human laying motionless against her chest, his eyes closed and his mouth gaping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, the pink legendary brought her head on top of your form and listened carefully in complete silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the human was still alive. But it didn't mean he was out of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Mew began rubbing you in between her paws while she neared her mouth to you and breathed right on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after several moments she stopped and picked up your shirt with Psychic, wrapping you up in one of the sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like her actions weren't in vain, she thought with a sigh of relief, the human's face regained a little bit of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Am I... dead...?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your first thought as you woke up, slowly opening your eyes to glance around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was comprehensibly blurry, but your vision cleared after a few instants, allowing you to see... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of what happened began returning: you met Mew, you saw her stealing your stuff, you... almost died from the cold, if you weren't dead for real right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your hand and tried to pinch yourself with it, but you discovered that you couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn confusion you looked around, which took a bit of an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there, right in front of you, was the giant form of the Mew you met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct was to back away, but you couldn't move properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you relaxed upon realizing the the giantess was asleep, her eyes closed and her breath slow, rhythmic, almost hypnotic. Even when asleep, the legendary was absolutely fascinating, but you didn't have any time to think about her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at yourself, discovering that the reason of your immobility was your own shirt, wrapped tightly around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew must have improvised this blanket for you to warm you up, you sourly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to break free from your own shirt, feeling like you were going to suffocate, but you only managed to loosen it up a bit. Better than nothing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, your gaze went to the sleeping Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you managed to break free completely, you could get away from this unpredictable legendary that almost caused your death only to steal a few things from your bag - she even brought them along while she rescued you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But, she saved you, so that meant she didn't mean you any real harm, and your chances alone out there  were quite low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew seemed like a comforting thought, a barrier around you, but she also was a tormenting thought; if you stayed around her, she could do all sorts of things to you and you wouldn't have been able to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone was terrifying, but not as much as it was the mental image of your dead body in the middle of these woods you made the mistake in coming to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you were going to do, you had to make a choice, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew wasn't going to sleep forever.</span></div></div>",

It would have been even easier to take your stuff if you were disposed of by the cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this legendary DID have a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could talk to her properly, you could maybe convince her to just grow you back and let you go on your way with the promise you were going to forget everything that has been going on between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, noticing your lack of response, Mew spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But don't worry!

A move, an ability, anything was acceptable if it meant that you could have your size back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mew intently, waiting for any kind of answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the pink legendary did was offer a shrug and sorrowful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">If there is a way to grow you back, I do not know.</span>\" she bluntly stated,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the giantess in silence for several seconds. The words she spoke, you knew, represented your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA life in this miserable size, in constant danger, lost in the middle of a forest, stuck with the unpredictable legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs stiffened as you laid there before the towering Mew, desperation taking over your mind and the need to cry growing stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have lost your size and your life, but you still had your dignity... you weren't sure how that was going to last, given how you were naked and on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body unable to move, and you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside you, the pink pokemon that did this to you adopted a dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry, but-</span>\" she started, reaching out for you with a short paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw it coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA newfound adrenaline spread through your body like an electric shock, and you moved out of the way, leading the Mew to shoot you a perplexed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desperation quickly waned from your mind, replaced by rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" you shouted,<br>\r\n\"You did this to me! You knew you couldn't grow me back, but you did it regardless! Just what did I do to you to deserve all of this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeble voice in your mind reasonably told you to calm down, because an outburst was probably going to end with the Mew crushing your body into dust with the mere blink of an eye; however, you shut the voice up, telling yourself that living like this wasn't worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well take out all your repressed rage, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Mew, she looked taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome legendaries had the power to feel others' emotions. The pink legendary wasn't among them, but could however feel an incredible amount of rage coming from you, and it was enough to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this human didn't calm down, she'd have to use drastic measures and get him to calm down, whether he wanted or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... You did nothing to me,</span>\" she calmly began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calm only made you feel more angry, why the hell did she seem to not care about your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why the hell did you this to me!? I was just wandering around, did I, I don't know, step in your turf or something?\" you exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"You literally ruined my life! What am I going to do now!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew frowned, feeling guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant you no actual harm, but your words were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she couldn't grow you back, then an innocent's life was ruined for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please, just calm down,</span>\" she muttered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We can talk this over...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you felt like you were about to catch fire, your anger threatening to blow your head up at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down!? Calm down!? You just ruined my life and all you can say is-\" you were interrupted as the pink giantess suddenly<br>\r\nplaced a paw on your forehead, with enough strength to send you stumbling back and fall down on the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had any time to react, the paw on your forehead sent a pink glow spreading through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to protest, but you felt your anger waning all of a sudden as Mew performed Heal Pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the legendary pulled back, staring down at you with a tired expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">There. This should make you more reasonable.</span>\" she said as she sat back down, letting out a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, all your rage disappeared from your mind as you sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it...\" you muttered dejectedly, reverting back to desperation,<br>\r\n\"There is... there is really no way for me to grow back...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew seemed deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, silence fell all over the cave, and remained unbroken for a good while, in which nothing was said or done from both you or Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately though, the legendary looked back at you and finally broke the silence,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wh... Really?\" you replied with surprise, a ray of hope shining through you heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Of course!\"</span> Mew spoke up with a cheerful disposition, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I mean, there's nothing a Mew can't do!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you say, trying to remember if you had picked up any TMs or HMs with Growth lately, \"Do you mean that in, like, an inspirational way or something more concrete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"No no no, don't worry!\"</span> Mew giggles while waving her relatively small yet to you gargantuan paws back and forth, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Shrinking and growing things are a Mew's specialty! I'm just a newbie at it, it's not like I had a trainer to teach me how to...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind pressure from her gesture stirred up the cool night's air and caused it to strike against your tiny body, which screamed out for a source of heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-MEW!\" you shouted between the shivers, \"Stop... Doing things. I-It's very...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh! Sorry,\"</span> she said as she picked you up and you felt the pink fuzz lightly crush you. It wasn't a lukewarm sensation, but more like heat cleashing with cold, like lighting a fire while naked in a blizzard. It wasn't enough, and you worried that you were going to pass out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, I'm still cold!\" you said and tried to rub your temple, but your arms were pinned to your sides by the giantess. Without wasting a moment, mew leaned back and dropped you on top of her stomach, before holding her paws over you like a shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Better?\"</span> Mew asked cautiously before quietly giggling, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I'm not putting you in my mouth.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking you to,\" you say, feeling satisfactory amounts of warmth wash over your body. From this perspective, everything looked so strange. Underneath you was a field of pink grass, which was warm to the touch constantly rippling with pulse-like movement and noise. Above you were two giant hands, blocking out most of the light and trapping the heat like inside a greenhouse. And through a small crack in front of you, though the yawning portal to another world from your point of view, was the beaming face of Mew, the giantess you were now sitting on. You were on the belly of a tiny little legendary, one so small you could probably have held her in one hand normally. Now she was your entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen...?\" you uttered breathlessly, taking in what it must feel like to be an ant, \"... Specialists in shrinking? I've never heard anything about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew stares at you for a few moments as she appears to ponder something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"How old are you?\"</span> she asked flatly, her hot breath blowing inside your little hideout and adding to the sauna-like atmosphere. You hastily looked at the rating for the interactive story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eighteen plu... I mean, what that's got to do with it?\" you ask. Mew stares at you a little longer this time; a little more intently.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><br>\r\n\"As you can see, I am not a particularly large Pok\u00e9mon,\"</span> she explained with a calm tone, and her words stung a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could've fooled me...\" you muttered bitterly, leaning back on the immesurably huge belly of this \"not particularly large\" Pok\u00e9mon, \"So you shrunk yourself down to this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"No silly; I shrink others!\"</span> Mew giggled as she looked off to the side sheepishly, <span class=\"cpink\">\"And then grow them back, of course, but the shrinking part just kind of came to me naturally and the growing bit... And I wasn't supposed to shrink you THAT much either... Hmm...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" you stammer in disbelief, wondering if all Pok\u00e9mon were this crazy once you got to know them better, Why do you shrink people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh, y'know,\" </span>Mew chimed with a knowing grin. You didn't. You stare blankly at her, apparently enough for it to become uncomfortable as she cleared her throat, causing the chest in front of you to boom with a terrifying noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpink\">\"... Have sex?\" </span></i>Mew said. You looked up at the giantess, somehow having forgotten that this planetoid you were on also came equipped with reproductive organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oooooh,\" you exclaim with the kind of knowing noise people feel the need to make whenever they've just figured something out, and then you became aware of a nagging feeling in the back of your head, \"Wait, were you... Trying to... Court me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpink\">\"What? No!\" </span></b>Mew shouted out in embarassment as she shook her head, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I was trying to... To...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteal your stuff, Mew thought to herself. But bringing that up now probably wasn't a good idea. Besides, all the talk about sex and having a naked guy pressed against her body had gotten her a little bit aroused. It wasn't just that though. There was something about the human's tiny form that made her heart race and face blush, filling her mind with ideas of a very different part of her body she'd like to put him. But all that was moot; she was trying to help him, not accidentally crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I was just... Experimenting, OK?\"</span> she said. The words left her mouth before she could stop herself as you crossed your arms, <span class=\"cpink\">\"That came out wrong. Listen...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you normally turn people into ants to have sex with them?\" you continue asking, getting a surprising amount of satisfaction out of seeing this behemoth completely flustered. You thought you could see a blush spreading over her vast expression, though what little light you had to work with was constantly shifting around as her paws began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Never!\" </span>Mew exclaimed as her eyes shot wide open, hoping she could explain this in a more 'normal' way than what she herself was feeling, <span class=\"cpink\">\"You're supposed to shrink them down just a little, y'know, so it... Fits properly?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm honored, but I'm afraid I must decline,\" you said and stood up on the wobbly ground and turned away from her face, hoping to hide an amused smile from the living goddess, \"At this size I think I'll fit with room to spare, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"That's true! So why would I shrink you down if I was trying to have sex with you!?\"</span> Mew argued as she raised herself a little, watching the small human tumble forward and faceplant straight into her fur. It felt odd to her; humans are built to walk upright and so most of their gravity gets focused into one spot. With the little guy outstretched like this she could barely even feel him, and she realized how insanely tiny she had made him. It made her heart flutter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you screwed up!\" the human shouted with exasperation and dug into the pink reed under him. This time Mew's heart wasn't fluttering; it was stopping. She opened her mouth to say something, but fell silent and felt embarassed. She would have a hard time arguing against that. She wasn't thinking about the consequences, and figured the human could've just wandered off and maybe grown himself back. She didn't think he was going to turn into a popsicle after 10 seconds. No matter how you looked at it, she was at fault here, and the human had every right to hate her as much as he did. There was no love in the air tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back on your feet, you watch Mew's gaze shift away from you. With those large sapphire eyes and soft features, there was something very cute about seeing a humongous creature get this bothered over an insignificant bug like him. If he were a fly on the wall he probably would've found it hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she wanted to have sex with you? That was a shocker. You had always snarked at people talking about their 'magical' Pok\u00e9mon journey, but you go hiking for just a few days and some demigoddess already wants you. You always liked Pok\u00e9mon even if you had never thought about them in THAT way, but this Mew wasn't just any regular Pok\u00e9mon. She could talk, for one. And she was nice and pretty funny too; all attractive features. And you would be lying if you said you weren't a bit curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you said, causing the massive legendary to flinch and making your surroundings twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" you stated bluntly. The sheer enormity of it all hit you as the giantess looked down at you, causing everything to change at once. Her breath came in once more like a summer's rainstorm and filled the air with humidity. Her heart hammered away inside her chest as the ground shook like an earthquake. Somewhere you recognized that this was complete insanity and would get even worse if you kept going down this path, but you had made up your mind - You were going to go through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Do what?\"</span> Mew asked with curiosity as she saw you turn and walk away from her. Or as close to it as he could manage, what with being on top of her body. Was he trying to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" he replied sternly and kept going. He was leaving! Mew wanted to stop him, to hug him closer, but couldn't muster the heart to do. He really did hate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You'll freeze,\"</span> Mew wishpered sadly as she lifted her paws that were now blocking your way, and you could see the vast expanse of pink stretching out in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long,\" you responded, gulping loudly as you looked at the horizon. By now Mew was beginning to put two and two together, and realized that you walking to her shins for an easy jumping-off point was, in fact, you walking on a straight course towards her genitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Wait! Wait!\"</span> Mew suddenly exclaimed as she almost sprang up, but stopped herself in the last moment as to keep you from tumbling off her completely, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I didn't mean for you to...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll keep me 'nice and warm', you said. I'm not an idiot,\" you recalled as you began to pick up your pace, the grassy fur around you receding into the \"soil\" the further you got and giving way to sleek pink skin. Mew was torn on what to do. On the one hand, this was a just a big misunderstanding! But on the other hand, her mind was swimming with plesurable feelings and the human didn't seem to mind the proposition she had been too afraid to ask. Does she...</span></div></div>",

Gradually, your body began sinking inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew let a moan escaped her mouth, which she covered with both her paws, attempting to hide her blushing face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid in waist-deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew struggled to remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sank in up to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you began to fade from sight, replaced by a new, reddish, dark and slick world made of damp flesh; your only way out took the top of your head in as well right before it shut close, blocking out any eventual light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was right, you mused: it was steaming hot in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the human's disappearing, Mew placed a hand on her quivering sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind raced, her heart pounded her chest and lustful thoughts began speeding across her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing she was alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink legendary felt her sex pulsing beneath her palm and, before she even knew it, she was already rubbing the portal of your entry slowly, causing herself to grit her teeth and let a stifled moan escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the legendary, you felt the slow motions from outside; it wasn't hard to see what Mew was doing now that you were 'nice and warm' down her depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fleshy surroundings squeezed you from head to toe, dragging you deeper within the legendary giantess, who gradually sped her 'activities' up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid unmoving, letting her insides throw you around like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never guess a legendary so innocent-looking could be ever able to do something like this; yet another example that one must never trust the looks, you mused, intoxicated by the sickeningly sweet scent that lingered inside of Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeper and deeper you were dragged, until your feet connected with a certain dome-shaped organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">AH!</span>\" Mew screamed from outside as she neared her orgasm; at this point, you couldn't fight your own urges anymore, and decided to help your 'savior' get the job over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to move within the cramped confines of her vagina, you began squirming and trashing around.

And this was one of those times, you mused while staring at the sleeping face of the Mew you 'befriended' last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still so hard to believe such creature could do such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that there was nothing interesting   to do or say until the pink giantess woke up, you began examining yourself and your environment: you were still pinned down to the stomach of the sleeping titan by one of her paws which, albeit stubby, was far too strong for you to lift. Ironically, the other paw rested near her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a couple of failed attempts to get free, you gave up and laid still, deciding to catch another five minutes of shut eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened them again, you had no idea how much time had passed, but the Mew was now staring down at you with her own sapphire eyes reflecting your body and a clear blush on her pink cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, not you or her broke the silence, both trying to find a proper choice of words that wouldn't make the conversation too awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So... some night, huh?' didn't seem like a good way to start after what happened between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey...</span>\" Mew finally shattered the silence with a simple word,<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you replied, just as quiet as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you went silent after that simple exchange of words. It wasn't like you didn't want to talk to her, there simply was nothing to say: what you did with her last night was clear and undeniable, there simply was no need to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, she looked at you with a calm expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's go.</span>\" she said, beginning to stand onto the rock she fell asleep on before hovering in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go where?\" you wondered as she fluttered towards the opening of the cavern, which she left, being showered by the warm sunlight of the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sure you want something to eat and drink.

Indeed, Mew had totally forgotten she brought that thing along when she was busy saving your shrunken backside from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink behemoth looked back at you and offered a small nod, before heading back into the cave, where she placed you down and turned her attention to the bag, sinking  nearly completely inside for a couple seconds, before she came back with her paws full of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growled hungrily at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having eaten your fill, you were once more carried outside by Mew; now that there wasn't the risk you could die from the cold, she could carry you around freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her promise and made her way to a nearby lake to wash up; since you were already naked, the legendary dove right in with you still in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the cool water assault you as both you and the giantess sank for a few moments; she swam deeper down, before turning back to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body felt refreshed immediately, and sensation of Mew's dried liquids on you faded soon enough, leaving just the pleasant feeling of the water; the pink giantess herself busily groomed herself in the water, eliminating any trace of dirt or dust her fur may have collected on the cave's stone floor. She paid particular attention to her nethers, carefully washing her sex from last night's... 'experience'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you spoke after a bit of doing nothing but swimming, keeping yourself around the giantess; if some water pokemon came out, you'd rather be around her than in their stomach,<br>\r\n\"About my size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighed and offered a half-hearted shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I told you, I don't know how to grow things yet.</span>\" she bluntly reminded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I can't stay like this forever!\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Look, I'm fairly certain I can learn the growth part,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I just need to figure it out. Problem is, I don't know how much time it'll take.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you at least try?\" you insisted, <br>\r\n\"I really need my size back, Mew.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess closed her eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Fine.</span>\" she said, lifting you out of the water with Psychic; her eyes glowed of a cerulean light afterwards, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I promise nothing though.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the glow surrounding you becoming warmer, before the light became blinding, forcing you to close your eyes for several moments, until the bright glow died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopeful, you opened your eyes to see if your situation had improved or if you were still a pathetically small doll in the paws of the giant legendary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, everything was the same.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tingling sensation intensified and you closed your eyes again in anticipation. You were feeling <i>something</i> so you assumed it was working and you smiled to yourself as the feeling seemed to reach its peak. All of a sudden, it stopped and was quickly followed by a gasp from Mew which made your heart sink with dread. Still being levitated with Psychic, you hesitantly opened your eyes and the sight made your heart skip a beat. It was Mew; only much, much bigger. You thought she was mindbogglingly large before but now she might as well be her very own planetoid! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, her attempt at reversing the shrinking she had done to you had only succeeded in making you even smaller. You flinched as Mew brought her stubby paw up to catch you out of the air and it felt like you were being swiped up by a fuzzy mountain. Your body sunk down waist deep into the large pink strands of fur and you struggled to stay standing from the minute movements she made as she simply held you. In the end you collapsed on your back as Mew carefully pulled you closer to her, her face essentially taking up all your field of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Um, I think I messed up,</span>\" Mew quietly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the understatement of the century. The size you were previously at could be considered gigantic compared to the new small size you found yourself at now. In the back of your mind you almost expected it, she made it clear that she wasn't confident in her ability to grow things but the sheer enormity of your surroundings and Mew herself made you feel incredibly anxious. Earlier you were concerned about the idea of being small forever and now those fears were intensifying tenfold as you started imagining that same scenario but on a much worse scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Are you okay?</span>\" Mew asked, guilt and concern written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to speak but hesitated. Not only were you unsure of how to answer that question, you weren't even sure if she could hear such a puny thing. Eventually you spoke up and stated the obvious. \"Well, it didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I said I didn't know how to do it,</span>\" she groaned. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm a bit surprised it backfired this much, though, I'm sorry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's get back to the cave, first.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew gently brought you up to her chest and held you there as she left the water and flew to the cave. With how large her paw was, your world was engulfed in darkness and you could only see a few fragments of light through the dense fur of her chest. For a moment you began to panic as her grip lightened and you felt yourself tumbling deeper into the fur but thankfully you found yourself essentially held in place by the long pink hairs. You assumed she was being careful not to crush you because of your much smaller size but the minuscule amount of leeway she was trying to give you would have sent you plummeting down if it weren't for her fur. Your body was light enough that the fur was holding you up but you still grabbed an entire armful, just in case. You felt like a flea.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen she got back to the cave you were almost amused as she pulled her hand away and failed to find you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Um, where are you?</span>\" she uncertainly asked. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I didn't drop you did I?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on your chest,\" you yelled up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel her chest slowly rise as she breathed a sigh of relief and started searching for you. Looking up you could see her searching her fur, slowly parting it randomly as she tried to locate you. Were you really so small she couldn't see you? Waving your hands her massive blue eyes eventually focused on you. Once again, she sighed but this one sounded more pitiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Jeez, you're really tiny.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment you both sat in silence as Mew craned her neck to look down at the pitifully small human nestled on her chest. The implications of her failure to return you back to your normal size hung heavily in the air. First off, you couldn't live a life at this size and secondly, if she tried to fix it she might accidentally make the situation worse yet again. It presented quite the conundrum because if you wanted to ever be larger again, you would eventually have to risk her giving it another shot. What if she fails again? Could you even survive if you got smaller? What if you got so small you just blinked out of existence? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you just pushed yourself further against her chest, resting in her fur. Reaching back, you touched her skin and could feel her powerful heart beating away inside. The concealment from the outside world and the rhythmic beating was oddly calming but eventually Mew felt like she had to address the issue at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Um, look, we've got a few options,</span>\" she started. \"<span class=\"cpink\">We could try that again, it might work...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it might not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah. I really didn't think I was that bad at it, I'm sorry...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the other options?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I think that if I shrink other people or Pokemon I could develop the skill faster. I shrink them down a bit, try and grow them back and if I fail and make them smaller then I can just go get another volunteer to train on!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolunteer was definitely the wrong word in this situation but you abstained from pointing it out. You hated to think about involving others into this fiasco but it did sound like a good way for her to develop the growing aspect of her size-changing powers quickly, even if she would probably end up creating a menagerie of shrunken Pokemon. When she develops it she could just grow them all back and release them, though, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Or maybe it's better if we don't try at all,</span>\" she suggested. \"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sure I can make it work; you can just live with me and i'll look after you. I mean, the arrangement might not be permanent, we might come up with something else later.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the the way she looked it seemed she was deeply conflicted. She wanted to make it right but was ultimately unsure if she could based on her past failure. It might have just been a fluke but the dread that another attempt might fail again weighed heavily in the air. Despite that, she had condensed your options down to three alternatives; merely try again, let her train her abilities or simply live with her as is and hope she comes up with something later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like she wanted your input. Which option do you suggest?</span></div></div>",

Right now it didn't matter what your thoughts were, Mew made a snap decision as she grabbed the shit from your bag that she wanted with psychic and flew off into the air at incredible speed to your shrunken form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mew was pondering the human...this was the first time she'd tried a stunt like that, and it was one she hoped wouldn't bite her in the ass. She'd been frustrated with humans coming upon her before and always eluded capture, but not before snagging a token offering from them for the trouble they put her through. This seemed a way to get a little revenge on the humans while also scoring some snacks...and of course the first human she does this to is not only in danger from the cold, but from what she could tell, he wasn't even a freaking trainer! She found nothing in his bag to indicate any of that, no pokepuffs, no pokeballs, no potions...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having a hard time keeping your senses together with the wind howling by you, even if you were pressed to a warm surface. You tried to adjust your head but couldn't even do that much, and all it accomplished was Mew pushing harder, stopping you from squirming out of her grasp. You felt the contents of your stomach dance around as she flew down, towards a mountain you noted, and into a tiny little cave...well, tiny to her, to you it was a grand maw, one you didn't know if you'd return from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed, setting her prize in a little corner, where you noted other cheap snacks and drinks were, and she decided to regard you. You felt yourself pulled from her chest and up to her massive face, her eyes filled with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Little human...</span>\" She said, a suggestion creeping into your head once again, one to tell the truth. \"<span class=\"cpink\">What were you doing in the forest?</span>\" She asked, genuinely curious. Your answer might indicate to her what she should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just taking a hike...taking in the sites and winding down from work.\" You said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Did you intend to capture any pokemon?</span>\" She asked and you shook your head no. Mew frowned slightly. So this was just an innocent passing human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that left her at a crossroad. The right thing to do would be to grow him back, give him his clothes and send him away...maybe erase his memory of the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that itself carried risks, erasing memory could cause permanent damage to your brain if she did it wrong, and if she didn't erase the memory there was a chance that you'd spread the word about Mew and what she'd done to you. There would be no peace for her in that forest, many humans would come to claim her as a prize, or they'd come in anger at what she'd done to one of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could keep you she mused...like a little pet or a little friend in a way. Company would be nice...not to mention the fun she could have with a tiny human of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could also just...end it too. At this point it could be a mercy to the tiny human, he was far too small and weak to care for himself, and the cold was eating through him fast. Could she do that though? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the eyes as Mew pulled you back and decided your fate.</span></div></div>",

Why would you want to be a pet, especially to a creature that tried to manipulate your mind. You voice your complaints to match your line of thought. \"Why would I want to be a pet?

That was a reasonable response, why should she trust a random no name human to not reveal that she had nearly killed him. You decide to explore other options before submitting to Mew. \"What other options do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew suddenly gained a sad look while looking pitifully at you. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Death.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death? Isn't that kinda... drastic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For you, it would be a mercy, considering you nearly died without my body heat.

Mew had taken to keeping you in a cage, only taking you out when she wanted to pet you or do...unmentionable things. You had given up on escape, the punishments Mew put you through for trying were unbearable. And even if Mew didn't punish you, you couldn't find any way out of the pink void. Not once had you been brought out, despite Mew saying she would think about letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pokemon in question appeared, looking as bubbly as ever, despite basically kidnapping you and keeping you caged.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">How are you doing, little buddy of mine!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that not responding would only make her upset, so you responded in the way she had trained you to. \"I am fine, Mistress Mew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's fantastic! I have some fun games planned for us today!</span>\" Mew rushed out, obviously excited to see you once again, but the feeling wasn't reciprocated. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Now let's have some cuddles on the bed!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to back away to the back of the cage, despite knowing that it would do nothing more then amuse her.

The psychic power gave out when you reached her, causing you to fall on the pink surface that saved you that fateful night, but right now holding you captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's spend eternity together forever,no one to bother us, you haven't been escaping in a while, my life is perfect</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But mine isn't' You thought angrily at the pink cat legendary. You had tried to kill yourself numerous times, but everything in this space was made to keep you safe, no sharp objects, and the 'floor' was like a bouncy castle.The worst part was, if Mew caught you trying to kill yourself, she would stay for a long period of time, leaving you no rest and relaxation away from the Yandere, so you stopped after the third try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admit that the warmth Mew emitted was relaxing, at least until you thought of what was emitting said warmth.

On its head, two thin antennae with blue tips and gigantic blue eyes with white pupils and black eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt, this was one of the most rare legendaries ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, the time-traveling guardian of forests!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt its grip growing tighter around your chest as it brought you up to its face, a perplexed expression painted on its face, like it was trying to figure out what you really were. Because, a human couldn't be so small... could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear seemed to finally relent and let go of your vocal chords,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\" you started in an uncertain tone, before you cleared your throat to try and assume a firmer voice,<br>\r\n\"D-Don't hurt me... please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy cocked its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw its lips parting, and you feared that this beast wanted nothing more than to throw you inside, swallow and enjoy a nice little nap while you melted away inside its tummy, maybe providing a nice, internal belly rub in your last moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such things weren't meant to happen. Not yet at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you... human?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for the solid fist holding you, you would have fallen off your perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this Celebi just speak to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did you just talk to me?\" you asked back, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi nodded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Of course... but if you're able to understand me, then you're not a human. I've never seen a pokemon like you though...</span>\" it mused in a feminine voice, making you assume the Celebi was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha- of course I'm human!\" you replied, growing more and more confused each minute that passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was just a very lucid dream... or nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked just a surprised as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're human...? But you're so... small! And you understand me!</span>\" she said perplexedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Seriously, I think you are confused. You look like a human, but you can't be one. I mean-</span>\" she trailed off, but used her other paw to indicate your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at the Celebi's na\u00efvet\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a human,\" you repeated, but her expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sign escaped your mouth as you freed your arm from her grip and pointed to your bag on the ground, right next to the empty pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you see those? They're mine. I lost them when it shrunk, get it?\" you said while the giantess looked at your belongings, now too big for you to possibly wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi seemed convinced, because she looked back at you with a more serious gaze,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">How did you get so small? And how are you able to understand pokemon?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, could you ease up your grip? You're kinda crushing me...\" you mumbled. Immediately, the fingers around your torso loosened up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said,<br>\r\n\"But telling the truth, I'm clueless about both things... maybe me being able to understand you is a side effect of my shrinking...\" you theorized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you have no idea of you you got so small, am I right?</span>\" the giantess asked you as she fidgeted around in mid-air, shaking you in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" you said, before an idea found its way inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe you could help me!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed logic, she hadn't hurt or threatened to eat you so far, so you could only assume that this giant fairy didn't hold any malicious intent towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cocked her head, much like she had done before,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Help you...?</span>\" she parroted back, before offering a shrug with the arm that wasn't holding a shrunken human,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I have no clue about how to restore your normal size.</span>\" she said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank. As you began wondering if you were doomed to live your life like this, pitifully small and unable to do pretty much anything, a new idea entered your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the time-traveling giantess that currently held you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe you could k-keep me with you!\" you spoke, not able to stop the flow of words despite the look the legendary was giving you,<br>\r\n\"I need protection or I won't be able to survive!... And i-if not, could you please put me down for I can find help on my own?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler blinked while she let all your words sink in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Nope, I don't think I'll just let you go. When will this opportunity come back?</span>\" she mused with a toothy grin, which made you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat grin alone made you reconsider all you said to this giantess since she first grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big question formed in your mind as you stated at that unnerving little grin of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she going to help you?</span></div></div>",

You're way too... <i>useful</i> for that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like the way she said it, nor the way she was acting in such situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said she was going to help you! She-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a light shining through the darkness, a newfound warmth rapidly spread through your body as something soft began wrapping around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little relief, you noted that Celebi,  keeping her smile, was glowing of a green light; and, as she did, your body felt warmer and warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at your own body, you noted with amazement that a blanket of soft grass was wrapping around your naked body, forming a cocoon around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">D'Aww, you look so cute like that little human!</span>\" the green time-traveler cooed as she stopped glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now let's find someplace warmer, so we can... get to know each other.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you were lowered down and pressed against the fairy's chest; her other paw joined you as she embraced you and fluttered off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move, you could do nothing but lay your head against the soft green wall and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you didn't feel cold anymore. Instead, you were surrounded by a comforting warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whispered a \u2018Thanks\u2019, which the giantess seemed to hear, because she smiled down at you warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Celebi fluttered in front of an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler hovered inside, deep into the shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when she reached the furthest point from the entrance, she sat down and laid against the stone wall, keeping you restrained in her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, I'm sure this'll do. You were really about to die, huh?</span>\" she said bluntly, causing you to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You saved me,\" you stated,<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're welcome little human!</span>\" she exclaimed cheerfully, before adopting a big smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now we can finally talk. If I'm not mistaken, I mentioned that I was going to help you... and I will. In exchange, could <i>you</i> help <i>me</i>?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she said that, her voice assumed a weird tone, and her cheeks grew red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you felt uncomfortable, but you found the courage to ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't initially reply, but you discovered that she was breaking the hug; she held you in her palm while her finger slowly traveled to your grass protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny nail pierced your green shield and began sliding along your body, breaking your the grass that surrounded you, leaving your naked body uncovered once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, cold greedily drove its metaphorical hands on you, gripping you from all sides and causing you to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey...\" you stuttered, but Celebi silenced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hush, my tiny friend, I've got plenty of ways to make you warm,</span>\" she hinted with a mischievous voice, and you finally managed to decipher the tone she had previously assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you only agree to \u2018help\u2019 me like I'm helping you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze traveled down at this, and you nervously noted that she was slowly spreading her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the endless green, a bright pink slit came into view, causing you to blush furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gigantic time-traveler wanted to use you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror, you realized that you were being lowered. This was it, you figured, you were going to be shoved up there to pleasure this perverted Celebi only to survive! That's what she meant with \u2018help\u2019! That's why she was acting like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with fear as the fairy placed you not inside of her like you expected, but on the floor, in front of her towering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So? What do you say, little human, are you going to help me? I did help you, and I still am, no? I think you owe me something...</span>\" she said sultrily, but somehow managing to keep a somewhat arrogant tone, mixed with a mischievous playfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered the choices you were given; this Celebi had helped you escaping death, so you could just \u2018help\u2019 her back and get this over with. In exchange, she was probably going to keep you safe while you were so helplessly tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it all felt so wrong that you seriously considered refusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't seem an available choice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feared that any refusal might not be taken well by the legendary, so you either helped her or ran like hell, hoping you managed to escape her. Though in such scenario your chances of survival out in the cold were practically null.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could you do?</span></div></div>",

A sickly sweet scent that almost made you want to gag as it overpowered you, but you kept your calm as you got closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon you were staring straight into the pink slit...more like a portal to you now, a place with which you could enter if you so wanted.

And with a gulp you reached a cold hand forward, rubbing the outer layer of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall before you quivered at your touch and you heard a slight gasp from above. At this you kept rubbing with your one hand slowly, the wall before you elated at your touch. After a moment of this you reached your other hand forward, and started to rub a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard moans from up above as the wall was moving more, and it was then that you noticed your hands getting sticky with liquid. You knew how this would end, but this was a matter of survival...the help of a legendary in a situation such as this felt critical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath as you reached a hand into the opening, feeling warmth embrace it as you did and Celebi cried out as you did this, sounding like you caught her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ah, ah...k-keep doing t-that...</span>\" She said, stammering and you leaned your shoulder into her cunt, moving your arm all the way in and moving it about. Your world went to pure chaos when you did this, as you were thrashed about. Celebi couldn't control this anymore, she was in pure heaven with what this tiny human was doing. She bucked, losing herself for a moment as you tried to pull your arm out. This only served to send another ripple of pleasure through her though as you felt something coming...you closed your eyes and nose as a warm rush of liquid completely covered you, sending you sprawling back onto the cold cave floor, lying on your back in a coating of Celebi's cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you heard her above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That...was...great...</span>\" She huffed as she looked down at you, almost lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed and shivered as the liquid you were in started to cool. You felt a wave of psychic lift you up and Celebi dried you off with some fine leaves. They weren't terribly absorbent, but you felt better as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help...\" You shivered as she giggled and pulled you to her chest, embracing you with warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I will help you little human...I will...</span>\" </span></div></div>",

But with the help of a legendary pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, unable to shake off the humiliation. But at least, you thought, you weren't cold anymore. The embrace of Celebi felt very warm; that was, of course, the last of your concerns, because you were busy pondering your life in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, why that long face little human?</span>\" the voice of Celebi, whom you miraculously were able to understand, rang,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now that you've helped me, I'm gonna help you!

I mean, I'm sure you'll understand that the chance to keep a human to myself are quite low... if not non-existent.</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was going on, you wondered, this couldn't be happening for real. That's it, this was only a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to wake up in your bed soon and never take strolls in the forest ever again, you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it didn't happen soon like you would have much appreciated, so in order to accelerate the process, you freed one of your arms from Celebi's grip and began pinching yourself repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt pain, and your arm began taking on a slight purple shade, but you didn't care, you wanted to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Celebi giggled, finding your actions of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What are you doing silly?</span>\" she asked childishly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know, this might sound like bad news, but it'll be fine - you'll be fine. I'll take good care of you, promise. You'll be warm, fed, safe and sound under my protection!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this horrible nightmare was nothing but the cold, hard reality, you looked up at the fairy, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm basically a pet to you!\" you exclaimed in alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's what she was planning to do with you, keep you like a pet AND a sex toy, a simple item for her to use whenever she felt \u2018playful\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-eyed pokemon smirked at your declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A pet? You think I'd treat someone who just literally gave himself to me like a pet? I don't think so.</span> \" she bluntly told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that, while she said that, her body began hovering in mid-air; her embrace loosened, and the fairy held you up in front of her face, her smirk wider than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered shouting for help, but your mind quickly told that it wouldn't get you nowhere, but would surely anger the legendary; you were alone in a cave, lost in the middle of the woods and in the dead of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was there but wild pokemon, so no one was coming to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only shot was relying on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for the fairy to do anything, but she didn't seem intentioned to hurt you; on the other hand, she now wore an almost loving gaze on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And how could I?</span>\" she continued saying,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No... more like...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, but her face came dangerously near you. For a moment, you guessed you were going to feed this legendary, but it never happened; instead, she turned her head, beginning to rub you against her left cheek, causing your own cheeks to flare up to indescribably hot levels as the Celebi affectionately nuzzled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll protect you, little human, I promise you'll be fine.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Why are you even doing this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she offered an explanation, she did mention she wanted to keep you because it was an 'opportunity'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed and her expression fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Have you got an idea of how hard is to be a legendary? Do you know what that Implies? I'll tell you - other pokemon avoid you.</span>\" she said, her tone switching to a sour one,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">They're afraid of the power we carry. Even the big mean ones keep their distance. I'm supposed to be a guardian of forests, and what do I get out of it? Nothing. No friends. Not a challenge.

I have needs too!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed too and wondered if her 'needs' were the reason why she asked you to 'help' her. You also felt a tingle of sadness for the frustrated legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too suffer solitude, huh?\" you told sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You have no idea.</span>\" she replied, before lightening up a little,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But, hey, that's when you come in! What do you say? Will you stay?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes at the offer that was presented once again. This would mean throwing your life away to join a lone legend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered your options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying with a friendly legendary or taking your chances outside with hungry giants and a deadly cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the situation was dire you, like any other being, valued life very much. Your choice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you said, not really sure but not really getting a choice,<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled massively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Great!</span>\" she exclaimed, pretty making your ears ring for several seconds,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I promise you - I'm gonna take good care of you! I won't let anything hurt you!</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offered a shaky smile, understanding Celebi's point of view a little; evidently, you were the first one to ever get this close to Celebi, so it was natural she was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess...\" you replied, still not really convinced about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's response was to pull you in a hug to her her green chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry, human, it's gonna be great.</span>\" she reassured in a soothing tone, pausing a moment to rest the bottom of her head on the top of yours in a display of naive affection, before continuing, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now come on...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Given my size, it would be impossible to write so much onto one talisman, so small illustrations best help me understand what it is one wishes for.\"</span></i> That much made sense, but it still didn't exactly answer why she worded herself the way she did earlier, and it showed on your face so Jirachi took more time explaining the mechanics of her wish-granting to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cyellow\">\"Because I am expending much of my energy to help you, I am left quite defenseless after doing so for the time being, and I cannot grant another wish until my cosmic power has been restored. To ensure my safety, I steal away to a quiet retreat, preferably with another pokemon who will protect and nurture me until I am fit to be out and about again. One way I can ensure that I will be tended to is to\u2026give my protectors something to do for me in the meantime\u2014or rather some</span></i>one<i> to do as you humans may say.\"</i> You almost didn't catch the meaning of what Jirachi meant, but when she sat you down to take a cross-legged posture before you, arms at her side and with a purposefully coquettish stare, it was almost impossible for you to not pick up on what she wanted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cyellow\">\"I have been quite lonely without a suitable mate for some time, and you humans have fascinated me so when it comes to carnal matters. If I grant you your wish, o' human, will you grant me mine?\"</span> With that, Jirachi opened her legs and revealed her vagina to you once again, this time in a deliberate showing of her own rather than you happening to catch a glance of it. This almost came as a surprise to you that pokemon\u2014a legendary one in this case\u2014were even capable of soliciting others for sex in exchange for favors; you didn't want to think of it as prostitution, but given Jirachi's comments it wasn't helping with the mental image. While it was a tempting offer, there was no way of knowing whether or not this \"wish-granting\" pokemon was really telling the truth or simply making things up to use you for her own ends. Still, a slim chance was better than no chance, and a part of you was desperate enough to take it. Plus, the way she invitingly laid against the wall\u2014legs spread apart for you to see her increasingly puffy and moist privates\u2014was unbelievably arousing. The pokemon sure knew how to sweeten the deal, and after much deliberation you came to your decision\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

And, on top of its head, two big, <i>V</i> shaped ears pointed upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Victini, the pokemon who supposedly brought eternal victory to the trainer who was lucky enough to capture it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while you were no trainer, you were lucky enough to meet Victini, whose existence was believed to be a mere myth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo lost in admiring the sight of the adorable legendary that currently laid belly-down in front of you, you failed to notice its paw snaking up towards you; before you had time to realize it, the \u2018little guy\u2019 had you solidly held in its grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the ground came missing under your soles you snapped out of your trance, noticing the Victini moving to stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the fist that held you was brought up to the face of your new captor as it stared at you from up close, probably trying to decide what were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere being in the grasp of the fire-type made you feel a lot less cold, but not for this less amazed by the sudden apparition of Victini. As it stood up fully, you had the opportunity to check the front side of the giant; despite its sudden contact with the ground, not a speck of dirt was clinging to its extremely clean fur. The chest-fluff was ruffled, its legs short and stubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really drew your attention was the thin, pink slit that rested in between the Victini's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously as the realization that this giant was a giantess hit you, but you had no time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, are you a human?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you looked up as the voice rang in your head for a second more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no one, aside from the giantess holding you, who was staring at you with a perplexed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">How did you get so small little guy?</span>\" the voice said again, and you saw the Victini's lips moving as she spoke, seeming completely uninterested in the attention you had been giving to her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... You talk!\" you blurted out in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck was going on? How were you able to understand-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And you're so incredibly small! Like, the tiniest being on this planet! I thought humans were a lot bigger than that, but you look so cute!</span>\" the Victini chimed with excitement, her initial confusion completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">How did you get so small little human?</span>\" she repeated you while her feet left the ground, her bottom lifting as well thanks to her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know...\" you meekly replied, still stunned by the revelation that this legendary was able to speak human language.<br>\r\n\"I was just wandering around and I fell asleep all of a sudden, and when I woke up I was like this and-\" realization suddenly hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini was a legendary. Legendaries were the most powerful beings on the planet. If you managed to get on her good side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

I woke up like this and I won't be able to survive if someone doesn't help me.

Hmm...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like the way that \u2018Hmm\u2019 sounded, nor the smirk that appeared on her face as she produced it before she quieted down, placing a paw over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time where nothing was said or done drew on, reality came back to you: you were in the paws of a legendary who could do anything to you without you being able to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could eat you, stomp you, shove you up her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began reconsidering though, Victini looked back at you, her grin wider than ever.</span></div></div>",

You could feel your heart fluttering with relief... just before it sank like a rock on the bottom of the sea upon hearing her next sentence,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Byyyy keeping you with me! Isn't that awesome!?</span>\" she continued, eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression you had on your face told everything, 'What?', though Victini didn't seem to pick up on the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Um, dude?

You're the one who asked for help.</span>\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant - help by growing me, if possible, please.\" you clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">How are you supposed to grow things?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" you yelled out of exasperation, before remembering your position, <br>\r\n\"...

You figure it out.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to. She had already spoken what she intended to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, why don't you just put me back down and I'll be on my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Aw, c'mooon, don't be silly! I don't wanna think how you'd end up if I left you on your own! Think about, what if some big mean Pokemon was to find you and you were all alone?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already pondered that possibility. You didn't like it, but being kept by a Pokemon didn't didn't sound very appealing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing any reply, Victini smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">See? You see things my way.</span>\" she pointed out, as if reading you like an open book,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Don't you get it? This is a win-win for the both of us!</span>\" she exclaimed, rising two fingers to do a silly victory pose. How ironic of her to say such thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini glanced back for a moment, then took flight and hovered a few feet above the ground, closing her hand around you to prevent you from falling to your untimely death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Think 'bout it, you'll be safe and I'll make sure you've got everything you need,</span>\" the twin-tailed giantess explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were basically going to become a pet, you mused, though, as humiliating as it could be, you guessed you could live with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was still one thing that troubled you, and it was her side of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" you asked warily,<br>\r\n\"What do you get out of helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini's eyes sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Ain't that clear? I get super cool, tiny-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pet'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... Pal! Oh, this is gonna be sooo cool!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? 'Pal'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... 'Pal'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">That's right! You're gonna be my little friend!</span>\" she repeated, her smile fading as she looked down,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You never get to do anything fun around here. But now you're here! We get to mess together!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile came back to the face of the long-eared Pokemon giantess as she continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What do ya say?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs intimidating as she was right now, this creamy legendary seemed more playful than harmful, which you were really glad for, though you had your doubts what she meant by 'messing', in which she wanted you to have a role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if there was no other solution to your issue, then you should have jumped at the opportunity. Which you did. Getting out of the grasp of potentially deadly Pokemon would be a great improvement already, plus Victini assured she'd take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, what did you have left to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you spoke after a long hesitation,<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini's smile widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew was that you impacted with a soft, warm wall of creamy fur and the legendary flailing in mid-air out of happiness, gushing about how great this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really cheer up, but guessed that this could've gone much worse. Like her eating you, for example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of just floating around and smothering you in a hug, Victini finally pulled off and did her victory pose a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Okay dude, now that's settled,</span>\" she said, doing a childish twirl around,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Let's have some fu- oh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupted when she saw you just staring at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What's the matter?</span>\" she asked, adopting an expression of polite perplexity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I appreciate you taking care of me and everything, but I just... I need a minute.\" you admitted, trying to internalize with everything that had been going on lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust look where a stroll in the woods had brought you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini opened her mouth to speak, but then shut it back up and nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It's okay.</span>\" she said, before getting an idea,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, maybe you can pick what to do next. Wouldn't that be nice?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled weakly in appreciation. At least, she was trying to be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You're welcome!</span>\" she replied cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So tell me, what is it that you want to do?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment.</span></div></div>",

It had two slender arms and paws, one of which was holding you; it had two cute, stubby legs and two tails lazily swinging behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really drew your attention weren't the jewels on the creature's tails, it was the odd detail that this giant had a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the air leaving your lungs as well as a deep blush spreading across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Mesprit was a female!? How could it be, you always knew that legendaries were supposed to be genderless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the sudden revelation, you failed to noticed the titaness holding you raising her head, having finished her examination with the wise conclusion that she wasn't holding some new, undiscovered bug-type pokemon, but a real, shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hello there.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you rose your head from the Mesprit's womanhood as a voice pierced the silence like light through darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you looked up at the legendary, feeling extremely embarrassed by your prolonged examination of her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon didn't seem to have noticed it though, and if she did, she didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Excuse me, you are a human, am I right?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt amazed once more as you discovered that the voice belonged to the same pokemon that was currently holding you! But... it couldn't be... this Mesprit must have been a trained pokemon and her trainer was somewhere around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, but there was no one aside from you and the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she did talk to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes?\" you offered as you looked back at the giant Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"I mean, yes, I am a human... despite this size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legend looked bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">May I ask you for what purpose you shrunk yourself to such tiny size, human?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't! I was just walking around and I suddenly passed out!\" you hastily explained, still quite unable to believe what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nodded as she shifted her position, floating on her back in mid-air, like she was laying down on a bed made of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Go on,</span>\" she encouraged. Her voice sounded gentle and curious, there was no hint of malice in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, assuming that you could trust this giantess at least for now, you continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's really nothing to say. When I woke up I was like this! And you found me and... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization began crawling inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alone and helpless in the middle of the woods, where countless pokemon waited for nothing more than to make a delicious little snack out of you before eating an actual meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't hope to get out of this forest alive... unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And I need help,\" you finished with the most pitiful face you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense, you figured. If you were able to convince a legendary, one of the most powerful beings in the world, to protect you, you'd be safe until you found a way to grow back to your original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mesprit adopted a small smile at your mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Help?</span>\" she parroted back with a hint of hilarity in her voice,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You must be referring to me, little guy,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip, trying to not appear disrespectful towards the Being of Emotion, and nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... you're talking to me... you let me explain myself while other pokemon would have simply eaten me with no remorse or pity...\" you explained, trying to get on Mesprit's good side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary allowed herself to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I wouldn't blame them, you do look pretty tasty, human,</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from your face as you saw the pink-headed legendary leaning forward; a huge, slick tongue darted out of her mouth as she gave your body a long, wet lick, coating you in a thin layer of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And you are!</span>\" Mesprit chirped merrily while you felt the sticky saliva rolling down your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld by the legendary, you were unable to clean yourself, but at least the saliva was somewhat warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...\" you begged while Mesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well... I'd say you'd be way more useful to me if you were alive...</span>\" she mused, looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toothy grin spread across her pink face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Tell me, human, what will you give me if I help you like you ask?</span>\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...?\" you stuttered breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what did this legendary want from you? Maybe you should have never even talked to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's right, we can make a deal. What will you give me if I offer my protection from... well, everything?</span>\" Mesprit repeated herself with a grin,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Or, if you wish, let's say \u2018What will you do for me\u2019?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat other choice did you have but submit to the legendary if you wanted to survive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth was faster than your brain,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit closed one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Anything you say?</span>\" she asked with excitement,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I think we have a deal then, human: I'll help you out while you do something for me...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieved at the pokemon's statement. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want me to do...?\" you stuttered, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excited guardian smirked again as she spoke,</span></div></div>",

Why would I now? If I let you go, you'll simply get eaten or stepped on, and will I be damned if someone other than me made a snack out of you!</span>\" she exclaimed, causing you to pale once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn't do as she said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in fear, which Mesprit felt: her grin shrank a little bit, becoming an almost reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No need to be afraid, little human. You just have one thing to do, and you'll find I can be quite generous when I'm satisfied. Of course,</span>\" she said, her tongue poking out of her mouth and slowly sliding across her lips,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll be quite displeased if you turn down my offer.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat was clear, and so was the choice you were given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither you pleasured this legendary or you got eaten for refusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you blurted out after taking a deep breath,<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll do it.

I would never take advantage of you being so small to get what I want without giving you something in return; I am a pokemon of my word through and through.\"</span> Of course Mesprit was; you really were worrying for nothing, and with that you gave the pokemon a relieved smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpink\">\"Bear in mind, this may not be an easy task. If you do not know what it was that had reduced your size to what it is now, that limits our ability to undo this predicament.\"</span> It was almost amazing how Mesprit went from her haze of ecstatic afterglow to laser focused on the task in a heartbeat. <span class=\"cpink\">\"There are three options I can see right now that could easily fix this mess: the first is that I myself will study your body and use what powers I can to grow you back into a safe size at least until growing you back to your original mass is possible, the second is that I scan your form to look for any remaining traces of the energy that had shrank you down and track down the perpetrator to see if they can undo it, and third is that I can instead bring you to a human who is trustworthy enough and knowledgeable enough to grow you back to normal. Mind you, we do not need only settle for one solution\u2014we should try all three in any order you wish to try first, and fall back on the other two methods if one does not work. If nothing works, well, I will have to request Uxie's and Azelf's aid as well.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was nice to see that Mesprit already had some of her options narrowed down and was willing to get some outside help if need be, so now you only need worry about which method you wanted to employ first.

Still, it helped if you figured out what it was you wanted to do the next day so you both would have adequate time to prepare.

Not with the cold outside.</span>\" Mesprit continued, before yawning,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Not to mention I'd like some rest right now... and I'm sure you need it too,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression dropped once more, but you couldn't help but think that the giant pixie was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold almost got you killed earlier, and right now you had no intention of getting out of this cave; not that it was what you'd call a warm place, but it was surely warmer than the outside was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll take you to her in the morning,</span>\" Mesprit replied, offering a sympathetic smile, only to then yawn again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But as for now... sleep well, human...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown went your world as the pixie laid down onto the stone floor of the cavern with you still on her paw; your perch tilted, causing you to slide off her hand and fall down, landing on a bouncy landscape of blue that was the chest of the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey-\" you tried to protest out of embarrassment, but the same hand that held you shortly ago came down on you, pinning you down to Mesprit's chest; her other hand joined in the embrace too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" you cut yourself off with a deep yawn; your perch was soft and warm, the grasp around you gentle and the sounds coming from within Mesprit soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyelids growing heavy, you looked up at the giantess, discovering her smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last things you saw before your eyes closed good were the legendary's own, yellow eyes, briefly shining through your hazy mind before everything faded away along with your consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and the light of the dawn slowly enlightened the skies, letting the moon take its leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small gust of wind penetrated the cave you and your legendary protector resided in, causing you to shiver in your sleep while also causing the pixie holding you to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, two golden eyes opened as Mesprit yawned drowsily, before casually glancing down... discovering that she was holding onto what appeared to be a very very tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked bewildered at first, but almost immediately remembered of you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Wake up, human. We have a long trip ahead of us...</span>\" she spoke lowly while she delicately shook you, like she was dealing with a really fragile porcelain doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of Mesprit and the gentle rocking had the effect of interrupting your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened as you glanced around, trying to spot the cause of the foreign voice, which you soon discovered to belong to a certain giant pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, you looked confused, but your mind slowly began flashing images of the events that occurred last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you said, blushing vaguely at the memory of you pleasuring the giant Mesprit,<br>\r\n\"Hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hope you don't mind traveling, because we have quite the flight to make to find Uxie.</span>\" the giantess replied cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere idea sent a shiver running down your spine; if, for any reason, you fell off, you'd be doomed... or not? Certain insects like ants survived falls from great heights, maybe you could too...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter, you told yourself, if you could get your size back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go.\" you said, feeling wide awake all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Up and running already, huh? I like it...</span>\" Mesprit chimed with a grin while the paw holding you rose up in the air; carefully, the pixie placed you on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Make sure you hang on tight.</span>\" Mesprit instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw nothing you could hold onto, so you hastily laid belly-down and hugged the smooth \u2018ground\u2019 while Mesprit rose farther up in the air and began her flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after endless hours of boring flight, Mesprit seemed to slow down; when she took off, it was dawn. Now, it was full morning and the warm sunlight showered your naked body upon the giantess's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite to what you were feeling last night in the grip of cold, this sensation was actually nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" you asked for what had to be the twelfth time, lightly tapping at Mesprit's skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Aaand...</span>\" the legendary giggled,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted your giant host swiftly hovering down, towards... a lake? It made sense, you thought, after all she was called one of the <i>Lake Guardians</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered why she was in a forest in the first place; whatever reason had brought her there, you mused, had saved you... even if it meant doing awkward things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mesprit halted above the water of the lake and shot a smile at her own reflection; you could see yours too, a tiny insect clinging to the guardian's head, a little ant climbing the great giantess while she merrily let you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook such line of thinking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Where's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Give it time.</span>\" Mesprit interrupted while bringing a paw to her head, snatching you up to bring you down at chest level,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And hope that Uxie can actually fix you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a knot tying around your heart, you didn't think of what'd happen if this \u2018Uxie\u2019 couldn't help you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And... what if she can't...?\" you timidly stammered, causing Mesprit to smile brightly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm still here, no? I'll take care of your cute little behind.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed red, but Mesprit ignored the sudden embarrassment that stroke her to focus on something behind you; hearing some water splashing, you too turned around, taking notice of something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sphere of water was splitting from the lake itself and was now hovering in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it bursted, droplets of water were sent flying everywhere, leading you to cover your eyes for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit?</span>\" a feminine voice spoke,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What are you doing here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and looked forward, noticing a creature nearly identical to Mesprit, but with a yellow, round head. Also, her eyes were shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the creature had noticed you as well, because she was staring right back at you in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-Wha...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And that's why I'm here, sis.</span>\" Mesprit explained,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">This poor lost human has... randomly... shrunken down, and he needs help.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's head rose as she seemingly stared at Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And where did you even pick up a tiny human?</span>\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The woods around my lake.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo <i>that's</i> where that unknown part of the woods led, you mused, and it also explained why Mesprit was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... there was some sort of curse around the lake that shrunk down any intruder? You discarded the idea, Mesprit would have known then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted as you felt yourself moving; you looked up, only to notice Mesprit's paws placing you into Uxie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">So you're saying you have no clue about how to help him and want <i>me</i> to do it?</span>\" the yellow-headed pixie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yup.</span>\" Mesprit confirmed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You definitely know how to fix him, don't you sis?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why would you want to help a human in the first place?</span>\" Uxie retorted, causing a blush to spread across Mesprit's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... I have my reasons.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighed and lowered her head, examining you. It was utterly weird, her eyes were closed but it felt like her gaze was piercing those shut eyelids of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hmm...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Your gaze simply couldn't help but travel downwards as you looked at the pokemon, taking in every detail to make sure this wasn't some kind of trick being pulled by your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be, the grip of Uxie was quite real, as it was the hand holding you, as it was its body, tails, womanhood and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Womanhood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze lingered in between the legendary's legs, where a thin, pink, slightly damp slit rested. You were dumbstruck, weren't all legendaries genderless? Of course, there were a few exceptions such as Latios, Latias or Cresselia, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess holding you cleared her throat, causing your gaze to travel back at her on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer closed eyes seemed to be staring right down you as she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, isn't this utterly singular. A human whose size is incredibly reduced,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Your kind is bigger than this, aren't they? So I must assume that you shrunk down to this size.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice sounded monotone, but you nodded anyway despite the fact you were having a hard time following the pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA timid sentence escaped your lips,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't hurt me...\" you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie cocked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now now, no reason to be afraid. I would gain nothing by causing you any harm, human,</span>\" she spoke soothingly as a gentle smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I just want to ask you a few questions, if that's alright.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like you had any other choice, so you timidly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay... I'll-\" you abruptly interrupted yourself, a thick cloud of vapor escaping your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole conversation, the cold never ceased to penetrate your body, like countless invisible pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in fear, you had forgotten about it, and apparently Uxie didn't even notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until now, when you were about to freeze to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaw of the guardian hung open as you began whispering for her help, your vocal chords having shut down all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess stared at you, seeming to be pondering her choices while trying to process the fact that you were dying in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, keep calm, I know what to do.</span>\" she spoke, but you weren't really listening anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So cold...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision grew blurry, your body felt weightless (as it probably was anyway). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this it? Were you dying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of heat spread through your body as you opened your eyes, noticing Uxie pressing you against herself with both paws, her bodily heat transferring to you as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it simply wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes closed back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything became dark as your consciousness faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie took notice of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Damn...</span>\" she mumbled as she released you, bringing her gigantic head to your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sliver of relief entered her: your heart was still working. There was still hope to save this human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Uxie lifted her head from you; without even thinking, she shoved your whole entirety inside of her mouth, past her teeth and onto her tongue, her lips falling back in place immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Should be enough to keep him alive...</span></i>\u2019 she thought, careful to not open her mouth for any reason. Any breath of the cold air could be lethal to you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the major problem solved, Uxie looked around, noticing your abandoned clothes and bag, now impossibly big for you and still quite large to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Psychic, the pixie quickly gathered all of your belongings and wandered off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt weightless, but no longer cold like you had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this how death was like? Because it wasn't as bad as they said, aside from your back being placed on a hard surface, though something soft and warm was upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you began opening your eyes, mentally bracing yourself for what they were going to met with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was blurry and... yellow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh...?\" you whispered as your vision began clearing a bit, revealing the face of the Uxie you met before. So... that wasn't some sick fever dream, you really risked dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you were dead for real and this in front of you was the spirit of the legendary, you had heard her spirit could split from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you awake caused Uxie to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I... alive?\" you dumbly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You wasted a question, human,</span>\" the pixie replied, though her smile remained,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... But you were extremely close to your grave. I-</span>\" Uxie trailed off and blushed, recalling how she placed a naked human inside her mouth without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Brought you here.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since your awakening, you took a moment to look around: you were in a cave, roughly wrapped up in some sort of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized it as the sleeve of the shirt you were wearing before your mysterious shrinking happened. Looking elsewhere, you spotted your bag laying in a corner. Sunlight crept inside the cavern, and you discovered that you were laying on a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze went back to Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... saved me.\" you muttered, your cheeks flaring up.<br>\r\n\"... Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Easy there, you need to rest. And eat something, too, so I don't think you'll mind if I took something from your bag for you to consume.</span>\" she said while a bar of chocolate you had brought levitated closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few squares missed from it, suggesting that Uxie had her taste of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, you removed the sleeve of your shirt from your naked body and inched closer to the food, giving it a few bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, may I ask you something? How did you get in such precarious size? I mean, there are pokemon that live perfectly with it, but you humans seem to lack the capability to survive with such height.</span>\" she declared smugly, though keeping a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how she was the reason of you being still alive right now, you weren't able to feel mad for her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know...\" you replied as you brought a hand to your forehead, feeling it damp under your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wandering around, y'know, a break from the city and stress, but I... randomly fell asleep. When I woke up I was like this, and you were there and-\" you stopped in mid-sentence, lacking courage to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Seems a complicated situation.</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me?\" you suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie cocked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If you are referring to your utterly mysterious shrinkage, I don't know about it. My apologies.</span>\" she bluntly stated, and you felt your heart sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... didn't you make knowledge?\" you inquired, causing the pixie to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Of course. That means I'm smarter than most creatures and - forgive me - you. But I lack enough information to tell how you ended up in such predicament.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you were having a hard time following her, but at least you got the gist of her speech: she didn't know how to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... can you... keep me with you at least?\" you asked again, causing the legendary to adopt a thoughtful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hovered backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Keep you with me?</span>\" she parroted back,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll have you know, human, this cave is not where I reside. I'd have to bring you along if I did.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To a lake, right?\" you asked, and she smiled at you. It made sense.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, I need someone to watch over me. It's like you said...\" you adopted the most pitiful expression you could muster,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't survive like this.\"</span></div></div>",

Could she really take this random human under her care as much as intriguing his situation was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice any of those bi-colored spheres his kind threw at hers to capture pokemon when she searched for food in his bag, but for what she knew, he could easily be a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he did mention that he was here because of just \u2018a break from city and stress\u2019, didn't pokemon trainers usually travel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this little guy wasn't a trainer, did she have the heart to leave him by himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Human,</span>\" the pixie spoke after a while of being deep in thought, startling you; her voice seemed to echo around in the whole cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I have taken a decision, but I'd like to know something before telling you.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah?\" you replied, perplexed. What did this pixie want now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie hovered close to the rock that had been your bed for the night; once again, you got that weird feeling of being observed despite her eyelids being sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Your kind captures and makes pokemon battle,</span>\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're getting the wrong idea!\" you spoke up, maybe a bit too loudly,<br>\r\n\"Alright, my kind captures pokemon, but a lot of times they bond and-\" Uxie interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're the one getting the wrong idea. I don't hold any grudges against humans, proof of it is that I saved you. I know most of you aren't bad, but it's also true that some people are really foolish. But- that's not the point,</span>\" Uxie abruptly interrupted herself,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We are talking about you. I want to know if <i>you're</i> a trainer or not.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent for a couple moments; a small breeze blew inside the cave, causing you to shiver slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No?\" you hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie cocked her head in a very familiar manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Is that a lie?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not a trainer. I don't \u2018make pokemon battle\u2019 or stuff like that. How can that influence your decision?\" you asked while standing up, only to immediately sit back down: your legs felt like ice sculptures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since this conversation started, Uxie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I have to be sure. I'm a guardian, I can't risk being captured by your kind. Who would protect my lake if I were to leave it to follow a human? What kind of guardian would I be then?</span>\" she replied with a hint of proudness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, suddenly having taken a lot more interest in your really cold legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's smile grew wider as she moved forward, her paw descending towards you as her fingers sank into your sides before the whole hand lifted you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But if you're really not a trainer, human, then I'll be more than willing to help you out.</span>\" she continued, causing you to become quite flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to believe me, I have never captured a pokemon before! Sure, I saw quite a lot of them, but I never felt the need to catch them!\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie giggled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now now little human, there's no need to be so agitated. I believe you,</span>\" she said, her words seeming to cause your whole body, soul and mind to let out one massive sigh of relief, which escaped through your open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie watched you, her smile still wide on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean... does that mean you'll help me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why, certainly. I said it, you said it, you can't survive in such rough situation. And I won't allow that,</span>\" Uxie blushed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The duty of a guardian isn't just protecting the lake, in my case, but also living beings from danger. And you, my unfortunate friend, are in great danger, like you had been just last night. I'll keep you safe and fed until we - I - manage to figure out a way to reverse your shrinking.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the giantess while your cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you replied in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the pixie brought her other paw up to you and grasped you more firmly, before moving you towards her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself being embraced by the giantess. You felt like you were going on fire, but the hug felt really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for the time being, you were safe from most dangers since you were under the protection of a legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose pokemon were supposed to hold powers with no bounds despite the sizes. Even the most small legendaries could erase mountains with just a mere glance if they only wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Uxie broke the hug and gently lowered you back to your previous perch on the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar of chocolate you barely left a mark on earlier levitated back up to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Here, eat some more, you need all the strength possible right now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the chocolate a few other bites, your teeth barely leaving any visible trace on a single square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only gave you an idea of how pathetically small you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Uxie,\" you called as you pulled back from your \u2018meal\u2019,<br>\r\n\"You mentioned you've got a lake to protect, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Correct.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've got to return to it... am I coming along?\" you asked, causing the giantess to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Silly human, what did I just say? Yes.</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When... when are we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one question took the pixie aback; but she quickly pulled herself together and replied,</span></div></div>",

There, you shall be under my care until we manage to figure out your situation.</span>\" she explained, extending a paw forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, a single, tiny finger came down to your head and began running your hair gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thanks I guess...\" you replied, smiling at the giant guardian,<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie blushed, but offered a timid smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There is no need, really.</span>\" she replied kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell in between you and the giant pokemon after her latest statement, and it lasted for a few minutes, before Uxie broke it, a pensive look on her face; a thought came to her mind, a thought about how she could take your offer. When would she get the chance to meet another human this small again? It certainly brought some... advantages, and this seemed a nice guy, too,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Actually, I'd like to take your offer, if it's not a problem,</span>\" she suddenly said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...

And you're saying you'll take care of me. That's very kind, and it's only fair I do something in return.

And if you're really sure...</span>\" she muttered under her breath, though you were able to understand thanks your more sensible hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's shown to be very kind so far, she couldn't make any weird requests, no? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But then, why couldn't you shake off the feeling that something was off about her...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your affirmative response, Uxie's blush deepened, and her mouth let a long sigh of embarrassment escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Very well, human, you may consider this as a way to pay me back for my aid. A condition, if you prefer,</span>\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile waned. The statement left you very perplexed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A... a condition?\" you stuttered,<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say you were going to take care of me anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flustered giantess looked away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You were the one making such offer,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And I'm sure you can understand if I... ask something in return, like you said.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded of your own words, and offered a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" you agreed,<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie inhaled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe what she was going to ask, but this human seemed willing to do as she pleased, eager even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small percentage he wasn't going to decline her request, but the majority of chances was that he tried to get away as soon as he saw the opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Uxie gathered enough courage to 'look' back at you and make her request,</span></div></div>",

You wondered what pokemon this could be, when a pesky cloud suddenly eclipsed moonlight, obscuring your sight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to see what pokemon you were about to deal with, you took a few steps back, realizing that you had been stupidly staring at just a single eye of the legendary. You could tell this one was indeed one of the mythical pokemon whose existence itself was a doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had never seen a pokemon so human-looking aside from Jynx, but this couldn't be one of those. You observed the pokemon's head, which was perfectly round. You thought you were in presence of Celebi or perhaps Manaphy, before your mind told you that the heads of those legendaries weren't so perfectly round-shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to figure out what pokemon this could be, but you found that there was no need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoying, cold wind that pierced your uncovered body blew away the as well annoying cloud, allowing moonlight to enlighten the night again while also letting you finally observe the details of the legendary's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon had a milk-white visage, those gigantic blue eyes you were staring at before were still focused completely on you; a thin, horizontal slit was the legendary's mouth, and a jewel the same color of its eyes rested right in between the giant oculars. In the end, the pokemon had a veritable waterfall of green hair, while its face was covered by its black body, which resembled a... dress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a knot in your stomach as well a lump in your throat that kept you from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Meloetta, a singing legendary whose melodies alone were legends themselves. Only few have been blessed enough to be able to hear Meloetta singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped in excitement, you were going to be one of those people! You could proudly say that you witnessed Meloetta singing from up close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained still, waiting for the legendary to make the first move lest you doing anything that might have offended the adorable legendary might have ended with you erased from existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the Meloetta blinked, bemused, before she began standing back up from her laying position, letting you witness the full sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo slim, with legs came out from an extension of her \u2018dress\u2019 that looked like a skirt, a green \u2018belt\u2019 tied around the legend's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Hello, little human,</span>\" a soothing, melodious voice rang around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes still glued to Meloetta, you saw her lips moving as the voice was heard, so it could be only her speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt elated, not only you were staring at a legendary, and a giant one too, but she also had the ability to speak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kept getting better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even think of replying, completely under the spell of the gracious pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Please do not be afraid by me, I have no intention of eating you or something along those lines. I was merely...</span>\" she interrupted herself, and you felt an invisible grip tugging on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you began hovering in mid-air, most likely held by the Meloetta's Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew up to the legendary, who held out a paw, which was black and completely round, lacking any fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic grip dispersed, letting you fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed straight on top of the Meloetta's paw, which she rose up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">... Wondering how a human can be so small. Your kind is usually bigger than this, am I right?</span>\" she continued, cracking a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned by what was going on, you couldn't respond, so you simply nodded your head several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">So, you must have shrunken down to that size. May I ask you why?</span>\" the Meloetta kept speaking in that wonderful, heavenly melodious voice of hers, each word like spoken from an angel,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I mean, this forest forest is a dangerous place for little things such as yourself.</span>\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vocal chords seemed to be able to work again all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't shrink myself...\" you replied in a whisper,<br>\r\n\"I don't know how it happened...\" you continued in a soft voice, like you were living a dream you didn't want to wake up from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as suddenly as it began, the spell was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike popping a bubble, the cold roughly snapped you back to reality, the hard reality that you were shrunken and in the middle of the woods with a giant and potentially dangerous legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your whole dream-like state, you forgot that you were naked, which wasn't bad only because you were in presence of such legendary, but because the cold-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Human?</span>\" the Meloetta's voice spoke up again, carrying a hint of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you didn't pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to stop the cold from penetrating your skin, you folded your arms and began rubbing, trying to find the least amount of hear that would have saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt each molecule of your body becoming cold. You felt like your brain and heart, along with the rest of your internal organs, were shutting down by the sheer force of the cold, which gripped you like a hungry, feral animal, wanting to claim you as a victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to enter pass out, you knew. If you did, you would've most likely entered hypothermia, only to slowly freeze to death if you didn't manage to get your body to warm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you had forgotten that Meloetta was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your perch on her fingerless hand shifted, and you found yourself moving forward. You were pressed right into her chest area, while her other, free paw joined the first one as the mythical pokemon embraced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeble warmth spread throughout your body like a shield, a fragile protection against the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, you glanced at the Meloetta pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-He-Help...\" you stuttered through chattering teeth.<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" cold penetrated your mouth as well, shutting down your vocal chords, much like they had done while you were under the Meloetta's spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid legendary let your request, so feebly spoken, sink in the depths of her mind before replying,</span></div></div>",

You don't need to fear.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile speaking, the green-headed tightened the grip she had on you; without warning, she began rubbing you in between her fingerless, black paws and her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began speeding up a bit, and a feeble heat started spreading through your body. It was better than freezing to death, but it was nowhere near enough. You expressed this by letting out a gasp, a cloud exiting your mouth and ending up dispersing in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta took notice of it and tilted her head - it wasn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to come up with something better real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Hang on in there, dear,</span>\" she said you, concerned; you didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta began looking around, wondering what she could do to help since her actions weren't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept calm, but that calm was rapidly waning: Meloetta never had to deal with dying shrunken humans before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of options, the green-headed legendary scanned the forest, searching for anything that might be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when she struck gold: lying on the forest floor, abandoned in a patch of grass, was the human's shirt, which didn't shrink along with him; a little farther was his pair of pants, which suffered a fate similar to the shirt's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile lit the giantess' white visage as she hastily picked up the shirt with her psychic powers and hovered it towards her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, giving you a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Don't need to fear, human,</span>\" she repeated once more,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">You will be fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, dark became your vision as your shirt was dropped over you. Meloetta hastily wrapped it around you until she formed a ball of fabric that shielded you from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth began spreading through your body at a faster rate, albeit your teeth didn't stop chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, with remaining consciousness you had, you felt grateful towards the kind giantess that was helping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the legendary herself, she moved quick: she gathered all your belongings with Psychic and, as they hovered in the air, she flew further into the woods with the improvised blanket and the precious life that currently resided in it in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast as she could be, Meloetta soared through the woods with a camping bag and a pair of pants in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few pokemon who were still awake fled at the sight of the legendary while she flew past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the legendary reached her destination: a particularly big tree which, she knew, could offer a refuge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped near the trunk and began fluttering upward, reaching one of the tallest branches. In the trunk, there was a big hole, not fit for big pokemon but surely enough to take a small pokemon such as Meloetta and her shrunken 'guest'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta didn't waste anymore time and entered the precarious shelter and gathered a few leaves on the floor with Psychic, forming a small bed on the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly the place she'd call home, but extreme situations require extreme measures. She would search for a better place for the human to recover in the morning, she decided, when the risk of losing his life because of the cold was minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, letting out a small sigh, the green-headed pokemon unwrapped the shirt from around you a bit to check on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw made her panic - your eyes were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her heart jumping in her throat, Meloetta hastily moved you closer to check if yours was still beating, but there was no need to: when she moved you closer, she noted that you were still breathing, slowly but rhythmically, meaning that you merely lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary let out a deep sigh. For now, you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours faded away as the night drew on, eventually coming to an end as morning came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon took its leave in the sky to make room for its brighter, warmer counterpart as the sun rose into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight began to shine throughout the forest, blinking into a certain hole and getting straight into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned in your sleep, before ultimately waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and took a look around, still shaken by a very vivid dream you've had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant pokemon, a near death and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not in your bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" you mumbled, pushing whatever was covering you aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Oh, are you awake? Good.</span>\" a voice spoke from behind you, leading you to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting in the corner of a place you didn't recognize, was a certain green-headed you could recognize: she was the same one that appeared in your dreams, which apparently weren't dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meloetta!\" you chimed, before the weight of reality began falling on you and it dawned on you that you were really about to lose your life just last night.<br>\r\n\"... I really was about to pass away back then, huh?\" you told, your whole soul letting out a sigh of relief and gratitude towards the legendary who heroically rescued you from death itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta bit her lip and slowly nodded her round head while her blue eyes sparkled with a sad glint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">You are safe now. That's all that matters.</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks to you.\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"If you weren't there, this conversation wouldn't be happening right now. So, from the bottom of my heart... thank you...\" you murmured,<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I'll ever repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Don't even mention that.</span>\" she said, her cheeks displaying a faint red shade,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">How are you feeling?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than last night, that's for sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Glad to hear that.</span>\" she said, before adopting a more serious expression,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Now, I'm sure you might want to eat, but we should look for someplace better for you too...</span>\" she told as she began pondering which was the most important priority.</span></div></div>",

Not like it was enough to miraculously put you out of danger, but it was still enough to allow you to prolong your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Just hold on human, I'll take you somewhere warmer,</span>\" Meloetta spoke reassuringly, causing you to once again fall under her spell, though only for a few seconds before the cold snapped you back to reality once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed a surreal nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like Meloetta wasn't even there, it was like you were alone, mysteriously hovering through the endless forest, showered by a cold wind while moonlight enlightened the whole, dark forest, causing the trees to adopt all sorts of weird, scary shapes as Meloetta passed them in search of a shelter from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if all of this wasn't enough, the giantess kept staring at you with a weird look on her face every once in awhile; but you didn't feel uncomfortable, you didn't have any strength left to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your thoughts were about the sad reality that you were about to die, and all your strength was used for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Meloetta finally got to the first shelter she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Do not worry any further, human, we've arrived at a safe place,</span>\" she reassured, causing you to glance past her large arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be nothing more than a simple, thin crack in a stone wall, but it looked like large enough for Meloetta, and surely enough for you, to fit completely inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Meloetta entered the small opening which, she discovered, led to a little cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting time, the small legendary hovered to the deepest part of the small cavern, to the further spot from the freezing wind that threatened to kill you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Meloetta turned her attention to you and began rubbing her rubbing her small paws, with you on between, together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep sigh as your nearly frozen body began regaining a little amount of warmth while Meloetta gently rubbed her large paws all over your naked being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the gracious legendary stopped rubbing your body, which was now warm enough to keep you from dying on Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Here.

You tried to squirm and struggle in her paws, but it proved to get you nowhere as she easily overpowered you without a hint of effort. You heard a loud giggle, it rang in your ears from the close proximity of her mouth and soon enough all you could see was the insides of her mouth. She started to put you in headfirst, and you tried to flail your hands to grab her lips and stop your movement, but you didn't manage to even reach them before she plopped you down on her large tongue.

You definitely weren't freezing anymore, this whole experience was like a disgusting sauna, you were pretty warm in here. You tried to stand on the tongue but every slight movement of it knocked you off balance, and it wasn't long before motions moved you against a wall, pinning you there as she sucked on you, you were against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Meloetta, please!\" You cried as she pinned you to the other cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard your cries, but disregarded them.

You tasted great, and to have you as a snack would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Probably kill you, she realized. She frowned at this. She didn't intend to do that, and in the end you were just a little human that somehow shrunk and probably needed help.

A few minutes later, Meloetta flew off, patting her round ass. \"Maybe I should start Gurgling more Humans,\" she thought.</span></div></div>",

She let go of her \"skirt\" and let it fall over you, sealing off much of the light from outside, but that part wasn't what caught you by surprise; the mere fact she put you up her skirt was shocking, and before long you felt her paw gently pushing you further back into her. The next thing you knew, you were standing right in front of something exuding heat and with a very faint musky scent wafting out. You didn't need to be told what your back was up against.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"chunter\">\"There~\u2026\"</span> Meloetta cooed almost in a whisper. <span class=\"chunter\">\"Aren't much warmer now my little human? My warmth is far more pleasant than the outside is it not?\"</span> You could hardly speak a word; Meloetta had really gone and put you up her skirt right next to her pokemon privates which were hot and wet no less! This explained some of the strange looks and smiles she had been giving you earlier, and now you were wondering what was going to happen next. <span class=\"chunter\">\"I must confess\u2014you are quite cute for a human, and I have long fancied the idea of mating with a human\u2026 Not many other pokemon could make me feel so\u2026anything like what I am feeling with you. Perhaps once we manage to get you to a reasonable size, maybe then I can feel you even more~. Alas, in your current shape such dreams are not possible, but I would very much love to give this a try. What say you my little human?\"</span> You didn't know what was more awkward for you to deal with: the fact that Meloetta\u2014a pokemon\u2014honest-to-god confessed to wanting to mate with a human (and that you happen to be her type), or the fact that her silk-laden voice with a hint of lust next to your increased exposure to her intimates was giving you a raging stiffie. Her sounding like a young woman and the knowledge of being so close to pussy almost made you jump at the offer, but the knowledge that she was a pokemon made you feel very conflicted about this. You truthfully weren't into pokemon as a whole, but there was something about Meloetta that made you consider the possibility of making an exception for her if you could. Before she could say or do much else, you went over your decision and came to a choice\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

You notice that the Shaymin has a pretty feminine voice, and she doesn't recognize you as a human as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm actually a human. Nice to meet you.\" You say as nice as possible. A second passes between you two, as you and her stare at each other. You then hear a short scream, and the paw's grip letting go of you, allowing you to call to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a thud, as you stare at the sky for a few seconds, keeping yourself awake from the shock of your fall. You steadily stand up, and notice that the Shaymin is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you very long, however, to find her, since she was poorly hiding in the grass, shaking. You decide, even though your inner instincts are telling you not to go near a creature that is 4x the size of you, to approach the startled hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to her, she shuffles away from you, still shivering in fear. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"P-p-please don't hurt me.\"</span> She squeaked, covering her head with her hands. You put your hands onto the back of the Shaymin, which makes her jump a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.\" You comfort, hugging her, well, as best as a 2 inch man can hug an 8 inch grass hedgehog. It does work, though, since you feel Shaymin's heartbeat calming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You let go of Shaymin, and kind of lean your back onto her body. You then feel a shift as the Shaymin starts to stand up and face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <span class=\"cgreen\">\"I-It's nice to meet you too, I'm Shaymin\"</span> She smiles, raising her front paw as if for you to shake it. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I've never s-seen a human so s-small.

What do you think?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias set your bag down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Human?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked your body from her head with Psychic and gasped when she saw the state you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Quick, warm him up!</span>\" Latios exclaimed in alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias nodded and immediately cupped you in her paws, which she brought closer to her before starting to blow warm air from her mouth and into her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but eventually the heat chased the cold away and you finally felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias took notice of that and stopped, offering a small smile of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks.\" you said, still a bit shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Don't even mention that,</span>\" she said cheerfully, beginning to nuzzle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and looked over to the side, noting Latios staring in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the red giantess was done showing affection, she pulled back, allowing you to see your new, warmer (though still quite cold) environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we're staying in here tonight?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yes.</span>\" Latios answered with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a nod of your own and fell into silence, still wondering how this all happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at least, you were with friendly guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be so bad, after all, could it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its eyes were fiery red and looking straight at you. It was a Marshadow, a Pokemon that could come and go from the shadows at will, and it was highly recommended not to make it angry in the slightest, because despite the body, it was said to have a huge power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at it for a few moments, you backed up, startled from the sudden appearance. Was it hiding in your shadow? Following you?... Was it the cause of your shrinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed up, the giant standing perfectly still, just staring at you. Then, you tripped over a root and fell with your butt on the hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly recovered from the impact and looked back at the giant... from this new angulation, you could see something, right in between the legendary's stubby legs and blushed: this giant was actually a giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained still, simply staring at the legendary, who stared back at you without moving nor speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she took a step towards you, causing your heart to start lifting to your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step. And another, until she was looming over you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with slow motions, she began bending, her hand extending as she went to grab a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought the urge to crawl away lest it'd anger the giantess and let her scoop you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought up to the Marshadow's fiery eyes as she fixed a neutral stare on you. She didn't look hostile nor friendly. She was just... studying you, maybe trying to determine what you were on, in the worst of cases, if you were edible or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost-type examined you in silence for a few minutes, moving her paw back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say a word either, but you felt very scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you began to feel very weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the circumstances led you to think the Marshadow was doing something to you but then logic led you to a different conclusion: you were naked in a frosty night with a much weaker body than it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to warm yourself up, you grabbed both your shoulders as you embraced yourself and began rubbing your naked body, but it was pointless, as what little amount of heat you managed to get in your body quickly dispersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you looked back at Marshadow with a pleading stare,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help...\" you whispered, fearing for your life, which was probably gonna end if you didn't get away from here soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the giantess seemed to understand and, silent as she had been so far, she began walking, her feet not making a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began picking up the pace and her walk became faster while you sat on her paw, trying your best to get some warmth to enter your body, going so far as laying down and rubbing yourself on Marshadow's hand. The giantess either didn't mind or ignored you, because she kept going through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a Marshadow would use the shadows to move since they had an ability similar to Gengar's to become one with the shadow. However, humans like yourself did not posses such ability, meaning that if she was to jump in a shadow, you'd be left behind to die alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid on her hand, trying to keep yourself conscious as the cold grew pungent and clouds of vapor began escaping from your mouth each time you inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust your luck, you thought, shrinking on a cold night like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, this would go on for about a couple more minutes before Marshadow reached a small hole in a stone wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she knew about it, because she slid inside without even thinking twice. Luckily, her body was small enough for her to fit and yours was way more than enough to fit inside the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness became your environment and, for a while, all you could see was the pair of fiery eyes belonging to Marshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, a green light lit the place up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered that Marshadow's head had gone from dark grey to dark green, while her head was acting like a flame, as well as her neck and the back of her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour perch suddenly became warmer and, when your body became warmer as well, you breathed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you quickly returned to reality: you were shrunken and in the hands of a Pokemon whose intentions were unclear. But, she saved you, so Marshadow was friendly, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, trying to find any traces of malice in her eyes, but she quickly looked away as she began a walk through the cave and went to sit down by a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good place to hide, you mused, since the hole was too small for any Pokemon, except maybe for a Joltik, to enter, though you doubted they'd be much of a match to your new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you, you looked at her, discovering that, once more, she was staring at you in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was starting to become awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thank you,\" you finally broke the ice, figuring you should have said something to her,<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving me. I doubt I would have made it out of that forest alive on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow blinked, as if surprised from the fact that you could talk, and for several moments she didn't act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, without any warning, the legendary...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her body still emanating heat thanks to the green flames that came from it, Marshadow began lowering the hand you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you thought she was going to put you on the ground, but then you realized where the paw, and consequently you, was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew, you were pinned against the Marshadow's chest by the one paw that previously held you, and that was now holding you in place so that you didn't fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe texture of her body was odd, like solid smoke, and it was fairly cold. You supposed a Pokemon that inhabited the shadows didn't get much warm, though the flames behind you were making up for her cold body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her other paw joined the first as you were fully trapped in between them and the giantess' chest, your body rapidly retrieving the warmth it had previously lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at Marshadow the best you could, since the two large paws obscured your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to get a glimpse of the giantess, you began squirming to get free from her grip, or to free at least your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was clearly saving your skin, you still couldn't be sure about her intentions, and feared that a quick moment of distraction could be lethal. Who guaranteed she was just warming you up because she didn't like her dinner cold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you struggling in her grip, the legendary loosened a bit and looked down at you, shooting an inquisitive stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose red eyes of hers stared deep into your soul, silently seeking for an answer to your unjustified struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you had her attention, you placed your hands on her chest and pulled yourself up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I suppose I have to thank you,\" you spoke, deciding to assume that she could understand you. Legendary Pokemon were smart, after all, so smart that you had heard of some of them being able to speak human language without issue.<br>\r\n\"But why are you doing this? Why are you helping me?\" you warily asked, wondering what you could do in case the response (if it was ever going to come) was a negative one that you wouldn't appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary giantess just stared at you for a few moments, as silent as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gaze of hers seemed hypnotic, her red eyes acting like two mirrors for you to see yourself, a doll stuck in the hands of such a small creature. However, they also carried a particular gleam, which in time carried a soothing sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Marshadow let a very small smile spread on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the sole answer you got to your question, because she then trapped you in her paws once more, her face disappeared behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you didn't struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why, but you were gaining some trust for the giantess. It was safe to assume that she was just a kind soul who wanted to help you in dire times, in this case by keeping you from dying alone in the woods, either eaten by some of the larger beasts that wandered out there, crushed by the same beasts or even worse from the hypothermia you nearly died of before she brought you in this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid still for what seemed an eternity, trying to recollect your thoughts, the only audible sound being the heartbeat of the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did a good job soothing you. It was a rhythmic, hypnotic sound that didn't allow you to focus on the same line of thinking for more than just a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as time drew on, you began feeling drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soothing heartbeat and the comforting warmth were making really hard for you to focus, but you still didn't want to let your guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt conflicted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you trust in Marshadow's good faith and go to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so tired you quickly decided you didn't care. She was acting, if not friendly, at least not hostile either, and that was all you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, letting the warmth envelop all of your naked body and the rhythmic beats of her heart invade your mind, rid it off all thoughts until nothing remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your body relaxed and your consciousness began to fade away as you nodded off to sleep in the paws of the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you felt like a great amount of time had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, sleepy and probably still dreaming, you opened your eyes, blurry figures dancing around your eyes until they took on a shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the surroundings of the cave you had been brought in, a small twinkle of light peering inside from the tiny hole that served as an entrance, meaning two things: it must have been morning now, and yours was no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last realization soon led you to yet another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, remembering who helped you last night. However, Marshadow was nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she abandoned you in the middle of nowhere!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready panicking, you failed to notice that things looked a bit darker from your point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could collect your thoughts, you casually looked down... and nearly fell on your behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the stone floor, a familiar pair of red eyes stared at you, seemingly from <i>inside</i> the floor itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as your mind began to put two and two together, you realized that your new legendary friend, if so you could dare to call her, had taken shelter within your shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply, but the shadow suddenly trembled as from it the familiar titaness emerged, until she was towering above you much like she had been when she first found you in the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... good morning...\" you awkwardly said, wondering how you could speak to someone who didn't make a noise,<br>\r\n\"I... thanks for saving me last night... guess I really owe you...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow offered one of those small smiles of hers, before returning stoic as ever, once more staring you down without saying a word nor making a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt uncomfortable under her gaze, mostly because of the sheer size of her eyes alone, even though they still carried that caring gleam in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several moments, nothing interesting happened as you and the legendary just stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point it even seemed she wanted to say something, as you saw her lips trembling, but you could easily be mistaken.</span></div></div>",

So, you decided to break it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you want to tell me something?\" you asked, trying to get this giantess to open to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't make a sound, but her head moved up and down in a slow fashion as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what is it?\" you asked, wondering if she could even speak human language like some of her fellow legendaries did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow blinked twice, and stood unmoving for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, moving slowly, she took a knee and extended her hand towards you, stopping with her palm up a few inches from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, she looked at you in silence - an invitation to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment, then hopped in the middle of the legendary's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her hand slowly, carefully, the giantess brought it up in front of her face, right by her mouth. The closeness with such thing made you a lot more nervous, considering what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the two lips parting and, for a moment, fear invaded your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it quickly dispersed when you heard Marshadow whispering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Are you alright?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" you stammered, her voice so low that, even from this close, you couldn't fully hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you exclaimed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you CAN talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow nodded a few times, her face adopting a small smile, before she repeated with a concerned tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Are you alright?</span>\" she asked,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You nearly froze last night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez, her voice was so low that you doubted someone normal-sized would be able to hear it, which was probably why Marshadow liked to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\" you replied, before smiling her way,<br>\r\n\"But I'm fine now, and it's thanks to you. I would've died for sure if it wasn't for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow didn't reply to that, but smiled again, evidently pleased by your gratitude. You guessed she didn't get much, being a Pokemon who usually wandered the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">By the way, you're really small for a human.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\" you repeated sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Why?</span>\" Marshadow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are asking why I'm so small... I'm afraid I have no idea,\" you answered, shrugging,<br>\r\n\"I was taking a hike, and the next thing I know is that I passed out. When I woke up, I was like this.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the need to ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you have any clue why I shrunk down to this size? That would be really helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow kept silent for a while longer, leading you to think if you had made a wrong question, or worse, if she was the one behind your shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegendaries did carry a lot of odd powers after all, time travel, aura manipulation and so on, who said shrinking other living beings wasn't among those abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Marshadow's eventual reply proved your theory wrong, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I don't know how you shrunk down to that size.</span>\" she said in the usual whisper, before adding,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could swear her voice adopted a barely noticeable flustered tone as she spoke the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gotta assume you don't know how to help me grow big again.\" you muttered, before looking at her pleadingly,<br>\r\n\"Please, don't tell me you don't know how to help me grow big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow's answer wasn't a 'no'. However, it wasn't a 'yes' either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she didn't reply at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to delude your expectations, the giantess simply kept silent and kept staring at you. After several minutes of silence, you just lowered your head and sighed resignedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a no, then,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry.</span>\" came the whispered answer you were waiting for, which confirmed that you were stuck with this size for who knew how long, potentially forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was really depressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were small and defenseless, unable to protect yourself even from the cold brought by the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see any bright side in this. You had to face the truth, you were doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Marshadow was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Human,</span>\" she said, bringing her free hand to your head, her small finger placing itself under your head as she lifted it up, forcing you to look at her; she was smiling,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know it seems bad. I'm sure it is.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">But I can help, somehow.</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I can watch over you, if you wish. I'll feed you. Water you. Whatever you need.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really...?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered a nod, though one a bit more enthusiastic, you could tell by its speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, she was happy to have someone to keep her company, while you were more than happy to have someone to protect and feed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice was obvious, but you simply had to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you can't take me back to town so I can get some actual help with my size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you knew what that meant, so you said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile came back to Marshadow's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Great.</span>\" she said in that ghostly whisper that was her voice,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't worry, human. I promise, I'll take care of you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how to reply, you simply shot a smile as small as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, there was a bright side after all, even if it lied in a shadow.</span></div></div>",

You actually couldn't believe any of this, and began thinking this was only a nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, logic quickly overpowered the illusion you were already creating around you: how many nightmares can save you from a certain death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was plain reality, you sourly mused, and the sooner you accepted it, the sooner you were going to adapt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow's voice gently called you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Are you alright?</span>\" she asked for what had to be the tenth time since you woke up; you stared at her blankly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">... You looked like you were pretty deep in thought.</span>\" she justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... sorry,\" you apologized, exasperated,<br>\r\n\"It's only... well, everything. This is going to take forever to get used to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">That is understandable. It does seem like a big change.</span>\" Marshadow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Is that supposed to be a joke?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply. You briefly wondered if Marshadow even knew what a joke was, given her attitude. It wasn't like you were in the mood for size-related jokes, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry. I didn't meant to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't worry, human.</span>\" Marshadow whispered, deadpan, before an idea clicked in her mind,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Would you like some fresh air? Something to eat, perhaps?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying to be nice, but her expression betrayed her intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, some fresh air sounded good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice.\" you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess didn't reply, but began moving towards the small opening in the stone that led outside; effortlessly, the ghost-type squeezed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm sunlight immediately greeted you. A nice change from the freezing night you barely escaped. It was nice to think that nature wasn't trying to kill you anymore, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess- huh?\" you were interrupted as you felt the ground suddenly getting much closer to you, though you soon realized that it was you who was getting closer to the ground; looking back, you saw your recently acquired caretaker lowering her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after she let you down you asked why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I can't stand the sun.</span>\" Marshadow quietly replied, right before taking a step forward, sinking into your shadow, which became much larger. You also noted that the world around you now appeared sort of blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What... what am I supposed to do then?\" you asked, not really sure if the legendary could hear you; it soon turned out she could, because you heard her voice in your head, saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">Just walk. I'll guide you to some place where we can eat.</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several seconds, you just stared in disbelief at your own shadow, which carried your host's glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary could speak to you in your mind, was this possession!? Your heart skipped a beat at the thought, and it skipped more than one beat when you heard Marshadow speaking again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">Not quite. I've merged with your shadow, becoming one with you.</span></i>' she explained, before adding dejectedly,<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">It's not possession.</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sorry... wait, does that mean I'm actually hearing your thoughts!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">Yes.</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss for words, so you decided to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where should I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your thoughts, Marshadow began giving you indications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">And don't worry about other Pokemon. I will deal with them if they threaten you.</span></i>' she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered: you could live with being tiny, but you were never going to get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cplum\">... I'm not creepy.</span></i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the instructions your own shadow was giving you, you strolled through the quiet forest until you reached a particularly large tree; several berries hung from the branches, though you had no way of ever reaching them at your current stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you had Marshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess silently slid out of your shadow and stood tall next to you, protected by the tree's shade; much like last night, you saw her head suddenly igniting with a green flame and, before you could ask questions, she delivered a single punch to the trunk, causing a few berries to fall from the lower branches to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pointed your eyes back to Marshadow, she had already returned to normal and was smiling slightly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Shall we eat?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, you were sitting at the foot of the tree, filling your empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly...\" you said, pausing to take another bite out of your berry, which was as large as your lower body. You let the juicy, sweet flavor overwhelm your mouth for a moment before swallowing and resuming,<br>\r\n\"... Food that's bigger than I am. I can't decided if that's awesome or humiliating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow, who was sitting beside you, stopped in mid-bite to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I think you should just stop thinking about your stature.</span>\" she said, taking a bite, chewing and swallowing, ironically louder than she spoke,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You're gonna adapt faster that way.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little hard, considering everything is huge compared to me, Marshadow.\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Perhaps.</span>\" she admitted, swallowing the rest of her meal,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">But I'm sure there's got to be some bright side to it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing from a Pokemon that was the exact opposite of 'bright', that was hilarious. Still, you were careful not to voice that thought, and were suddenly glad the giantess wasn't hearing your thoughts at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" you muttered in response, quickly finishing your meal as well, taking a moment to stretch,<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshadow didn't reply, busily munching on some other berries. It made sense that she wasn't satisfied yet; after all, a berry was like a watermelon to you. To her, it was more or less a potato chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after eating several more berries, Marshadow stood up, before looking at you; your eyes and hers met for a moment, right before she started sinking back into your shadow, looking as stoic as ever as her face slowly disappeared from sight, once more leaving nothing but a pair of fiery eyes to prove her existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue your mind having technically become one with hers, you could hear her thinking a response to the question you previously  made, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Marshadow had been living together for a good amount of time now. Maybe a month had passed since you first shrunk? In any case, Marshadow was still taking care of you. The only problem was... Marshadow herself. At first, she was fun to talk with. Meek, quiet and shy. Then, she became controlling. Despite you not seeing her you knew she was always watching from the shadows. You supposed it was probably her lonely nature trying to not lose her one friend but it was still really excessive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe straw that broke the camels back on your opinion of her treatment of her was when you asked if you could see other pokemon. Almost instantaneously the cold had crept upon your back and the cave turned pitch black with shadow. The mild temperature in the air dropped to temperatures similar to when you had first shrunk, leaving you shivering on the floor to try and retain body heat. The thing that had broken you out of your panic was the same voice you had grown accustomed to over the days, let laced with a hint of lethality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"No... You can't leave me...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mustered up your energy to reply to her, trying to pacify her to not only stay alive but also to quell her fears. \"I-I'm not going to l-leave you. D-don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you said this the temperature had gone slightly up and allowed some light to come in, although you weren't out of the water yet. The shadows still far outnumbered the light and the cold was still dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"R-Really?\"</span> You heard Marshadow whisper out in her signature whisper, the edge in her voice much less than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes! Really! I promise! I'll stay with you forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter speaking those words the shadows all dissipated and all that was left was a black cloudy blob coming full force at you. Despite the temperature going up, you were still suffering from the after-effects of the extreme cold meaning you couldn't move at all. You were scooped up with the misty paws of the Female Marshadow and brought up to her lips. You were assaulted with kisses that, while not that bad were still starting to wear on you. Finally mustering up enough strength you stretch out your arms to at least signify to Marshadow that she needed to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the assault had ended. Of course, that incident's after-effects still hadn't gone away, not one bit. If anything, they had grown stronger. You were confined to the small cave, being prohibited from leaving. One time you wanted to go to the entrance to look outside and Marshadow immediately pulled you back and held you within her grasp, despite not being there moments prior. You were locked in a cage made of shadows constructed using Marshadow's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite all the downsides you were still perfectly fed and clothed, along with water and shelter. Marshadow's constant acts of affection were getting bothersome, but they still felt filled with love and made you hope to a future where Marshadow's doubts about you staying are quelled, where the two of you can walk outside without Marshadow fearing the possibility of you running away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise at the front of the cave snapped you out of your inner monologue. What was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: A wild pokemon that just happened to come across this cave in the rare instances Marshadow was out hunting. <br>\r\nB: Marshadow along with another pokemon that she had befriended along the way. (You choose what pokemon)<br>\r\nC: A legendary pokemon had come to rescue you from the clearly over-obsessed pokemon. Marshadow may or may not decide to hunt them down to \"save\" you from their clutches. (You choose. The new legendary may also fall in love/obsessed with you, who knows!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"></span></span></div></div>",

It was, if you remembered correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan had a slim, black figure with blue eyes. There was no mouth in sight on its face and there were long, pink hair falling from its head; the top of the head was covered by a pink, pointy shell, as was the lower body of the monolith whose grasp you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, definitely Tapu Lele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back at it as the giant studied your tiny body in its grasp, not making a sound while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were initially too afraid to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as time passed without the giant creature doing anything, you realized it had no interest in hurting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you called out, hoping it'd understand you. It was a legendary, after all, and legendaries were supposed to be smarter than normal Pokemon, right,<br>\r\n\"I, uh... need help! I'm lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan blinked twice, seemingly perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you heard a voice speaking directly in your mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You are a human, right?</span>\" the voice spoke with a feminine tone, startling you. You looked around, trying to figure who it was speaking, before the same voice asked,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How did a human like yourself get so small? What happened?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Tapu Lele, noting that she was staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Was that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant, or giantess apparently, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Indeed.</span>\" it answered. Both its looks and voice made you convince that Tapu Lele was actually female, which was odd. Legendaries were supposed to be genderless, after all, though this wasn't what concerned you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the hands of a potentially dangerous legendary, and such line of thinking worried you. Who knew how you were going to end if you made the mistake of ticking her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tapu Lele seemed more intrigued in you than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Tell me, human,</span>\" she spoke, and for the first time you saw a tiny mouth opening on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How did you shrink to that size? Oh, tell me, tell me!</span>\" she said, sounding suddenly very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excitement caught you off guard, and for several moments you didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you cleared your throat nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know, really...\" you replied truthfully,<br>\r\n\"I passed out and, when I woke up, I was like this! I'm shrunk and I'm lost, I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">My help?</span>\" the legendary parroted back, seemingly surprised,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Help with what?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to reply, when you suddenly noted how cold it was around you. A quick look down reminded you that you were naked, and that your more fragile organism wasn't going to survive the night if you were left by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-Well, could you start by bringing me away from here? It's cold!\" you said, shivering, your skin starting to adopt a very pale tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapu Lele seemed to ponder your request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Meh. Not that cold.</span>\" she said, and for the first time you noted how childish her voice sounded. Even more, it sounded like the one of a spoiled little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guardian this giantess was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'll die if I'm l-left out here for too long!\" you pleaded, your teeth beginning to chatter and your skin starting to adopt a faint shade of cerulean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapu Lele waved her free arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't be silly!</span>\" she said, before taking a good look at you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hmm... you do seem to be in trouble though... aw, fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt yourself falling as Tapu Lele dropped you. You fell for a moment, before landing right inside of the giantess' pink shell. Immediately, heat washed over you as you sat up, noting that you were on a soft, black surface. Was this part of Tapu Lele's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt movement around you, and looked up to see that the giantess was retreating completely inside of the shell, forming a barrier against the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">There. Happy now?</span>\" she said, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very. Thank you.\" you replied, feeling much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the expression of the giantess changed, and a rosy tint appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, you're welcome!</span>\" she spoke cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'll get you somewhere warmer! Don't worry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the shell around you starting to move as Tapu Lele began hovering, apparently knowing where she was going despite the fact she wasn't actually seeing the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... What a quick change of mood, you thought. From annoyed, she was now eager to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Tapu Lele arrived within a cavern, where she opened up her shell, letting her head pop out like a cork from a bottle, before she picked you out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">There we go!</span>\" you heard her say in a chiming voice,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Now, let's talk about business. I know, I'm a powerful psychic and a oh- ever so gracious legendary, but... I have no clue how to fix you. Your size, I mean.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. You didn't even get to ask, and you were already being denied. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I supposed to do like this?\" you wondered, starting to fear. Were you going to have to spend your whole life like this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well... technically, I shouldn't do this, buuuut... maybe you can stay with me.</span>\" Tapu Lele offered, her voice betraying a certain excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered the offer, before thinking, <br>\r\n'<i>What do I have to lose at this point?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there is no way you could restore my size? Or do you happen to know anyone that could, y'know, like, other legendaries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm on board...\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the giantess smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Great!</span>\" she said cheerfully, though you noted a certain glint in her eyes when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a look of...</span></div></div>",

The tongue below you starts to move, as she presses your body onto the roof of her mouth, suckling a bit on your body. Though it startles you a bit, you notice that the Poipole is not pressing on you too hard. You would even say it's a bit enjoyable, if it wasn't for the saliva also around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a noise come from the back of the throat behind you, the Poipole finds your taste...</span></div></div>",

What if she wasn't going to help you get back to normal and simply use you to satisfy her wants and needs? Still, you couldn't deny that for better or worse, life for you from this point onward was never going to be the same whether you grew back to normal or not. So many things could happen to you in the future, and it all rested upon this moment.

You were in a precarious position and she seemed to be your only way out of it, so with this in mind you extended your arm out to Poipole's to \"seal the deal\". Poipole flashed you a wide grin and accepted your hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"A pleasure doing business with you, human~,\"</span> Poipole said. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, let's get right to it.\"</span> The pokemon raised herself back up into a sitting position, revealing her privates to you once more. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I've heard from other pokemon that humans are <i>really</i> good at these kinds of things, so I hope you don't disappoint\u2026\"</span> With nothing else but to get this ordeal over with, you sighed in resignation and made your way over to the pokemon's privates. Poipole slouched in her seat to grant you more access to her, and soon you noticed that her orifice wasn't like that of a human's; it resembled a cloaca of sorts, and you resisted the urge to cringe a little\u2014a cloaca was both a pokemon's vagina and anus where they were impregnated, laid eggs from, and last but not least excreted their waste from. Shuddering, you hoped that Poipole had some sense of hygiene lest you ended up with questionable things all over your hands. From the looks of it, Poipole was already slick with what you hoped was lubricant, and without delaying a moment longer you took your hands and placed them at the edges of Poipole's orifice to get straight to work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your hands firmly massaged the fluorescent flesh, kneading the walls every now and again, and Poipole voiced her satisfaction with your starting efforts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oooh~\u2026not bad, human,\"</span> the pokemon giggled. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I wonder if you've done this before\u2026\"</span> You explained to Poipole that you were a virgin\u2014you had never experienced sex before, though that had done nothing to lower the pokemon's expectations. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"From the way you are touching me, I would have thought otherwise. Just keep up the pace and you'll do nicely.\"</span> You obliged the pokemon, keeping a steady rhythm as your hands explored as much real estate as they could and throwing in firm squeezes whenever you could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Mmmmm~\u2026\"</span> After some time Poipole frequently cooed softly in approval of your touches, simply sitting back and letting you do your thing. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Ahhhh,<i> yesss~</i>\u2026 Hey, human\u2014think you can go a little faster\u2026?\"</span> At her urging you did just that, speeding up your pace and causing the pokemon to leak more of her fluids out onto you as she moaned in sheer euphoria. As for you, the effect her pleasured voice was having on you made your little john stand out long and hard, straining painfully in the warm air\u2014and whether it was the musk wafting from Poipole's aroused orifice or her voice, your mind seemed to slowly slip into sexual delirium. Soon, emboldened by your increasing lust, you spread Poipole's hole open a little further and stuck your tongue out to slather your spit all over her inner walls. That earned you a throaty groan from the pokemon, and after a few more moments of tasting her you hear Poipole suck in a sharp breath\u2014you only had a short amount of time to just barely regain yourself as the pokemon let out one last groan, and then you found yourself caught in the wake of her powerful orgasm. You were knocked flat to your back, covered nearly from head to toe, and the shock from such a powerful wave hitting you had cleared up the haze of lust that had overtaken you. Despite having just orgasmed, Poipole herself seemed to be fine enough to stand up just fine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Ahhhh~, I needed that\u2026\"</span> Poipole sighed. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"That was a wonderful job, human. Now I can't help but imagine how good you'll be when you're big enough for me\u2026\"</span> The implication that Poipole wanted more of you once you were back to normal was both arousing and concerning. When you tried to get up, however, you found yourself stuck to the ground thanks to Poipole's emission, and while you quickly began struggling to break free from the sticky substance Poipole laughed at your misfortune (though not out of any malice). <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oops, I forgot to mention that my\u2026bodily fluids act as adhesives\u2014don't worry, you won't be stuck like that for much longer, but since I have you down there I want to strike another deal with you.\"</span> The pokemon got down on her fours and looked down from right over your immobilized form.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'll help you grow back to normal\u2014a deal is a deal after all, but in addition to helping you, I was wondering how you might feel about becoming my mate~?\"</span> Your eyes flew wide open at Poipole's offer of letting you bed her as a mate\u2014a pokemon and human having such relationships weren't so unheard of, but they were still far and few in-between with most never letting their secret slip. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"However, I'm going to let you know right now that I am pretty picky about my mates, and that includes wanting my mates mostly to myself if I can help it. The best way to do that is to let all other potential rivals know that you are mine, and what better way to do that than to\u2026mark my territory?\"</span> Almost right away you recoiled from what that meant, and while the idea of having sex with a pokemon was somewhat enticing you didn't want that at the cost of what Poipole implied she would do to you next.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, I'm sure you probably have some potential human mates in mind, so if you want I'll only mark you enough to let every other pokemon know that they can't have you; any other human will never be able to notice the scent. On the other hand, if you don't have any potential human mates in mind that you want to claim for life, then I can heavily mark you to let every other female know that you're mine, human or otherwise. With me as your mate, I'll make sure that you'll never have to want or need any other~\u2026 How does that sound?\"</span> There was a lot to consider about Poipole's offer\u2014if she marked you period then that limited how many other \"mates\" you might want in the future, though she was considerate enough to consider allowing you to have at least one female human mate of your choice while keeping all other pokemon away from you. It sounded as though she would prefer if you let her mark you thoroughly so that no other female could lay a claim to you, but even that was somewhat mitigated by how she spoke of making so that you'd never have to want any other mate. In any case, you'd have to make your decision soon\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

The rest of your belongings would have to be left behind for now, but you doubted that anyone would steal your stuff if they chanced upon it. With your mind made up, you went on ahead with your unclothed self and made for the trail. It wasn't all too difficult to find the road despite the huge setback in your small size, but you soon found that finding the road was the least of your worries.

Back with your things someone would eventually have to find them and you would invariably be spotted if you positioned yourself well enough, but that would only work if someone benevolent came along rather than a pokemon looking for a snack or some other misfortune. You could still make it to the town and find someone to help you, assuming that you were willing to hitch a ride on a(n) (unsuspecting) person or their pokemon, or you could look around and find someone who was simply admiring the scenery with no particular place to go for the time being. One thing was for sure: you were tired as hell from dodging everything and everyone out on the open trail, and if you didn't want this to keep up you would have to make up your mind soon before you ended up getting no help\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

The thump was rhythmic, almost like footsteps and you fell forward once again onto the cold ground as the booming got closer. You felt the cold of the ground seep into your bones as you looked forward to see dark paws in front of you. The black paws stopped as the owner of them noted the abandoned pack and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see that...it was indeed a pokemon. You followed the shape of her body up, to yellow-orange fur...a fox like face...a stick in its hand. You noted that it was a Braixen...you saw a slit between its legs too, making you blush as you confirmed that it was a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part she regarded the stuff in front of her with confusion, was a human out here? This far from the town and they abandoned their belongings. With a boom on your ears she moved for the pack and went to hoist it up, finding it surprisingly heavy. Her eyes widened at this, and she looked around the ground again before her eyes fell on you. You gulped, the piercing red eyes seeming to penetrate you as you shivered not only from the cold, but now fear. This Braixen was easily the size of a building to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello...\" You stammered out and she tilted her head. A great sound resonated as the Braixen dropped to her knees and you stumbled around, trying to get your bearings. You got your senses in order as a paw seemed to descend upon you, its shadow eating up your vision as the warm fingers wrapped around you. Immediately you were constricted and lifted from the harsh ground, high high up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't hurt me...I don't know what happened to me...\" You said, still afraid and her mouth opened in shock at this confirmation. It really was a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a small thing for her, her mouth opening frightened you. It would be very easy for her to put you in there...tear you to shreds with those sharp teeth of hers. You whimpered a bit, and your stomach lurched again as she got up from her knees and put her stick in her tail, keeping you in one hand. She regarded your clothes and picked them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" You asked, curious and she looked at you briefly before ignoring you and going to your pack. She fumbled with a few free fingers that had your clothes to open the pack and she put your clothes in them before closing it again. With a giant grunt and an impressive display of power to you she lifted the pack that you would never be able to budge on your own with that free paw and looked at you one more time before she started walking away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going!? What are you going to do with me!?\" You squeaked out as your world shook, and she seemed to ignore you as she kept moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach seemed to lurch with each step she took and after about 15 or so minutes she made for what looked like a dark cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uneven terrain had done a number on you though, and you felt yourself having a harder and harder time clinging to consciousness. By the time she'd settled in and set you down you were already fading fast. The last thing you remembered was her lighting her stick with a gentle flame, and using it to provide you a bit of warmth as you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ngh...\" You mumbled, as you opened your eyes. There was warmth around you...but no flame you noted. You couldn't move you found too, and you felt...fur against your being? Looking around you found that you were against a wall of yellow orange fur, with white furred fingers keeping you pressed to it.

You couldn't understand the question. All you did was squirm slightly in her grip and she closed her mouth. You felt the fingers around your back that were pinning you to her chest fully wrap around you as you were lifted up to her face, in her eyes you saw an air of curiosity as she regarded your pitiful form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what she could be thinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen herself was still processing the fact that in her grasp was a tiny little human. She saw humans come through here from time to time, usually passing by, many of them trainers trying to capture pokemon. She'd had her handful of encounters with humans that wanted to tame her, but each time she evaded. There were many pokemon out there that would like nothing better than to bond with a trainer, but that wasn't her. No thanks, she much preferred true freedom. Though there were times she envied the bond she'd see when a trainer was being kind to a pokemon...or the times that a despicable human abused pokemon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what kind of human this one was. While he slept, chilly from the night with no clothes or fur to protect him she'd rummaged through his bag, helping herself to a bit of his snack food that was in there...but she found no pokeballs. Just some survival stuff...food, water, a sleeping bag just in case...rope, knife, but nothing that would indicate that this human was a trainer. If anything he seemed to be a hiker or camper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noted how fearful he was of her, and how confused he was as well, so whatever happened to him...he probably didn't know either. A tiny human...this was quite the catch she mused, a slight smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what she'd do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part you gulped, seeing her smile. You couldn't possibly know what she planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you noted her mouth opening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">En...Braixen.</span>\" She said and you found yourself being pulled closer to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no please! Please don't eat me!\" You cried out but you didn't stop moving closer as soon you saw her sharp teeth, her long tongue, and felt her warm, moist breath on your face. The muscle that was her tongue departed past her lips to greet you and soon the soft squishy surface came upon your face, completely engulfing it and covering your face with her saliva. She licked your face a few times and you shut your eyes, whimpering as you had the warm wet substance covering your hair and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she pulled back and you opened your eyes, seeing how the Braixen was looking at you and wondering what she'd do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Braixen's original plan was to keep the shrunken human as something of a pet. The idea of reversing the roles between humans and pokemon amused her greatly. However as the massive bipedal fox creature gave you what was supposed to be a playful lick, she noticed something. This tiny, naked human actually had a great taste to him. Sure there was some dirt and whatnot mixed in with the taste, but she was surprised just how wonderful you tasted to her. She attempted to control herself, trying to remember the plan to keep you as a pet, but soon the fox couldn't help herself as you found yourself sliding back into her mouth. You struggled against her overpowering whims, trying everything in your power to avoid those sharp teeth and the all devouring black hole behind you. Of course Braixen had no intention of chewing you (at least for now she didn't). She just wanted to savor your taste. Her tongue quickly pinned you to the roof of her mouth as her hot, humid, and rather odorous breath washed over you, consuming several of your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue gently rubbed back and forth against your bare back, providing an oddly comfortable massage as she continued to taste you. Of course your weak struggles amused her. But as she leaned back slightly she stopped, remembering what exactly was inside her. This wasn't some common berry or animal she could eat. This was a shrunken human. Great taste or no, this was something incredibly special. And if she were to eat you, she sure as hell wouldn't be getting another, as food or as a pet like she originally planned. Even if she didn't care about your fate, if she wanted to experience this again, she would need to keep you around. Though part of her still wanted to know how you'd feel going in. Was she willing to give everything up for a quick meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen pondered her options carefully. Despite the past few minutes she really did want a human pet. And aside from taste, you would certainly be able to provide a lot of amusement for her through various means. But curiosity and urges still lingered. And that taste. Could she say no to them.</span></div></div>",

As Braixen enjoyed a few final licks against your squirming body, sense and self control finally returned to her as she buried the urges to eat you. After all, she had much bigger plans for the tiny human. Soon the Licking stopped and you fell back onto her slimy tongue. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">XEN!</span>\u201d The fox spoke. From within her mouth the voice was booming and echoed all around giving you the scare of your life. Soon you felt a powerful force pushing you past the tongue and the sharp teeth. Within seconds you were back in the outside world, though pretty disoriented from the events that lead to hear. You eventually crashed into the fennic pokemon\u2019s awaiting hand paw, laying in a puddle of her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen examines you excitedly. Her mind went back to all the humans who attempted to capture her. All the ones who successfully got a few of her friends. Now the tables were turned. Now it was the human\u2019s turn to belong to the Pok\u00e9mon as some sort of pet. The thought of this role reversal made her grin at you as you slowly regained your bearings. Carefully she closed her hand around you as she made her way for your bag to look for something to complete her control and ownership over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen knew she needed something to keep her pet in line. Something to keep him obedient and prevent him from running away. Humans typically use pokeballs to achieve this with her kind, but unfortunately for her, she didn\u2019t have anything of the sort that could be used on a human, even a tiny one. But maybe you had packed something that she could use for this. Keeping you in a fairly tight grip, she dug through your bag, tossing aside snack bags and underwear. Finally she spotted something that could work. With a cheerful \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Brai!</span>\u201d the fox pulled out a spool with string. You originally packed that in case your clothes ripped since you were going to be traveling for a while with a limited number of clothes. However, now it\u2019s purpose would be to give Braixen a tool and symbol of her ownership over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to resist, but it made no difference. Braixen was still able to easily the the string around your body, careful not to make it too tight on you, but strong so that there was no way you'd ever undo the knot she made. Holding the remaining long end like a leash, Braixen smiled, proud of her work.</span></div></div>",

She pondered if this was what it was like for something to be trapped inside those red and white balls. Finally deciding to take a bit more of an active role in the fun, Braixen had a game in mind. One she was sure you wouldn\u2019t be too fond of, but one that your master was going to have you play anyway. Holding this much power over a human was almost intoxicating to the fox Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept tugging at the knot trying to free yourself (for whatever good that would do given the massive Braixen right over you). Unsurprisingly, you couldn\u2019t even loosen it slightly. Suddenly, your owner tugged on the string, pulling you up against her footpaw. Braixen seems to try explain something to you, but of course, you only heard her repeating bits of her name along with some growls. Braixen noticed your confused expression and quickly thought of a simple way to summarize the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down, Braixen placed her hand near you using her fingers to act like a little person with legs. Suddenly her other hand slammed down towards it, only barely missing the other hand as it moved at the last second. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Brai?</span>\u201d She asked seemingly trying to determine if you understood what she was describing. You still have her a confused look. You assumed the first hand was supposed to be you. Were you supposed to avoid something? Sighing Braixen stand back up and tugs your string a bit pulling you in front of her. Before you could act, you saw her footpaw hovering over you. You screamed and tried to get back up, but the string was holding your leg down. You watched in fear as the paw came down quickly. Suddenly at the last second, your owner tugged the string again pulling you out of the way just as the paw slammed down. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Brai?</span>\u201d She asked again cheerfully. \u201cYou... want me to dodge your foot?\u201d You questioned causing her to smile and nod. \u201cAre you crazy? That\u2019s not a game! That will get me killed!\u201d Braixen just shrugged seemingly not caring. You wanted to argue some more, but the raising paw quickly shut you up as you stumbled out of the way at the last second. The game had begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen enjoyed herself, toying with you for the most part, though you did surprise her by dodging the steps that were intended to pin you. You on the other hand were having a decidedly less enjoyable time. Each step boomer inches from your body. You were terrified for your life as you barely stayed in this game. The paws kicked up a little dirt and dust with each stomp coating you and causing you to cough. You wondered if this game even had a win condition for you or if it was just a sadistic game of torture for Braixen\u2019s enjoyment. You knew so little about her that you felt it could go either way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your legs started to tire after a few minutes, You ended up tripping over your leash string while dodging one of Braixen\u2019s stomps. You were out of breath and sluggish from all the constant action. You knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to get back up in time. Rolling over you saw the fox creature\u2019s paw in position right over you. With a terrified whimper, you braved yourself for what might be the end.</span></div></div>",

You felt the intense pressure lower down onto you in mere seconds, and prepared for the crunch and great pain that would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never came though as you tried to open your eyes and saw the dirty sole of the pokemon on you. You struggled and tried to move, but you were pinned down pretty hard and couldn't budge. It was then that the surface above you moved to the left, you rolling along with it as you were scraped along the ground and found your face down in the dirt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gently rolling your body around under her foot. It was then that you heard yips from up above as the Braixen was laughing at you and your situation. She rolled to the right, scraping you along again and rolling you around as you found yourself swallowing dirt in the great roller coaster of this whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to open your mouth to say something, but you found it difficult to even talk right now. She kept this up for a few minutes, though to you it was hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen was having the time of her life. She couldn't believe how easy it was to dominate this little human, it was pathetic really. She smirked as she rolled you around on the dirty ground, savoring the moment. She wasn't even the least bit tired from that little 'play' session either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a few minutes of this that she lifted her foot, content with this little game. She looked down to see the tiny form of the human facing the ground, not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the intense pressure lift from you, but by now you were so tired that you hardly had the strength to even move. You groaned as you felt a tug on your leg. That damned string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to kick at it, but it did nothing but exert more energy as you were dragged along the ground, and then up into the air, the string digging into your leg as this happened. You grunted in pain but it was over soon as you fell into the furry palm of the Braixen as she grinned down at you, dirty and wet from both sweat and her spit from earlier. You looked a bit scraped up too, but nothing terribly serious. Her fingers wrapped around you as she lifted you to her face. \"<span class=\"corange\">Xen? Braixen?</span>\" She asked, kinda smugly, almost in a condescending tone. You didn't know what she was trying to communicate but you hung your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kill me if you're gonna do it...\" You croaked out. \"Because I honestly don't know what the hell you're trying to do to me aside from torture me.\" You didn't know what her intentions were, she just seemed to be playing sick games with you as she stuffed you in her mouth and then tied the string on you, probably to make sure you didn't run away, then that stomping game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen tilted her head. She wasn't trying to kill the human, just have fun with her newest pet. She didn't give a damn about if it was what he wanted, but she wasn't trying to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Xen? Brai?</span>\" She seemed confused with her words and you looked her in the eyes, finding some form of courage to glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said just do whatever you're gonna do! I don't want to put up with any more of your sick and twisted tricks! Were you the one that shrunk me down you freaking fox!? Because it wouldn't surprise me!\" You shouted, hoping that if she wasn't going to let you go, that this would at least make her finish you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you started to think straight again though...and realized you just told off a giant fox that had just shown in a variety of ways how she could end you and the power she had over you. You gulped and was thinking maybe you should apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen was a little surprised by your words though, this little human was yelling at her, as if he had a say in what happened. This was only right, he was a human, one of the stupid humans that captured pokemon and took them away, making them fight, or making them pets. This was what he deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But by the same token, he didn't seem to be a trainer either, and didn't have anything in his pack to indicate as such. She sure wasn't going to give up this source of entertainment or fun, but maybe she'd been harsh on him. Though why was he yelling like this, if not for her he'd have frozen to death too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen made her choice.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps a break would be the best thing for the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her awaiting her wrath. The fox giantess certainly wasn\u2019t going to tolerate your little outbursts. But strangely she wasn\u2019t looking at you in anger or anything of the sort. It was almost a cheerful smile actually. You weren\u2019t sure if this was worse than anger but then you saw her reaching for you. You didn\u2019t have a chance to flee when she wrapped her fuzzy digits around you and pulled you closer. The body heat comming from Braixen was actually quite comfortable to you, but you weren\u2019t going to drop your guard just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you were deposited on the fox creature\u2019s lap. The abundance of fur, mixed with her body heat made this position very comfortable for you, but you were still very weary of the giant. Seeing the fear remaining in your eyes, Braixen smiled and started to pet you. Though she still viewed you as her lesser, Braixen didn\u2019t want to appear as a cruel owner to you. \u201cBrai!\u201d You has no clue what she was saying, but she didn\u2019t seem to mean you any harm. As a clawed finger started to gently scratch your back, you started to relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, you opened your eyes and looked back up at Braixen. She really did look like a powerful figure from your point of view. Noticing that you had finally calmed down, Braixen petted you a few times before moving her paws away. \u201cT-thanks... does this mean you\u2019ll take this off of me?\u201d You asked lifting the string. Unfortunately, Braixen only responded by laughing and wagging a finger. Well so much for freedom, but you supposed it could have been much worse. Though being a fox creature\u2019s pet is still pretty low on where you hoped your life would take you. With a defeated sigh you figured you might as well accept it now. She might be bossy but at least she\u2019s not outright malicious. She seems concerned enough to calm you down at the very least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your break neared it\u2019s end, Braixen pondered what to do with you next. Perhaps she should ease you into your new life. Then again, she was the master so it was still up to her.</span></div></div>",

Just what was she going to do now? You hoped it wouldn't be painful. She was smiling before she pointed at you, then her footpaw in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Xen!</span>\" She said in a cheerful tone as she made a rubbing motion with her hands. She wanted a foot rub? Seemed simple enough...you nodded with a gulp before approaching...god, this paw towered over you. You reached out, slightly hesitating before you touched the paw. It felt surprisingly soft...you started to rub it before you felt a tug on your 'leash' as she pulled you away and she looked down at you before doing the gesture again quicker and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted you to put your back into it?

You approached again, and with a grunt, put your whole body into rubbing her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen sighed as you did this, it actually felt great to have you do this. Yup, not eating the little human was a good call. He would remain hers for a long, loooooooong time. She had a smile flit on her muzzle as you worked, sweating quite a bit as you did. She'd keep you in good condition, fed at least too, but this was the beginning of your life at her whims and there was one more thing that would seal that for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted before once again you felt a tug as she pulled you back to look at her face. She wore a smile on her face before she nodded. \"<span class=\"corange\">Brai! Braixen!</span>\" She said, almost in a cooing tone. You thought she was saying good job. She then pointed to you, then the sole again...then made a kiss motion with her face and a lick motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted you to kiss and lick her foot? You almost retched at the thought...but you didn't want to learn what a real punishment would be like from this fox pokemon either. She was holding your life in her hands, pretty literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had a smile, and she nodded at you before she used the leash to force you into her foot paw. You looked up and gulped...those toe claws looked awful sharp. You looked ahead to the furred flesh...if you did this, it was the ultimate degradation...pretty much admitting she owned you...but the alternative...</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t take a psychic to guess what she was saying though. You had only fulfilled half of her command. You still had to lick the soles of the massive creature. You briefly grimaced as you looked back at the paws. Unsurprisingly they had some dirt on them. It\u2019s not like she wears shoes or anything like that. Though the alternative flashed in your mind, you couldn\u2019t help but feel like you were going to regret this action. With that you stuck out your tongue and began licking your mistress\u2019 paw. The toes flinched a bit as they felt your wet muscle rubbing across them, picking up an odd dirty and salty taste. To Braixens credit, the paws could have been much worse for you, but that was only your secondary concern for now. At least you hoped this would mean she\u2019d take care of you.</span></div></div>",

It was a bit gentler than the previous tugs as a shadow enveloped your figure. You looked up to see furred fingers once again descending upon you, and soon they pinched you up, lifting you higher and higher to Braixen's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked quite pleased, as well as a bit smug as she regarded you in her grip. She dropped you into her free palm and leaned back a bit, against the cave wall. You sat in silence for a bit before you started to feel a bit of cold seep into you, it was still the night wind making its way into the cave you surmised. Braixen noted this and soon a wall formed behind you, blocking the wind. You looked back to see she had simply curled her fingers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" You said, she arched an eyebrow, as if expecting you to say more. It dawned on you what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...master...\" You said and she smiled wider before yipping again. She was laughing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Brai! Braixen!</span>\" She said in a happy tone as she got up, making your stomach lurch. She kept you in her hand, not even bothering to close it into a fist around you as she approached your bag. Opening it she fumbled through it with her free hand and you wondered exactly what she was doing. The last time she did this she got out that string that she'd tied around you...you hoped it wasn't anything terrible that she was pulling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she pulled out what looked to be...a bottle of water. Ah, she was thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Brai, Braixen!</span>\" She said as she looked at you again, she looked at the bottle, then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I am thirsty, thank you master?\" You said, hoping that's what she was asking. She rolled her eyes before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Brai!</span>\" She said, looking at the bottle, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Xen!</span>\" She then looked at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're...do you want to know how to open it?\" You asked and then she nodded. You sighed internally with relief. This was going to take getting used to in terms of learning what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just twist the top part of it, and it comes off.\" You said as you made the motion with your hands. Braixen nodded at this before she walked back to the wall, you in one hand and the bottle in the other, and sat down again. She set you in her lap as she went to open the bottle. As she did you licked your lips, truly thirsty. She managed to get it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Brai!</span>\" She let out happily as she started to chug it down. You paled...did she even intend to give you any water? You sat in her lap, almost feeling yourself want to cry before you felt a tug on your leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Braixen.</span>\" She said as she offered you the cap...it had a bit of water in it. looking at the cap was odd, it was a bit bigger than a dinner plate or bowl to your scale, and it had a bit of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" You said as you reached for it, but she pulled it back and she looked at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you master...\" You said, a bit hesitantly as she handed the cap to you, letting you take it. You started to greedily chug down the water as she looked down at her new pet, almost fully broken in.</span></div></div>",

Braixen was yawning, and to be honest you were feeling pretty tired as well. With a gentle tug of the leash, Braixen slowly made her way home, expecting you to keep up the pace and remain alongside her. Partway through the walk, you tried to hitch a ride on Braixen\u2019s paw. However, your owner was having none of that and with a quick tug you were removed from her leg and forced to walk once more. <span class=\"corange\">\"Brai!\"</span> she said sternly as she wagged a clawed finger while trying to scold her disobedient pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk wasn\u2019t particularly far, though you did struggle to keep up with your mistress\u2019 pace before she would tug at your leash once more. Never enough to harm you or trip you, but enough to send the message to hurry up. The aside from the cold hitting your exposed body, you were reminded of how much you relied on this fox monster, and how pathetic you were in comparison. Hell you were struggling to keep up with her walking pace, and based on her grin she was probably thinking about the same thing. Soon you reached your destination, a hole that presumably lead to her den or something of the sort. With another yawn, Braixen started to pet you once more. Despite the embarrassment you had to admit that this did feel nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you entered your new home, you were relieved by the relative warmth compared to being outside. Pulling out her stick, your mistress lit up the dark area revealing a small series of rooms she must have dug in the past. There were several twists, turns and presumably dead ends for security\u2019s sake, but your owner knew the way without a second thought. You realized that this little underground maze effectively killed your chances of escaping Braixen. There was probably no way you\u2019d be making your way out of this place alone. A grim thought, but one that you more or less accepted back when you licked her paws. Still, it was disheartening to see your faint hopes of a normal life be extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Braixen reached what you assumed was her living or sleeping quarters. It was a modest room some places to sit, eat, and rest. As the fox laid in her sleeping area, you felt your leash being tugged as she started pulling it in. You weren\u2019t sure what she wanted since she was so silent, but soon you found out what was going on. Driving her stick into the ground, Braixen started to tie her leash around it to secure you in place. Pleased with her work, she let out a lazy <span class=\"corange\">\u201dBraiiiix\u201d</span> before falling asleep. Through the limited lift you saw that you were stuck near her lower body. At best you could probably reach her legs if you tried to approach her. You felt tired but we\u2019re a bit hesitant. You could rest against her for added warmth and comfort, but you would be against her paws if you tried, more or less putting yourself in another demeaning position. Your alternative was to stay by the stick and rest there. It wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable, but maybe you could retain a shread of dignity through all this.</span></div></div>",

You breathed into your hands, hoping to warm up, but it wasn't doing much...her stick also wasn't burning anymore so you weren't going to get anything from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, hating yourself for what you were about to do...but honestly, you'd already thrown away your dignity the second you licked this fox's feet, and you didn't want to be this miserably cold anymore. You got up, walking your way towards Braixen's feet, as you felt a bit of heat radiate from them, her natural body heat. It wasn't much most likely, but to you it beckoned you forward as you laid down with you back and feet pressed against her black paw, feeling the leathery texture of it as it warmed you up from the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you then turned to lay your hands and chest into the paw, curling yourself into as much of a ball as you could around the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must've looked pathetic, but you didn't care anymore. What was there to really say or do, at this point you were at the whims of this wild pokemon, and she wasn't torturing you at the very least, so survival meant accepting your place in the world, right? If so you'd accept it while being as comfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts rang through your head as slowly you nodded off, allowing sleep to overtake you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen woke up with a bit of a yawn as she felt something resting against her paw. Groggily, she looked at her stick still in the ground, and the leash of her little pet human leading to her...paw. She looked down to see the tiny human sleeping, curled into a ball at her paw, trying to keep himself as close to it as possible. She found this both amusing and slightly adorable as she got a bit of a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't taking long at all to adjust to his new life she mused, as she pulled her paw away to see what he would do. He didn't seem to wake up...but he started to shiver in his sleep. So he had been cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen for her part got up with a yawn as she reached for her pet with a clawed finger, gently poking him to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part you felt a warm, furry surface pounding on your back, not hard enough to hurt, but enough to jolt you to wake up. You tried to get your senses about you before you heard a \"<span class=\"corange\">Braixen!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, your owner...it disturbed you a little to think how easily that thought came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at this goddess of a pokemon as she regarded you with a look of mischief before grabbing her stick and untying your leash from it. From there she picked you up with her furry palm and closed her fist around you. Both to help you warm up, and to remind you of your status in this world since you had no hope of breaking her grip.</span></div></div>",

Given that she was a fire type, she might have been actively trying to help warm you up. A reward for submitting yourself to her and accepting your role as her pet. Though this fact haunted you a bit, you didn\u2019t really care too much right now. For the most part you were thankful that your... owner (you still had trouble swallowing that one) for her show of kindness. A simple reminder that you could have ended up with much worse than her. Though you still wish she didn\u2019t openly enjoy teasing and demeaning you so much. Still, you counted your blessings and enjoyed the warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the paw opened back up, you saw her other hand holding her stick, which was producing a small flame nearby. You were quiet for a moment as your eyes adjusted to the surroundings. \u201cThank you... mistress.\u201d There was a trace of reluctance in your tone as you hit that final word, but the rest of it was clearly genuine. Braixen only smiled more in response and gently petted you with a finger before setting you on the ground. At first you were confused at her intention before she made a kissing motion and set her footpaw right in front of you. Not even awake for five minutes and she was already at it. You briefly made an annoyed face before quickly changing it, hoping she didn\u2019t notice. Though she didn\u2019t appear to react, Braixen did see your initial reaction. Unknown to you, she secretly liked that her pet still had some bits of fight left in him. But for now he was being obedient and accepting her superiority over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drew nearer her leathery toes wiggled in anticipation. You tried to force out any conflicting thoughts for now, fearing how your owner would react if you did anything she viewed as misbehavior. As you leaned in to kiss the toes, a strong odor seemed to radiate from them. You tried to hold your breath as you leaned in closer by suddenly the toes opened and grabbed your head, trapping you in place. The odor got stronger as you swear you heard the fox giggling overhead at your struggles. As you squirmed and pushed against the leathery digits you finally forced yourself free, coughing and gasping for air. As you recovered you looked up to see Braixen smirking overhead. You can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s just being playful or if she\u2019s planning something.</span></div></div>",

It was Braixen planning something you figured. You looked up only to gasp as her foot was raised above you, a slight frown on her face.

It reeked, and yet...it felt warm, and almost soft...until she started to apply a bit more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mistress...please...\" You croaked out as you felt more and more discomfort.

You were certainly feeling the pressure as she gently rolled you around. Honestly she wasn't even trying to be rough at all, it really took next to nothing on her part to keep her pet in line. She was blissfully unaware of the full extent of the situation though, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a wetness that was on her paw now. Her eyes slightly widened. Had she crushed you by mistake? She hoped not...she didn't want to lose her pet, and a small part of her would feel bad if that had happened too. She lifted her paw to see you panting. Then she looked at her paw to see a splotch of...white liquid...her face went to you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put one hand to your crotch to cover it, and the other to your face to hide your shame. You couldn't believe that this giant animal had just gotten you off...this was maybe the worst humiliation you'd suffered yet...and you now had no idea how she was going to react to this.

You felt so weak, in terms of your place in the world and in terms of stamina and how your bum felt, you didn't know if you would be able to keep up with whatever Braixen wanted. She didn't say anything to you, not that it would matter since you couldn't understand her words. The ground trembled a little bit to you as she started to walk, tugging at your leash as she did, forcing you to follow. You winced as you walked, the pain still quite fierce from your mistress...spanking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked at a pace that kept it hard to keep up, even if you were able to walk normal, which made it worse. Braixen was keeping an eye on you, and gently trying to tug to make you keep up. She did feel somewhat bad for you, and she could tell you were hurting, but she would NOT tolerate another instance of what happened this morning and that needed to be ingrained in her pet, both for her sake and his sake because if there was a next time...the punishment would be much more severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were watching the winding twists and turns around you, unable to keep a map in your head of where you had come from and where you were going. This Braixen was smart in terms of her den at least, no way she'd be found sleeping by any hostile pokemon or trainer that could catch her. After a bit though sunlight started to shine on you as you exited the den, with your towering mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a smile play on her muzzle as she saw the new day, and she looked down at you, only to frown. It was clear to see now that you were staggering and struggling to stay on your feet, quite tired, and very very dirty. She sighed as she saw the pathetic state of her pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how much longer you could walk before you felt the powerful gaze of the fire fox that held your life. She reached down with a paw and you gulped, not sure what she was going to do. You felt two fuzzy pincers pinch around your stomach and back, and you ascended into the air before you were dropped into a furry palm, a wince and grunt coming from you as your ass touched down, still raw from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked at you with a more neutral expression before she spoke. \"<span class=\"corange\">Braixen.</span>\" The tone didn't seem angry, and you had no idea what she intended by saying it the way she did, but she was carrying you now, something you greatly appreciated as she made her way through the forest...at a much quicker pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe many hills and rocked she went over so quickly made you assume she picked you up so you wouldn't slow her down at this point, and you were a little thankful you hadn't eaten for a bit because you would've had a hard time keeping your stomach down otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped onto the fuzz in her paw as much as possible, just trying to stay on board. Braixen for her part wasn't paying you much mind as she made for her destination, and after a few minutes it became clear where she was going.</span></div></div>",

You could feel her chest beating as she had you pressed to her chest, and could feel the plush fur tickling at your skin. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, especially the heat. You were still wary of this giant though, and more or less trying to comprehend everything that had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure if i'm okay, but yes, I am warm. T-thank you very much!\" You said before the Braixen smiled gently at you, looking almost harmless as she had her mouth shut, not showing you any of her razor sharp teeth. \"<span class=\"corange\">That's a bit of a relief, still though...you can understand me huh?</span>\" She said, still smiling and you hesitantly nodded. \"<span class=\"corange\">That's certainly different. A tiny human that can understand pokemon. What are you doing out here?</span>\" She asked as she pulled you away from her chest, still keeping you clutched in her furry fingers. You were lifted to her face as she examined you with curiosity. \"<span class=\"corange\">How did you end up like this?</span>\" She asked, somewhat curious before you shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know...I was hiking the normal trail of the forest, went off of the trail a bit and then...passed out and woke up like this.\" You said as she frowned at you. \"<span class=\"corange\">Just hiking huh? You're not a trainer?</span>\" She asked, a hint of suspicion in her voice. You shook your head vehemently at this. \"N-no, never been one. I just work in the town and enjoy hikes.\" She still had a bit of a suspicious expression before it softened. \"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm, well okay then. I didn't see any of those little red and white balls in your bag so i'll believe you.</span>\" She said. It was then that she reached for something and brought it towards you. It was a giant, brown, sweet smelling bar. A chocolate bar from your pack. It looked like it had already had a few giant bites taken out of it, probably by Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Here, you need to get something in your stomach. I gotta say, human food is really sweet.</span>\" She said, as she used the hand not holding you to hold it close. You gulped before you took a bite, finding it a little harder to break off with your reduced size, but still managed to get a bite. You took a few more bites before stopping and she set the bar down, before she presented a water bottle in front of you, this made you nervous as you felt like you could drown in it, but she kept control as it was brought to your lips, and she let you drink as much as needed, tilted enough to not overpower you. After this you sighed as she set the bottle down, cupping you in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well you're more than welcome to stay with me little human. I've been a bit lonely here and could use the companionship.</span>\" She said smiling, you frowned at this though. \"But I gotta get back to town, I have a job, a home...\" You said before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I don't know if giving you back to the humans would be the best option. No offense, but I know what your kind is capable of, and with a tiny human like you...I shudder to think what could happen.

You looked up, at the far distant, massive face of this Braixen, who was giving a gentle smile to you, and felt a pit in your stomach as you averted your eyes from her, looking down at the still far off ground of this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I don't want to be your pet.

Instead, you were considering to accept her demand simply because it offered you the best chances of survival in this new and enlarged world. You were tilted towards acceptance because by all means it could have been severely worse. You could have been eaten and lying in pieces in the belly of a wild Pokemon or be tortured by one that has a grudge against humanity, yet despite the odds you were found by a kind Pokemon with the desire to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, her insistence of you being a pet could definitely be seen as self-serving or selfish but she also showed a genuine kindheartedness about her. One of the first things she did after finding you was to take you somewhere safe, feed and hydrate you, after all. You could even feel it in her paws as she held and stroked you. Her grip and each brush of her finger was incredibly gentle which let you know she was very well aware of how vulnerable your new condition has left you, or rather how easily she could hurt you if she wasn't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you with a soft smile as she patiently waited for your input. Try as she might to come off as friendly and reassuring you still couldn't help but be downright intimidated by her size. A single flick of one of her fingers could break your rib-cage, or worse! And would she still be the same kindhearted Pokemon if you decline? You groaned, as much as you wanted to say no it absolutely was in your best interest to say yes and you were sure the Braixen knew that, too. \"I guess,\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen's ears perked up, almost looking surprised. \"<span class=\"corange\">You're fine with being my pet?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You quietly said. The admission kind of stung and you turned your face from her huge dark, orange eyes. Or at least you tried, Braixen simply turned your body in her paw until you were facing her again. The smile she kept was replaced with a worried frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It's not going to be that bad. I'll take care of you, remember?</span>\" The fire fox said. She gently eased you lower until you were sitting on the yellow fur of her 'skirt' around her hips, Braixen still resting her paw on your back so you don't fall or run off. You think she intended lowering you would make the environment feel more casual but it only succeeded in making her look bigger. \"<span class=\"corange\">I'm going to make it work.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, It'll be fine.\" You said, more to yourself than her. Braixen seemed to be content to just let you sit there for a while to perhaps let you get used to the size difference between them. She stared at you with warm regard and smiled before she lent back, still keeping a firm paw on your back to keep you sitting up. The two of you sat in silence for a while and you decided to focus your attention <i>away</i> from the giant Pokemon, quickly noticing you could hear the sound of soft rain. Turning your head you saw that you and Braixen were in a small dark cavern, although even by her standards it wasn't that roomy. It was open enough that you could see the forest and small droplets of rain falling down outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live here?\" You asked. There wasn't much else in the small cave besides your backpack she took and her stick which was letting out a small flame. Braixen gave your question a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">No, just hiding from the rain. It looked like it was going to rain when I was taking you home so I took you here just before you passed out. My home is <i>much</i> more cozier than this place, we can head out when it clears.</span>\" Braixen explained. The two of you sat in silence for a while and you were almost starting to enjoy the warm comfort her fur offered before she cheerfully spoke up. \"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, I wanna do something, want to play with me?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play?\" You asked, feeling skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well it's raining so I thought we should bond a little, y'know? I know your still adjusting but I think we should get acquainted sooner rather than later.</span>\" You could only give her an apprehensive look. What would 'playing' even entail? Braixen saw your uncertain look and turned her head away bashfully. \"<span class=\"corange\">Or we could just relax together or something? I mean I'd take you to my place to give you a tour but I don't want to go out in the rain, so that's out.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen wanted to play with you; how, you didn't know. You were considering going along with it and getting thrown into the deep end to hopefully get the whole 'pet' treatment out of the way off the bat. She also seemed a little reluctant to rush you so if you spoke up you might be able to relax with her instead, although you didn't know what that entailed either.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides that, the only other information that was running through your head was how you were too small to possibly get away from him or how easily you fit into his mouth. Still, nothing helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curious brown eyes were boring into you from above and you got startled as he lowered his head down to meet you. Instinctively you covered yourself with your arms and flinched as his cold nose nudge against you while it sniffed you. When it stopped you lowered your arms a little while the Vulpix simply regarded you, as if it was uncertain what to do with the miniature human he found. An ear of his drooped to the side for a moment before standing to attention again as it presumably came to a conclusion. Giving you no time to think, he reached down and grabbed you in his mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tossed about as the Vulpix  tried to fit you comfortably into its mouth and eventually your body was splayed across his flat tongue. There was little to no room and you could barely move a muscle as he held parts of your body down with pointed teeth. You let your body go limp as the Vulpix kept you pinned, desperately hoping he wasn't thinking of pressing those teeth down and chewing you up. For a while it felt like he was just tasting you and carefully moving you around his mouth until you began to feel gravity gently bobbing you up and down. His jaws parted for just a moment long enough to confirm that he was definitely on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf all goes well he won't eat you and decide to take you somewhere, somewhere you can hopefully find some type of solution to this crazy situation you found yourself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of waiting you eventually find that...</span></div></div>",

Wiping some of the excess saliva off yourself, you sat up and quickly tried to gain your bearings in the new unknown environment. From what you could see there were tree roots poking through a hard-pressed dirt roof in what seemed to be like an underground den of sorts. A fair amount of light was reflecting through the entrance which led to the surface, though at your stature the small incline was comparable to a large, steep hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore pressing, however, was how the amount of big brown paws surrounding you appeared to have doubled. From your low point of view you found yourself looking up at the two similar-looking Vulpix with their cheeks pushed against each other as they regarded you with curious fascination. The second one almost seemed in awe with how its jaws were parted slightly. The sight would have been cute if not for the terrible size difference. Averting your eyes from their gaze you decided to take a peak of the new Vulpix's underbelly. It lacked the equipment the boy Vulpix had so you could assume that this one was a female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a noise from behind startled you. It sounded like an amused hum and it caught the attention of the two curious Vulpix who were now looking up at something. Almost afraid of what you would see, you hesitantly turned around to the source of the noise. What you saw was a towering form of yellow fur looming over you. You weren't sure how it avoided your perception because in comparison to the two Vulpix, this Pokemon was utterly massive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo slender arms were crossed against a fluffy chest as it was laying on the ground. Its vulpine head was proudly held high and you found yourself craning back just so you could look up at the underside of its pointed muzzle. From how its face was angled you could only just see a red eye and white pupil looking down at you, and from how its mouth was angled into a small grin it was undoubtedly very amused at seeing you. You recognized that this Pokemon was the evolution of the Vulpix that captured you, a Ninetales. Just past the bulk of its form you could see the mass of fluffy tails sitting idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was waiting for you to notice it, the Ninetales began to move. Those arms it was keeping crossed at its chest rose over you until they were splayed out to the either side of you. With the two Vulpix on one side and the rest of the Ninetales on the other, its arms effectively walled you in as it moved its face down closer to you, still holding that amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to do. Or rather, if there was anything you <i>could</i> do at this point in time. What you assumed was the parent of the Vulpix duo looked very interested in the small human that was sitting in the middle of its den. Escape seemed impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief silence, the fox Pokemon began to speak.</span></div></div>",

You knew it was pointless to tell her you weren't a trainer, and just tried to escape. Vulpix just growled at this and swallowed again, taking in your ass and hands, pinning your arms to your sides. She lifted you up, smirking at your struggles as she ran her tongue over your ass. \"What's wrong, can't take the heat? This is nothing, you are going to melt like ice cream in my belly,\" she proclaimed as she took in your belly. This fact renewed your struggles, which unfazed Vulpix. She swallowed again, taking in your chest. She purred happily as she ran her tongue over your flesh. With another gulp, your head was in her maw. Vulpix slowly licked your face before gulping down your head. She belched and licked her lips while rubbing her gurgling gut.

But since none of your possessions seemed to shrink with you, Pikachu was easily able to see through your bluff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse took a deep breath before blowing air at you. The resulting gust was powerful enough to knock you back on your ass as the Pikachu\u2019s laughter boomed from above. You looked around desperately for any shelter. But where could you even go? Not bothering to think any further you tried to get back up and bolt for your bag. It might not keep Pikachu away, but at least it would prolong this a bit and hopefully give someone or something else a chance to show up and chase the Pikachu off.

It wasn't so far, you could make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You could make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow grew dangerously large and the air began carrying a very sweet scent mixed with a truly hideous stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You were not going to make it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and gritted your teeth, bracing yourself for the impact that was going to send you straight in the cold embrace of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inevitable happened. The impact came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet from the air faded, leaving only a disgusting smell assaulting your nose. You didn't find the courage to open your eyes - this must have been what hell smelt like. It was utterly weird: your upper body was in a warm, moist and squishy place while your lower felt weightless and cold. Was this what hell was like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were wondering what did you do in life to deserve all of this, a deep moan resonated around,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Piii...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened instantly as your fears of being crushed turned out to be unwarranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it didn't mean your situation wasn't one to dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgently, you realized that you had gone straight up that hole you had been gazing at earlier, and that it was slowly consuming you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you, the voice of the Pikachu echoed blissfully as she moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... H-Hey!\" you screamed, the hideous smell violating your mouth too as your legs beginning flailing helplessly outside of the anus,<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response of the rodent was another moan. This wasn't her original plan, but it felt wonderful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning blissfully as she sat on the grassy forest floor, the yellow mouse clenched her anus, causing more of you to be sucked inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperation overtook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempted to push yourself back out, you tried to grip the slick, fleshy floor of the inside of Pikachu's rear, but the walls were far too slick and your hands slid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the rectum itself was trying to stop any progress; it was like a ravenous, perverted beast, trying to feed on you, knowing that it would bring great pleasure to its master, who in turn showed no signs of wanting to let you out of your new, cruel and smelly entrapment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour waist was sucked up too, the Pikachu's moans causing the slick walls to vibrate while her butt-hole consumed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClench-unclench, clench-unclench, clench-unclench, like a powerful Arbok's maw would with a yummy but way-too-big prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were up your knees now, and all hope was beginning to wane just like the clean air from your lungs, which was rapidly being replaced with the rank smell of the rectum, which was oddly breathable. You didn't know if to take that as a blessing or a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Pi! Pika!</span>\" moaned your captor from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow mouse was ecstatic right now; her tail swinged back and forth, her feet flailed and her tiny fists clenched while a blush spread across her already red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">C-Chu...</span>\" she moaned again, feeling more of the body of her human prey slide into her rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care how the critter got so small nor if he needed any help; perhaps she was going to take a better look at them later, but for now she wasn't going to let this opportunity go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of bottom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Piii-ka...</span>\" she moaned one last time, clenching her butt-hole as she felt the human's feet slide inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anus opened and closed repeatedly after the sudden insertion, as if rejecting its latest \u2018meal\u2019; but, as Pikachu began growing used to the foreign feeling of having something - or rather someone - up her butt, her hole clenched for the last time, before closing definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer prey was consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness was all you could see, meaning that you couldn't actually see anything. The smell burned stung your nose, burned your eyes, violated your mouth. If possible, you were quite sure it was crawling its way into your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the smell was only the tip of the iceberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was unbearable, the rectum awfully tight; the rectal muscles clenched around you quite hard, the Pikachu moaning in sheer bliss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing to get out as soon as you could, you tried to crawl around to get back to the anus, but every little movement you made caused the muscles to clamp down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsteat of getting closer to the way you came in, you urgently discovered, you were being dragged even deeper inside the smelly cave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sticky, slick and squishy flesh even rubbed against a certain, exposed organ of yours, causing it to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously - your were growing aroused!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what's gotten into you, you doubled the efforts to try to crawl back to the anus, your squirming making the giant rodent you were trapped in moan harder, but not allowing you to make any progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in defeat as you laid into the tight rectum, realizing that there was no way out of her unless Pikachu was willing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If</i> she ever willed it...</span></div></div>",

You had no way of escaping and by now any attempts at movement at all were thwarted by the walls closing in around you. You were stuck here, with no light and just the overpowering heat and smells of Pikachu\u2019s cavern to set off your senses at all. On the outside you occasionally heard Pikachu moaning or making other sounds as the walls rubbed against your naked body some more. You had given up on resisting them by now. Even if you hadn\u2019t you didn\u2019t have the strength left to try. In the complete darkness, you had absolutely no sense of time whatsoever. You could have been in here for several days, or maybe it was just an hour. You thankfully didn\u2019t have to share your space with any of Pikachy\u2019s past meals so you had one small blessing to count in this absolute hell of a life you were trapped in as a giant rodent\u2019s butt toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the walls closed in more. You felt a strong pressure building above your head. You dreaded that you were about to lose that single blessing right then and there, but you soon noticed this was differant. Nothing come or pressed against you. Well nothing solid at least. Instead all you get with the pressure growing stronger. The walls and muscles seemed to be changing. Now they seemed to be pushing you back towards the exit rather than deeper into her rectum. Was she about to let you out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Pikachu had grabbed your bag and taken it and you to a secluded area of the woods. No predators would reach the two of you here, making this the perfect place to enjoy her new toy. Getting into position, the yellow rodent grunted as she tried to force the passenger out of her. A small fart sounded as a bit of the air forced its way outside while she tried to get the rest of the contents back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise erupted around you causing the walls to vibrate. What would otherwise be a small fart was completely earth shattering to you. The foul stench managed to get even worse, but you quickly noticed the silver lining as you get a cold breeze reach your feet. You were starting to exit her rear. Maybe she was planning something but anything was preferrable to being trapped in here as far as you cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu let out a quick gasp as she felt your tiny form beginning to poke its way out of her. The feeling was unlike anything she had ever experienced before. So so tingly, so relieving, so wonderful. A blush formed as she felt you wiggle a bit once more, presumably from the first fart hitting you. Slowly she felt the hole widen as the rest of your body was forced out of it, needing to compensate for your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of your body felt the comforting breeze of the outside world. The chill was definitely comforting compared to the overwhelming heat from within your captress. Finally you were ejected from your prison, gasping for fresh air, though it was still prettty tainted by the stenches escaping her ass along with you. As you laid beneath her you saw the hole closing up, thankful that you were watching this from the outside this time around. The hole shifted away as the massive Pikachu turned around to see her catch. At first she seemed a little embarrassed at everything that just transpired, but then she started to grin. You had no clue what was going on before you followed her eyes and noticed that you still had an erecting from all the grinding. Ohhh crap. You quickly try to cover it up but the mouse easily pushes them aside and kept them pinned with a finger as she examines your embarrassing stiffy. Did her pet enjoy his little ride. Or maybe something else set this off. Whatever the reason, she was going to enjoy this. </span></div></div>",

If only you could dig your way underground or hide in between some roots, maybe you could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Pika!</span>\" your captor exclaimed, causing you to snap back to attention and look at her again... only to notice she was no longer staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr better, she was, but you quickly noted that her face and head had, once more, risen to heavens while you were left staring at a familiar, heart-shaped tail and a wrinkled hole...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you exclaimed while the giantess, noticing she had your attention again, began to lower her rear back on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLest you were going to end up getting pushed up Pikachu's behind again, you tried to back off while the humongous rear descended towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No no no, not again, not again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily tried to stand back up to run and avoid the incoming butt, but the furry behemoth was far too fast for you. Like t did before, the shadow grew larger as it approached your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even knew it, the rear came back on you once more, once again assaulting your nose with that hideous smell from before mixed with the sweet scent of the Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you could see your own self being sucked up inside Pikachu's bottom for the second time in less than an hour, but you realized it was just your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, noticing you were snugly wedged between the giantess' butt and nethers, which dripped with anticipation on your lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure you were being subjected to wasn't enough to kill you, but was far more than enough to keep you in place and unable to move while all your senses were overwhelmed; all you could see, hear, feel and smell was the bottom of the rodent, who wiggled her butt in place, her tail wagging happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu moaned a deep \u2018<i>Chaaa</i>\u2019 of satisfaction - her latest catch made a great cushion for her behind, which was used to the hard, cold forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it made any difference, but it still felt quite good to have something so small under there. Not to mention it was quite... arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu could feel every little movement you made, and she loved the sensation she got from it; you struggled, an electric shock traveled across her body, causing her tail to stop in place and her ears to shiver, her body to quiver and crotch to pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, she felt concerned lest, if she was pleasured too much she'd let out a massive amount of electricity, frying her little pet alive; but her worry was soon replaced by pleasure again as the human beneath her butt kept uselessly struggling to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the yellow giantess grew aroused, you noted the weird mix of horrible and sweet scents growing stronger along with your captor's arousal, working its way in your system through your mouth, which you tried to keep shut close, not wanting it anywhere near the Pikachu's bottom, and your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickening sweet of her nethers and the horrible, unbearable smell of her bottom invaded your nostrils, though the bad smell was a little stronger due the farts the rodent had let out before when she let you out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream for the yellow giantess to let you out, but as soon you opened your mouth, it was invaded by the yellow fur of her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhhh!\" your muffled scream echoed under the Pikachu as you spat out the fur, disgusted, your mouth violated and your stomach twisting violently at the idea of what just entered your oral cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess whose butt you were trapped under giggled, enjoying the activity of the little human in his current, cruel entrapment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks grew redder than they already were as she let a small, nearly inaudible fart slip out, straight on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed as the foul stench assaulted you point blank, burning your eyes and stinging your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only caused you to double the efforts to break free, but you struggled uselessly against the giantess' butt; might as well try to fight a legendary barehanded, you mused, but you had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the giantess felt annoyed enough, she was going to stand up; punish you for sure, but anything was better than this!... Except maybe for a trip to her stomach, which would be much worse than your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle you did know, Pikachu was nowhere near to being annoyed; it was the exact opposite, your squirming only made her moan in pleasure as you tickled her sensible butt and crotch, which began growing wetter each minute that passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the smell the giantess began growing so strong that you could no longer bear it; it crawled its way inside your lungs, causing your eyes to water in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Pikachu didn't stand up soon, you were going to pass out, and who knew what she'd do to you then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your prayers were soon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the pressure around you waning all of a sudden; the smell lingered around you for a second, like a powerful aura, before it was blown away by a cool breeze, allowing you to breathe air. <i>Normal, fresh, wonderful</i> air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relief was however short-lived as the yellow rodent you were apparently stuck with once more filled your whole view with her entire, towering being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you tried to back off, but you lacked enough strength to do so; and it was so that Pikachu could easily grab you and sit back down where you once were, grinning at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Pika-chaa!</span>\" she chimed, though you couldn't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please... just let me go...\" you begged, not caring if it meant being alone, lost and eventually at the mercy of some other giant pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the electric rodent had no intention of letting you go, and she expressed it with another grin appearing on her frightening - though admittedly cute - face while she giggled lowly, suggesting you what Pikachu was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun had only just begun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just like in any movie, time seemed to slow down as the shadow around you became larger. However, you were well aware that it was in reality just something above drawing nearer, and you knew that 'something' had a heart-shaped tail and yellow fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant before the impact, you turned around to see the Pikachu giantess carelessly dropping tummy-down towards where you were standing, arms spread wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to scream. And, the moment you did, a yellow monolith came crashing down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream never left your mouth, silenced by a mouthful of yellow fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened, and you wondered if you were still alive. You assumed you were, since you could still feel the immense pressure you were being subjected to. You could feel that pretty well, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow fur was the only you could see, feel, smell, <i>taste</i>. It was a miracle you had survived the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this new size of yours rendered you more sturdy, but you had no wish to stay here more and find out the practical way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here, though it would be no simple task: you couldn't move properly, and could barely even breathe. If your stay under the Pikachu's belly would grow prolonged, then you weren't going to get out from under it alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the electricity in the air, emanated by the same fur of the giantess. Of course, there was a good risk she'd to give you a playful shock, frying you alive. That was the worst case scenario, which, you decided, you didn't want to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout many options at you disposal, you did the only thing you could do right now: you began squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure where this would bring you. Surely not out of here, though it was worth a shot. Maybe you were going to annoy the rodent giantess so much she was going to let you out in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the outcome was the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess you were trapped beneath, she suddenly felt a tickle under her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to figure out what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu smiled, the began giggling as she felt the sensation growing the more the human under her tummy squirmed to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with him being stranded in the middle of her belly, the effort was quite pointless; not only that, he was pinned between her belly and the grass which, albeit saving his life from the impact he received, also kept him from getting away. Which was pretty good, since Pikachu had no intention of letting you go anytime soon, if she was going to let you go at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubted she wanted to. And why should have she? Humans kept Pokemon as pets all the time, what was the harm if the roles were swapped for just one time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made Pikachu's smile grow wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickle grew stronger as you squirmed more and more, and the urge to flip on her back grew just as strong, though Pikachu was able to keep herself from accidentally freeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your squirming soon came to an end, when you realized that it was bringing you nowhere. It wasn't exactly surprising to you, but it was still disappointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out another way, or you were going to run out of air under here, risking death from asphyxiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really had to stop thinking about your potential deaths, because all it did was daunt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of lingering on such line of thinking, you focused more on how to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you could shift on your belly so you could try to crawl out of here, that'd be great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you began squirming again, this time to get on down on your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, your efforts were paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to move on your belly, though the hardest part had yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your elbows on the ground, you tried to lift the tons of heavy yellow fur with your back. You needed to in order to crawl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an immense effort to lift the belly of the Pikachu a little bit, and it was even harder to crawl an inch forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of doing this, you could feel your elbows hurting, and you were not even sure of how much progress you had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Pikachu, she was not amused anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour movements underneath her were barely felt now, and she was growing bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been more fun when she felt you struggling, tickling her, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the awkward situation, a grin crawled across Pikachu's face as she figured this was only the tip of the iceberg.

And where was the Zorua?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn confusion, you began stumbling around, not believing what you were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt more and more confused as you kept walking in circles, trying to figure out was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, the grass around you sprang to life as it began moving. Blades of grass wrapped around your wrists and ankles, entangling you. You screamed in terror as you began struggling to break free, but the grass was too strong for you to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt coiled around your waist and neck, like a hungry Arbok would with its meal. You uselessly tried to break free, but the the grass didn't relent. At some point though, it finally loosened a bit, and you took the opportunity to finally free your arms and legs, before using them to free the rest of your body and starting to run off in a fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was happening!? Was your shrinking bad enough!? Now nature itself was trying to kill you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran aimlessly, just trying to get away from the grass, when you bumped into a soft yet firm wall that caused you to be sent flying backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou painfully landed on your back and dizzily looked up, your vision blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it cleared though, you noticed that the sky and clouds were back to normal... weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did you bump into? You were sure that there wasn't anything where you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat familiar snicker interrupted your train of thought; you sat up, noticing the giant figure of a black fox staring straight at you, a mischievous grin on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zorua you met before! The nasty fox just pranked you by scaring the hell out of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you cried in anger, and a bit of fear, though mostly anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Zorua simply shot the same grin again as it began walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou anger waning, you tried to crawl backwards, away from the malicious fox, but it leaped in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, as it did, you caught a glimpse of the pokemon's crotch... and blushed furiously as you noticed that this fox was, in reality, a vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the sight, you didn't realize until it was too late that th Zorua had leaped straight onto you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red paw quickly pinned you down into the dirt while it caused you to scream in pain from the force of the impact. You felt like all your bones were about to snap like a bunch of matchsticks, but the Zorua didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she began toying with your naked body under her paw for a bit, rolling you under her toes and paw-pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when you began to feel like you were being crushed by a heavy truck, the Zorua stopped to lower her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, from her expression, you could tell what her intentions were.</span></div></div>",

You whimpered as you saw the face getting closer and closer, you laid back expecting the worse, but all you got was a soft chuckle from the giant pokemon as her warm breath washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I got you good!\" You heard her exclaim in an oddly feminine voice. Wait...you could understand her. \"That look on your face when you came out of that bag! Ha!\" She had an oddly friendly grin as she said all this, and she gave you a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-w-\" You were stuttering, and she lowered her face even more, that maw of her descending as you tried once again to crawl back, only to wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa little guy, relax, i'm not gonna eat ya, I was just having some fun!\" The Zorua said, stopping you with a paw, pinning you effectively, though much more gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you jump on me?\" You asked, wincing and the Zorua grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure scared you didn't it? Relax, I knew I wouldn't crush you, I was in complete control.\" She said and you groaned as your head rested against the cold ground, she felt you shudder and shiver a bit under her paw and lifted it again, bringing her muzzle down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the deal, i've never seen a human as tiny as you before, or one that could understand pokemon either, what happened?\" She asked, curiosity in her eyes and you looked into those giant pools and shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know, I just woke up like this after getting dizzy and passing out. I hid in my bag when you came along...\" You said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.

You stammered a bit as this colossus was leaving you here! You looked to the distance as she moved, her pink slit in full view, you blushed, but cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" You cried out between shivers and she stopped, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't l-leave me here...\" You said, clearly cold and scared and she looked at you a bit sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?

She sighed as she looked at you. You felt booms as her giant form came closer and closer, her face regarding you once more. She looked you over then spoke.</span></div></div>",

Help me out here!  I don't know this area, I-I don't know how long I can survive on my own!\"  Her face turns skyward as she gazes into the darkness, pondering her options.  Dread washes over you as a familiar grin comes across her face, a mischievous look shines through her watery eyes as she stoops to your level.  \"Too bad I'm not that nice.\"  The black fortress of fur raises her head and takes one massive step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  She's... leaving?  Without you?!  Your throat clogs up, but you manage to choke out a pathetic \"But... I need help...\"  She turns her head toward you.  \"Yeah, well, good luck with that!  You're not getting any help from this Pokemon.\"  She pounds her chest for emphasis, obviously trying not to laugh, but abandoning the notion after a few short coughs devolve into a giggle fit, as if she couldn't get a hilarious idea out of her mind.  \"See ya!\"  With a swish of her tail, she takes off, fading away until all that remains is the faint sound of her snickering laugh.  Alone again...  You let your head sink back to the ground.  What are you going to do now?  She might've been your only salvation, and she just... abandoned you!  And she seemed like an alright Pokemon, too...  Maybe she just didn't want to deal with you...  A freezing gust of wind blows over you, stinging your teary eyes.  Can't do anything at night...  You slowly pick yourself up and head back to your makeshift camp.  Hopefully, it's still warm in there...  <br>\r\n............................................................................ ................................................................................ <br>\r\nYour ears and fingers are numb by this point, you didn't run this far away from the bag...  Did you?<br>\r\n............................................................................ ................................................................................ <br>\r\nYour movement is now a zombie-like drag of your legs.  Unable to feel even your feet against the ground, it's a wonder you don't just collapse under your own weight.  The only thing you can think of is that -freaking- smirk on the Zorua's face before she left you to die...  It's just enough to bring you another micro-human's length further.  However, you still haven't found any trace of your bag...  Was it even in this direction?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother gust of wind rushes over you, and with a gutteral noise, you pitch forward onto your face.  Doesn't matter anymore.  Your frozen muscles can't even lift your head up to look around.  Some hiking trip this turned out to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi little guy!  Didn't expect to see anyone your size tonight.\"  Someone's talking...  Female, you think.  You try to respond, but only manage a weak \"Gahh...\"  The voice returns, much closer now.  \"You've got some serious balls, sleeping out in open here, I almost stepped on you, y'know.\"  As much as you try, you can't make any more noise.  \"You alright, dude?  I'm still waiting for a response here...\"  You can suddenly see the starry sky again as you are flipped over.  There's a shooting star...  \"Jeeez, you're dead cold, dude!  You're not... actually dead, are you?!  ...No, he's still breathing.

Even with her trying to make it easy for you it was a trek. With a shiver you approached her and reached out a hand, feeling her fur...it was warm, and soft. It instantly felt good on your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are cold little guy.\" You heard her say, and even felt it through your contact with her, the slight movements of her body being all too noticeable at your scale. She must've been able to feel you better now as you firmly gripped her fur, getting ready to climb her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put both hands on her torso and started to make your ascent. You grunted, finding it at least easy to keep stable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for her part was staying as still and patient as she could, though found it difficult.

You weren't going to die. When she started moving though, the wind started to chill you once again, you swore it was going to be the end of you.

Fear runs through you when she opened her maw, telepathically saying, \"wriggle for me.\" With that, she popped your feet into her maw, running her tongue over your heels and between your toes, smirking at your panicked struggles. How fitting, the 'useless' Rattata caught a human, and this human will be sludge, and then rat fat. She slurped down a portion of your legs, smirking as she felt your feet touch the back of the throat. \"feel that? that's your demise,\" she taunted, slurping down the rest of your legs and taking in your rear end. You wriggle in disgust as her tongue got every inch of your ass. She swallowed again, flipping you over to lap at your belly, letting go with her tail. \"So delicious, I think I found a new meal,\" she taunted as she swallowed again, taking in your chest. \"Just a little bit more, then you will melt,\" she said, taking in your taste. Rattata swallowed again, taking in your head. The purple rat smiled as she slowly ran her tongue over your face before swallowing again, sending you to her belly. She belched and licked her lips, smiling at your pathetic struggled, your form melting. A few minutes later, Rattata belched again and stood up, giving her plump ass a shake before scampering off.</span></div></div>",

You look at it through your little sock bed as it takes an apple right next to you. You gulp, as the Goodra takes your apple and removes it's head from the backpack. Great, there goes your breakfast, but at least the Goodra didn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like it read your mind, you feel the bag shaking again, as the Goodra shoves it's head back into the insides of the sack. You watch it again, as it looks through your stuff again, but then you and it lock eyes. You panic, and descend into the sock, hoping it might forget about you, but no such luck exists, as you feel the sock get pulled out of the sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see a purple hand coming down on you, covered with some weird goo. You are pulled out of the sock to the morning wind, sending shivers up your spine. Your vision is encased with the face of a giant slug dragon, it's face showing expressions of curiosity. You look down, and stare grimly at how far you are from the ground, but you also notice that the Goodra is a female, judging from the slit on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a slimy muscle hit your face, as the Goodra licks you. You wipe of the saliva off your face, as you look at the Goodra. You noticed her expression changed as she looks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's not a good sign, you think, as you try to wiggle of the hand's grasp, but as you look down at the ground, you realize that you'd die if you dropped at the height you are at. You look back at the Goodra to see her maw open, ready to take you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goodra throws you inside her mouth, as you land on her soft but wet tongue. She then closes her mouth, leaving you in complete darkness. The air around you smells of morning breath and apples, as the Goodra makes a high pitched noise, like she's pleased with your taste. The tongue then presses on the roof of the mouth, squeezing the breath out of your lungs. You feel the tongue rub you on the top, as you are suckled and covered in the dragon's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops suckling you, as you gasp for air, but you break is short lived, as the Goodra moves your body over to her molars. You brace yourself, expecting for you to crushed by the pearly whites, but instead, you are softly chewed on. It's not enough to cut your skin, but it does feel irritating on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the tongue move you back to the center of the mouth as it suckles on you again. It, luckily, doesn't last as long as it did before, but you notice that the tongue starts to go on an incline. You grab onto it, as it tries to lean you over toward its throat. You look down at it, as it swallows a bit of saliva with a big gulp. You gulp yourself, as you realize that you are slipping towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to climb up the slick muscle, but the tongue was a bit too slippery. You feel your heart sink, as you see the dark abyss ready for your arrival. You close your eyes, as you feel yourself being...</span></div></div>",

You then feel a heavy pull, as the muscles around you press onto you and send you into the esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are squeezed and assaulted by the slick tissue that surround you as you delve deeper into the dragon's body. You try your best to maybe get a grip on the pulsating walls to maybe get the Goodra to hack you up, but you can't seem to get a good enough grip. Soon, you go into a free fall, and land in a spacious room with the stench of fruit, other known as the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bang on the walls of the stomach, wanting an out on this whole mess, but all that gets you is a happy hum from the Goodra, as she lets out a little burp. Knowing that there is no way out of the situation that you are in, you sit down and rest your head on one of the soft stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you start to notice a weird viscous liquid coming from the walls of the stomach. Your heart sinks, because it could only be one thing, stomach acid. You proceed to bang on the walls some more, begging to be let out, but that causes the Goodra to shake her belly. The world around you vibrates violently, which makes you fall down into a pile of half digested fruit and acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice...</span></div></div>",

The whole interaction with the Goodra made you forget how cold it really was at the moment, but, with the added saliva from the Goodra's lick, You feel like you're freezing to death. The Goodra, luckily, notices as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Goo?</span>\" You hear her say, before you pass out due to extreme coldness. When you wake up, you feel warmth around you, as you see the Goodra's soft purple belly fill your vision with her arms around your back holding you close to her, effectively covering you in slime, and keeping you warm. You look up at the Goodra looking ahead, not really realizing that you are awake. You also feel that the Goodra is moving somewhere, but where exactly, you have no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goodra, after a few minutes of walking, looks down at you and sees that your awake. \"<span class=\"clilac\">Goo!</span>\" You hear her excitedly shout, as you feel her press your body onto her belly, taking the breath out of your lungs. You start to struggle as you have trouble trying to breathe. The Goodra, feeling your squirms, realizes that she is hugging a little too hard, and releases the pressure from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath of fresh air, as you look up back at the Goodra. You see she has a worried expression looking down at you. She then looks forward, continuing her walk, with a more saddened expression on her face. You press your own body on her belly, basically giving her a hug back, but in a smaller scale, which the Goodra smiles at the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of walking, the Goodra reaches her destination.

Try to write something of substance at least. I will delete chapters at my discretion if you fail to meet this outside of choice chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow either being able to understand or not understand the Pokemon, but if you can understand them it's a result of being shrunken down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prefer female Pokemon, but I will allow male interaction as well. The pokemon in question are not pokemorphs, they are wild pokemon but have the appropriate sexual organs of their gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive allows for any scenario from innocent to sexual, unaware to aware, gentle to violent. Try to keep consistency or if something changes in the dynamic between the human and pokemon interaction, try to justify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character can change size again, bigger or smaller, and you can explain the circumstances as you wish. He will start at around 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere can be minimal human interaction, but only in service to the pokemon and tiny main human in the story. Keep the focus there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will be awarding 1000 gift points per substantial chapter added until I run out of gift points.</td>",
