No gore - not \"no death\", but don't be too descriptive and gross about it. Also, do not abruptly end chapters. <br>\r\n2. No one sentence chapters after the initial choice chapters, if you please.<br>\r\n3. This is not a growth story, as such please keep it focused on shrinking characters and interactions.<br>\r\n4.

Behind closed doors, this invite-only club gets up to who knows what involving strange lights and strange noises. This club is...The Shrink Club! Touting Shrink rays which never leave the club building, urban legends can only guess what crazy things occur behind their locked doors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters: <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Britney <br>\r\nOne of the first club members, Britney is a rather eager girl with poofy C-cup breasts and a winning personality. She enjoys mischief and shrinking her boyfriend, David, on the daily. She is occasionally jokingly referred to as \"The perfect girl\" by everyone. Proud of her chocolate skin and creativity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0David<br>\r\nOne of two token \"shrinkees\" on the club, David doesn't stick up for himself very well. He's the submissive boyfriend of the typical much-larger-than-him Britney, whom he shares a charmed relationship with, even if she is totally the one in charge. Likes food at all sizes. Dislikes being shrunken, but you'll never hear him complain about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marvin<br>\r\nA fat short glassed nerd. This tech whiz inexplicably has it in with the ladies, as he is the developer of most of the S. Club's tech. He's also the one that makes sure folks get their privacy once night-time comes and people want to make the house shake. Pretty well liked, and doesn't get shrunk that often. Not that those two are in any way linked. \"Club superhero\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sally and Suzy<br>\r\nTwins with a serious domination streak, they're rarely seen apart, and are responsible for most of the club's new invites. They have connections, on top of matching curvy figures. Their shared favorite member to shrink is Tino, whom they take turns with. Dye their hair every third week and choose each other's clothes in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tino<br>\r\nThe class president doesn't really like attention. He gets an excess of it for being in an invite-only club by the Student Council, and he also gets just as much if not more attention from the twins Sally and Suzy, who practically own him like property by this point. Tall and thin with a black bowl haircut. Should visit the gym more often, but can't get away from the twins enough to get into a routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gary<br>\r\nPicture the perfect man in your head. Gary is better than that man. Pretty loyal, pretty studly, pretty popular, and just plain pretty pretty. Gary volunteers at the campus nurse office, and is the one who makes sure nobody gets hurt under normal circumstances. Is the closest thing the club has to a token giant, and has a perpetual tan. Voted most likely to be the one \"Sharp Dressed Man\" is about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kim<br>\r\nToken shrinkee #2, Kim flirts (and sleeps) around. She's a blonde who likes to get what she wants, and in this case, \"what she wants\" is to play around with men while she's shrunk. Nothing to write home about in terms of assets, but outrageously confident and forward. Somehow has won ten perfect attendance awards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add any characters you think would fit in this story, and if they're good I'll add them to this list.</td>",
