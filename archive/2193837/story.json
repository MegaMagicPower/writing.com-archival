Her stomach gave a few quarrelsome grumbles but she pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon the white and black striped mare came to a clearing where she was overjoyed to see her family enjoying themselves.Her daughter Lorenda was biting into a candy watermelon. Devin was blowing bubbles from the gum balls that grew on a nearby bush. Her Niece Regina was busy devouring a life-sized gummy bear. And even dear brother Alph was managing to sample from a bowl of chocolates with candy shells as he read a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria smiled at the scene and then dove at a rock the was a massive marshmallow, wrapping her arms around it as she began to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK, KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kria it's time to get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness winced and groaned as the dream faded in an instant and she found herself hugging and chewing on her own pillow. Spitting out a couple loose feathers she yawned and stretched as she enjoyed the comfort of her bed. \"Ngh, no it's not,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it is,\" came Devin's voice through the door, \"Come on, you've four meetings, six conference calls, and a hostile takeover scheduled for today. And you wouldn't want to be late for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria hated to admit she really wouldn't. That was the best part of her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing her matted red mane of hair from her eyes she reluctantly climbed out of bed. As she made her way to the bathroom and a shower, she deliberately avoided looking in the mirror or at the scale on the floor. She didn't need reminders of her ...situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Devin seemed all too keen to remind her as he stepped into the bedroom after she'd closed the bathroom door behind her. \"I've already got your breakfast ready. a bowl of plane oatmeal with a dab of honey for flavor and a bran muffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria grit her teeth as she turned on the shower, determined to try and drown out his words. But she couldn't deny the sight of her own figure as she began to soap up. Her once concave and toned middle was looking soft and round as it pushed out slightly from her front. Her hips and rear too had gained a noticeable couple inches in their diameter. She'd already had to replace her work suit twice and paid the tailors extra to ensure they kept their mouths shut (A promise they wouldn't even <i>have</i> a shop anymore if they blabbed was also implied).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria hated to admit it, but the fact of the matter was the demoness had put on a few pounds lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had raised an issue she considered as she washed in the warm waters of her morning shower. Normally she would not care what others thought. She'd been seen to chase after ice cream trucks in her nightgown for the delicious treats. If she actually concerned herself with anyone else's image of her then she'd have to go out and kill a few beings who were talking smack about her and that could lead to all sorts of bureaucratic red tape. She might have been the unofficial 'protector' of the city state of Zinvith, but that didn't give her <i>'carte blanche'</i> when it came to deciding the fates of every living creature in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever on the other hand she had heard the beginning of whispers about her new pounds, rumors she was going soft. And given she was up nearly twenty pounds from her former slim size she couldn't deny her body was even if her mind was as sharp as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the shower Devin was waiting for her with fresh clothes. The blue furred undead feline looked fairly good considering his usual physical state. The preservative magics that kept him animate had fairly well preserved his body. There was nothing 'unpleasant' showing nor any bad smells, save for a slight musty scent of sawdust that packed his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline smirked and tactfully averted his black eyes with golden pupils as Kria finished drying and began getting dressed. \"I know it's not as nice a meal as say pancakes and bacon, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devin, don't. Just don't.\" Kria sighed, \"Just because you don't have to eat doesn't mean you get to tease me. Maybe next time you're asleep I'll stick a large weather balloon in your torso and fill it with water. See how you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be fairly impressive considering I don't need sleep either,\" he replied with his usual snark, \"But fine, a change of subject. You're planning a hostile takeover today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Kria sighed with a small smile despite her bra pinching slightly as she did up the clasps, \"One of the few pleasures of running the biggest company in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No deaths I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if they won't accept it peacefully. I'm sure a few won't but I'm hoping I can pay them off instead. Not that I wouldn't enjoy a good fight once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about your only form of exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin politely coughed as Kria glared at him before hastily moving on. \"So just what company are you conquering today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: A unconventional candy factory. Think something out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Plenty of weird inventions and possible ways for Kria to get fat or expand in other forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: An advanced technology company, specializing in helpful robots or matter manipulation, creating food or tireless workers that could bring her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A experimental chemical lab. Working on powerful formulas that a careless sip of which could cause drastic changes to Kria's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: A shipping company, specializing in trade of exotic (and likely magical) foreign foods and objects.</span></div></div>",

You said that we are going for a family outing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina groaned, clearly irritated by her cousin. \"Oh, stop being such a wimp,\" she said, \"Embrace your inner demon for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No!\" said Lorenda firmly, \"I will not harm an innocent person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" Kria barked before are argument could break out, \"Listen, Lorenda, this IS a family outing. I didn't lie to you. It's just a family rampage, that's all. As for harming anyone, my sources tell me that the place is probably ran by magic or machines, which means that we will be fighting soulless, mindless things. No one with any personal lives will be harmed....but, if you don't want to....I guess you can leave then. You don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenda sighed and said, \"No, I'll come along.

Kria quickly gave them the details of the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we take storm this faculty?\" asked Alph, \"Do we do it strategically, or do we go go weapon swinging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria grinned. \"You know the answer to that one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed Alph did, much to his irritation.</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed to be edible, from the gingerbread houses to the licorice trees. There was even giant versions of existing sweets, like giant gummy bears and chocolate bars.

And this was nothing like any rampage she'd ever wanted to be on. Granted she was technically grounded from any rampaging for fifty years after an 'incident' some time back, but that was only solo. Here was her chance to rampage with Kria and the whole things was turning into more of a 'business trip / whimsical adventure'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina might have had a few plush toys but even this was pushing the limits of her saccharine tolerance levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her wanderings she eventually made her way down to the river. She could tell even from a distance it was liquid milk chocolate. Looking around there was no sign of the rat that had brought them to the room. Off vanished to do something somewhere else most likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little nasty Regaina kicked a candied rock into the bubbling brown liquid with a 'splunk'. Then tossed in a plush toy sized gummy bear. She was just about to break of a branch from a tree and hurl it in when her off slipped on the riverbank and before she could get a grip her whole body went tumbling into the chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she was up and sputtering for air as she tried to swim to the shore. However, tasty though it was, the chocolate was not easy to swim through. Fortunately her family had heard the yell and come running, but even by the time they reached the shore she was too far away and being swept along by the current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria was the first on the scene and looking nervous as she watched Regina struggle against the liquid candy. \"What do we do what do we do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Alph muttered joining and looking grim faced, \"Any attempt to fly out and grab her would just have her pull us in as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be something we can do...\" Lorenda looked worried as Regina was swept along, \"Where's that old rat owner? Maybe we could get him to shut this off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him since we entered the room,\" Kria replied as they could only watch helplessly while Regina was dragged towards the far end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Regina gets pulled under and sucked into a pipe. Fortunately the right way up. Oddly despite being thin enough to have fit through the pipe easily, she gets stuck and Regina discovers her slight dip in the river has caused the addition of several unexpected pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Regina is swept down the river and into a tunnel out of sight, but a automated boat appears with Mr.Wonkie on a TV screen saying he can guide the remote controlled boat down the river to find her as the remaining family climbs aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Regina reached the runnel at the end of the room and is saved by a net strung through the chocolate. With help she hauls herself out to join the family but she has been... changed by her time in the chocolate (weight gain or living chocolate transformation.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Lorenda get's an idea to use the licorice vines like a rope and ties several together to throw to Regina.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late at night, and in Alph's home all was asleep. The dark pegasus slept on the couch, various empty boxes of takeout food scattered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, he groaned in discomfort. Apparently some of the take-outs were a little on the expired side, which was not a good thing for a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tended to have nightmares then. His belly rumbled like distant thunder, and now we enter his dreams. He dreamed that he was a ruler, proud and respected by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood amongst a huge crowd. They cheered his name, and it felt wonderful.....but then the cheering turned to laughter, and Alph was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he felt a breeze, and looking down he saw that he was naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...!\" said Alph in horror, and began to run to hide his shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter continued though the crowd seemed to fade and swirl into a mist that surrounded him on all sides. Alph knew he shouldn't be afraid, but in dreams logic was often not... well, logical and all he could think to do was to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever even taking that first step proved difficult and the second one more so. Each step plodded along like he was trying to move through molasses. And then, suddenly, he was standing in what looked like a funhouse. He'd never been to one himself but he'd seen them in the occasional movie or TV show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically he looked to be in the 'hall of mirrors', where curved metal sheets bent one's reflection in any number of weird ways. Although as he passed these they seemed to all be the same, depicting him as a truly massive stallion butterball when he knew that simply wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, it was. He was truly huge: his belly dragged across the floor between his thighs that were as thick as pillars. He could feel his massive, dome-like ass cheeks sliding hypnotically behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed and puffed, his arms thrust out to the side, both to keep his balance and simply because they were too fat to move properly. His body jiggled and sloshed as he headed to the nearest exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was truly terrified, despite this only being a dream. Suddenly, he was struck by the greatest hunger in his life, his vast belly rumbling like an avalanche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find some food, and fast! Just then, he found himself in a room with a long table packed with various food of all kind. They looked absolutely tasty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph wasted no time digging in... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to resist, he wanted to run, but his legs refused to move and his arms continued to grab at one delicious treat after another. And through it all he continued to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the table always stayed within reach but his belly rolled out, growing bigger and softer with every bite as it transformed into a bed sized mass of black-furred flab. His male breasts as well grew bigger and bigger, rolling to the sizes as huge furry mounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if that wasn't bad enough, his black skinned nipples felt pinched and he watched as hoses uncoiled from nowhere and latched on to the bowling-pin sized protruding attributes before throbbing with a sucking motion as milk came pouring out of his enormous assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph maoned in bliss. He could no longer reach the food, but that was no problem; a hose had descended from the ceiling and shoved its way into his mouth. Sweet and delicious liquid poured into his mouth as he swelled even bigger, producing even more milk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor underneath Alph cracked, snapping him for a moment out of his blissful trance. He grunted in confusion, but then he felt all the tubes suddenly rip from his nipples and mouth as the floor collapsed underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled as he called, and then his eyes snapped wide open as he sat up. He was back in his living room, as thin as he was before. He blinked and sighed. He wasn't dreaming anymore...or was he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could smell the scent of food coming from the kitchen, and Regina calling, \"Oh Alph, babe, come and get dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat other weird expansion does Alph come in contact with?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Babe'? She'd never used that term before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Alph was on guard as he slowly pulled himself upright. any number of scenarios running through his head. Regina might be held hostage by adventurers... but then why had they not killed him while he slept? His still sleep addled mind struggled to find an answer as the vivid dream still prodded at him in ways he was unsure about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help either the tent in his pants refused to go down as the sensations from the dream lingered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the kitchen, and saw his  Regina cooking, her back turned to him. As he took a seat, Regina turned around, and Alph saw a sight that mad ehis jaw drop. She had the biggest breasts he had ever seen, barely contained in her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was her belly that caught his attention. It was swollen, her belly button popped out. \"Regina, are you pregnant!?\" Alpg said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina gave him a weird look. \"Yeah, duh,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but how!?\" Said Alph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you busted a nut inside me, uncle Alph,\" said Regina with a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... made several neurons fry in Alphs head. And disbelief was the only salvation he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What!? Come now Regina this prank is far too much even for you. This is the sort of thing I'd expect from my sister...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet as she approached him and he reached out to pull off what he assumed was a fake costume, his hand touched her stomach only to feel the kick of a definite something inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alph stepped back in horror, Regina only glared at her uncle, saying, \"You're weird, uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rung, and Regina went to open it while Alph tried to rationalise what was going on. He heard Kria's voice call his name rather joyfully. \"Oh Alph, where are you? Where is my sexy stud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the kitchen, and he saw that Kria was in a similar state, only her belly was bigger. She grinned at him. \"Wanna touch the babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Babies?\" Alph asked as his brain continued to fry, drawing out the plural as he couldn't believe her striped dome of a belly was filled with even more children that might be his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Regina, \"Your babies. Sorry, Kria, uncle Alph is out of it. Typical male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph could only stare at them, completely speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria shrugged. \"Well, I guess we should give him some space then,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" said Regina with a sly grin, \"We can have some fun with him while he is so out of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Kria gave a smile at her distant niece, \"Did you have something devious in mind? Because the last time we did something like that my brother ended up with a juicy pair bigger than the ones you're sporting now.\" Kria reached over and gave Regina's breasts a gentile caress as the bounced and sloshed faintly behind her skimpy clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina grinned and pulled out a vile from her pocket. \"I've been saving this,\" she said, \"It will have interesting effects on him, especially in his cock and balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria squealed in delight. \"Bigger is always better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please,\" said Alph as he was firmly taken to his room, where they undressed themselves, their breasts flopping free they advanced towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be some sort of dream...\" Alph groaned as Kria held him down while Regina advanced on him with the potion, \"I have to be dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be more than a dream in a minute,\" Regina grinned as she uncorked the vial and poured the cool fluid all over Alph's lap. The black equine groaned as he felt it ink into his skin in a matter of moments, seeping into his privates and saturating them with magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph moaned loudly as his cock burst from his pants, throbbing larger and larger until it was four foot in length, his balls the size of beach balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to do the honors?\" Said Kria to Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" she said, getting to work licking his giant horsecock, squeezing them between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph jerked as Regina squeezed his massive rod between her huge breasts and licked along it's enormous length all the way to the broad flat tip of his horse cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop...\" he groaned, struggling against Kria's grip, \"This is all wrong. We're family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes brother,\" Kria smiled leaning in to smother the top of his head with her breasts and plant a kiss on his nose, \"And family should always love eachother... deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Regina between her licks, \"A family that fucks together stays together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\na while later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph was fucked silly, falling into a deep sleep while his sister and niece only giggled and held their cum filled bellies, seed dripping form their cunts that, amazingly, took his length all the way down to his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and fell asleep. When he woke up again after a few moments, he found himself in an library, the memory of his incestious family foggy. He got up and rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where am I?\" he thought. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following story is co-written by a friend and I.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the world of Furrae few places were as relatively peaceful as the city state of Zinvth. That wasn't to say it didn't have the occasional trouble or crime, but generally run by the demon family with the last name Soulstealer the place served as a generally safe place for beings and creatures alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them. Alph Soulstealer (self declared Dark Pegasus) was a wanted creature by many Adventurer guilds. While he could in theory walk the city streets safe during the day, the more eyes that saw him meant more mouths to tell the annoying adventurers where to find him. So despite hating it, he was forced to go out in the dead of night and dressed in a large cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case he was just returning to his hidden home after meeting with his usual 'suppliers' in back-alleys behind shops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Regina gripes about procuring the wrong cereal again...\" Alph began as he walked but cut himself off. Regina was annoying but she was family (however distant) and he he wouldn't kill her. ...Not without a very justifiable cause like she tried to kill him first or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar enough away from the shops, Alph waved his hand and a door appeared in a once solid brick wall, a quick dug lead to a descending set of stone stairs and after he closed it the door vanished again as he began descending. So many stairs weren't necessary really, the home he had wasn't physically beneath the streets. It was merely an extra dimensional space he transitioned to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bottom Alph passed through a general living area where magazines littered the coffee table and soda cans piled up everywhere else. Again his grumbles about Regina grew as he made for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everything in his arms though was groceries. As usual he'd passed by a magic shop to inspect their recently 'imported' trinkets for anything useful. One pendent with a large red stone caught his eye and he could feel some odd magic about it. So he'd snapped it up curious to dissect the spells it had in his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trinket wasn't anything pretty, to be honest. It had a rusty chain around it, and the ruby was cracked. But the Dark Pegasus could feel magic radiating from it, strong magic, so it wasn't completely worthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just needed some love,and that was exactly what Alph Soulstealer did, using numerous spells to revert it to its original form. Slowly but surely the rust lifted like ash from a smouldering fire, revealing a gold chain underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fixed the crack too, and the results of his efforts was a decent looking chain. He could feel that the magic was stronger now....yet, what did this mean? More importantly, what could it do? It was truly a mystery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph suddenly heard a rumble, and he looked around himself, expecting danger, but then he realised that the rumble was from his stomach. He was hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to ignore it, turn his attention back to the amulet and begin pealing back the layers of magic it had, but his stomach would not be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he grumbled setting the amulet on the bench and returning to the kitchen. His eyes fell on the grocery bags he'd brought back. He'd put away the stuff that needed to be cold or frozen immediately, but the amulet had taken his attention before he could put away the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully he began to unpack and put away the rest as he mused what to make for himself. But then his clawed digits fell across a package of candy bars. He's picked them up as treats for Regina, a reward if she finished her chores on time. Alph never touched such things usually but for once he was curious. The smell felt enticing as he sniffed at the bag and almost before he realized it he'd cut into the bag and pulled out one of the candy bars to examine it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were one of Regina's favorites, chocolate covering little packets of caramel. Both sweets Alph only knew of but had never indulged himself. And yet now, for the first time, he was curious. He'd often told Regina not to dismiss something out of hand without trying it. And in truth he'd never tried such a sweet. Though logically his mind screamed to make a salad or at least a sandwich, curiosity drove him to unwrap the bar and take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a first time for everything, the saying goes, and it truly was the first time Alph ate a candy bar, and it showed. He found himself moaning softly in bliss, and before he knew it, he had devoured the whole bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph stood there in shock. Had he honestly enjoyed food so much that it was almost orgasmic for him? It was really weird. He could feel something on his mouth, and wiping it with his hand, he saw that it was a chocolate stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes! It seems like candy can turn him into quite a messy eater! He shook off the weird occurrence, but he could not shake off the hunger that still bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to make a proper dinner for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he held his breath and put away the remaining back while trying not to look at it at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was normally something he would take pride in. Do something elaborate, marinate some meat, chop some fresh vegitables and so on. But for once the effort seemed a bit too much. He reasoned it was because he wanted to get back to studying the amulet and his nagging stomach wouldn't leave him be. So Alph was forced to resort to one of the lowest forms of prepared food he knew of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen dinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina always had a few stashed away for easy means and flipping through it was hard to determine which disgusted him the least. In the end he settled on a whole frozen pizza, reasoning at least there would be some leftover for Regina when she woke up (it was the middle of the night after all). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreheating the oven would have taken a while, but a little fire magic got it hot enough in seconds. Still his stomach wouldn't let him wait for twenty or so minutes it took, so Alph looked about and finally found a snack more civilized as far as he was concerned. A fresh block of cheese and some crackers to enjoy it o. A bottle of wine and it would have been a refined snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph tried to busy himself by fiddling with the trinket again, but his hunger was really starting to irritate him now. \"What is wrong with me?\" he thought, \"I've never felt so hungry in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his pizza was done by the time he couldn't stand it anymore, even considering stooping even lower and ordering fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph inhaled the steamy pizza, and found that the scent was not too bad. When he sat down and a few slices, he found that it tasted even better. He would have never guessed that frozen food can taste so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he leaned back in his chair, holding a hand before his mouth as he belched politely. His hand moved down to rub his bloated belly, but then he felt something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was...curving? Looking down, he saw that it was indeed bulging ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a moment panic rose in his throat then immediately he calmed down. He'd just eaten a whole pizza. Very strange, and unusual, but one meal did not make him a glutton. Or worse fat. He'd simply consumed too much too fast and now his stomach was digesting it all. He could recall times when Kria had eaten whole beings and left her with a round middle like she'd swallowed a beanbag chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be gone by morning,\" he rationalized as he cleaned up, and, despite his concerns, snuck one more candy bar to take to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the night was growing late and much as he wished to continue examining the amulet it would have to wait until morning. However, Alph was no fool to leave a magical artifact out and unguarded. He had a special mirror lined case that he put it inside which contained its magical energies. That done he performed his usual nightly rituals and crawled into a big bed liked with silk sheets. One of the few luxuries he could manage in his current 'exile'.</span></div></div>",

He did not feel much like getting out of bed. He could afford to sleep in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes again and dozed off....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in itself would have been a big warning had Alph been more awake. The demon stallion never slept in. He always got his desired hours to rest and recover but never indulged beyond normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich itself was unusual enough to have his current charge come poking around. Regina snuck into his room curious to see if he really was asleep still. Normally she would have left it at that but then her eyes fell on the ruby pendent in the box. It just looked so nice...

It worked better than any alarm clock, and Alph jumped out of bed and dressed himself, hurrying yo the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his niece cooking up a storm, humming to herself. When she realized that her uncle had entered the kitchen, she said, \"Morning! I got this sudden urge to make breakfast for you. I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Breakfast' might have been an understatement. Along with the lambchops she was cooking were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice toast, muffins, cinnamon rolls, cream cheese Danishes and more,. Kria had her own plate of delicious foods she was nibbling on  as she worked and had Alph been able to see under her apron he might have noticed the start of a bulge forming over her once trim middle. Like his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks remarkable Regina, \"But why cook so much? Surely this is too much food for either of us to consume at one sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Uncle Alph, haven't you heard of leftovers?\" she replied sound a touch more like the teenager he knew her to be, \"Besides everyone says breakfast is the most important meal of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it unlikely to believe ever sentient creature in the world believes such a thing,\" Alph replied as he sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an expression. Sheesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the same, I appreciate your work, it looks and smells wonderful, but do at least try to avoid using up most of our food stores in one meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sure try, uncle,\" said Regina, \"I just got a bit carried away. But forget about that. Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two demons dug in, and Alph moaned in bliss. It tasted even better than he imagined. He seemed to lose some control over his eating manners and stuffed his face, bits of food staining his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of clothes, they started to feel strangely tight as he ate, most of the pressure around his gut and waist. When they were finished, leaving very little leftovers, Aloh leaned back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt gas building up inside him, and to his surprise a loud belch escaped his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina raised an eyebrow over one of her solid violet eyes as she smirked at him. \"Uncle, since when did your manors become so... uncouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph glowered just a little at his own tone being turned against him. \"Regina, as difficult as this might be to conceptualize, no living thing is perfect, myself included. Small errors in judgements may crop up from time to time, but it's not those singular moments that one should focus on, save to improve oneself and once's performance around others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you saying how you act all the time is a performance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of a sort,\" Alph replied, \"Life is a stage, and someone, somewhere is going to judge every move you make on that stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting words of wisdom,\" said Regina in a teasing, \"Tell me, is that bulging gut of yours also some makeup you decided to put on for the performance of life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph frowned and looked down, and to his horror saw that his gut was indeed very large, nearly the size of a basketball, gurgling and sloshing as it digested the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph blushed, at a loss for words while his niece laughed. \"Well....you aren't the spitting image of a perfect body, either,\" he countered, festering to her own bulging gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have me there, uncle,\" she said, \"I guess we both should watch what we eat from now on and stay active.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed we should,\" he said, but for some reason he felt like that would be harder and harder to do as time passesd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I would like for you to give me the necklace back,\" he said, \"I do not appreciate it if someone takes my belongings without permission. That's called theft, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Regina  seemed to roll her eyes as she unclipped the pendent and handed it back to her uncle, \"I just thoiught it would look good. Worth trying it on for a bit you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regina, this pendent is magical. Who know what it could have done to you while you wore it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm fine, aren't I?\" replied, putting her hands on her hips, unaware they were several inches wider than yesterday, \"So relax. It's probably some passive beauty charm to make the wearer look nicer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely,\" Alph replied, unaware of his own increased sized beyond what Regina had pointed out, \"Such a mundane charm seems far too useless for such a large pendent.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day at the Soulstealer Household. For those with a job, morning was always a struggle to haul oneself out of bed and go through the annoying routine of getting ready for work. For those without they either had to be dragged out of bed forcefully to begin the day (like Regina who almost tor her mattress at Devin's attempts to extricate her), or were left alone to follow their own disciplined routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with some shock that the normally meticulous and studious Alph Soulstealer found himself waking up at almost 11AM when the black equine knew he should have been up almost three hours earlier. He didn't have anywhere to be so there was no rush to jump up, but it was a annoyance in his own lacking discipline. However that was just the start of his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one to present itself was actually getting up. His first attempt yielded nothing and he merely assumed he was stiff from the day before. His second was nearly as fruitless. And by the third Alph finally had to prop himself up to see what the problem was a s he now felt a heavy weight settling on his middle. Throwing off the covers he couldn't believe the change he saw. The night before he'd gone to bed a slim and toned equine. Now, sitting stubbornly on his front, was a gut right out of his worst visions of couch potato slackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph wanted to scream in horror. He nearly did so, but he managed to clamp his hand over of his muzzle. The last thing that he wanted was to alert the household. He wanted no one to see him like this. The humiliation would be too much. The questions they would ask would be even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to make sense of what was going on, he could feel new memories pouring into his head. He could vaguely recall eating a sugary treat that randomly fell in front of him in his childhood, which sparked his love for sweets and fatty foods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he, with some effort, climbed out of bed and waddled to his dresser, still trying to make sense what was going on, he threw open the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, he saw that all his clothes were of gigantic size, perfectly tailored to fit him. What on earth was going on!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, as he thumbed through them, there were several made of far larger sizes than what he guessed he was at now. He tried not to dwell on that as he put on some robes and decided to forgo his usual shower (he'd had one the night before anyway) and crept out of his room to hurry along to his lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mansion was well decorated but usually didn't have much in the way of portraiture. There was a hall of course dedicated to the lineage of the family though, and as luck would have it Alphs lab was on the other side of it. The whole thing depicted the family line going back some two dozen generations. Each was expertly painted when a family member came of age. Lorenda was nearly there, so Kria's was the last in the line with Alph's just before hers. However when Alph passed both he he had to do a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kria's was painted just eighteen years ago and his was over three hundred years ago, both images depicted himself and his sister even bigger than he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of his family members showed up. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

In fact, it seemed to shimmer with energy the likes of which he had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regina, what's the matter?\" he asked as she came running past him, sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed her, only for him to stop dead in his tracks when she slammed her bedroom door in his face. For some reason he felt that it would be very unwise to force his way in, as if Regina's foul mood was something he had to handle with great delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear whimpering coming from the inside, followed by loud sniffing. Was she crying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked a few times, incredibly worried, and the answer he got was a stern, \"Go away!\" from Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not, though, and he knocked again, this time adding, \"Regina, you are worrying me profoundly. Tell me what is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO AWAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph took a step back in surprise. Her voice sounded demonic, which wasn't really a surprise, seeing that she was a demon, after all, but to drive her to such a state was the result of intense emotion, and not the shallow kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the type that hurt you deep down, that shook you to your very core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was indeed a very serious matter, so serious that not even Alph, with his intellect, could handle. As much as it will hurt his pride, he knew that he will have to call up only one person who could handle this situation: his sister.</span></div></div>",

Fa'Lina watched them from her office, her omnipresent eye on each individual. Everything was going like its should, no dangers whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered into the future just to make sure, and she found nothing of note...except for a fuzzy spot that was hard to make out. It was quite a common occurrence, these fuzzy spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost oracles would tell you about them. It was due to some magical interference blocking your future eye. In the past this would have put Fa'Lina on high alert, but after experiencing this for several centuries, she got used to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese fuzzy spots weren't a sign for a major crisis, to be honest. The worst case scenario is that it could be something that would peeve Fa'Lina, but it won't destroy everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example,  last time she got one if these fuzzy spots was a hundred years ago, and the event turned out to be a student cheating with a spell in her cooking contest. It resulted in a large amount of cookies spawning out if nowhere, and it kept appearing, flooding into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey called it the Great Cookie Catastrophe. Luckily, it was cleaned up pretty quickly, and to that very day they were still serving those cookies at tea time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Fa'Lina wasn't too worried. As she relaxed back in her chair, a Warp-Aci suddenly came flying into the room, looking like it was quite in a hurry. \"Miss Fa'Lina!\" it cried, \"Come quick, it is an emergency! A student has broken a very big rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina had one of those rare moments where she was genuinely surprised. \"Broken the rules?\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was someone who broke any serious rules, she would have already have a long time ago. Why then didn't she detect it? Why did she have to be told this first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething fishy was going on, and she wasted no time following the Warp-Aci.</span></div></div>",

At first glance, one might mistake him for a female, for his hips could put even the most voluptuous women to shame, but on closer inspection, he was indeed a male rabbit, just a feminine one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was waiting for someone, bored out of his mind in the shady part of town. She was taking her sweet time. Finally, after waiting for nearly an hour, he could feel small tremors pass through the ground. She had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an attempt to keep herself all dark, mysterious and quiet on this night, but the effect was ruined due to the fact that she could be spotted from a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nearly eight feet tall and weighed nearly a ton, her thundering footsteps shaking the rundown apartments, waking up and alarming those who resided inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit only rolled his eyes as her wide figure knocked over a cart like it was a stack of papers. The cloak figure stooped before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Malroy,\" she said in a husky, matriarchal voice, \"Ready for this secret meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As secret as a bomb going off in a crowded street!\" said Malroy in frustration, \"You are too big for city life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to the inhabitants of the apartments who were leaning out of their open windows, wondering what all the ruckus was about. Some managed to figure it out and was glaring at the two figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being under the cloak grinned sheepishly and said, \"Yeah, perhaps the city wasn't the best place to conduct this meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's too late now,\" said the rabbit, \"Let's head inside before you get us into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalroy led the way as the cloaked figure followed him, getting stuck in the doorway, but she managed to break free....breaking the doorframe as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered a wide, shabby chamber, which had enough room for the cloaked figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit turned to her and said, \"Alright, what this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mischief,\" said the cloaked figure, throwing back her hood, revealing the plump face of a hippo. Though, not just any hippo; a demon hippo. Like two burning fires, her yellow eyes glinted with mischievousness, and she licked her plump lips and fangs. \"Chaos, anarchy, panic and general no-good behavior,\" She said dramatically, throwing off her cloak, revealing her large body, which was stuffed in a ill-fitting red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it's one of those moments,\" said the rabbit, rolling his eyes, \"Well, what harebrained scheme have you come up with now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo demon placed her hands on her wide hips and said, \"Oh, you say that like my plans don't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't, Ursala,\" said Malroy bitterly to the hippo,\" Every time we get stopped in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was back home,'' said Ursala, \" but we are now in a different country, in a different city. We can start causing havoc all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, we still need to watch our backs,\" said the rabbit, folding his arms, \"Anyway, back to the main question, why are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To show you this,\" said Ursala, producing a statue of a strange creature, and Malroy cocked an eyebrow, \"Bare with me. Its cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why the hell do we have it then!\" said Malroy in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt me!\" she snapped, her yellow eyes flashing in irritation, \"Anyway, I managed to tweak the curse a bit. originally, it was meant to inflict the full effects of the curse instantly, but I spread out its influence and power to a few beings in Furrae. The side effect being that the effects are much slower now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalroy placed his hands on his generously proportioned hips and said, \"Hmm, interesting, but what does it do exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see,\" she said and let loose an evil laugh.</span></div></div>",

As he lay there in bed, still pondering the mystery of why he felt so troubled, he could feel the weight of something resting on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, he threw the covers away and jumped out of bed, hitting the light switch. Standing in front of a mirror, he looked almost exactly like he always did: he was a lion Cubi, his wings on his back and head fluttering, as if to say hallo to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, another attribute of his body wanted to say hallo as well, and it did so by rumbling. Dan was at a loss for words as he stared at his new beer belly, wondering where on earth did it come from. It wasn't there last night.... or at least he thought it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, last night was a blur. His sister, Alexsi, had made it official with Pyroduck, and a month later the got married, and Fa'Lina had given special permission for Dan to stay at home for the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party that ensued was crazy. Say what you want about Cubis, but they sure know how to party! Of course, there was a lot of alcohol involved, but did he honestly drink so much that he developed a beer belly overnight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to remember again, but his memory was too fuzzy. he let it forgo for now. He can work!off the pudge. Right now, he could feel a headache coming along due to the hangover and he decided to head downstairs for some fetch himself some medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was greeted by Pyroduck, who's hangover was even worse than his,  groaning, dark rings under his eyes. \"Hey, there, Pyroduck,\" said Dan, \"How does it feel to be a newlywed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my head hurts like a hell,\" he said, \"but my heart is at piece. I'm so glad to have your sister in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she?\" Dan asked as he took the medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even worse than me,\" said Pyroduck, \"She drank even me under the table, and I'm a dragon! Though, she was quite frisky in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan cocked and eyebrow and said, \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyroduck nodded. \"Yup, we did it last night. Though, it might take a while for all that spunk to digest. She's quite inflated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan grimaced. \"I didn't need that mental image, thank you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyroduck only grinned and said, \"Enough about me. It seems like you also had a bit of fun last night. That beer gut is evident of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over and poked Dan's belly. The Cubi blushed and patted his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really drink that much last night?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea,'' said Pyroduck, \"A few kegs, to be honest. I never knew you had it in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, that explains a lot,\" said Dan as he shook his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have sworn that it looked even bigger than a few minutes ago.</span></div></div>",

After a while, she got bored and got up. dressed in a night shirt and a pair of panties, which looked even more skimpy on her than it usually did, Regina went to the bathroom to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood under the falling water, she noticed something. Her ones toned belly was.... curving. In fact, that wasn't the only thing that seem to be curving a bit more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and breasts seemed bigger too, and Regina, being very self-conscious, was worried. She got out, dried herself off and got dressed in a shirt and jeans, finding her clothes to be a bit tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to work this off ASAP,\" she said to herself. \"I don't want to end up looking like Princess Pudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the kitchen, where she found her uncle Aliph making coffee. He looked moody, and Regina knew that he had pulled one of his all-nighters again. She really didn't like it when he did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so grouchy and unpleasant the next day, but she still tried to greet up anyway. \"Morning, uncle,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he groaned as  he sipped his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably  shouldn't ask you how you slept,\" said Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" said Aliph, \"Because an event like that never transpired the previous twelve hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you need to hit the hay now,\" said Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Aliph, \"I'm running on fumes. Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled out of the kitchen and to his room, Regina watching as he left, but she noticed something....off about him. Did he look...thicker? His hips were wider, his rear stretching the fabric of his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. She was probably imagining things. Regina finished her breakfast and headed out to do her part time job that she got a few weeks ago to keep her preoccupied, much to her overprotective uncles displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tucked at her pants as she walked out, her ass began to spill over it. I really need to hit the gym, she thought.</span></div></div>",

The young demoness' clothes hugged her chubby frame, her belly spilling over her belt, which clung to dear life as her hips forced it apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenda stared at her in shock, and she said, \"Regina, what....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say anything about my weight,\" Regina said through gritted teeth, cutting her off, \"I'll kick you! The only reason why I am here is that I need to run an article on fashion statistics for the magazine company I work at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a notebook and clicked her pen. \"So, start talking,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenda decided to forget about Regina's sudden weight gain and answer her questions. They were pretty standard ones: What's pieces of clothing is sold the most? What brand? What sizes? How many times do people buy per month? What gender visited them the most?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answers were the surprising part, even for Lorenda. The clothing that were bought the most were loose fitting ones, such as sweat pants, tank top, muffin tops and plain shirts. The brand was called Big Boys, which specialized in making clothing that was super stretchy and durable. The sizes were rather big, mostly in the large to extra extra large category. No smalls or mediums have been bought recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of visits and clothing bought had spiked, most of them being women. In addition, bras were flying off the selves, the cup sizes getting bigger and bigger as time moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lorenda gave these statistics to Regina, they stared at each other for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something really weird is going on,\" said Regina. \"These statistics are very unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are,\" said Lorenda as she tucked at her bra, which was beginning to feel snug all the sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of something dragging across ground caught their attention. When they turned, their mouthes fell open in awe. It was Miss Kate, who was slithering towards them, but she had expanded bigger than both Regina or Lorenda could have ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail was nearly as wide as a car and seem quite difficult to move, seeing how Miss Kate was struggling to bend it as she slithered. The upper part of her body wasn't speared either. Her gut bulged outwards several by several feet, her corset looking like it could pop off at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher enlarged breasts were giving her blouse a run for it's money, the sheer size resulting in rips in the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, ladies, don't gape like that,\" said Miss Kate in w cheery tone, seemingly oblivious to her changes. \"You'll catch flies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slithered past them and into her office, nearly getting stuck in the doorway. Both ladies only stood their in shock for several minutes before they came to their senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something totally weird is going one,\" said Lorenda.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kria sat in her office, staring out the window and idly munching on a blueberry muffin. She had unbuckled her pants and pulled down her zip, loosening some buttons as well to giver her basketball sized Pudge some room. With her feet on the table and leaning back in her office chair, she reached out for another muffin....only to be unable to find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria had ate all of them and she pouted. Ever since this seemingly endless hunger began, she had been eating nonstop, and when she ran out of food she had a tendency to get upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit a button on her office phone that accessed the intercom and she shouted into it, \"Get me more muffins! And don't keep me waiting!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, Miss Soulstealer,\" said one if her assistants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria leaned back into her chair, letting loose a loud belch. a few. minutes later her giant pack of muffins arrived, being delivered by one of her favorite assistants, a raccoon male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked quite like the boy toy, but it was such a shame that he was so professional all the time, resisting her advances previously. But very since she started gaining weight, he got more interested in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was his secret, thought Kria, he was interested in big ladies all along. I should have seen it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now he was housing as he entered, placing the bag in front of her. \"H-here you go, ma'am,\" he said, looking quite flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in to take the muffins.... before deciding to grab the raccoon by the tie. With her superior demon strength, she pulled him closer, grinning at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked terrified. \"I-I-I'm s-sorry!\" he spluttered, \"I-I d-don't know what I did, but I'm s-sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax, young man,\" said Kria, \"You're not in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not?\" said the raccoon nervously, \"Then w-why did you grab me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want you to feed me,\" said Kria, gesturing to the bag of muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you know you could have just asked me,\" said the raccoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where the fun in that,\" said Kria, \"You know us demons are the aggressive sort. Anyway, hope to it! Those muffins aren't going to jump in my mouth by themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon began to feed them to her gingerly, Kria munching and moaning in bliss, her belly swelling out slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, kid, I never got your name,\" she said with her mouth half full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Jimmy, ma'am,\" he said as he fed her another another muffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, hey?\" said Kria, \"Well, Jimmy, from now on, you can call me Kria, because your are getting a promotion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A p-promotion?\" said Jimmy, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said Kria, \"but there are some terms on conditions. You need to drop everything going on in your life and be available at all times to feed and move me around. Do so and you will be rewarded handsomely. What do you say? Be my personal assistant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy thought about it for a few moments. He didn't really have anything going on in his life. In fact, he spent more time at work than anyplace else. He was practically married to his job. So, whatever he had in his life he could drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if he did have things going on, it was still a bad idea to say no. First off, Kria was a demon, and a quite hot tempered one, he had heard. She will be most displeases if he said no. She was also the type of girl he had always been looking for: dominating, mature, likes to be fed and wants to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis secret sexual fantasies was finally fulfilled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, a promotion would be good for him. He was struggling to pay both his college debt and housing rent. This could be his ticket to the good life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and said, \"I'm all yours, ma....I mean, Kria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria grinned and said, \"That's a gold boy toy. Run along and get me some ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy saluted and said, \"Yes, Kria,\" and ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria leaned back into her chair again, belching even louder than before, a button popping off her shirt.</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her temples and groaned. Why was the normally calm and collected Fa'Lina so stressed out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, of late, her whole academy was in chaos. Her students have been swelling like balloons, being inflated by flab, eating thrice as more than they usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no clear reason why this was happening, but what ever it was, it was pretty sinister; Fa'Lina had tries to use her magic to glimpse into the future to perhaps find a clue to why this was happening, but she found her magic blocked by some kind of force that pushed her back, resulting in her nearly passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feared that she had to do this the old way: through agents and spies gathering knowledge. She suspected Kria was involved with this. The demoness' company had a notorious reputation of producing questionable and often downright dangerous items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria had always gotten away with this due to her power, but Fa'Lina will not stand for it! When her students were directly affected, she will not stand by idly and watch. That was why she had called Kria here to confront her. This ended now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plump Warp-Aci came suddenly flying into the room, their kind also not spared by the growth. \"Miss Fa'Lina,\" it chirped as it hovered before the door, \"I like to announce that Kria Soulstealer has arr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor creature was slammed against the wall as the door burst open. Fa'Lina jumped to her feet as she saw a striped ball enter her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the meaning this!?\" she said in outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The meaning is,\" said the striped ball, ''is that you are interrupting my three hour lunch break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina was stunned. \"K-Kria? is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud belch came from behind the striped ball. \"In the fatty flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina skirted around the striped ball and found Kria on the other side. She was in her suit, though, it was ruined, several tears appearing in the rich black fabric due to it not able to handle her huge size anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her buttons on her shirt had popped open, her massive breasts free for all to see, her areolas as big as dinner plates, and Fa'Lina blushed, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you called me here?\" said Kria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina had a speech prepared for Kria, but whatever accusations she had that the demoness was guilty for fattening up her school, she tossed away. She knew Kria could be childish and reckless from time to time, but she was far from stupid. She would never do such a thing and have herself caught up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina sighed and sat down behind her desk. \"Never mind,\" she said, cradling her head miserably in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, Kria said, \"No, seriously, tell me. What's the matter? You can't have summoned me here for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFa'Lina looked up in frustration. \"Seriously!?\" she said, \"Can't you see what's going on? Can't you see what's happening to my students?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Kria, \"They are a bunch of Butterballs in serious need of some exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Fa'Lina, \"Have you seen yourself in a mirror? You are a whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Kria, offended, \"Have you seen yourself lately? You aren't the slimmest of the bunch either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures to a small pudge that was bulging against her dress, and Fa'Lina groaned, placing her hand on her bulging gut. She had honestly hoped that no one noticed that she was affected too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" said Fa'Lina as she steepled her hands, \"there is something sinister afoot, and we need to set our differences aside and assist each other to find out what's causing this. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKria shrugged her meaty shoulders and said, \"As long as it doesn't interrupt my eating schedule, I don't see any reason why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you will be well fed.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>HOLD IT!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're just here to read that's fine, but if you plan on adding to this interactive you need to know the world and it's characters. Chances are you do if you searched and found this title, but all the same you should know what you're getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the world of the online webcomic Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.missmab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.missmab.com/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://missmab.katbox.net/\" target=\"_blank\">http://missmab.katbox.net/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit up the 'Demo. 101' in the first link for more details about the cast, races and the world. I'll try to give a rundown here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to be aware of is in this world, the planet of Furrae, there are few truly evil individuals. Yes there are creatures that will kill tens of thousands, but it's not because of a blanket excuse of 'I'm evil'. Often times it because of longstanding grudges or a power struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hierarchy of the world there are many types of sentient individuals. The two largest and broadest categories are Creatures and Beings. Beings are anthros with little to no magical power. They work normal jobs and live normal lives. Some with a bit of magical skill or capability join adventuring guilds to help others in need of help. We'll get to that in a sec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other group is Creatures, and they vary wildly. There are many sub-categories for Creatures, but all of them are magically based and are by-and-large, more powerful than Beings. Among the Creatures you have races like Angels, Demons, Cubi (succubi females and Incubi males), Dragons and so on. There's also the Undead race, but they're as harmless as any other group of beings and just as sentient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, read all about this in the first link above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story takes place for the most part in the city state of Zinvth, which is owned an operated by the demon family with the surname Soulstealer. Kria Soulstealer is the current head of the family and manages the central company that oversees the well-being of the city. Everyone who's a citizen of Zinvith is under her protection, but being a demoness, she flaunts her power and has on occasion eaten a few beings on a whim. Though usually this has forced her to pay out large sums of money to family members as compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titular characters are Daniel Ti'Fiona, a feline adventurer with blue wings who, early in the comic, discovered he is in fact a Incubus inherited from his Succubus mother when he sprouted their signature 'second wings' from the top of his head. Dan's a little thick at times and slow to accept changes in his life, but he wants to do the right thing for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMab meanwhile is a purple cat Fae. And Fae's are literally the most powerful beings in Furrae. Technically they're one of three of the most powerful races in any dimension. They exist in all realities simultaneously and have their own home realm they can retreat to. They can do anything with their magic but as such feel the need to extremely limit themselves. A Fae will set rules for any new world they visit, going so far as to change who they are each time they set foot in that world. In Mab's case, she removes most of her omniscient abilities to become a silly, goofy carefree individual who does whatever she thinks is fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's lots more characters but again read about them above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how the comic may change and dynamics alter here is the present set up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>READ THIS TO KNOW WHERE IN THE COMIC THIS IS SET!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present Dan is spending one month a year at SAIA, the Succubi and Incubi Academy to learn how to use his powers. Fa'Lina is the headmistress of the academy and uses her power to protected it from all would-be attackers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenda works at Miss Kate's corset shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyrras has agreed to work with Biggs on his 'project'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlph Soulstealer and Regina are still in hiding, although Regina now has a job working for a fashion magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyrras and Abel have just started 'dating' though neither knows anything about such relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically Abel should be in the hospital after an attack by a dragon but I'm excluding that event so he can be a character in this story. Everything else up to the present comic of #1927 is what happened up until the events of this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now for my usual rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1 - Keep vore to a minimum.Demons and other races eat Beings but let's keep it to a minimum please. I have Vore listed as minimal because there are other more interesting ways of voring individuals that could be used. Either way, for whatever reason, voring does not kill characters here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3 - No short posts. Any post added must be a minimum of three paragraphs or approximately two hundred and fifty words. Which is not as hard as some might think. Longer posts will be greatly appreciated though. I'm not holding this one tight since sometimes just more choices are needed, but please at least try to make every chapter substantial even if it's just adding more choices. IE, if a character is browsing a shop trying to decide what magical item to buy, describe further browsing before giving more choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4 \u2013 Give everyone an out. All chapters should have two options at the very least. Give everyone a chance to follow the story you want to see and a way to escape that path if they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#5 \u2013 Keep the flow. Everyone is entitled to interject their own ideas, however do not suddenly stop a story line for no reason to start a new one. So if there's a character given super powers, don't just suddenly strip them from him for some arbitrary reason and dump him somewhere to start your story. See rule 4. If everyone is given an 'out' then everyone will get the chance for the story they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 \u2013 Weight Gain, Inflation, Hyper, Macro, Micro, Transformation, Transgender, and much more is all viable here, but be respectful. If you don't see a type of change you want to do and there's no more room for the choice don't just butt in with your idea. I'll try and offer a number of options from the start but I can't do everything right off. Just try and be respectful and I'll help where I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#8 \u2013 Oviposition or egg-laying. Some furs like being expanded with hundreds of eggs, and I will allow this. <i>However</i>... All eggs laid must be infertile and not be destined to hatch into hundreds of babies. If having children is to be part of the story keep the number to a minimal amount no matter how many eggs are involved. Eggs or other pregnancies may produce clones or the like, but keep the number of actual infants to the barest minimum if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#9 -- Nothing gross or disgusting. Sorry, but stuff like scat and 'watersports' is right out. I won't tolerate disgusting excretions all over the place. Basically if you can imagine it covering your whole body being sticky or slimy and it makes you feel ill then don't do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#10 \u2013 Lastly, have fun with this. This is a world to expand upon and grow huge with creative ideas. The rules above are guidelines rather than strict 'do not cross' guardrails for the most part. However, take note of each since anything falling into such categories may be removed if it is deemed inappropriate in one form or another. However, such actions will not happen without the author being told via on-site email and giving them a chance to correct their chapter. Any abuse or rude behavior, including mean spirited posting, will be removed without such notification though, so 'play nice'.</td>",
