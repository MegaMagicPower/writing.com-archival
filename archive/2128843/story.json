The passenger window half way down, her blonde wavy hair dancing with the wind. She was singing. Singing loudly. \"Your the reason God made Oklahoma! Your the reason God made Oklahoma...\" I tried to speak her name to get her attention. But what is her name? My heart is pounding. Luckily there are no moving vehicles near us. Well, there is nothing near us. Frantically, I look again at my cell phone. No signal. \"Babe!\" I screeched. Her head sharply turned my way. With my foot off the pedals and hands off the steering wheel. I shrugged my shoulders, flashed her a seductive grin and as my eyes connected with hers, I joined her in song \"And I'm sure missing you....\" </span></div></div>",

Ten more miles and he knew there would be an all night truck stop, possibly a mechanic on duty at this hour. He kept his foot on the gas pedal determined to keep the car rolling Westward. Jenn had stopped her singing she was focusing on the road ahead as well.<br>\r\n Cody suspected the power steering pump had gone out, the car whining and popping each time he moved the wheel or sped up or slowed down.<br>\r\n \"We will be ok.. \" Cody assured \" We didn't have a destination to begin with, so a night in Pecos can't be all bad\" <br>\r\n \" My car, hon. is not okay.\" Jenn replied.<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry babe.. \" replied Cody.. \"It wasn't my fault\"<br>\r\n \" IF you hadn't been in such a hurry and bounced across the median.. playing with your phone and looking at me instead of the road\" Jenn gnashed.<br>\r\n The two were silent for the next few miles.. only the hum of the tires and the pops and creaks of whatever was going on beneath the hood.

Low Fuel... <br>\r\n    \"Christ\" I mumbled.\"How could we be out of Gas already?\" <br>\r\nI banged my hand on the dash board. Knowing it was useless I tried to start the engine once more anyway. Nothing.<br>\r\nI opened the door and climbed out to take a look around. There wasn't anything but a desolate highway stretching for miles in either direction. The roadway was lined with miles and miles of triple strand barbed wire fence, just on the inside of the fence were utility poles about every three hundred feet and overhead electric wire. At least electric wire meant it must eventually lead to some sort of civilization. Maybe to somewhere or someone who could get us some much needed gasoline. <br>\r\n I began to walk and after a few hundred feet looked back to see if Jenn was coming with me. She was still sitting in the passenger seat, Her face looked flush, she was saying something, but I couldn't make out exactly what it was. I shrugged and looked back down the road. The traffic had been light, not another vehicle in site. I stuck out my thumb as if hitchhiking and that at least got a smile out of my gal.<br>\r\n Jenn was reluctant, but finally got out of the car,adding, \" There must be a ranch house, or an oilfield office or something nearby\"<br>\r\n I knew I needed gas, it was already getting hot, we both grabbed a bottle of water and began walking in the direction we had been traveling. Each step seeming harder than the last, we walked until the car was out of our peripheral view. The sun was hot and we sat for a moment under the shade of a wilted Mesquite Tree. I spotted a windmill across the pasture and decided to walk to it and try to refill our water bottles. We still hadn't seen sight of anyone. There were only a few red and white cattle gently grazing their cud, not even paying any attention to us as we picked our way through rocks and cactus on our way to the windmill. <br>\r\n After filling up our water bottles, I thought perhaps I could climb the ladder on the side of the windmill and catch some ambient signal on my cell phone, then maybe I could make a phone call to someone who might bring us some gas.<br>\r\n \"Be careful.\" Jenn said, as I began my way up the ladder looking every few steps at my phone for that one bar of signal.<br>\r\nI was almost to the top when I looked back toward the highway and saw a pickup drive by at a high rate of speed, I tried to yell out and wave my arms in order to stop the driver. I doubted he even saw me. Aside from the poor circumstance the view of the area was nice from the top of the windmill. The field was broken into several pastures by the barbed fence, the grass was green and wavy. Wildflowers were blooming and even the prickly pear cactus had color in its flora. I looked back at my phone and nothing. Feeling a little aggravated, I slowly climbed my way back down.</span></div></div>",

We were too far off the road to be seen. \"Babe, I think we should head back to the highway,\" I said, as I jumped down from the last rung on the windmill's ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms and sighed. \"How can you forget to fill up with gas?\" Her blonde hair stuck to her face and neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2014I don't know. I swear I filled the tank a couple of days ago. I swear I did.\" The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced I had. I knew we were going on a road trip. There's no way I would have left the tank empty. Heck, I even remembered going to the gas station. That younger Garrison boy was working, and the little idiot gave me lip, so I refused to tip him. <i>Huh, I bet this is all his handiwork!</i> \"I did fill it, Taylor. I remember. It's that Garrison lad\u2014Brandon, is it?\u2014he drained the tank, or didn't fill it, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Shoving her hands onto her hips, she walked right up to me and said, \"He did all this, and you didn't noticed when you drove home? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. I would have noticed. <i>Maybe he did something that night. I wouldn't put it past him.</i> \"Okay, whatever. Well, we're not going to get help by standing around here. We must get to the highway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling behind me, Taylor scuffed at the dry dirt, spraying the backs of my legs with red dust. As we got to the highway, I looked all around. Not a soul in sight. There were no cars, no sounds of traffic, no buildings. But I already knew that. The vista from the windmill let me see for miles. We were stuck there, on our own. At least we had some snacks and drinks in the cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so these are our options. Firstly, we can stay here and wait for another vehicle to pass, hoping it will stop to help. In doing that, we have the cooler full of drinks and snacks. Or, we could continue walking in the direction we were headed. We know there will be a town eventually. We weren't heading into the middle of nowhere\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though that's where we ended up!\" She huffed and stamped a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy patience was just about out by this point. The heat had drained my energy and every last nerve. \"This wasn't our destination, and you know that! This is not my fault, I tell you.\" I shot her a stare that told her to interrupt me again at her own peril. \"As I was saying . . . we could walk the way we were headed in the car. There will be a town, with people and gas, eventually. But if we do that, we can only carry a couple of bottles of water each, and this scorching heat will take it out of us. That's it. That's all I've got.\" throwing my hands up in the air, I waited for her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  <br>\r\nI sat in the car for a few moments thinking, <i>\"well at least the car is safe from wild animals,\"</i> we could sleep sitting up... Then I had an idea, \"Jenn get your pack I'll get the cooler.\" She had been laying with her eyes closed, seat leaned back as far as it went. Her eyes opened like she just been goosed, \"What are you doing?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're going to sleep in the crawl space of the windmill, then get an early start while it's still cool in the morning.\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked at me with those large eyes, and then promptly got out and went to the trunk to fetch her knapsack. I got out my side, and opened the side door behind my drivers seat and got the cooler. At least we would have sustenance, I was starting to get hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n We walked along the fence line until we came in line with the windmill, it was late afternoon by now, and I was getting pretty hot. All I could think was thank God we'll be out of the sun for awhile. We shimmied under the wire and made our way to the windmill. As Jenn cleaned out the crawlspace, I busied myself collecting small sticks and some fair sized logs. It would be cold as heck out in the desert at night, and a nice fire would keep us pretty cozy, It would also keep the wild animals away. We got a fire started, small at first so we would be ready when night arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a fine meal of sandwiches and chips, followed by a water chaser we sat backs to the footing of the windmill and talked. The conversation went from that monster Garrison who I was sure had snuck by our home and done some evil to our car, to the dusk settling over the shrub tree filled desert we were now prisoners of. As the stars started to pop silently out into the sky even before the light of the sun had completed its work for the day, we talked about how surreal it all appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everything went well as the light all but completely faded, and I got the disingenuous idea of bringing up the subject of the disappearances. At first Jenn was intrigued, and the conversation was really interesting. Things did not stay that way for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You mean there are stories of people gone missing here, in this area?\" Jenn suddenly said as it dawn on her that I had mention the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes in fact, this area has reported no less than twenty missing people over the last two years.\" I assured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shut up!\" she said, with a half smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well it's true, they have reported campers, drivers, locals, and even cops who just disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look stop, I'm getting scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh there's nothing to be afraid of.\" I assured. Though even as I said it I had pause to think, there really was nothing special about our situation, it fact if we went missing only our car would tell the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well change the subject, she said.  \"Talk about something cheerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I thought for a moment, then said; \"Maybe we should just climb into the crawlspace and get cozy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded her head ever so lightly, and moved to get her backpack. I grabbed mine which was right next to me on the ground, and then I froze! <i>\"Was that a movement in the trees?\"</i> I starred out at the black night for a good half a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I shook my head slightly, and got up carrying my backpack to the vent at the base of the windmill. We joined our sleeping bags and got comfortable, she wrapped her arms around me and said'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Silly, sometimes you don't know what your saying.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I began walking forward. Tailor didn't follow, but I knew she would follow soon enough. She could only pout for so long before she would have to give in to the only choice available. The dreadful walk ahead in the scorching heat was the only realistic option. They could just stand and hope that another vehicle passed, but the reality was, it had been two hours since they had last seen a vehicle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe beat-up, old, blue pick-up truck had flew past them, blowing dust in its wake, obviously in a hurry. Or, just maybe with no cops in the area, there was no need to obey speed restrictions. None the less, it would be a waste of time to sit around waiting to be rescued, might as well begin walking and pray that another vehicle would pass by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, David?! Your just going to leave me all alone out here in BFE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, seeing her hand on her hip and nose flaring in anger. I exhaled loudly. \"Well, you have choices. Who am I to tell you what to do. You can walk with me, or you can just stand there and wait. The doors on the car lock if you get scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing honest with myself, I had trepidations about leaving her all alone, but it might be a good thing to split up. If a car were to come by, maybe she could hitch a ride and rescue me. Women do have better luck hitchhiking, seeming less threatening and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the deserted highway, I heard a loud slamming of a car door and figured Tailor had gone into the car. I shook my head, frowned, and rolled my eyes. <i>Women can be so stubborn</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of walking I turned, hoping to see Tailor running towards me, but all I saw was the car, which now seemed much smaller in the distance. I reminded myself that she would be alright. One of us would run into someone at some point, hopefully. If not, there had to be civilization somewhere up ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the first hour, my body began to weaken from the scorching heat. Or, at least I estimated it to be about an hour. Distance and time is difficult to gauge when everything looks the same. It almost seemed like I was walking in circles, seeing the same tumble weeds, and cactus, but the realist in me told me that obviously this wasn't the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a swig of the open bottle of water. I figured half a bottle per hour would sustain me, even though I was most likely sweating out four times that every half hour. Guessing, I decided t hat there was probably about four hours left of sunlight. Once night hit, I'd probably be alright without the sun sucking my energy, that is if I didn't find civilization by then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows how far I walked, but time grew distant and irrelevant as my feet grew heavy and my face began to blister from the sun's rays. My throat dry, I took the last drink of water from the second bottle, before throwing on the ground. I remembered something about water from cactus, so I searched for a pointy stick that could possibly work for cutting one open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile searching, what seemed to be endless sandy loam, I ran across a woman's purse tucked under some brush. Momentarily I wondered why it was out in this deserted place, but I was grateful to find it when I found the compact mirror inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at my reflection, I could see that I was a dreadful site. My skin was bright red with blisters beginning to form, and my eyes were blood shot from exhaustion. Shaking my head, I broke the mirror, and removed one of the sharp shards of glass. It would have to due for a knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ripped open the sides of a nearby large cactus, revealing the fleshy meat inside.  Three years ago, while visiting family in Texas, my cousin had convinced me to eat chili with chunks of cactus cooked in it. As I bit into the chili, it seemed as though someone had blew their nose, leaving chunky remnants of snot in my chili. At the time I had gagged on the cactus, yet at this moment, the mushy center was delicious. I suppose when you are hungry and/or thirsty enough, anything tastes wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer I sat there, after indulging in the cactus meat, my eyes grew heavier. I figured it would do me some good to rest my eyes for a while, I curled up on the ground under a short bush, its tiny leaves protecting my upper body from the bright sunlight. The relief from the heat was a welcomed relief, and I drifted off into sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awoke, everything was pitch back and I wondered how long I had slept. Fear hit my gut like a stabbing ice pick. What if I had slept so long that by the time I reached a town, it would be too late for business to be open. Small little hick towns rarely had business that stayed open in later hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped to my feet, dreading the long walk ahead, but now rested, my pace hastened. The cool breeze felt like it was chafing my sunburn, but it was welcomed in trade for the torturing sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked, I heard a rustling in a near by bush, and I jumped. In further inspection, I realized it was just the wind. That is when I noticed the headlights in the distance behind me. Maybe it was Tailor. If she had hitched a ride to a gas station, she would be looking for me. She was angry, but of course she loved me enough not to abandon me here in this god forsaken place, or worse yet suffer the fate of dying here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headlights grew closer and he realized it was a larger vehicle, not the little black Toyota Corolla we were driving. Still, it was someone and I livened with hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vehicle neared and I realized it was the blue truck they saw earlier, or at least looked like it could be. I waved my hands in the air from the side of the road, hoping the driver would see me. I suppose standing in the middle of the road would have more than likely gotten the drivers attention, but they were approaching so quickly, I feared they were going so fast that they would not notice me until they had hit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue truck ran past me at first, and I felt like I wanted to cry. This was the only vehicle I had seen since my walk, and I feared there would not be another one. Just when I lost all hope, the truck stopped in a screeching halt, causing dust to fly everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran to the passenger side window. There was a big bald man around fiftyish sitting in the drivers seat. I smiled. \"Boy am I glad to see you! Several miles back, my wife and I ran out of gas. I've been walking since around three this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man spit something outside the side widow. When I noticed the bulge in his cheek, I figured out it was tobacco.  His lips widened in a smile. \"Up ahead about five more miles there's a gas station.\" He looked at his watch. \"They'll be closing in about half an hour. Get in and I'll take ya there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door and jumped into the passenger seat. \" Thank you, thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me inquisitively. \"Damn, you sure got one hell of a sunburn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking in the sun for several hours has that affect.\" I laughed despite being reminded of the painful burning sensation on my skin. My newfound rescuing, made it more than tolerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that I hadn't introduced myself. \"I'm David, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, David. My name's Tom.\" He was driving now and his eyes on the road, he seemed contemplative and there was a pregnant pause \"So, David, what brings you to these parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we were on a road trip to visit my wife's family and I apparently took the wrong exit somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I bet the wife wasn't happy about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she wasn't. Speaking of my wife. I noticed you were coming from the direction our vehicle was in. You didn't happen to see a black Toyota Corolla along the way, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Well, I'm sure sue is just fine. Feeling bad for leaving her there though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does seem like a pretty messed up thing to do. I know I wouldn't be leaving a lady friend all on her lonesome out here. People have been know to disappear into these parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn icy chill ran up my spine. \"Disappear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean come on, not many go through here. Perfect place to toss a body or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Oh come on, you don't think-\" He shook his head. \"I'm not up and about tossing bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Sorry, I've had a stressful time of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some silence for some time, then I swung forward as the truck screeched to a stop and something  bounced off the front with a loud thump. Both of us stepped outside to investigate. Turned out it was a fox. Tom frowned. \"Poor little guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked him up and tossed him in the bed of the truck. That is when I noticed the tarp. Something seemed to move underneath. I leaned in closer to investigate and Tom noticed. He sighed. \"It seems I hit a lot of critters driving down this highway. No sense wasting good meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you hit? It seems rather big. I didn't see any large animals walking along the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 1668<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His flip flop see-sawed down the remaining fifteen steps. Cody murmured under his breath as he balanced himself steady on the ladder once again.  The heat and his frustration could be seen in his reddened face. He held on to the ladder with one hand and held tight his cell phone in the other. He looked down at his phone. The bright sun\u2019s reflection made it difficult for him to read the phone\u2019s screen. He squinted his eyes and lifted the phone up over his head. He balanced himself carefully as he let go of the ladder with his left hand and attempted to block the sun\u2019s glare with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I think I see a \u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody\u2019s long slender body plummeted downwards. His long arms wildly and desperately grappled for the rungs of the ladder to no avail.  He braced his body, locked his knees and flattened his feet in position for his landing. A loud thump echoed through the barren terrain. As he had hoped, Cody landed on his feet but then crashed down to his backside. A sharp piercing pain shot up his right leg. \u201cDammit!\u201d He bellowed. He curled up in a fetal position and gripped his right ankle with his left hand. His right hand still clenched his cell phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabbyyy!\u201d Jenn rushed to Cody \u201cAre you ok?!?!\u201d Cody grumbled and moaned in pain. \u201cAnswer me dammit!\u201d Jenn agitatedly demanded. \u201cI think my ankle is broken\u201d. Cody answered sharply. Jenn helped Cody sit up. She picked his straw cowboy hat up off the ground, dusted it off and laid it next to him. They both stared at Cody\u2019s ankle as it turned into a purplish color and swelled to twice the size of his other ankle. \u201cWhat do we do?!\u201d Jenn cried. She grabbed Cody\u2019s cell phone and peered into the screen \u201cNo signal Babe! AND\u2026 there\u2019s only 8% left on your battery!?!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the truck got closer the white powder of the dust stuck to our sweaty skin, leaving us looking somewhat ghost like. I looked at Jenn and laughed at her appearance. She was red from the harsh winds and the hot sun just a few seconds ago now completely white as a sheet. She had a big smile as help had arrived just in time. Jenn helped me to my feet, and I winced in pain as I tried to put weight on my ankle.<br>\r\n \"Just sit down and relax\" Jenn told me.<br>\r\n \"Hey!\" the man in the truck bellowed, \" Who are y'all? and why are you trespassing on my property?\"<br>\r\n \" Please\" I begged the man.\" our car ran out of..\"<br>\r\n \" Good way to get yourself killed..\" the man cut me off.<br>\r\n He climbed out of the truck. He was tall and slender, His dark weathered skin, gave him an appearance of being older than the two of us. He was clean shaven and well dressed. He sort of looked out of place out here in the middle of nowhere on this cattle ranch, and that beat up truck he was driving didn't  match his slacks and his starched shirt. <br>\r\n \"WHO ARE YOU? WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?\" the man in the suit asked again.<br>\r\n \"Ummm our car.. it broke down and we were thirsty we came to the windmill for a drink.. our phone isn't working. Cody is hurt. Please can you help us?\" Jenn pleaded.<br>\r\n The man laughed. That sort of evil laugh from the villians in the movies.. <br>\r\n \"Please sir, can we get a ride to town?\" I begged.<br>\r\n The man reached back into the truck and grabbed a long bladed knife.. <br>\r\n\" You know too much\" He told us<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jenn and I asked simultaneously.<br>\r\n We looked at each other, and Jenn reached for me. Grabbing my arm she pulled me to my feet.<br>\r\n\"Run!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n I was in pain. Thoughts crossed through my mind. Should I stay and fight? Maybe if I disabled the man we could steal his truck. I charged towards this man, shoulders hunched forward and gave a hard blow to his mid section. The man stumbled backwards, then swung his large forearm towards me, I barely missed the knife point as I bobbed my head sideways. I reached for the man and grabbed his shirt. Jenn had found a short piece of pipe, left over from some sort of repair of the mill. She flung it over her head and smashed it on the man's head. His knees buckled and he let go of his grip on me.. We quickly jumped into his already running pickup. </span></div></div>",

Cody scrambled to pull his bare and lifeless foot into the shelter of the vehicle. \u201cI don\u2019t know! But he\u2019s PISSED!\u201d replied Cody as he labored for his next breath of air. Jenn\u2019s tremoring hand fumbled fiercely to put the truck gear into reverse. The lover\u2019s bodies both powerfully bolted forward as Jenn stomped on the gas pedal full throttle. Cody\u2019s forehead smashed into the dusty dashboard. Blood began to trickle down into his eyes. \u201cShit Babe!\u201d he cried out. \u201cOh DEAR GOD!\u201d  Jenn shrieked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenn pushed the gear into drive and sped off in the direction of their stranded car. Cody looked back to see the man lifting himself off of the ground. A cloud of caliche dust engulfed the dry skinned creepy brute. \u201cFaster, Jenn! He\u2019s awake!\u201d Cody clamored. \u201cThere\u2019s our car!\u201d Jenn declared as she pointed towards Cody\u2019s direction. \u201cKeep going! Nothing in there that will help us!\u201d Cody insisted. Without a second thought, Jenn hurriedly followed directions. A streak of a grayish glow passed quickly by the passenger window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody\u2019s complexion turned pale. He felt weak and like he wanted to faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer\u2026\u201d he muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn didn\u2019t hear his low-pitched call of her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer\u2026\u201d he stifled \u201cThere is a\u2026 oh my God!\u201d It felt as if he was choking on his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJENNIFER. There\u2019s a body in the back seat!\u201d</b> Cody was terror-stricken at the sight of this human being that lay uninvolved and indifferent just a few feet from himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenn looked over at Cody bafflingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn let go of the steering wheel and glanced into the back seat. At the sight of the corpse, she gasped for a breath of air. Her heart began to pound inside her chest. Her body went cold. Her skin numb. Darkness filled her eyes and blinded her. She felt her body weaken as she collapsed. She fainted and lay motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe dusty Ford pickup veered off the road and bounced uncontrollably through a small ditch right before slamming through the triple strand barbed wire fence and colliding with a utility pole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the trucks horn reverberated through the dreary and isolated desert land. </span></div></div>",

A plume of white steam rose from the engine.<br>\r\n The old man was on his feet, he was moving swiftly towards the highway. \"They've seen me\" he thought aloud.. <br>\r\n Baxter Badd had recently been paroled, He had spent some time behind bars on drug charges, and an attempted murder case. He came to this ranch to seek solitude, and to gun down the man who had ratted on him, in his drug running excursion. Now these strangers had found his \"Hide Out\" and had found the body of the man he had just murdered, Badd's plan was to dump him out on this remote ranch and leave him for the coyotes and buzzards to pick apart piece by piece. Now he had two more bodies to deal with. Cody and Jenn. <br>\r\n He reached the fenceline and headed East, he had assumed the direction they would run would be back to their car broken on the side of the road. Maybe they would still be siphoning gas into it when he reached them. In the distance he saw the smoke rising and in the wind he could smell the antifreeze from the overheated Ford. He picked up his pace to a jog. When he reached the wrecked truck, Cody was still trying to re start it. <br>\r\n He ran to the truck and jerked open the driver's door grabbing Cody and flinging him to the ground. He reached back into the truck to grab the rifle hanging in the back window. He aimed it at Cody.<br>\r\n Slam- Jennifer had awoke and kicked the creepy man in the back just in the nick of time, the rifle rang out but he had lost his balance and the shot missed Cody by a few feet. Cody got up and ran towards the shaken man. He grabbed the rifle and tugged it away. He held it towards the murderer as Jenn got back into the truck and started it, she summoned for Cody to come on and limped the truck back to where they had left their stranded vehicle.  </span></div></div>",

I damn sure don\u2019t?\u201d Jenn took a deep breath and tried to calm herself by placing her left hand on her heart. Her right hand clutched that Smith &amp; Wesson as if it were her very life. Indeed, it just may be. <br>\r\nCody began earnestly searching the inside of the car for the tools he needed for his mission. Jenn stood guard, circling the parked vehicles as watchful and alert as a lioness protecting her cubs. Jenn cautiously surveyed the inside of the Ford truck. \u201cOh dear God\u201d she whispered when she glanced in the back at the spiritless shell of a man. Scanning the truck for any clue as to why this man wants to kill them. She spotted legal paperwork on the dash of the truck. Release papers dated for last week, Reeves County Detention Complex, located in Pecos, Texas. \u201cCODY!\u201d Jenn wailed his name like she\u2019d been hurt. \u201cThis man just got paroled from a Pecos Prison!\u201d Jenn also spotted an unopened ammunition can. She stretched into the backseat and yanked the metal can to her. \u201cI\u2019m putting this in the car!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn began her encompassing trail once again around the vehicles. She looked searchingly in all directions. Inspecting every inch of dirt as if it would tell her a story.  In the distance, she saw a shadow of man peaking over at them from behind a cliff.  \u201cThat sick Son-of \u2013a-Bitch isn\u2019t giving up, CODY!\u201d Jenn held up the rifle and aimed in the man\u2019s direction, made sure the safety was off and his shadow in the cross hairs of the scope. In a calm yet trembling voice, Jen whispered \u201cIf this asshole gives me the chance, I\u2019m going to kill him, graveyard dead.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Baxter Badd stood on a flat top ridge overlooking the two stalled vehicles, He had found his prey and he intended to kill them. He noted the red headed Cody,  attempting to use a make shift hose he had fashioned out of water bottles and a soda straw in order to transfer gasoline from the old Ford truck into the little Ford car. It appeared that Cody's plan wasn't working very well.. more gas was spilling on the ground than was going into the Ford Tempo's tank. The blond woman had his rifle, she looked intent to use it. Badd wondered if she had ever fired a gun before. All he had was a snub nosed .38 revolver he had taken after he had killed the Deputy Sheriff. The man who had found him and convicted him for transporting Cocaine a few years back in the town of Toyah Texas. He had recently been paroled and wasn't planning on going back to jail. He had resentment and planned the perfect murder while locked up and he wasn't going to let this young couple ruin it, now he had to get rid of them on the fly. If Jenn knew how to shoot, at this point she definitely had the advantage, he had the pistol but knew he would have to get closer for it to be effective. He also thought about once the gunshots started echoing through the hills, someone might hear them and come to investigate, for now he hid in the shade of a big boulder and tried to figure out a plan. Badd only hoped Cody's bad luck would hold out and he wouldn't be able to get enough gas into their car to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hurry Hunni\" Jenn ordered, \" This man isn't coming out of that hilltop.. yet, but we need to get outta here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenn scanned the hillside with her scope, she could no longer see the man, but she knew the general area he was hiding in,.\" He's right up there behind those rocks\" she called to Cody who was still intent on trying to get gas through his makeshift hose.<br>\r\n \"This is taking too long.. \" Cody growled.<br>\r\n Badd had crawled from behind the rock and slithered like a snake through the thorny brush and was edging his way down the steep hillside. Not a man of the Gospel but enough of a believer to pray that Jenn's rifle didn't find him out in the open. <br>\r\n Suddenly she spotted him, She released the safety on the rifle and steadied it, Badd moved once again out of view of the scope, she hurriedly scanned trying to spot him once more. <br>\r\n Pop Pop- two shots rang out and Jenn could hear the bullet ricochet off of the ford truck..<br>\r\n She instinctively ducked underneath the flat bed of the truck for safety..<br>\r\n \"Geez\" Cody exclaimed as he quickly jumped inside the car. \"Babe... are you okay?\"<br>\r\n \" I'm fine, but this son of a...\"<br>\r\n She fired a shot back from the rifle, rocks and dust spewed from the ledge above.. The shot had missed her moving target who was now up on his feet and running towards another large pile of boulders.<br>\r\n Bang- she fired again.. This time Baxter Badd stumbled forward.<br>\r\n \"Ayeeeeee\" He screeched out in pain. Jenn's bullet had landed in the back  of the man's left leg..<br>\r\nHe hit the ground and rolled firing twice more back at Jenn, Pop Pop...<br>\r\n Baxter knew he only had two bullets left he must make them count, He also knew he was bleeding, he must find cover and bandage himself before going any further..<br>\r\n Jenn loaded five more cartridges into her rifle.. she crawled towards her car and climbed into the backseat..<br>\r\n \"You okay baby?\" Cody once again questioned.<br>\r\n \" I'm scared sweetheart\" Jen choked out tears swelling in her eyes.. <br>\r\n \" We will get out of here.\" Cody Promised.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
