Normally it was his Mommy that took care of these sinfs, but she wasn't feeling good, so his daddy took the day off from work. \"Don't be, Sora. It's just an accident. Why don't you take a break from potty training.\" He comforted giving his son a pat on the head. \"Whaddya mean?\" Sora asked looking up in curiosity. \"I mean,  don't worry about the potty for awhile. Next time you gotta go pee or poop, just go in your diaper. You just have to tell me or a big kid if you have an accident, so we can get you in a clean diaper.\" He explained patiently. \"Okay Daddy, but does Riku count as a big boy?\" Chris thought for a moment on his son's question before replying...</span></div></div>",

Riku was completely potty trained after all, and he was pretty mature for his age. \"Cool, I'm gonna go play!\" Sora said running off to the islands. \"Wait a sec, you silly goose!\" Chris ordered chuckling and pulled him into his lap. \"I gotta change your diaper.\" He explained at Sora's suprised look. \"Oh!\" He replied nodding in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris chuckled once more before picking his son up. He carried him to his room and lied him on his bed. He grabbed a diaper, plastic pants,  and some wipes from on top the dresser and went to work changing him. \"Sora remember, tell me, or a big kid, when you have an accident. I don't want you to spend all day playing in a wet or poppy diaper.\" He warned sternly. \"Okay, Daddy!\" Sora agreed eaisly. Chris finished up changing Sora and gave the little a backpack filled with diapers and other supplies. Then, the boy  ran off to play. He was going to tell Sora that he forgot to put his shirts back on, but he figured it didn't matter. Almost everybody knew Sora still wore diapers, even among his friends. Plus, it was pretty warm out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora made it to the beach, not realizing that all of the adults and some big kids were keeping a close eye on him while he ran to the islands. They didn't want him to get hurt or anything. All of the kids who played in the islands were watched from afar by all the adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He giggled as the warm sand went in between his toes. He sat on the ground just to relax and enjoy the nice weather, the plastic pants kept the sand from getting into his diaper, and making it uncomfortable. He soon noticed his two good friends Kairi and Riku playing together. He could go and play with them, but he saw a tall guy with brown hair standing by the water. (Terra) He wanted to see what he was up to. Which did he choose?</span></div></div>",

He asked as he closed his eyes, seemingly sensing something. \"Uh huh, I wanna protect my mommy and daddy and all my friends too!\" Sora replied earnestly.

It was freaking embarrassing having his friend see him naked, but it'd be more embarassing if his crush found out he wore diapers! Riku was his best friend and a darn good one at that, but he liked to feel in charge.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A memory was being observed, by both it's creator and a third party. It was of a little boy lieing on his bed. On his dresser was a stack of diapers, that wans't too suprising, considering the boy was only 5. Plenty of little boys his age had a bed wetting problem. What was surprising, was it was only 9:00 a.m! There was no way any little boy would go to bed this early! That meant, Sora wore diapers during the day too! But, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamine listened in on the conversation between Sora and his mother. \"Mom, do I have to wear these?!\" He whined, as Mary, his mom, slid the diaper under his rear. \"Sweet heart, you've hardly made it to the potty at all this week.\" She explained not pausing in the process of diapering Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'll do better!\" He pleaded desperately \"This isn't a punishment Sora, it's just to make sure you don't make a mess.\" She explained gently and calmly. Finally, she taped the diaper on to her little boy. He looked calmer now, but he was still unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sora, you can still use the potty if you want, but I won't be upset if you decide you just wanna use your diaper.\" She explained, as Sora pulled on the red jump suit his Dad bought for him last week. It was quickly becoming his favorite outfit, and if Namine was seeing correctly, it was a simply smaller version of the one he wore currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, Mommy.\" Sora agreed, running off to play. Namine now had a choice to make. Would she alter Sora's memories and add herself to them  as a big sister and care taker? She knew the organization wanted Sora to be obessed with her, and she knew they didn't care how she did it. On the other hand, she could leave Sora's memories for now, and find out whether or not, he was still in diapers at age 14. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was her decision?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had used her powers to make Sora think she was his big sister. \"What's with the diaper, little brother?\" She asked sitting on the sandand pulling him into her lap. \"Mommy's making me wear it, 'cause I've been having accidents.\" He complained, not resisting as he was pulled into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look on the bright side, at least now you don't to worry about getting your clothes all yucky.
