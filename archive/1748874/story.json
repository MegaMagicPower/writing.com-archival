People were walking down the busy streets with their kids. Shops closed early in preparation for the street fair. Silverstone amusement park was ready to kick off its annual Halloween celebration extravaganza. Then all of hell broke loose as the reappearance of the undead drove the population into a panic. Crowds swarmed through the street, eager to escape the madness. Innocents were killed as the zombified army grew. In only 3 days time there was no one left alive... or was there? You must once again take control of a survivor as they try to escape the nightmare they've found themselves in... but it won't be easy. Unlike Bitterwood, Rustone is much more isolated from civilization and crawling with brand new types of zombies... along with some old favorites. Four heroic survivors made it out of Bitterwood alive... will anyone make it out of Rustone? Choose wisely and find out...</span></div></div>",

A fully loaded gun was tightly gripped in his hand and ready to fire should something come along. \"Fuck...\" Jack groaned as he closed the door behind him and admired the fresh blood smeared on the wall. \"This whole fuckin' place has gone to hell...\" Three days ago he had decided to check out and be on his way. Three days ago the hotel was overrun by creatures that were only supposed to exist in horror movies or comic books. He had spent the previous night partying with some \"friends\" who he had met up with after he won a $10,000 jackpot in the casino downstairs. He got up late the next morning at 1:34 p.m. with a hangover and about a fifth of the money he had won the previous night. A few pieces of underwear and an empty sea of wine bottles had told him all he needed to know about how the party had gone. He had though lady luck was back on his side after a few weeks of slowly and steadly getting back on his feet, but she was only being a tease before throwing him out on his ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman was attacked in the lobby by... a thing... with massive arms that crushed her to a pulp. Jack had been heading to the front desk when he nearly caught a chair to the face traveling about sixty miles an hour. It missed him by inches. No one had known where the thing had come from, but it was soon joined by other walking horrors that made quick work of the guests. The security team fought valantly to the last man... although in the end it did little to stem the tide of oncoming zombies. Most of the guests made a vain attempt to get to the doors and fire exits... few even made it outside. Knowing he had no chance of making it to the city from the desert with these things about Jack made a run for the elevator and pressed a random button as quickly as he could. The door closed just as a cocktail waitress with a bleeding neck wound collasped on the floor in front of him. The last sight he saw as the elevator made its ascent was of a massive zombie closing in on the defenceless woman. Seconds after the door closed he heard her scream, a scream that would haunt his nightmares for the rest of his life... however short it may be. By chance, the floor the elevator stopped on was 7, the very place he had just left mere minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weak laugh escaped his lips at the sheer irony of it all. The screams continued as he walked back into his room to enjoy his last few minutes of life. Hours pasted as he druck away his sorrows with the alcohol he still had. The only thing that kept him from commiting suicide by overdose was the thought of being trapped without booze should he fail. On his second day he finally ran out of the cheap beer he had drunk once he had polished off the rest of the wine. Fortunately, the screams had worn down to about once or twice every few hours and he was so inebriated he didn't care. \"I shudda O.D.'d when I had the chance.\" He slurred as he looked at the barrier preventing entry to his room and fell asleep. On his third day he grew tired of waiting for death to come and decided to go find it on the outside. It might not be quick or painless, but it was better then waiting for one of those things to find him. He was about to take down the barricade when he noticed something sitting under an overturned glass bowl on the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fully loaded handgun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had no idea how it had gotten there or how he had failed to notice it before now. It was possible he had taken it off a security guard when he ran, after all, he had such an adrenaline rush at the time that with everything else going on the whole event was a huge blur. Maybe it had belonged to someone who he had invited up to his room, he DID only know those people for a few hours before he got drunk off his ass at his success party. He couldn't know for sure, and probably would never know. However, one thing was for sure... lady luck wasn't ready to completely abandon him, at least not yet. He walked down the hall and looked out over the balcony at the courtyard in the center of the hotel below. Images from his brief stay here flashed through his mind. What was once a bright and cheery 5 star hotel was now a glorified graveyard. Bodies were strewn about all over the ground, some sprawled out in chairs, some floating in the pool, some were even hanging off the balconies across from him. There was some movement and noise on the floors below him and he could see zombies shambling in the bright midday sunlight of the courtyard, though, thankfully no one was left on this floor. At least, no one breathing. Jack took a deep breath... and headed out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack was much more confident now that he had a relible weapon to defend himself with, though he still exercised extreme caution as he made his way to the elevator. As soon as it arrived he got on and headed to the ground floor, ready to escape this hell once and for all. All he had to do was get to his car in the parking lot and he could drive and drive until Rustone was out of his life forever. \"Maybe I'll head to Canada next, more snow, but less zombies.\" He joked to himself to keep his spirits up. The glass door opened with a soft ding as Jack stepped out into what remained of the lobby. The whole placed looked like a massive crime scene with dozens of bodies laying about, some in pieces, some little more than a bloody smear with a few entrails. Over on one of the walls were the words \"help me\" written in blood just above a corpse with her stomach carved open. \"Jesus H. Christ...\" Jack wispered as he stood for a moment to take it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had regained his senses he stepped forward towards the front doors across a room that seemed to be a mile long. Footsteps echoed throughout the large room as Jack stepped carefully around dead bodies and their luggage in the eerie dimness. \"Of course the lights had to be out...\" He said sarcasticly as he tried not to imagion what might jump out at him from a dark corner of the room.<br>\r\nJust as he was about to push open the doors that would lead to his salvation Jack felt a chill run down the back of his neck as something stirred in the darkness behind him. He turned around and was met with the most horrifying sight of his life. There, in the darkness, was a large humanoid figure with glowing red eyes and a pentagram mark taking up most of its forehead. Even in the poor lighting Jack could tell the thing was smiling at him all the way from the other side of the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second passed as Jack stuggled frantically to find the strangth to push the door open before the abomination charged at him with a mighty roar. \"OH SHIT!\" Jack swore as he accidentaly shoved the door open behind him, causing him to fall onto the hard sidewalk outside. The warm sunlight was hardly a blessing as Jack hurried to his feet and was horrified to see that the thing had already made it through 2/3 of the lobby and was about to tear through the door. Mere seconds before the impact Jack managed to dive off to the side to avoid the blast of metal shrapnel and glass that exploded forth as the level 3's powerful claws obliterated one of the doors. The second door soon followed as the powerful zombie took its first few steps outside, its eyes searching for the man who had just narrowly avoided a quick and painless death at its hands...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!\" Jack whispered under his breath as he ran down the sidewalk towards the parking lot on the north side of the building. Another roar from behind quickly told him that the thing had once again spotted him. No easy escape for him today. \"Shit!\" Jack cursed as he spun around and fired 2 shots into the things chest as it charged after him. A few trails of blood began pouring down its stomach, but that was it. \"Just what in the high hell ARE you?!\" Jack groaned, exasperated. The monster made another swipe for him just as he turned the corner, narrowly avoiding death once again as bits of the building flew past him. He spotted his car, but knew it was too far away for him to make it in time so he turned around for what would probably be the final fight of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the level 3 didn't move or make a sound... it just stared at Jack as if it was mildly surprised that he had given up. Not one to play the fool Jack took this oppertunity to draw his gun and make the first strike. Two more bullets sunk deep into its pale grayish-white flesh, but the creature payed its minor wounds no mind as he readied itself for another charge. This was it, Jack wasn't sure how many bullets he had left and the ones he had already spent didn't do a damn thing. Poker had taught him to make the best of the hand you were dealt and that even a poor deal could be turned into a jackpot with a little risk and some skill. Jack swallowed hard as he took careful aim with whatever ammo he had left. The thing was almost upon him when he focused on his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe furiously squeezed the trigger of the gun as many times as he was able while keeping the firearm pointed at its target. The last thing Jack saw as he lept out of the way was a flash of red cover the monsters face. The gun, long since emptied, fell out of his hand onto the ground as he backed up against the car. His last ace in the hole had been spent. A gentle breeze began blowing as his foe remained motionless. If it showed any sign of movement, any hint of life, it would all be over... \"Well...?\" Jack asked as he tried catching his breath. The level 3 zombie fell forward without a sound other than that of its dead body hitting the pavement. It was gone, killed with a bullet that destroyed the mark keeping it alive. \"So thats it... you gotta destroy that glowing symbol on their forehead...\" Jack noted as he picked up his empty gun. \"Guess thats one good thing to know...\" In less than a minute he was pulling out of the hotel and heading onto the highway...</span></div></div>",

Guess I'll have to continue on foot for now. If I can find a gas station I might be able to obtain a new car with some fuel.\" With that he took one last quick look around and stepped out of his car and onto the sidewalk.

The mess of the torn Halloween decorations and dead bodies were much easier to see up close now and sent a few shivers up Jack's spine as he walked. When he came to the end of the street he noticed a large banner hanging from what looked like a hospital. The only symbol on it was a big blue R in a circle that was painted on with a few splashes of other colors. Crowley wasn't sure what it meant, but there was probably a good chance there were survivors nearby. The question is, would it be worth wasting time on that could instead be used to locate a gas station?</span></div></div>",

He approached the door cautiously, gripping his Uzi tightly.  Suddenly, a middle aged man with black dreadlocks, wearing a camouflage jacket, blue cargo pants, and black biker boots leapt out of the room.

In all honesty floor 3 didn't look much better than floor 7, but at least Jack was a few floors closer to making his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I've got a gun and I've got a freakin' axe... bring it.\" He taunted, knowing that no one was around to hear him. He walked down the short hallway and looked over the balcony at the pool just a few floors below. \"God... it looks even worse up close... those poor bastards didn't stand a chance against these monsters...\" He turned away and continued on to room 148, ignoring the others along the way. \"If there isn't something here I'm just going to try and make a run for my car, even if those things get me its better than spending the last hours of my life going through dead people's stuff.\" The door to the room in question soon came into view near the end of a darkened hallway and Jack carefully made his way over and went inside. It was hard to see as the only light came from a window that was covered up by a shade, but there was just enough for Jack to be able to search the area directly in front of it. The creepy twilight effect unnerved him, but he soon came upon a tiny flashlight keychain attached to a handbag. \"I suppose this is better than nothing...\" Jack sighed as he put it in his pocket. \"If I need to search any cabnets or closents this'll be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to walk over to remove the shade covering the window when he heard somethin stir in the bedroom. \"That can't be good...\" He whispered to himself as he pulled the cover back to allow a wave of warm sunlight to flood into the room. \"Please don't let that girl be in here... please don't let that girl be in here...\" Jack chanted softly to himself as sat his axe down on the couch and approached the door with just his gun. He turned the knob and the door swung open as Jack readied himself to fire at anything that jumped out at him. \"Oh my god...\" He moaned as he covered his mouth with his hand. There, on the bed was the exact same girl he had seen a few days before, the one who had handed him the number and asked him to drop by before he left. Both her wrists were slit and a blood coated razor was tangled in the red sheets under her arms. \"Fuck.\" Jack groaned as he turned to leave, only to hear a deep growl echo from the shadows behind him. He spun back around just in time to catch a flash of red as something tackled him to the ground. The gun fell from his loosened grip as the massive zombie who had him pinned to the ground began choking him with its large hands...</span></div></div>",

It had been all alone for a while now and a human had finally wandered in of its own free will! Jack wheezed a bit as he made a grab for the handgun, but it was just out of reach, another inch and he would have had it. \"God damn you...!\" Jack choked out as he delivered a punch to the dead mans jaw. A tooth slipped from its mouth as blood began running down its lips, but it kept its hands in place. \"This is it... I'm going to die...\" Jack though as he began to feel lightheaded. With the last of his strangth Jack twisted his body away from the zombie. The monster didn't even notice as it was too busy watching Jack's face change color, but it was enough to give the sauve gambler one last chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried desperately feeling around for his gun as his vision began dimming. \"No! NO! Don't pass out now, god damn it!\" Jack thought as his hand felt nothing but an empty floor. Jack began to faint right as his hand touched cold metal and without a word he pointed the gun and fired 2 shots into the zombies chest. The man groaned as blood began covering his chest and softened his grip a little. \"Thank god, one more.\" Jack whispered as he took aim and put a bullet in the bastards left eye. The body went limp and collapsed just as Jack himself passed out. It had been a close call, yet he had managed to survive by the skin of his teeth. \"Guess lady luck has decided to come back to me...\" Jack said softly as the room disappeared in a sea of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a while before Jack woke up, though wether it had been hours or merely minutes he was unsure of. The sunlight from the open window warmed his head and a thick liquid could be felt slowly running down his body. Jack opened his eyes and shielded them as he shoved the body of the man aside and pulled his legs out from under him. He had a bit of a headache and his suit was now badly stained with blood, but other than that he was fine. \"Christ, how long was I out...?\"  He groaned as he picked up his gun and axe and walked over towards the door. \"Thats it, I'm getting out of this place... now.\" He opened the door and began walking down the hallway towards the elevator when he heard a man call for help. \"Hey, that sounded like it came from close by!\" Jack shouted as he began looking around to see where the cry for help had come from. There, on the balcony across from him, was a middle aged man grappling with a strange zombie with glowing green eyes. \"What the hell...? What is that thing?!\" Jack gasped as the man screamed again, this time a lot louder...</span></div></div>",

A pair of glowing green eyes peered inside from the shadowed hallway leading to the front door. \"Shit, that thing has green eyes... it must be some kind of different variant of stiff than the slow red eyed one.

As soon as he reached the door at the end of the upstairs hallway he turned the knob, only for the door to stop suddenly after opening only an inch. \"Damn it, the door must be barricaded on the other side!\" Jack cursed as he moved over to the side window and smashed it with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window was fairly small, but just big enough to fit a large human male if need be. Jack wasted no time in pulling a chair out of the opening and throwing it aside as he climbed inside the managers office onto a wooden desk. By now the Infector had cleared the stairs and was seconds away from following Jack into the room.

The rotten bunch which had ganged-up on him in the Palace was still all eager to brawl'n'bite Jack to death. Yet something happened that moment. It felt like the Devil itself had re-spun the wheel of fortune. Zombies had hunger and dark magic on their side. Film heroes had guns to shoot zombies in the head. All Jack had before, was the chance for a most unwelcome gruesome death. Not anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheel was turning and the dice were rolling. \u201cMaybe the Reaper did send his sissies, yet now the God of gamblers has brought in me!\u201d Jack thought to encourage himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw one more bottle into the face of one of the rotting punks encircling him. One swift scan through the room, so he an estimation of how long they would need to reach him. And then he faced the closest of the Bitches, the one which had tried to get behind the bar on its open side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here, Rotmouth! Daddy has some fine extra sugar for you, bitch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zombie seemed not impressed at all by those words. It was a notch more impressed by the brutal kick Jack unleashed into its stomach though. Before it crumbled in, Jack had already grabbed its head, given a face-smash upon the bar and a neck-break to finish it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurviving Mini-Vegas, years on the streets and the boredom of all those hotel rooms had left plenty of time to see those martial arts workouts on TV and practice them, along with some housewife yoga, whenever Jack needed to make himself tired enough to sleep. Finally that waste of time proved itself to be an investment after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Zombies, obviously smart enough to cooperate jumped towards Jack. Jack spun around, quick steps backwards to make his next move. The World Wrestling Federation would have cheered in Jack's personal opinion! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack clawed the heads of the two jumpers and smacked them against each other as brutal as he could. Death-Defiance shining from his eyes and a logic-banning grin upon his lips. He knew it! The Zombies took a test-bite off each other, damn gluttons among cannibals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack withdrew to the closest table, knowing time was running out. He turned a table upside down, kicked-free one of the table legs and readied his makeshift weapon. Smacky bash into rotten face one, even more smacking bash into rotten face two. Finally a stab through the eye of the first jumper driving forcefully into the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack kicked another table-leg free. He had a plan now, one option out without being a walking corpse. Yet for now three more zombies were eager to get him. They never took time to mourn their losses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second former jumper lost his right eye when jack smashed his skull from the side. But the rotten punk did not rise up. Jack had no other choice at hand, he kicked one of the zombies' legs away and clobbered it down. Then he impaled its skull by driving the table-leg in with all the force he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenal rush was fading off and jack felt exertion of his muscles and truth be mentioned, some fear. He would have given much to... No! He DID this to ever sit in a comfortable casino again and smile for knowing, that the best prostitute of the service awaited him in his hotel suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe readied the two remaining table legs and moved back, buying himself some time to breath.

Still, Jack knew a safe bet when he saw it and quietly walked up with his new toy ready to fire. The place looked pretty bad with blood smears and broken glass everywhere, though it at least looked like a good number of people got away safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead was an abandoned cargo truck filled with snack cakes visible through the partially opened back door. Jack had found some rations and a little water back at the military base but knew he'd need food more than he needed extra ammo. After removing some of his spare bullets he stuffed some of the snack cakes into his pocket and climbed up onto the top of a nearby RV to get onto the roof of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance he could see Ruststone further up the road as well as what appeared to be a wrecked military helicopter crashed at the foot of a small hill. While Jack was planning his escape back to the city something else caught his eye... movement near the front of the bridge. He walked over to the edge of the truck to get a better look but was horrified at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crashed city bus had suffered a nasty wreck that had sent the front end off the bridge and wedged the back end into what could only be described as a vehicle sandwich. This left Jack very little room to cross the bridge and get past the zombies that were now piling out of the crashed vehicles up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Jack considered turning back only to see the way he came now cut off by a large horde of zombies, several of which had been obscured by a large semi truck. \"Shit, no way they won't see me if I go back that way.\" he cursed as he walked back to the front of the truck and jumped down onto the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traffic jam in front of him was bad enough that he might be able to just get across by hopping from roof to roof. \"Here goes.\" Jack said confidently as he leaped from the hood of the truck onto a van and then to the side of an overturned truck much like the one he had just come from. In minutes he was just a few feet above a sea of zombies and about three fourths of the way across the bridge, the only obstacle left was the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of things Jack had only 3 options: He could jump down and try to move past the end of the bus still on the bridge and climb up the vehicles to the other side, he could try to send the bus the rest of the way off the bridge or he could try to make the long jump from where he was standing and hope he'd be able to grab onto the bus and pull himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the options seemed great but he was out of options at this point...</span></div></div>",

As she looked around the outside world her eyes fell upon a grisly corpse. A fat bloated man was laying on the walkway next to the stairs. His head and entire body looked as if it had been ripped away, but that was NOTHING compared to the thousands of blood red ants moving in and out of the desecrated body. Marching all across the rails and carrying what looked like raw meat with them as they headed to their various destinations. Marie immedately turned away and threw up in disgust on the floor and part of the wall. \"Hey, I thought I heard you throw up! You okay in there Marie?!\" Her sister called as she began washing her hands. \"Oh... Oh god...\" Marie groaned as she struggled not to vomit a second time. \"Are you okay, Marie?! Answer me!\" Fransisca called out, with an agitated and more harsh tone to her voice. \"I'm... I'm okay...\" Marie groaned as she laid down on the bed and rested her head on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated this. She and her sister were only passing through Rustone. They were only going to stay a little while. Now she and her sister were caught up in some kind of zombie apocolypse in the middle of nowhere. Marie buried her face in the pillow as she let out every emotion she had felt over the past three days. She wished she were with her father right now, she wished she were anywhere but here. They were supposed to arrive there yesterday, did their father know what had happened. Or their mother? Were they even still alive? The tears burned and stung Marie's rosy red face as she hugged the pillow for comfort. \"Why... did... this... happen...?\" She choked out through a sore throat. Her world had always been sunny and bright, even through the worst of times. Now she felt she would never feel warm sunlight again, even though the heat of the afternoon sun was slowly creeping over the small motel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're out of tampons, I just used the last one.\" Fransisca said as she threw the empty box in the trash and opened the door to make sure her sister hadn't suffered a complete breakdown. \"Are they... are they still out there?\" She asked in a stern, yet worried tone. Marie simply nodded her head without looking up from the pillow. \"Shit... its been three days then...\" Fransisca noted as she sat down on the side of the bed. \"Marie... you've got to stop crying. I know you're upset, hell, I want to fucking burn this whole city to the ground... but we're out of food, we're out of water, and, worst of all, out of goddamn tampons. We need to do something... its clear help isn't going to arrive... at least not before we're dead...\" Marie's sobbing grew softer as she took large gasping breaths. \"I... know... *sniff* But... But... what can we do...?\" Fransisca put a hand on her younger sisters shoulder. \"Looks like we'll have to go out there... and try to find help. If two teenage girls have survived this long by themselves there has got to be other people still alive out there. Maybe we can find them... maybe we can get out of this city and finally see dad...\" Marie lifted her head off the pillow a little to look at her sister. \"Daddy? You... you think he's still alive?\" Fransisca nodded her head and smiled (a rare occurence for her) as she got up from the bed. \"He married mom, so there's no way he's dead yet.\" Fransisca joked. \"I don't think that old bastard would let himself die before her.\" Marie forced a weak smile as she rubbed her eyes. \"Heh heh, you know you shouldn't talk like that...\" Fransisca lost her smile and rolled her eyes. \"Great, the zombies arn't bad enough. You're more worried about having a clean mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if we die? I don't want god to not let my sister into heaven because she doesn't act right.\" Marie said, her voice slowly returning to its normal sweet tone. Her sister merely groaned. \"Please. If there was a god, why did he let this happen? Why didn't he protect us? Why didn't he stop d... You know what? Forget it. If clinging to the crap they taught you in church will help get us out of here go ahead and believe it. I'm going to be rational and think like a sane human being. C'mon... lets get out of here. \" Marie wiped her eyes one last time and got off the bed. \"O-okay, just let me grab one thing...\" She said meekly as she picked up her purse off the table next to the bed and put a bible that had been sitting next to the lamp in it. \"Don't tell me you're really gonna take that worn out old thing.\" Fransisca scoffed as she picked up her own purse. \"Its not gonna help any.\" Marie was quiet for a few seconds before replying. \"Maybe. Maybe it'll keep our spirts up... and its not like its gonna do any good sitting in this dusty old room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just don't starting chanting or some crap while we're sneaking by the zombies. You do that, I'll shove that damn thing up your ass.\" Fransisca taunted as she took a pack of cigarettes out of her purse along with a siver lighter with a stylized horse on it. \"You don't have to believe in god like I do... But I wish you'd stop smoking...\" Marie said as she zipped up her own purse. \" Oh whatever. Its not likely I'll end up living long enough to get lung cancer or some shit. A good smoke is more important to me then a box of fresh tampons... and my packs only got 2 left.\" Fransica said as she lit her cigarette and inhaled its taste into her mouth. \"Besides, you should be thankful. If I didn't have these to relax me I'd have probably killed you by now.\" Marie was the one to roll her eyes this time as she walked over to the door. \"Just don't blow that stuff into my face... ready?\" Fransisca picked up her knife off the table and got Marie one from the kitchen. \"Yeah, lets head out, but first take this.\" She said as she handed her sister her knife. \"And you use that if you have to... I know you don't like violence, but those ARN'T people out there...\" Marie nodded and followed her sister out the door.</span></div></div>",

It was all so much to take in that they barely noticed a police officer stumble out from behind an over turned car. \"Oh thank goodness, mr. police man!\" Marie called out, only to fall silent when she realized the person before her was no longer human. A soft groan escaped the mans lips as he raised his head and stared at the two living humans with pure hate in his glowing red eyes. \"God damn it, Marie, he's one of them!\" Fransisca called as she grabbed her sister by the arm and pulled her along past the rotting corpse. \"Ah!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marie Lopez sat shivering in the matinence room under the roller coaster at Silverstone amusement park. The night air was thick with a cool breeze and the cries of the undead who were making their way through the park. It had been an entire day since she and her sister were seperated and Marie wasn't even sure if she was still alive. Her eyes were still red from all the crying she had done since she got here which had thankfully gone unnoticed by the zombies roaming the park outside. \"We... we were just passing through...\" Marie choked out as she tried to get ahold of herself. Her entire world had always been bright and full of sunshine, even when she was sad she knew things would get better so long as she had her family and her friends. Now she was alone in a strange place without either in the middle of the last thing she had ever wanted to experience. Her world had gone dark, her hopeful sunny demeaner had left her, and she had no way of knowing how she would even survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand tightened on the crowbar she had picked up when she was still with her sister as Marie began singing softly to herself. \"Jesus loves me... this I know... for the bible t-tells me so...\" It was hard to hold back the fresh tears that were forming on the edges of her eyes, but she was starting to feel a bit braver as she went along. \"Little ones to him belong... for they are w-weak, but he i-is strong...\" She wiped her eyes as she stood up and looked out the window at the eeriely empty park. There were only a few weak zombies in sight, shambling along out in the open next to food stands and attractions. Marie felt an ice cold chill run down her spine even though she knew the bushes hid her quite well from the walking corpses. She still had trouble believing that this was all real, that something this horrible could really happen. \"Its the end of days...\" She moaned softly as she sunk back down to the floor. \"I'm not getting out of here alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Marie consitered the unthinkable, walking outside and just letting them have her. It would be quick and mostly painless... maybe she'd even get luckly and have one of them snap her neck. \"Oh god... oh god no...\" She whispered to herself as she came to her senses. \"I... I can't just give up... I have to be strong...\" She said with as much determination as she could muster. \"I... have to find my sister...\" She looked down at the crowbar in her hand with slightly blurred vision and took a deep breath. It was heavy, much heavier than she had expected a crowbar to be, but it would surely put an end to whatever she swung it against. The thought of killing anything repulsed her, yet she soon came to the grim realization that disposing of these things was a kindness. \"Mercy.\" She whispered as she walked over to the door. \"Peace for the dead. I have to do this... I have to be strong.\" With that, she opened the door and walked into the worst nightmare of her entire life...</span></div></div>",

Marie took the note and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-To whoever finds this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've stashed a lot of guns and ammo in the back seats of my truck.  The gas tank is full and there are several spare gas tanks in the back seat as well.

Even with the power shut off and the fireworks put away the stadium was still easy to spot no matter where you were in the park. It seemed to call out to Marie, as if it was telling her she would be safe there, protected from the zombies crawling about the park restlessly. With her crowbar in hand Marie began walking past the dark, silent rides and darkened booths and snack tents. The only movement came from a chilly wind blowing the various decorations and torn streamers about like the branches of ruined trees. The effect disturbed Marie, but she remained brave and kept moving as she got closer to the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost screamed when a dead clown lumbered out from behind the food stand she was passing, the only thing that stopped her was the disgusting sound her crowbar made as it struck him upside the head. She covered her mouth as the body fell to the ground, a large chunk torn from its already mangled forehead. Fresh blood poured from the wound, mixing with the dried blood and make up on the ghouls face. Marie took a step back and fell to the ground after failing to steady herself. Tears began forming in her eyes as she dropped the crowbar to the ground with a light thud. \"I'm s-sorry... I'm so sorry...\" Marie choked out as she wiped her eyes on her shirt. She felt horrible, not just with the zombie she had just killed, but sick with fear at how close the thing had been to getting her. If she had been a second slower the large man would have likely pinned her... and that would have been it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie picked up her crowbar and look up at the stadium walls under the starry night sky. She was much closer now, just a little bit further and she could hopefully rest. \"I-I've got to be strong...\" Marie said as she slowly stood up. \"I can't give up now.\" She stepped over the body of the slain corpse and moved on. Soon she came to the glass doors of the stadium, which were strongly locked, but had been shattered with some type of blunt instrament, leaving a space just big enough for Marie to crawl inside. She swept away some of the broken glass with her foot and climbed through the small hole. The inside was very dark, but there was enough light coming in through the shattered doors to allow Marie to see some stairs leading to a higher floor, as well as the front desk. At one time it had been manned by a vendor who sold cheap curios and novelties at high prices, now it might have something worth scavenging... if there was even anything left...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, that is exactly what she found underneath a pile of discarded t-shirts laying on the floor, along with a small pack of batteries and a note. It seemed to have been hastily scrawled out in ink with a few splotches here and there. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, Johnson and Craig didn't make it back. I'm going out there. If I die and anyone finds this, we managed to barricade or seal off most of the stadium, but somehow they got in. Not many, but be careful if you go looking around. I've hidden a few supply catches all around the place, covered in park t-shirts or placed them next to souveners. Everyone else just uses an \"R\" symbol, think I heard em' say it stood for resupply. None of that nonsense here, you find anything next to a blue item go ahead and take it. But DO NOT touch anything near a red item or so help me god one of us will hunt you down ourselves. We might NEED those supplies... and we already had to kill Ann. Stay alert, stay focused, and for god's sake, stay away from the windows and doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Saul<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Marie whispered and she looked over the note again before putting it away. \"Those things managed to get in, but there may be some more stuff here. I best look around... maybe I can even find a safe place to spend the night.\" She clicked the flashlight on and made her way over to the stairs. There were a few bloodstains on the wall and signs of a struggle, but no bodies meant the survivours who had fought here likely got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second floor was a little worse off than the first, with a dead body covered in a blanket to greet Marie as she walked past a couple broken chairs and a ruined vending machine, the only remains of one of the barricades that had saved the survivours here from a quick death on the first day. As grim as the situation seemed, Marie still felt safer here than outside, where she would be easy prey for a group of these things. \"At least in this creepy place I only have to worry about a couple dozen at a time instead of an entire horde... if there are even that many left.\" She said as she tightened her grip on her crowbar. Marie continued to walk down the vast empty hallway past a few restrooms, snack shops, and vending machines, careful to keep her eyes on any spot that something could leap out at her. Soon she came to a branched off hallway leading a little further towards the center of the stadium. At its end was a door leading outside to where Marie guessed the upstair seats were. Should she go and check out the view of the stage or stay inside and keep following the main hallway?</span></div></div>",

The two had been staying at a motel and Marie wanted to visit the water park before they left while her sister did not. The last time they had seen each other was now 3 days ago when Marie left the motel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure her sister was still alive since she was very smart and tough but couldn't shake the worry that something bad may have happened to her. They had been together their whole life and were there for each other during all of the bad times, like their parents divorce. Now she was all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie stabbed a twitching corpse laying on the ground in the back of the head with her cleaver and wiped away the tears forming in her eyes. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...\" she repeated to herself as she started walking towards the front gate. Just as she was about to head out into the parking lot to grab her car a round from a hunting rifle dropped a level 2 zombie that had been rapidly approaching her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marie turned around she nearly screamed at the small horde of level 1 zombies that were closing in on her. \"Hurry! Up here!\" a man with a bandana wrapped around his head called out from the ski lift station overlooking the main pool. The zombies still approached but the sight of another human being gave Marie the courage to fend off her attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran for the station the man kept firing his hunting rifle and killing whatever zombies got too close. Marie even managed to take out a fat man in swimming trucks who attempted to ambush her her and sliced off his rotting jaw as she moved past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we need to get out of here!\" the man called as Marie quickly ran up the stairs to the ski lift station and climbed over a small barricade he had set up near the top of the stairs. \"Alright cutie, you follow my lead and I'll keep you alive.\" the man said as he prepared the lift to take them over the pool. \"My name is Marie, it's nice to meet you.\" Marie said as she followed closely behind the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about introductions later, climb in, sit down and do exactly as I say.\" he replied as the lift carried them over the crimson waters of the pool below. \"Normally, we'd jump in the pool and escape that way but these things already have the waters infested so we'll be riding up to the main station where my group is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride over the pool was short and the two survivors were soon behind the safe walls of the heavily fortified main lift station. A single female survivor covered in tattoos and a pink bucket hat was there to greet them and help them off after their ordeal. \"Hey Sasha, we got another live one here. I've gotta take the supplies I found to storage, can you explain things to her?\" the man in the hat asked as he took a small backpack off and began walking towards the main room. \"Sure, we were just about to have dinner and it'll be nice to have another woman with us..\" Sasha replied as she reached out to shake Marie's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, welcome to our little resort group. That guy who brought you here is Blake, I'm Sasha and we have four other people in the main room who you'll meet in a minute. Their name's are Sid, Alex, Leo and Monique.\" Sasha said as she led Marie into the main room where four other people were lounging about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a surfer looking guy in a wetsuit with goggles around his neck sitting on the floor reading a magazine, one was a fat guy sleeping in a chair, and the last two were a couple holding hands on a couch. The man wore a pair of glasses along with a plain white t-shirt and cargo shorts and the woman was still in her bikini, much like Marie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room itself looked like a ski lodge resort lobby and even had an authentic fireplace with several paintings hanging on the nearby walls. Aside from that were two couches and three chairs along with a table in the very center. Of all the places to be trapped during the end of the world this place really didn't look half bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do next on our little tour?\" Sasha asked as Marie looked around.

A bit of drool ran down the dead girl's mouth as her glowing red eyes focused on her would-be prey. With one swift motion the tip of the katana was dyed red and poking out of the girl's back. She let out a soft moan and collapsed to the ground as Kenji retracted the blade from her now destroyed heart. He wiped if off on his shirt and looked over the pile of corpses he had amassed over his brief stay here with sadness in his eyes. Outside the dojo was a trail of murdered zombies leading all the way back to his house. He wasn't sure exactly how many he had killed over the last three days, but he was sure the number was well over a hundred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo him these walking dead were still people, they had loved ones, they had lives... and he had to kill them one by one in self defense. When they first showed up he had been walking home after a tiring day at the dojo teaching his class. He had though that old man that had bumped into him was only a drunkard... until he tried to rip the flesh from his bones with his teeth. A futile warning and a failed disabling strike later the man was on ground, coughing up blood from his crushed chest. Kenji would have reported himself to the police, but as he quickly found out... there were none left. After managing to reach his home he loaded up a bag of supplies and prepared to make his escape... the dojo was as far as he'd been able to get before he was forced to take shelter. He suffered from constant attack, though only from the weak undead that wandered in off the street. He had been able to dispatch them all effortlessly these past few days, but now he was starting to run low on supplies....</span></div></div>",

Four fresh bodies were sprawled out in the parking lot by the time Kenji made it to his van, all still bleeding from the devistating wounds inflicted upon them. \"I can't wait to get out of this city... even if hell itself is where I have to escape to.\" Kenji said grimly as he sat the supplies on the floor of the van and pulled the door shut before a limping dog managed to get in. A soft rain began pouring as Kenji pulled out onto the empty streets of Rustone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the better part of an hour Kenji simply drove around looking for a place he could salvage some supplies, only to see large crowds of zombies near any major store he came across. Even many of the smaller stores and shops had too many zombies for him to deal with only a katana. \"Everywhere, they infest this this place from the inside out... I need to get away from the center of the city...\" Kenji said as he made a turn onto the main road heading north. He didn't know the layout of the city very well, although he knew where all the major locations were. \"If I can make it out of the city I'll be able to get enough gas at the station out on the highway to make it to Vegas, if it hasn't met the same fate as Rustone...\" Kenji thought to himself as he looked out his windows at the devistation that had occured after the last 3 days. \"But before I do that I'll need to atleast stock up on water in case this piece of junk breaks down out in the desurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, as if on cue, the aged vehicle sputtered and began slowing down. \"What?! No! I'm sorry, just please don't give out just yet!\" The van made it to the next intersection before it finally came to a stop. \"C'mon... c'mon... damn it!\" Kenji cursed as he stepped on the gas pedal to no effect. He was stranded with only his katana near the center of a city slowly overflowing with the undead. For the first time in his life he felt truly fearful that he may not make it out of this alive. He was just about to step outside and continue on foot when he noticed something he had overlooked before. The van had simply run out of gas as evidenced by the flashing light on the fuel gauge. \"That's right... I was going to get gas the next day, but then all this happened...\" He said as he turned away and got out onto the empty road.  After a quick look around Kenji realized he was on Clark street, which ment a gas station was less than a mile to the south. Of course, there was also an arcade nearby and the suburbs of Rustone were only a mile or so to the west. Seems Kenji has a rather important descision to make...</span></div></div>",

Then he climbed into the drivers seat and turned the ignition.  To his relief, the engine restarted.  He then slammed the accelerator, sending the van barreling toward the undead creatures.  \"Forgive me\" Kenji said to himself as he ran over several of them, crushing them under his wheels.

It would be impossible to tell which face showed more relief.  \"My name's Chris.\" the boy said.  \"Kenji.\" he replied, shaking his hand.  \"Need a ride out of this hellhole.\" he asked, laughing slightly.  \"What do you think?\" Chris asked in mock puzzlement.

Unlike many of the other kids his age he had struggled to beat even the first level of most of the games there, though he always had fun playing. \"Heh, I wonder if they still have Ms. Pac Man or Dig Dug?\" He said with a laugh as he stepped into the dimly lit room filled with glowing machines waiting for children to come in and play them. If not for the zombies walking the streets outside, it would have been just like any other day. Kenji walked towards the counter near the back without even noticing the blood smeared over the front of a pinball machine over next to the vending and change machines. \"Hello? Hello, is anyone here...?\" He asked as he looked around the shadowy room. Silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, why did I even bother coming in here? This is no time for nostalgia.\" Kenji muttered as he hopped over the counter. \"Hopefully, there's at least something here that can help me...\" Many of the shelves below the counter were empty or contained boxes of stuffed prizes for the crane machine. There was a handgun laying on the floor under an overturned box, but it was empty and the clip was missing. Nothing else of vaule could be found. \"Nothing.\" Kenji groaned as he kicked one of the boxes. \"Should I try the back room? I've already wasted enough time here... maybe I should just go.\" His desire to leave was strong... yet he couldn't shake the feeling that something else might be found in the back room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was in a small hallway that split off in three directions. To his left was a door next to a large glass window, clearly an office. To his right was a door that Kenji assumed led to a storage room of some kind. Lastly, at the end of the hallway was a door that must lead back outside. \"Looks like I got 2 choices...\" Kenji said as he opened the door to the office. \"Lets see what is in here first...\" The small room was clear of zombies, but had the bloodied corpse of a middle aged man sitting in a chair behind a desk. One eye was open in shock and the other had a pair of sissors jammed into it pretty deep. The ghouls entire face was covered in a dried and cracking layer of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me.\" Kenji whispered as he bowed his head in silence for a moment before beginning to search the room. There wasn't much to be found, but after a few minutes of searching Kenji came across a box of cigars and a notepad. He didn't smoke, but the cigars looked expensive and would likely be a good item to trade if he found other survivours. As for the notepad, it could be a big help for keeping track of important imformation. The last thing Kenji did before exiting the room was grab a couple pens from a knocked over plastic cup on the desk. \"Alright, this is a little better.\" He said as he closed the door back behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man hardly let out a groan as he slowly got back to his feet and began shuffling down the stairs after the much faster human. \"Blast, three days here and they're still gathering around the doors... I should have left when they were only a few in front of the building.\" Kenji muttered under his breath as he hid behind a row of slot machines to avoid dectetion by the large horde surrounding the broken front doors. They were only a few level one zombies aimlessly walking about the casino with the bulk near the main exit, this ment Kenji was safe from danger but would have to get them to move if he wanted his freedom. \"I ran out of water last night and I can't just drink alcohol...\" He said softly as he crept a bit closer to his goal. \"I'll have to get them away from those doors or I'll die in here before help can arrive.\" He didn't have any weapons other than his own two fists, which meant he would have to take his chances in the street until he found a better means of self defence... if he ever managed to get out of here alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They listened to the sounds made by the machines when they were played the other day, maybe if I can set off a jackpot they'll come over to investigate it.\" He noted as he ducked beneath a blackjack table. \"I'm not very lucky... heck I can't even win at video games, but I have to hope fate is on my side for this.\" He said a short prayer and silently moved over to a large machine that payed out a $50,000 top prize. He was fairly exposed here, but the distance and the long line of exotic potted plants helped obscure him from view. \"I just hope this works.\" He said as he sat the purse full of money he had collected on the floor and began playing the slots. After a few minutes the noise alerted a few zombies to his position and they began slowly searching for a way to get to him. \"No... c'mon I'm almost there, just a few more times... c'mon c'mon...\" He chanted as an obese woman lumbered her way around the corner and began walking up a short set of steps that would take her to Kenji. \"7...7...

He triped the woman with a foot sweep and crushed her head with a stomp as he delivered a blow that knocked the security guard backwards. The man's ribs cracked as he stumbled into the tourist and both fell back down the stairs. \"So much for them... now I've got to hurry up and set off this jackpot, I don't have much money left...\" With that Kenji quickly made his way back over to the machine as the other zombies began to investigate the noise coming from the two injured ones wiggling about on the bottom of the steps. \"No... hurry... hurry...\" Kenji whispered as he softly banged his fist on the machine. Another failure. Kenji was just about to take another spin when he noticed that more of the zombies were approaching the stairs... more than he could deal with by himself. \"No, this might be my last chance... please...\" Kenji begged as he turned the lever one last time and ran back around in the direction he had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the machine hit a jackpot he might be able to get outside, but if it didn't he'd have to retreat back upstairs for now.

A loud ringing sound echoed as lights flashed and coins started erupting from a large slot on the massive machine. Kenji had triggered the $5000 prize. \"Yes! Thank you...\" Kenji whispered as the horde continued to lumber towards the loud distraction. When only a few stragglers remained Kenji made a mad dash for the exit, shoving aside the few remaining undead that got in his way. One last fat man tried to block off the door and grab Kenji, but the young martial artist was too quick for the shambling corpse. Once outside he began running down the road away from his temporary prison as fast as he could. Finally, he came across Paradise Park, Rustones biggest and most beautiful outdoor park, at the end of the street.</span></div></div>",

No... no! I can't think like that! If there is anyone left I must help them, together we can hopefully reach safety outside this accursed city...\"  The words had barely left Kenji's lips before a wave of dread washed over him. What if he WAS the last man alive in the city... or the entire planet? It would be hard to keep his mind off such things, but if noting else Kenji had learned to focus and be patient. He took a deep breath and headed into the park. A large tattered and bloodstained banner reading \"Rustone would like to wish everyone a very HAPPY HALLOWEEN!\" in black and orange letters was torn down and stretched all the way into the road. Not the best sign, but better than seeing a mound of corpses piled near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park was actually a pretty good place to hide for it was quite wide and open, but with several excellent places to hide. As he walked along on the path leading to the fountain in the center of the park Kenji almost forgot that he had just narrowly escaped a zombiefied casino. The warm sunlight, fresh air, and lush green surroundings certainly helped take the edge off, but it almost made Kenji nervious with its desolate emptiness. Several barbecues and picnic areas were completely abandoned, save for the occasional mangled corpse or lucky animal that had so far managed to escape death at the hands of the terrors walking through the rest of the city. \"This place looks almost untouched...\" Kenji said to himself as he looked over the isolated bits of carnage. \"Guess most of the people here were able to get away in time... thankfully...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much, but the signs that suggested at least some people got away kept Kenji's spirit up... until he made it to the fountain. Paradise park had always been beautiful, but its crown jewel was definately its large wishing fountain in the center square. Three elegant stone mermaids were captured in a scene of playful frolicing with various forms of sea life as streams of water twirled around them. It was a sharp contrast to the brutal display under it. Shimmering crimson water filled the base of the fountain, obscuring the many coins carelessly tossed into it by carefree children and their parents. Propped up along its outer sides were a little over a dozen body bags, some closed tight, some ripped open, and some much smaller than the rest. A few other corpses were simply covered in blankets and sheets, but all had flowers and various other offerings placed near them. A football helmet, a pair of sunglasses, a family photo... a teddy bear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenji simply stared in silence at the gruesome memorial. These people who had moved on had no time to bury their dead... this was the best they had been able to do. Kenji covered his his mouth as he felt tears begining to well up in his eyes. He knew things had gotten bad, but had hoped he wouldn't find something like this. The smell from the decaying bodies stung his nose, but he found he couldn't turn away. Finally, his eyes fell upon a message spray-painted on the side of a clear space:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarvin Briggs<br>\r\nKyle Doyle<br>\r\nSarah Doyle<br>\r\nMike Doyle<br>\r\nDesmond McGuiness<br>\r\nLeroy Young<br>\r\nFred Young<br>\r\nVee Grooms<br>\r\nTed Clarke<br>\r\nElizabeth Clarke<br>\r\nEd Taylor<br>\r\nEd Taylor Jr<br>\r\nLenny Regan<br>\r\nSamuel \"Brick\" Rhodes<br>\r\nKinzie \"Phonex\" Usher<br>\r\nDan Gray<br>\r\nFran Wellington<br>\r\nStacy Wellington<br>\r\nJan Wellington<br>\r\nEllen Frost<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay all these lost souls find peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone comes across their final resting place we have moved on towards the northern edge of the city. When we have enough people we plan to escape to Vegas. We have left some emergency supplies in the chest near the parks restrooms, which are located up the hill from this location. May god help us all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenji took a moment to re-read the message and bowed his head in a moment of silence for those lost. Afterwards he took a brief moment to rest and pay his respects to the people who had died here. He wasn't sure if there was anything worth finding at the restrooms, but it wasn't too far from here... and he certainly had plenty of time... not a single zombie in sight...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered that a killer whale was one of the first things he saw after walking inside so he began following the signs towards that exibit in the hopes that he'd soon be out of here. The lights had been out since the first day, but a few people who had been through hung up small lights and glow in the dark objects to help lead people to the exits. The bright sunlight shining in through the bloodied water was the only other source of illumination and dyed many of the halls an eerie shade of blood red. Dank and smelly water splashed under Kenji's shoes as he began walking down a hallway with a busted window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn the near darkness he could make out several pairs of glowing red dots flopping about. Most of the sea life contained here had long since died, but a few had become miniture zombies. They were completely harmless, but still unnerved Kenji. This place had been a happy memory from his childhood up until a few days ago, now it was filled with corpses both large and small and smelled strongly of decaying flesh. Kenji put a hand to his nose as he passed a large carcass that looked like half a manatee with its entrails strung out near the many shards of broken glass. He then turned down a new hallway and was overjoyed to see a faint trail of light pouring in from a couple windows overlooking the barricaded doors leading outside. He moved along quickly before a noise made him stop dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he had caught something swim closer to him from the murky red tank surrounding this part of the hall. It was an undead killer whale. At first it looked unharmed, but when it passed by Kenji caught a glimpse of a deep gash running across the creatures back and tail. It had been attacked by something and was now undead itself. \"Oh no, it spotted me!\" Kenji shouted as he ran out of the way of the monsters violent charge. The sound of shattering glass echoed throughout the building and was quickly drowned out by the thundering rush of water that began flooding the large hall. Kenji fired two shots at the Beast in a panic as he began sprinting for the exit. The killer whale let out a mighty growl as it tried in vain to swim over to the young martal artist. Had Kenji been a second slower he may have ended up bitten in half or crushed, but the warm sunlight that washed over him as he began to take down the barricade over the doors told him he had made it... for now.

After gathering an armful of candy bars, snack cakes and boxed cookies, Kenji and Mike walked back to the SUV.  Kenji placed all the food in the back seat with the drinks.

But, as fate would have it, Halloween had come much earlier this year and the streets were already filled with ghoulish mosters looking for their candy. Most of the picture-esque homes and yards were covered in fresh blood, organs, and moaning zombies. The nightmarish decorations of hell placed upon an unsuspecting nighborhood. Yet, amazingly, there was a house untouched by the undead... although the lawn was still a mess of corpses. Jessie Tenenbaum fired her 12 gauge into the torso of a man in a business suit and blew away half of his mangled face. \"I DON'T WANT ANY!\" She roared as she loaded 2 more shells into the shotguns chamber and opened fired on a group of zombiefied girl scouts making their way up her driveway. \"KEEP YOUR GOD DAMN COOKIES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghastly little horrors went down easily, but there were still many more coming from off the streets. \"BURN IN HELL YOU MOTHERFUCKING ABOMINATIONS!!!\" Jessie yelled as she threw a homemade molotov into the middle of a corpse pile on her front lawn. Several shambling undead burst into flame instantly as she grabbed another firebomb and hurled it at a large man in a football jersey and \"kiss the cook\" apron. \"KISS THIS, YOU ASSHOLES! YOU'RE RUINING MY YARD!\" The zombies just kept coming and she kept putting them back down with all the hellish fury of a demon. Then, the unthinkable happened... she ran out of molotov's and her shotgun clicked on an empty chamber. \"SHIT! WELL THEN, COME AND GET SOME YOU WALKING HORRORS!\" She called as she picked up the two machetes she was keeping next to her porch chair and began slicing her way to safety. One zombie at a time.</span></div></div>",

COME AND GET SOME YOU WALKING MEAT CHUNKS!\" Jessie shouted over the moans of the undead as she dropped a machete to grab a nearby man by the throat and slam him facefirst into the side of her car. Quickly, she threw the body into another zombie and climbed inside before they could grab her. \"GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY!\" She shouted as they began to surround her. \"FINE, HAVE IT YOUR WAY THEN!\" Without even bothering to fasten her seat belt she hit the gas and ran two zombies over as she pulled out onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content to simply escape with her life, Jessie then backed up into the growing crowd, knocking several of them off their feet. The last thing she did before hitting the gas a second time was to pull out the uzi she kept hidden under the front seat and unload it into the fiends that had driven her from her house. Several fell, all the rest simply began dripping blood as they tried to close in on her again. Of course, Jessie was already on the next street by the time they had even made it 2 yards closer to her. \"Jesus, I can't believe I let those bastards make me run like this. I should go back there and kill them all...\" Fortunately, her common sense outweighed her rage and she didn't even look back. She drove around for a few minutes to look for other survivors in the surrounding nighborhoods, but it soon became clear that everyone else had either abandoned the suburbs or died trying... Luckily, Jessie was the type of woman to always have a plan, even if it wasn't always a good one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I left all my other medications back at the house... I'll have to pay a visit to the pharmacy once I contact some help.\" Jessie was careful to keep her eyes on the road as she slowly made her way deeper into the city, taking note of the destruction around her. \"My god... what the hell happened to this place...?\" She thought to herself as she gazed out her left window at a store that was completely missing its front wall as well as a good portion of the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way those slow zombies did that...

If nothing else, they should have plenty of weapons there for me to use.\" The station wasn't too far from where Jessie lived, but was still a decent ways away. The only good thing about heading towards it was that the number of cars were lower, making it easier to drive around wrecks and blockades. Of course, this also ment less cover to hide behind should she become stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Jessie was turning around the corner onto the street that led directly to the station... only to come aross three wrecked cars that made it impossible to proceed unless she got out and continued on foot or went around another way. \"Oh fuck me... of course the damn road is cut off 50 feet from my destination!\" Jessie cursed angrily as she looked around to check the area. There were two zombies on the front side of the blockade, but both were heavily injured level ones and posed no threat. The one on the other side of the blockade was different though, it had sharp claws and looked to be in slightly better condition than the level ones. \"Alright, this shouldn't be anything my uzi can't handle, just gotta be careful, its the last clip.\" She said as she stepped out and walked over to the wrecked cars.

The monsters that had driven her here were still moving about aimlessly, though thankfully none had followed her inside. The small group that had been waiting for her downstairs she could handle, but not an entire horde. Fortunately, on her retreat here she had found a wrecked APC with some dead soldiers and many dead zombies nearby. Most of their ammo was spent, but one of the female soldiers that had holed up inside the vehicle was still clutching her shotgun. Next to her had been an entire box filled with ammo, though she'd have no chance to use it now that her neck had been ripped open, just like her comrades outside. \"Thank you... all of you.\" Jessie whispered silently as she took the gun and used it to clear a path into the apartment complex. That had all been 2 days ago, not long after this whole thing began. If it weren't for those brave men and women Jessie was sure she wouldn't have made it as far as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of her 2 day stay here the zombies began to thin out a bit in the surrounding area, likely moving on in search of fresh prey. The soldiers Jessie encountered had killed off many of them, making it much harder for them to effectively hunt down any of the remaining survivors, even ones who were injured. \"I may yet see the end of this.\" Jessie said softly as she took out a bottle of pills from her backpack and popped two into her mouth. \"I better move out today, my medications almost gone.\" She shook the bottle, only to hear a few tablets tumble around inside. The appartment had plenty of food and other supplies for Jessie to wait this out, but without her pills she wouldn't last any longer than a few days waiting for rescue and it didn't look like that would happen anytime soon. The last thing she wanted to do was head back out into this mess, but knew that there was a small clinic about 3 blocks away that would probably have what she needed. \"At least it isn't far.\" She tried to tell herself, though it felt like the place was on the other side of the world. With a deep breath she opened the door and moved out into the hallway with her shotgun ready in case something had found its way inside. Jessie was currently on the third floor and had cleared the floors below her and sealed off the higher ones when she first arrived. Still, she knew all too well that being careless could cost her and made sure to keep an eye on any open door or window she passed. In a few minutes she was back on the ground floor. </span></div></div>",

A bloodied teenager in a jacket had found his way inside off the street... and bit one of the dancers on her arm. Security had managed to pulled him off the girl quickly, but the damage was done. He had severed a major blood vessil and she was bleeding to death on the floor as the bright lights and roaring music covered the sound of her screams. Not that it mattered, the security guards soon had more than a few rowdy patrons to deal with and the number of survivors decreased until Cindy, a few of her friends, and one or two others were all that were left. On the third day of their stay in the club Cindy's friend Joan commited suicide by overdosing on cocaine she had gotten from the now dead DJ, leaving Cindy and Alison as the only 2 people left alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I'm almost out of bullets!\" Cindy called as she fire 2 bullets into the skull of a police officer who was almost past their ruined barricade.

I'm not as reckless as you say I am...\" Cindy merely rubbed her head as she put her gun into her purse. \"Let's just go...\" She groaned as the two made their way to the ground, which gave Cindy a bit of trouble. \"Hey, what happened to your new high heels?!\" Alison asked as Cindy stumbled to the ground. \"One of the fast ones almost got me... nevermind, let's worry about that later.

Thats a long way to walk and I've still got my keys.\" Cindy asked as they both crouched down next to an abandoned car that had run into the side of a building. \"No, there isn't that many and we can easily outrun them.

I should know, my brother works there.\" Alison said as she peeked over the hood to check for zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a little boy clawing at a broken store window down the street there was no one, zombie or human, in sight. \"See girl? You worry for nothing.\" Alison taunted as she got back up and ran across the street to the next alleyway. \"Poor kid...\" Cindy whispered as she joined her friend on the otherside of the road. \"Most of these things are still back at the casino, I doubt many are just wandering the streets.\"  Alison said confidently as they moved on. Cindy was silent. She wasn't sure if it really was safe or if the zombies were planning something, but a feeling in her gut told her they needed to be careful. One wrong turn is all it would take for them to end up like almost everyone else. \"So Devon's place, you sure there will be people there?\" Cindy asked, trying to keep her mind off the devistation around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, Cin. That place is one of the most heavily guarded casinos in town. If two ladies like ourselves could hold down a fuckin' dance club for half a week that place must be doing alright.\" Her friend replied as they crossed another mostly empty street, trying to ignore the one armed woman pushing an empty baby stroller. \"Jesus, I hope we're almost there.\" Cindy groaned as she resisted the urge to vomit on the sidewalk. \"Almost, we just gotta make it around the laster tag building and we're home free.\" Alison said as she wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead. \"Great, which way is the quickest?\" Cindy asked as they walked out onto the street. \"If we head right we'll have to make our way through a pretty long alleyway that passes around the building and if we go left we can just head past it on the open street.\" Cindy was sure that the alleyway was safer, but if there was nothing in the street across from them it would be a lot faster to go that way. \"Okay Cin. I picked last time, you get to choose this time.\" Alison said as she raised her shotgun in case they needed to defend themselves.</span></div></div>",

She rounded a corner and began making her way to the escalator that would take her closer to the maintenance room where she would be able to gain access to the roof. As soon as she had gotten on she turned around and fired 3 shots from her handgun at the zombies. One went down with a headshot and the other took 2 rounds to the chest, causing it to stumble over the dead one as it tried to make it past. Cindy fired off one last round to finish it and stepped off the escalator onto the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I've only got one bullet left... at least I'm almost there...\" She said to herself as she followed the bright green arrow spray painted on the wall. After a few minutes of uneventful walking she came to two more arrows pointing down a hallway towards a security door. \"Thank god...\" Cindy mumbled as she played the events of the last 3 days over in her head. She had been with one of her best clients and they were going to see a movie and have dinner together before heading back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie had just ended when people in blood-stained clothes began pouring into the theater and attacking everyone in sight. Both Cindy and her \"date\" managed to make it out one of the back fire exits before being overwhelmed, but Jeremy was heavily injured from defending Cindy and coughing up blood by the time they got to his car. Cindy tried to help him as best she could, but he passed away shortly after pulling up in his driveway. After trying to spend the night at his house Cindy was forced to flee when the undead hordes began breaking in. During her escape Cindy had lost her own handgun, but was able to take the one Jeremy kept in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day of running around the city trying to find help the car ran out of gas and Cindy had to continue on foot. Fortunately, she spoted a sign saying that survivours were meeting up at the nearby mall on the roof where they would try to alert help. Since she had no better option Cindy began her short journey to the Rustone mall. Now, after days of avoiding zombies she was finally at her destination. Cindy turned the knob on the security door... only to have it jam instead of opening. It was locked. \"No, no! I'm so fucking close...!\" She shouted as quietly as she was able. Cindy had made it to her destination... now she just needed a way inside.</span></div></div>",

Guess it'll have to do though.\" With that she quickly made her way to the store and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interrior was small, but was lined wall to wall with useful gear and potental weapons. Its clean floor and distinct lack of blood stains meant it had also managed to avoid an infestation of undead like most of the rest of the mall. \"I never was a big sports fan, but after this I might have to rethink my opinion.\" Cindy mused to herself as she grabbed a football helmet and some padding to protect herself. \"Not exactly high fashion, but it'll definately help me stay alive.\" She said in a bittersweet tone as she looked herself over in a small mirror. \"I just hope I get rescued before this thing starts to smell.\"  She spent a few minutes searching for a sutible weapon that would allow her to open the door. It couldn't be too heavy, but had to have a strong enough impact to get her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! Here we go!\" She called out as she grabbed a 9 iron from a nearby shelf. It was heavier than she expected, but should easily allow her to break the door open. \"Alright, now I just have to get back before any more of these disgusting things show up.\" The trip back to the security door was just as uneventful as the one to the store and Cindy soon found herself staring at the same knob that had denied her access before. With 3 solid whacks the lock gave and broke with a loud thumping sound. Cindy pulled the door free and began climbing the stairs up to the roof. \"Finally, all I have to do now is wait for a helicopter or something to come along and pick me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the knob on one final door and stepped out onto the mall's roof. The floor was a mess of trash and various discarded items, all scattered about. Cindy paided no attention to this however, as a man in a blood smeared t-shirt was standing over the edge and looking down at the city below him. \"Whoa, hey over there!\" Cindy called out as she took a few steps closer. \"You shouldn't stand so close to the edge! Do you guys have room for one more?\" The man seemed to ignore her comment at first, only to turn around just as she was about to ask him if he heard her. His entire lower jaw was hanging loose from his mouth and about half of his face seemed to have been ripped or peeled off. \"Oh my god!\" Cindy yelled out in surprise as the lowly zombie began shuffling closer...</span></div></div>",

With two final whacks Cindy caved in the man's skull and was just about to turn around when a second zombie grabbed her from behind. The both of them fell to the ground as Cindy dropped her golf club, which landed just under 2 feet out of reach. \"Ugh... you rotten smelly pusbag!\" Cindy groaned, wishing that her football attire had come with a protective mask. While it didn't have that, it did offer her protection against the zombie's sharp fingernails, allowing her to better fight off the bulky woman. After a few seconds of struggling and avoiding being choked Cindy was able to overpower the zombie and throw it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large undead woman tried to get back to her feet, but Cindy made it to her golf club before she even got close. Teeth and blood sprayed from the decaying woman's mouth as the right side of her head was torn off with the impact. \"Eww... you were a ripe one, weren't you?\" Cindy muttered as she brought the club down on the woman's mangled head for good measure. \"Whew... glad thats over...\" She said to herself as she lowered the club and took a few deep breaths. She walked past the fresh corpses and headed around to the main part of the roof. The sight that was there to greet her wasn't pretty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmoung the various discarded pieces of litter and garbage were around a dozen human corpses. Some were covered in sheets and blankets, a few were slumped over in chairs next to a table in the center of the roof, but most were simply laying uncovered in the hot sun gathering flies. Many had their torso's ripped open or were even missing whole limbs, likely inflicted by a slumped over man in the corner with large claws on his hands. His head seemed mostly intact except for a massive wound from a sharp blow to the forehead that had leaked blood all over the front of his shirt. A single living zombie stirred next to the corpse of a young boy covered by a bedsheet and let out a groan as it slowly got to its feet. Cindy had no way of knowing, but this man had once been the boy's father and was the second to last survivor to die here. The fury of losing his son had allowed him to protect the others for a while, but in the end the wounds he suffered were too great and he died seconds before his best friend was beaten to death by his zombiefied wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Cindy whispered as she took a step back. \"What... just... what the fuck happened here?\" She was in complete and utter shock. The safe zone she had been trying to reach was gone, the city was crawling with more and more zombies by the hour, and all she had to show for her effort so far was a rescue that would probably never come. \"Its... its all over... I'm gonna die here...\" She moaned as she sunk to her knees. \"Everyone's dead... all my friends... the city is lost...\" She hardly even paid any attention to the large zombiefied man that was now only a few feet away...</span></div></div>",

After making sure the place was clear Cindy grabbed an uzi and stepped out into the parking lot to greet him. \"Yo, Brent, Kelly, Sue, Donna... we got company here!\" The man called to his compainions as he pulled down a chair to talk to Cindy face to face. \"Hey dollface... the name is Marty. Pleased to meet ya.\" He said as he stuck out his hand. \"I'm... Cindy. Just call me Cindy. What the hell are you people doing out here?\" She said as she pushed his hand away. \"Ah yeah, me and some of da boys came out here for our buddy Kent to celebrate his bachlor party. It was going great until his bride to be and some of her grilfriends ripped him apart. Must be some kind of virus or something, it came through here a few days back, but we were smart enough to barricade the place and shoot anyone who was bitten or scratched.\" The man said as he was joined by a younger man and some scantily dressed women. \"This whole thing is so awful.\" A young woman with curly blond hair said as she moved closer to the man standing next to Marty. \"I had to kill my best friend before she turned, but what could I do?  It was just like the movies, if an infected person comes into contact with you, you'll become one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shook her head as she rested an arm on the doorway. \"I'm not so sure this is an infection. Have you seen those fuckers up close? They keep moving even with half their body gone and have god damn glowing eyes!\" The young woman began to look like she might cry upon hearing Cindy say this. \"W-what do you know?! They would have killed us, I had to kill her... I had to...\"  She whispered as she shivered a little. \"Whoa whoa, Sue, calm down okay...? I'm sure this woman is mistaken. Those things can't be supernatural, it doesn't make any sense.\" Another woman said as she put an arm around Sue. \"This thing has been pretty hard on us all, but could you kindly keep your ideas to yourself lady? That girls been through enough.\" The younger man said as he stepped between Cindy and the two girls. \"Hey whatever, I'm just telling you what I've seen...\" Cindy replied as she took a step back. \"My name is Brent, miss Cindy.\" The man replied as he looked Cindy over. \"By the way, if you don't mind telling us... why are you wearing that football get up?\" Cindy paused for a moment when she remembered that she was stilling wearing the football outfit she'd found at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I was alone and couldn't find anything better. I wanted some protection in case one of those things jumped me.\" She replied as she fiddled with her uzi a bit. \"Look, can I please come in? Its great to finally meet some other people, but I-\" A loud roar cut her off as something big jumped onto the limo behind her. \"The hell?! Did I just hear one of those things jump on top of my ride?!\" Cindy yelled as she spun around to see what had found them. \"Jesus... just what in the fuck IS THAT THING?!\" Cindy gasped as she backed up against the barricaded door. The figure standing atop the limo was about six and a half feet tall, but its arms were large and swollen looking. With a simple flick of the wrist it tore the roof off of the front part of the limo and tossed it aside like it had been made of paper. One of the woman inside the strip club let out a scream as Marty told them to get back away from the door. \"Good luck out there sweet thing! We'll try to find a way to help from in here!\" He shouted before placing the chair back into its spot on the top of the barricade. \"Yeah... thanks...\" Cindy groaned as she pointed her uzi at the Brawler and prepared to engage it alone...</span></div></div>",

Cindy opened fire as soon as she lined up her shot and emptied a full clip into it before quickly moving out of the way of its tackle. The thing swung its now bleeding arm to knock her down, missing by only a few inches. Cindy quickly backed up towards the limo as she loaded a fresh clip and began pelting it with more bullets. The thing was faster than most of the zombies she had seen and blocked most of her shots with its arms, but still appeared to be taking damage and slowing down a bit. By the time the second clip was spent its arms looked like raw slabs of meat with some bone now visible under the mangled flesh. \"Goddam it, two fucking clips and its still coming! I'm almost outta ammo!\" Cindy yelled as she jumped on top of the limo and climbed inside the ripped open top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brawler smashed one of its mighty fists onto the trunk, causing the whole car to violently shake, and hopped up to corner the prey waiting for it inside. It peeked in through the roof and growled when it noticed Cindy slumped over on the floor, which was littered with spilled guns and ammunition. \"Smile, you big bastard.\" Cindy quipped as she pulled the trigger on a sawn-off shotgun she had recovered from the mess. A large wound opened on the Brawlers upper torso as it howled in pain. It attempted to back out and began to clutch it chest, but a second shot took out a good chunk of the monsters forehead and caused it to fall backwards, dead. A single loud thud was heard as its body hit the pavement and Cindy quickly got to her feet. \"That was a lot closer than I would have liked...\" She said as she reloaded her uzi and shotgun. \"Might as well take both, I doubt that was the last big ass zombie I'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy jumped down from the wrecked limo and began to survey the damage as a couple of people appeared on the roof of the strip club with hunting rifles in their hands. \"Hey girl, you get that ugly son of a bitch?\" A familar voice called. It was Brent and one of the girls Cindy had meet near the club entrance. \"Yeah, nice of you to show up when the fight has just ended.\" Cindy taunted as she pulled a bit of twisted metal from the spot where the Brawler had pounded the limo. She doubted it would run now with all the damage that had been done. \"Sorry, it was hard climbing up the ladder with these sniper rifles.\" Brent called back. \"Hows your ride? Donna here has a bit of auto repair experience... maybe she can help?\" Cindy let out a sigh as she tossed the broken piece of metal aside and rubbed her head. She didn't want to join up with a bunch of people she had just met, but going alone without a vehicle or backup was probably suicide. \"The limos completely fucked. That damn thing ruined the gas tank and knocked one of the wheels loose, can I join up with you guys?\" Cindy replied as she lightly kicked the side of the limo. Before Brent or Donna could answer a new problem revealed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of loud moans echoed up and down the streets as a mass of footsteps began sounding off in the distance, some of which were moving pretty fast. Seems all the noise has drawn a fresh horde of zombies. \"Shit, I can hear them from here... there could be hundreds of them...\" Cindy said worriedly as she backed up against the limo. \"Hurry get inside!\" Brent called as a loud groan sounded from a nearby alleyway. \"Shit, one of those things is close behind you, run Cindy!\" Donna called as she pointed her sniper rifle a little ways past Cindy to try and find the zombie. \"Crap... guess I better move.\" Cindy said under her breath as she...</span></div></div>",

Usually sports five-o-clock shadow due to his habit of never shaving off his current beard until he loses 3 games in a row. (He considers a brand new beard lucky.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Born to a fairly wealthy family he had an easy, yet boring, life for most of his childhood. All that changed in high school when he learned to play poker from a buddy and took half the school for all they were worth. Finally realizing his calling in life, he decided to drop out at grade 11 and hit the road to make his own fortune. He doesn't always come out on top and there have been many hard times, but he is able to make a decent living doing what he loves and sees Ruststone as just another city to fleece a few gullible suckers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Cocky, sarcastic, and downright rude to most of the people he meets. Many women have fallen for his charm and good looks... only to quickly find themselves unable to stand his company for more then a few minutes. Still, he does have a decent heart underneath the vile outer shell: 10% of all his winnings go to various charities, mostly ones that benefit children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Lopez Age:19 Ht:5'4 Profession: Works at a bookstore back in her home town<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: She has long black hair with bright pink highlights and often wears mini-skirts and tube tops. She loves jewelry, especially necklaces and earrings, so she almost never leaves home with less then two or three sparkling and extravagant objects hanging around her head or from her ears. In short, she'll wear anything sparkly or cute, but doesn't have a very good sense of fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: She and her sister had left their hometown on a road trip to visit their father while he was in California. They had only planned on staying in Ruststone a day or two... and then they have to change their schedule to factor in one new variable: The dead were walking the earth. Now they'll both have to put off visiting their father and instead try to survive the living hell they've found themselves drawn into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: If the words \"squee\", \"glomp\", or \"rainbow-frosted sweetness\" mean anything to you then you probably know all you need to. Unlike her bitter ill-temper twin all Marie wants to do all day is have fun, whether its by hanging out with friends, reading or watching her favorite anime and manga, or just relaxing in the sun. This often annoys her sister. She does have a temper, but good luck getting her to stay mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenji Takashi Age:26 Ht:5'10 Profession: Martial Arts instructer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Unless he is teaching a class he'll likely be wearing a dark blue jacket and sweat pants. He'll sometimes wear sunglasses and is never seen without his prize medallion necklace, a gift from his beloved grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: His family immigrated to the U.S. from Japan when he was only 9 years old, which made it a little bit difficult for him to adjust to his new environment. Eventually his family moved to Ruststone where his grandfather owned a school of martial arts. He didn't have many customers, but he got by just fine and was overjoyed to have young Kenji begin working with him that summer. By the same time next year Kenji was a top competitor in all the fighting tournaments he participated in. Things were going well for him until the night his grandfather was fatally wounded defending a woman from an armed purse snatcher. That horrible incident made Kenji colder, but he is still friendly and respectful to everyone he meets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: His tough-looks and intimidating presence hide a kind and warm-hearted man behind them, but his character always shines through when it matters. He values honor, loyalty, and kindness as his biggest virtues. He will always defend those weaker then him and as a result has gotten into many fights over the years, which usually end with his opponent laying in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie Tenenbaum Age:86 Ht:5'7 Profession: Retired <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: At first glance she would appear to be a bitter old paranoid woman who hates children and thinks everyone is out to get her. In actuality, she only thinks the government is out to get her. While she is usually dressed in standard old lady clothes (with a hidden bullet proof vest underneath, naturally) she also keeps the old S.W.A.T. team riot armor of her deceased husband handy in case the threat level goes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: She and her husband were both born in Germany but left when they were each under a year old. After meeting in Austria they got together and moved to America in the late seventies. Some say her husband was the only human being she truly loved and when he passed away she was devastated. Fortunately, he left her more then enough money for her retire and maintain her \"base of operations.\" (In reality, just the attic of her house.) Due to her odd behavior and unlady-like nature most people leave her alone, although she is still visited occasionally by salesmen or Jehovah's witnesses. Known to many of the neighborhood children as \"that crazy old bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Rude, suspicious, and distrustful of anyone she meets, especially government agents. She is fairly paranoid, but has always believed to be \"better safe then sorry\" and isn't one to take chances. After all, when the city's flooded and she has the only emergency raft in town who'll be the one laughing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy Lowel Age: 37 Ht: 5'9 Profession: Prostitute<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearence: With short blonde hair, shimmering brown eyes, and sexy pink lipstick Cindy has been turning heads her whole life. Her attire consists entirely of short skirts, tight shirts, and a huge collection of shoes. While reasonalby modest, she is constantly trying to find new ways to wear the most revealing clothing in public as possible, to the point she has had some minor trouble with the law regarding indecency charges. But hey, what's a ticket or two when you look this good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: When she was a little girl she only wanted 3 things in life: a loving husband, a nice sports car, and to be a princess. By the time she was 19 these things changed to: a partner who's good in bed, a vibrator for when she doesn't have a partner who's good in bed, and more accessories for her pimped out sports car. After wasting 3 years of her life working for an asshole pimp who treated her like shit she decided she wanted to be her own boss. She acomplished this goal by beating her former pimp within an inch of his life and taking half of his girls with her. Now she makes a living by doing what she's done best since high school... sleeping with anything that moves and beating the hell out of anyone who disses her or her girls. When not hanging out with her friends or sleeping with a client she'll often be found in one of Rustone's many clubs or bars looking for a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Rude and harsh to most of the people she meets and surprisingly kind to the few people she cares about. She has a nasty habit of offending people by saying exactly whats on her mind or starting fights and arguements for petty reasons. While she has a short temper she is also amzingly street smart and knows how to take care of herself, which is why she keeps a gun on her person at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRustone city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRustone City, or \"Mini Vegas\" as it is sometimes called is a small, but prosperous city located a little over 100 miles outside of Las Vegas itself. Despite its isolation it gets a fair number of travelers and tourists passing through thanks to its many attractions such as Silverstone amusement park, which is located only about 4 miles outside the city. While casinos, bars, and strip clubs can be found all over the city it still manages a wholesome family image due to its large numbers of all-ages celebrations and old family-owned businesses. The city even has several old timey streets and buildings that look almost the same as they did 100 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe areas<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChurches<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecause the zombies were revived with dark magic they cannot cross holy ground. This means that any church the survivors come to will protect them from any and all types of zombie. Zombies cannot enter churches by themselves but can be knocked/pulled/pushed into one. If this happens they will be unable to move and lose any power they have until they exit (their eyes will still glow red while inside). Many churches all over the city have been fortified to offer more protection and often contain useful items that the survivors may find useful like food or ammo. Some people have even left behind maps and signs that give directions to nearby safe areas. The universal symbol for a safe area is a triangle with a cross inside it and will also often have an arrow under it or above it pointing in the direction of the safe room. Keep in mind that while most other survivors are more then happy to let others inside there may be a few selfish or insane survivors who will deny entry to others and possibly even attack them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon-holy safe locations<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeveral areas have been fortified to protect against zombies with varying success. Because these areas lack the holy protection given by churches they can be destroyed by zombies. Many of these places are damaged but still standing while others have been wiped out completely. Like churches, many of these locations have useful items left behind by other survivors and may not be all that friendly to newcomers. <br>\r\nThe symbol for this type of safe area is a triangle inside a square.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-supply locations<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMany survivors discard excess supplies once they find improvements or are unable to carry any more. While a lot of these supplies end up being thrown on the ground or abandoned in hard to reach locations some people are kind enough to leave extra supplies in places were other survivors are likely to find them. These places are simply known as Re-supply locations. They range in size and scope from a few cases of bullets and a bottle of water in an empty trash can to a small garages worth of weapons, food, and medical aid. Important to note is that re-supply locations are NOT SAFE AREAS and in most cases survivors are just as vulnerable to attack as any other time. They are marked with a large R in a circle to let people know what they are. If one of these locations is cleaned out it is common courtesy to cross out the R symbol so no one will waste their time checking it for supplies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies<br>\r\n <br>\r\nZombies are humans that were brought back to life with dark magic. Since they were revived with dark magic getting bitten, scratched, or injured by them DOES NOT turn you into one. However anyone who is killed by one DOES turn into one of them. They come in 2 types:normal and special.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal: This type of zombie has 3 levels depending on how strong they are. When a person is killed they turn into a level one zombie(unless they become a special zombie). They level up by killing living cretures.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLevel One: This level of zombie looks like a normal human except for its glowing red eyes. It moves slowly and has only half of the strangth of a normal human.It can be killed with a headshot, a shot to the heart, or by burning it to death. Rarity:*<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLevel Two: This level is as fast and strong as an adult human and has sharp clawlike fingernails along with pointed teeth. It is also more violent then a level one. This level can not be killed by fire or a shot to the heart like a level one. Rarity:**<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLevel Three: This level is extremly deadly. It looks like a monsterous human with glowing red eyes and a pentagram symbol somewhere on its body. This pentagram is its only weak point and must be destroyed to kill it. All level 3 zombies look fairly humanoid but each has a special unique ability that no other zombie has. When using this abilities their pentagram symbols glow bright red, making them easier to spot.  Rarity:****<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial: This type has no levels, instead each type has a different ability. Only about 1 in 15 people who are killed become a special zombie (Any animals killed become Beasts).<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPyro: A pyro moves as fast as a level two zombie, but walks most of the time. It looks exactly like a normal human except for its glowing redish-orange skin. Its skin is hot to the touch and many of the things it touches burst into flames or sometimes explode. It is completely immune to fire. They are not hard to kill, but whenever one dies its entire body bursts into flames that quickly spred. When a human gets too close the pyro will raise its body tempature causeing anything within a 5 foot radius to catch fire or melt. Pyro's hate water and are often found in places where they can stay dry. Rarity:****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMimic: A mimic is the only zombie that doesn't have glowing red eyes...because it tries to disguise itself as a living human. It can walk or run and even perfectly immitate human speech. While they may seem human, there are several things that can give them away:A mimic can survive wounds that wound kill a normal human(If someone walks up to you missing half of their face or with most of their blood gone and ask for help, they are a mimic.), mimics don't have heartbeats, mimics will try to lead living humans into danerous situations or to other zombies, and mimics are often found in small groups while pretending to be survivors. So when ever you find survivers in something like a sealed room with no food or water and they have been there a long time, they are mimics. A mimics weakspot is its upper torso, a headshot will only slow them down. Rarity:****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDeathtouch: A deathtouch is perhaps the most deadly type of zombie that can be found, it is also the most rare. The walk slowly and are not vary strong, but are vary dangerous. A deathtouch is easily spoted as it is surrounded by a deep red mist. This mist is highly toxic and coming into contact with it can be fatal. Fourtunately the mist only extends about 3 feet from the zombies body. The zomies body itself is red like the mist and simply touching it is almost instantly fatal as its entire body is filled with a deadly virus. Deathtouches have no weakpoints, the only way to stop them is reduceing them to paste, which is vary difficult as their skin is twice as strong as a normal humans and they can't be killed by fire. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNightmare: These are probaly one of the most fearsome types of zombie. They have the very eerie ability of absorbing all manner of illumination within a 30 foot radius. The veil of shadows remain over their corpses after they die, so no one knows what they really look like. Things like flash lights or even floodlights are useless agenst them as they absorb the light itself. All that is known about them is that they are vaugely humanoid, they have two legs and a head, but they have four arms. They also seem to have the strangth and speed of an average human. The only things that are visible in their shroud of night is their 4 glowing red eyes. They are often identified right away as they look like large black clouds moving slowly over fields and streets. They often also allow other zombies to hide themselves in its black veil which makes it extreamly dangerous.(The other zombies eyes don't glow in the shadows like the nightmare's do.) Rarity:*****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCarrier: These zombies look more like giant monsterous bats then humans. It has six human-like arms(but no legs) that it uses to carry other zombies(except sumo) to locations that they couldn't normally reach. The have two pairs of wings and stand between 8-10 feet tall. They can be killed with a headshot and its wings are very weak and can be easily burned or shot off. If it loses its wings it will crawl along the ground and claw and bite at living humans. Rarity:****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBeast: The name beast refers to all the animals that were zombiefied by the event that took place 5 days ago. These animals are all fast moving and ruthless. Birds that once sang happily outside windows now swarm and peck to death anything left alive. Deer that once avoided humans will now hunt them down and gore them to death. Fish that would just swim in the rivers and ponds now rip apart anything near them(except Swimmers). All zombie animals have glowing red eyes and can be killed with a headshot. Rarity:*<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDigger: A digger will find one spot it likes and remain there. It digs holes to hide in with its huge claws. It grabs people and will drag them underground. It can be killed with a headshot, but rarely sticks its head above ground. Its claws are razor sharp and can easily cut through metal. Diggers can also shoot tentacules from its mouth to snare pray. Rarity:****<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSlimer: The slimer is a nasty zombie named for its 3 different slime abilites. The first is the red slime attack. Red slime is acidic and can melt steel. The second is the blue slime attack. Blue slime is sticky and doesn't wash off with water, it wears off after about 5 minutes. Finally, there is the purple slime attack. Purple slime is highly flamable and will burst into flames in hot areas. It may also explode. The slimer moves slowly, but can spit slime up to 50 feet away. Slimers usually have slime dripping from their mouths. One headshot is all it takes to kill them, but their corpse will dissolve into a random type of slime. Rarity:****<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGhost: A zombie that is very likely to induce paranoia in survivors who encounter it. At first glance it appears to look just like a level one zombie, but  in reality it is far more deadly. It can become transparent and intangible for up to one minute at a time allowing to harmlessly pass through anything it wants (except a church). It is as fast and strong as a normal human, but is immune to fire even when it isn't intangible. Lastly, its ability to move through objects only applies to it and other zombies cannot be affected by it. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwarmer: A somewhat bloated-looking zombie that is home to thousands of hellish insects. Upon injury or death, it releases them to seek out survivors. Oddly, these insects don't have glowing eyes like the zombies and seem to be normal and unzombified, yet appear out of nowhere whenever a Swarmer is created, making them supernatural in nature. Swarmers come in three types (although it is impossible to tell them apart from each other based on appearances): spider, ant, and wasp. Rarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawler: An aggressive zombie with large mutated arms that excels at beating survivors to death. Due to its massive upper body strength it can easily climb up the sides of buildings and cliffs, along with being able to throw objects with moderate accuracy. Despite its impressive physical attributes it can easily be kill with a headshot or burning to death. While fairly unintelligent it does have enough sense to use its massive arms as shields when under attack, making it somewhat hard to kill with low-caliber weapons.  Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBride: A strange and horrifying zombie with deathly pale skin, sickly white hair, and glowing white eyes. Despite its terrifying looks it is actually a passive zombie that wanders aimlessly while crying or moaning. It is able to talk, but only speaks one word: the name of its lost lover. Although it may seem harmless at first it is actually one of the more deadly zombies. When it comes into close contact with a Groom both will be driven to a rage. In this enraged state they both have glowing red eyes and will gain access to their special abilities. The Brides abilities are increased speed, agility, and the ability to summon white fire. This fire is an otherworldly flame that the Bride can use to envelop and protect herself or shoot at enemies. Unlike normal fire, white fire can burn on anything and eat through any substance. It cannot be put out with water and stops burning after a short period of time. A bride is always female. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroom: A melancholy zombie with shiny black hair, shimmering black skin, and dark void-like eyes that wanders from place to place much like its counterpart. It too can only speak a single word: the name of its lost lover. Like the Bride, it is passive until the two come in contact with each other. Its special abilities are hardened skin that stops bullets and most types of blunt force and enlonged sickle-like talons that can slice through anything. A groom is always male. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoodoo: The deadly Voodoo zombie is passive, but also one of the most dangerous specials a survivour can encounter. Just as its name implies, whatever anyone does to it they suffer themselves. Even worse is the fact that there is no way to tell a Voodoo from a normal level one zombie unless you harm it. Luckily, whenever one is in the area survivors will feel occasional sharp pains that intensifly slightly as it draws closer. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfector: The Infector is a really nasty zombie that carries a powerful virus in its fangs. One bite will transform a survivor into one of the undead in a matter of seconds. Survivors that are transformed this way have a 50% greater chance of becoming a special zombie than if they were killed by the zombies in another way. Dispite also having sharp claws, they are not poisonous and seem to be a last resort if the Infector is unable to bite its prey. Killing an Infector is as easy as killing any level 2 zombie so long as the survivour avoids being bitten. Oddly, an Infectors eyes glow a bright sickly green instead of red like the other zombies which makes it somewhat easier to spot in a crowd. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules<br>\r\n <br>\r\n1. You can not introduce any new zombies of your own, please use the ones listed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n2. Keep in mind the story begins 3 days after the zombies appeared, the survivors all start out alone in a location were they have managed to find shelter. There are no other people alive(except for the few other survivors that might be found later).<br>\r\n <br>\r\n3. Keep this realistic, nothing cartoonish or stupid.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n4. Survivors MAY die.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n5. Cursing, violence, gore, adult content/situations, and nudity is fine. In fact most of those things are expected.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n6. Sex is allowed with a few conditions:<br>\r\n a. No sex when there is the danger of a zombie attack.<br>\r\n b. This is a zombie story, not a porn story, if chapters start focusing too much on sex they will be deleted or edited.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n7. All the characters live in the same city so they may meet and join up with each other.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n8. Finally, characters are not allow leaving the area unless they are rescued somehow, and they can't be rescued before chapter 20.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: When this interactive was first created I used several ideas given to me by friends that I've grown to dislike and have removed or rewritten. As such, many elements have changed and some older chapters may be out of date. As such, please reread the important information above to get up to date on what is going on. I thank you all for reading and apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused. I'll also try to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.<br>\r\n </td>",
