As she parted some tops hanging on a circular rack, two kids who had been hiding darted out, startling her so bad she fell over backwards. And unfortunately as she fell, her protective sunglasses went flying off. She heard the kids spastic foot stomps \"Hey wait!\" she cried, just before she heard one of the steps accompanied by a crunching sound. With a heavy sigh, she said to herself as she clenched her eyes shut \"I have got to start carrying spares with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this place has a pay phone in that little side room. I'll just get over there, call my sister to pick me up. Easy... I think it was this way,\" she said to herself, rising unsteadily, and groping along. Finally she felt her hands touch what was definitely a door. As she walked through, she started reaching around blindly for the phone. Suddenly she grabbed something, but it wasn't what she expected. In shock she looked down at what she'd got a hand full of, just as the mostly naked woman in the changing room she'd stumbled into snapped, \"Who the hell are you? Why the heck are you grabbing my...</span></div></div>",

Little help?\" Jen snapped around, trying to find the girl again, making Jamie dizzy. \"Whoa! Easy there!You don't want to fall and bust your me. The mirror. Look behind you in the mirror!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen finally did so, then just stared in confusion. There was an image of an eye on top of each of her cheeks... and they were blinking! Her eyes widened as she heard the voice again, but couldn't hear it as she was too mesmerized. As the eyes blinked and looked up at her, she could see the corners of a mouth, almost completely buried in her large rump, moving along with the voice. \"A face,\" she muttered, \"there's a face on my ass. And its talking to me... but wait, where's the nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt a hand on each side of her face, starting to shakily spread her face \"Trust me! Its there!.. its really, really there, and its really, really working...\" The hands quickly released. \"Look, its a really long story, but yes, I'm a person, and yes, I've, uh, been turned into your ass. This kinda thing happens a lot to me. Look, I know its a pain in the, well, me, but do you have anything silver on you?\" The woman apparently called Jen shook her head no. \"Well, can you go to a jewelry shop? I'll pay you back, you just need to touch it to me for three seconds, and I'll be out of your life. OK?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen replies simply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One: \"uh, uh, OK... anything you want ass lady\" - shocked, scared, but willing to help<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two: \"Absolutely not.

Okay...anything you want ass lady.\" Jen frightfully said as she turned from the reflection of her shapely behind in the mirror, and quickly began to get dressed. She was understandably shocked, and scared. One moment she was minding her own business, trying on clothes in a changing booth, the next she has a faint, distorted image of a woman's face plastered across her butt. First she though she was simply hallucinating, but she got the feeling that this was all too real. Jen quickly slipped back into the small, baby blue t-shirt she wore to the store, and started to reach for her black panties when she stopped. \"Um, do you--how do I, uh...\" Jen began to ask, but paused once she realized she didn't know how to ask her question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you put on your underwear and pants with me back here?\" Said Jamie, asking the question she knew Jen wanted to. \"I was just thinking that. Hm. I guess you can just put them on as usual. I mean, I'm not planning on being your ass for long so it shouldn't be that much of a problem.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Jen said nervously. She hurriedly slipped her panties on followed by a pair of dark-blue denim short-shorts, and quickly exited the changing booth, and made her way outside the clothing store. She was in such a hurry that she left the clothes she was trying on behind. As Jen was walking she remembered seeing a jewelry store when she first arrived at the mall, and it wasn't too far from the clothing store she just exited, so she decided that would be as good a place as any to get some silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Jamie asked. \"There's a jewelry story not far from here. I'm gonna see if I can find some silver there, and return you to normal.\" Jen answered. \"Thank you.\" Jamie gladly said. Jamie's world was dark. She couldn't see anything through Jen's underwear, and shorts, save for a tiny bit of light that managed to slip in through the bottom of  Jen's pant legs. It was also getting hot and moist. Jen's tight panties and shorts were trapping much of her body heat within them, and it was causing Jen's large, curvy butt, which Jamie had been turned into, to sweat. One half of her face was stretched across Jen's left butt-cheek, while the other half was stretched across her right, and as Jen was walking, Jamie felt both halves of her face move in rhythm with Jen's footsteps. As Jen's hips switched  from side to side Jamie felt her face jiggle slightly as her cheeks, Jen's big, round buttocks, alternately pump in and out. Jen wasn't speaking, and Jamie couldn't find anything to say, so she simply waited in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, Jamie felt her and Jen come to a stop. \"Are we there yet?\" Jamie asked. \"Yes. I'm going in now.\" Responded Jen. Jamie heard a door open before she felt her and Jen moving again. \"Welcome, how can I help you?\" Said a cheerful voice that Jamie didn't recognize, but could tell belonged to an older woman. \"Hi. I was wondering if you happen to have any silver for sale.\" Jamie heard Jen ask the store clerk. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid we have a bit of a shortage of silver at the moment, and we're all sold out.\" The clerk explained. \"Oh, well how about one of the other jewelery stores in the mall then?\" Jen asked. \"You don't understand. When I said we're having a shortage, I meant the whole region, not just this store. It has something to do with the miners working the silver mines going on strike.\" The clerk clarified. \"Really? So you mean I can't find silver anywhere?\" Jen asked. \"Definitely not in this mall. Maybe at a pawn shop, but it's after 8 o'clock in the evening, they're all probably closed by now.\" The clerk said. \"Thanks anyway.\" Jen said. She turns and leaves the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Jamie asked. \"You heard the lady, the whole region has a shortage of sliver, and the only places to possibly find some are closed. There's nothing we can do.\" Jen explained. \"So what? I have to be your ass until we can eventually find a store that has silver in stock?\" Asked Jamie. \"I'm sorry, but it looks that way.\" Jen responds. \"But I'm a human being, I have my own life. I can't just stay this way.\" Complained Jamie. \"I'm sorry, but what can I do?\" Jen asked. \"We can still look around.\" Suggested Jamie. \"I don't know. At this time of night most stores are closed. Maybe I should just take you home with me, and try in the morning?\" Jen asked her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Jamie's response?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I hate to admit it, but you're right. Maybe you should just take me home with you.\" Jamie said reluctantly. \"Right.\" Jen agreed. Jen then began to walk, and Jamie's world shifted as Jen's hips start to switch from sided to side. The vibrations of Jen's footsteps traveled up her legs, and caused her curvy behind to jiggle slightly, which sent ripples through Jamie's face. With every step Jen took, Jamie could feel both halves of her face pushing out past one another. \"I'm really sorry about all this.\" Jen said, feeling sad for the girl that has to, for now, remain as her shapely rear. \"Don't worry,\" began Jamie with a sigh, \"It's not your fault.\" She finished. \"My name is Jen by the way.\" Jen said. \"Jamie.\" Jamie said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, Jen arrived at the mall's parking lot, and began to make her way towards her car. Once there she unlocked the driver side door, placed a foot inside, and proceeded to bend over and get seated when she suddenly stopped. \"I almost forgot I drove here,\" Jen began, \"I'm going to have to sit down on you to drive home.\" Jen said, sounding concerned. \"I didn't think about that.\" Jamie said worriedly. She went quit for a moment as she weighed her options. \"It can't be helped,\" Jamie started, \"I mean I can't expect you to just leave your car here, so I guess I'll just have to bear with it.\" Jamie finished. \"Are you sure?\" Jen asked. \"It's fine.\" Jamie answered, sounding annoyed. \"It's at least a twenty minute drive from here to my hou--\" Jen started, but was suddenly interrupted by her butt, \"Just get in the car!\" Shouted Jamie. Jen's response was a startled yelp. She hurriedly sat down in the drivers seat--unintentional putting a great deal of pressure on Jamie--and started the car. A short while later she left the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie meanwhile was in pain. Her face was being pressed firmly into the cushion of Jen's seat, and Jen's weight rested fully on top of her. Jamie felt as though she was being crushed to death though death never came. She whimpered silently in agony as she tried to endure. Jamie couldn't see anything with Jen's tight panties and shorts pulled over her, and if things weren't already bad enough being a sentient ass, it had also gotten a lot warmer in Jen's short-shorts, which caused Jamie to sweat, and she was now starting to give off a foul, earthy odor. Jen's taut shorts were trapping this unpleasant aroma within them, and Jamie could do nothing about it. \"This is..so wrong!\" Jamie thought in disgust. She was trying her best to ignore the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and Jamie felt Jen's car come to a stop, and she was suddenly lifted up as Jen got out of the car, and not a moment too soon. \"Thank God!\" Jamie sighed in relief, just glad to have the whole experience of being sat on over. She rocked gently from side to side as Jen walked toward her house. With that whole ordeal of being sat on, Jamie hadn't noticed until now that Jen hadn't spoken at all during the drive to her house. In fact Jen hadn't said a word since Jamie snapped at her. Jamie suddenly felt bad as she knew the reason for Jen's silence. \"I'm sorry for yelling at you before.\" Jamie said, apologizing to the woman she was now apart of. Jen didn't answer, and opened the front door of her house before stepping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt Jen continue to walk, and she thought that Jen was ignoring her so she started to speak again when suddenly Jen's panties and shorts were pulled down, and Jamie was blinded by light as she was exposed to the world outside Jen's shorts. As her vision clears, Jamie noticed that she and Jen were in a bathroom, and that Jen had her back towards the bathroom's mirror. Jamie could see Jen looking over her shoulder at her in the mirror, and that she was studying her rear. \"It's okay,\" Jen finally began to speak, \"I don't blame you for being upset. You're stuck as my butt. I bet if I was stuck as an ass I'd be a bit moody too.\" Jen said jokingly. \"Are you sure you don't have any silver?\" Jamie asked. \"Sorry, I have jewelry but none of it's silver.\" Jen answered. \"We'll just have to look for some tomorrow.\" Jen said. \"Tell you what, how bout we both wash up before bed?\" Jen asked. \"I could use one, and I can smell you from here so I know you can as well.\" Jen said before walking over to the bath tub, and turning the shower on. She stepped in, closed the shower door, grabbed a bar of soap, and began to lather up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt the soothing hot water run down over her face and despite being a girls bum she couldn't help but feel somewhat at ease. \"You might want to close your eyes.\" Jen said. Jamie did so and moments later she felt Jen rubbing her gently with the soap. She just stayed quite as Jen bathed, letting the warm soapy waters wash the sweat, and stink coating her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later Jen had finished washing, and turned off the shower. She stepped out, tightly wrapped a white towel around herself, once again cutting off Jamie's vision, and exited the bathroom. She walked down a short hallway where she comes to a closed door, and opens it before entering the room it led to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie just remained silent. She couldn't see anything through the towel wrapped around her, but she could feel Jen moving. Then the towel around her pulled away, and Jamie could see once again. She took a moment to observe her surroundings, and realized that she and Jen were in what must be Jen's bedroom. In front of Jamie was a wooden dresser with a large mirror attached to it. Jen was toweling off her wet body, and was standing with her back to the mirror, allowing Jamie to finally get a good look at herself. Nothing more than the large, rotund ass of an attractive young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen finished drying off, and turned toward her dresser. She opened the top drawer and pulled out a pair of white panties when she paused, and looked at them thoughtfully. \"I guess I can go bare from the waist down tonight,\" she began as she placed the underwear back in their drawer, \"It's the least I can do.\" Jen finished. \"I'd appreciate that.\" Answered her butt. Jen then opened then drawer below the one she just closed, and pulled out a small white tank top. She slipped it on, closed the drawer, and walked over to her bed which she promptly plopped down on front first. \"Sorry again for all this,\" Jen once again apologized, \"I hope we have better luck tomorrow, and can get you unassified.\" Jen joked. \"Me too.\" Jamie said simply. \"Good night Jamie.\" Jen said as she laid her head on her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours passed and Jen had long since fallen asleep. She was laying on her front, and didn't have the covers completely pulled over herself. They were pulled over her legs, and up to her behind, but not over it to allow Jamie to see. Jamie just lied there listening to Jen softly snoring. She was having difficulty trying to slip into unconsciousness. She couldn't relax enough to sleep. She worried about the coming day. Would she and the person she was currently attached to find any silver, or was the woman at the jewelry store right? Would this supposed silver shortage keep them from finding what was need to return Jamie to normal? Would she be forced to live as an ass for a longer time? She also thought about the curse on her. Jamie knew that the longer she stayed this way, Jen would eventually grow more, and more accustomed to her being her rear-end, and to the point that Jen, and everyone around her would start to believe that talking booties were the norm. That's when Jamie thought of something that filled her with dread. \"What happens if Jen has to use the bathroom, while I'm still stuck this way?\" Jamie thought. She shuddered at this and quickly put it from her mind. She was going to stay positive. She was certain that she would be back to her old self before anything gross like that happened...She hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually morning comes and when Jen and Jamie awaken...</span></div></div>",

Jen began to mutter in her half-asleep state. \"Snrr...Hnch...Bitch...\" This caught Jamie's attention, who called out \"Jen, wake up!\" Jens eyes shot open, and before Jamie could react she rolled onto her ass, smothering Jamie. \"Mm Mmf Mmph!\" yelled an annoyed Jamie. Jen realized her mistake and quickly hopped off the bed. \"Oh god, I'm sorry! I forgot you where there!\" Jen didn't say a word. \"Well, I hope I can make it up to you later today. Me and my friends are going for a full body massage - and I mean FULL body massage,\" she said, emphasizing full. \"So hopefully you'll be concealed enough so that the massager can massage you, too!\" Jamie couldn't think about massaging. She had more important problems to attend to. \"Uh, hello? What about finding some silver to turn me back to normal?\" Jen rolled her eyes. \"Yeah yeah, we can do that later. AFTER the massage.\" she said, Jamies field of view blocked by an ever rising pair of panties. \"For an ass, you sure do complain alot.\" 'Oh no', thought Jamie, 'The curse is starting...that's not good.' She opened her, well, mouth to object when suddenly a rather thick pair of jeans slid over her, muffling her voice somewhat. \"Much better then those thin yoga pants, I can actually here myself think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes, during which Jamie is mostly ignored. Neither of them speak much, but the silence is broken by Jen. \"Alright, Jamie, we're...\"</span></div></div>",

People wouldnt even notice as she walked around talking to herself.Her fears were interrupted as the girl started putting her clothes back on. She first felt a thong pulled over her. It quickly disappeared into the teens massive ass. Then a short skirt.  \"Hey! No fair, I can't see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her face jiggle as the girl laughed at her, \"So? You might as well get used to it. That's how its gonna be when I'm dressed and not wearing low pants. Like it or not lady, this is your new life... Actually, you're not even a lady anymore!

Please help me, ill do anything you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, no 'Jamie', your name is butt. Get it right or I'll have to spank you, haha!\" Jamie heard more people and assumed Jen was in the main part of the mall now.  \"Now hush up. I don't want people looking at me funny for talking to my ass, or hearing my ass talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they won't-\" Jamie tried to cut herself off before saying too much, but Jen froze in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't what?...

However, this time after one of her jokes, Jamie manage to trip over her own feet. With a yelp, she landed on the belt, and went rocketing off it backwards. As she tumbled across the floor, her sunglasses went flying off, and landed between the weights on a machine. She instinctively clamps her eyes shut, and hears the sickening crunch as the weights slam together, reducing her protection to splinters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy comes running up next to her, \"Oh god, are you alright sis? That looked like it hurt like hell... Oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sighs in annoyance, \"Yeah, oh crap. Can you go get the car and bring it around so you don't have to guide me through the whole parking lot. I've got a spare pair at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll be back in just a sec.\" Her sister hopped to her feet, and she could hear her foot steps as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sat on the floor, afraid to move unless she bumps into somebody. However after the 4th or 5th person has to walk around her and vocally complains about it, she decides she'd better at least try to get out of the way. Only opening her eyes for split seconds, she started crawling towards a wall. Suddenly she felt an impact on her side, and heard another girl shriek as they both went tumbling. The other girl snapped at her, \"Dammit, that hurt! Just what do you think you were doing!?\" and uncontrollably Jamie opened her eyes to look at the person she injured, and found herself looking at...</span></div></div>",

The blonde girl above, who jamie had noticed when her and her sister first came in, was standing looking around, confused about where the person sh tripped on was, after a few seconds she walked over to a bench to take a drink. Meanwhile, under the socked foot of the blonde jamie had noticed she couldnt speak while the giant girls foot was crushing her into the ground, *this could be a problem* jamie thought, realising that in a short while this giant would not care that her shoe was talking, and would therefore not feel a need to help jamie. Luckily the constant pressure cycle of the giant girl walking stopped, and jamie now had a view out into the gym. The blonde was sitting, feet out in front of her. \"Hi, dont panic. Im jamie, the girl you bum...\" jamie was cut off suddenly as the blonde shifted her feet, harshly grinding her shoes soles along the carpet as she stretched. She moved her feet back and continued to sit. \"Please, dont move.\" Said jamie, hiding the pain from the stretch. \"Okayy?\" The giant said quietly, \"im lucy, where are you jamie?\" \"Well...lucy. dont panic but...emm, im your shoe\" lucy diddnt speak for a moment. Jamie felt the giant toes move inside her. \"Did you feel me move my toes?\" Lucy said, eerily calmly jamie thought, starting to worry a little. \"Yess?\". \"Okay, youre my right shoe then\" lucy said, still calm. \"All i need you to do to have me not be your shoe is some silver\" jamie said hopefully, wanting lucy to be more shocked. \"Well little shoe\" *oh no* jamie thought. \"Youve got some hard work to do before you get a rest, or any 'help'\". Jamie wasnt a fan of how lucy said help. Before jamie could respond, lucy stood up, exerting tonnes onto the size 6 girl below, before heading...</span></div></div>",

I'm not going to hurt you. Actually i,  uh, couldn't if I wanted to. I really need your help. Pleeeease?\" Amber was at a loss for words, but the voice did sound desperate, so cautiously she snuck into an unoccupied aerobics room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm here. You can come out now.\" Amber walked around the room, wondering if there were some hidden speaker or something, and this was all a huge prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie whined to her, \"Could you please sit down? I swear, I can feel a callus forming... thanks, now, don't freak out, but look at the bottom of your right foot.\" There was a moments hesitation, then her view swung around until she was looking up at her current holder. The poor girl was cute as hell Jamie thought, even as her mouth struggled to form words, her eyes going huge as her light brown bangs hung in front of them. \"Uh, hi... I'm Jamie. So... what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber blinked a few times, and finally sputtered out \"You're my foot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heh, yeah, kind of. First time my eyes ended up on the heel. Look, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a face on my foot!...\" Amber cut her off, still slack jawed. Jamie couldn't help thinking she looked adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I am. And I could really use your help to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOURE A FACE ON MY FOOT!!!\" She screamed as the concept sunk in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know, look let me explain..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving calmed down, Amber was now just studying her sole in awe. \"So all I gotta do is find something silver to help get you out of there?\" She asked as she traced her finger along Jamie's features. Her face added contours, like millimeter high bumps in her skin, with a bit of her colors peeking through. The weirdest part was Jamie's face still responded to her. Her lips moved on the ball of her foot when she talked, her eyes blinked on her heel, and her nostrils flared in the middle of her wrinkly arch as she breathed, but Amber, couldnt feel any change. If she hadn't spoke it couldve been months before she noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's face shifted up and down slightly as she tried to nod, \"mm mm. My sister has probably run home to get my other glasses since I disappeared. She knows i tend to get out sooner or later.. I'd really prefer sooner though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled giddily, '\"Ooo! Ooo, I know! My mom has some good sterling silver. I could take you home, change you back, then you can call your sis for a ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt a wave of relief \"oh that would be so awesome Amber, you're a lifesaver\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's a problem...\" she suddenly looked really sheepish, \"I have to do my running before i go home. I'm trying out for the cheer leading team, and mom is being really stern on me being in shape if I do it... and my sister isn't coming to pick me up for an hour anyways, so... so you mind if I, um...\" her face turned beat red in embarassment. Jamie could even feel the wave of heat from the blush hitting her. \"I mean, I won't if you don't want me to, but it means a lot to me to get this and...\" she looked plaintively over at her tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh I suppose...\"</span></div></div>",

Jamie became acutely aware that yelling was worthless as she was first stuffed into a slightly worn sock, then into a tennis shoe. The next 45 minutes was just agony. She could feel her face being ground through the thin sock into the relatively new insole, but she could feel the sweat as it started to pour out of her. The worst was down by her mouth, since it was so close to her toes, it was basically pulling double duty. The smell quickly and steadily worsened the whole time until Jamie was wishing she could pass out while changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the running stopped as Amber sat down, catching her breath. Jamie heard the music get louder, and realized Amber had taken her headphones off, \"heh um, Amber? Hun? I hate to be a pain, but is your sister here yet? No offense but I think we both need a shower... Amber?\" She heard Amber reply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption one: \"I know, I'm soooooo sorry.

However, before she could say a single word, she heard Amber's music get fainter. \"No don't put them in yet, we need to talk!\" Jamie cried as she realized it was too late, Amber had put her headphones back on and they were already on their way back to the gym floor. Jamie's hell continued for nearly two more hour. She was losing it in the horror of the combined smell and taste. She would have passed out or vomited by now if she were normal, so the mental anguish of being unable to was torture. She continued to plead even though she knew it did no good. It got worse when Amber seemed to find some of her friends and talked and laughed while she suffered under her. Finally, she heard Amber call out to her sister who had just arrived and said goodbye to to her friends. Jamie hoped she would finally take the headphones off again, but was once again disappointed as Amber simply packed her things and left to head home still in her gym clothes. As Amber got home she went upstairs to her room and without removing her shoes, flopped on her bed and laid there still listening to her music. Jamie prayed she'd remove her headphones or at least her shoes soon. It was the former as she heard Amber's music get louder again. Jamie was about cry out when fate gave her the middle finger again and the music increased exponentially because Amber turned on her room's music player. Jamie screamed in desperation, but Amber just started dancing around her room putting things away. Finally after what seemed like an eternity, the music stopped and Amber began to undress for the shower. Amber looked down at Jamie with an innocent smile and asked... \"So, wasn't today such a great workout? I'll be head cheerleader for sure at this rate.\" Jamie felt anger swell in her she wanted nothing more than to tell this girl off, but if she makes Amber mad, who knows what will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?...<br>\r\nYell at her and risk Amber's anger.<br>\r\nor<br>\r\nKeep calm and try to get through to her.</span></div></div>",

So there she sat, up in the stands, looking bored, occasionally checking out some of the players surreptitiously and basically day dreaming. From the side, she heard someone shout \"Hey, look out!\" before she could react, a frisbee smacked into the side of her head. It wasn't enough to really hurt, but it WAS enough to knock her glasses off. Unfortunately for her, at that moment she happened to be glancing at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Karie's lucky game socks that she refuses to wash as long as their winning streak holds out? Or the team bench with half a dozen players sitting on it?)</span></div></div>",

Whatever was stretching her had the most powerfully disgusting taste and odor she'd ever encountered. Looking around for clues to what she was, while screaming for help, she saw to her left something weird. It was a green stitched column with a white band around the top. Above that it turned into a peach colored, curvy and kind of jiggly pillar until it disappeared into a shadowy green tarp. \"Weird,\" she thought, \"the outside of the tarp is the same color as that pillar... which looks like the same color as Karie's teams colors.... which is why she thinks those socks are lucky...\" She looked down and saw a the most worn out athletic shoe she'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie lost her mind screaming again. Her eyes were just below the white band, stretched cartoonishly tall. She could feel feel her nose curve at the ankle, with her now huge nostrils starting just before the top of Katie's toes, around the front of the, to just barely touching the ball of her foot. Her mouth might as well be the insole for the area it is covering. Looking up pleadingly, she saw her chubby (probably 170-190lb) friend look down at her and say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 1: \"Oh god Jamie! What the hell happened!?\" - saw the change so she remembers her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: \"Hey whiny  socks! Ready to help me win us another game? Pretend to protest all you want, I know deep down you don't wanna get that wash yet\" - didn't see the change, cheerful and peppy, the whole team is just having fun and thinks of Jamie as their mascot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: \"You better knock off that crying and focus on winning us this game dammit. Plenty of the girl's feet are way worse than mine, andthey'd LOVE to be the ones punishing you for not pulling your weight. We told you. No washes until we get a championship!\" Didn't see it. Team is very competitive and has think since they have the world's only talking lucky socks, the should be giving them extra luck</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a girl named Jamie who suffers from an odd curse. Whenever you are looking at an object or part of a person and lose your concentration, your body disappears and you turn into it. You can communicate with anyone using you or within an inch or so of you, and still have all your senses while changed. Your face will even be visible in whatever you've been turned into, as if it's just part of the object. The worst part is, the longer you are the object, the more the person that is in possession of you will see it as natural. Only those who saw/the change happen will remember she was a person at all. Anyone else will just see her new form as what she's always been with no memory of her ever existing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the person will be shocked, confused, and probably (maybe) genuinely want to help you. Then slowly they'll start wondering what the big deal is, why you were complaining so much, why they need to help you. Eventually they'll think things have always been this way, i.e. you never had a name to them, you were always \"My favorite boots\" or \"a comfy chair\". A helpful person might wonder why their clothing is suddenly objecting to being worn. A meaner person might decide that it needs to be \"corrected\". All it takes is a silver object being touched to you for 3 seconds to turn you back to yourself, at which point everyone's thoughts will return to normal, and they will still remember how they had been treating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you wear a rare kind of sunglasses that block the curse to go about your daily life, but one day they are stolen. You have to try to find another pair, while avoiding becoming someone's property for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many rules, but here they are:<br>\r\nNo scat. Butts are okay, but no crap. Same with pee.<br>\r\nNo male interaction. I know. I'm boring.<br>\r\nNo underage<br>\r\nDon't really care if it is written in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person, so long as it's comprehensible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, be creative.</td>",
