It's Saturday, and set to be a very longer and boring weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are aware of a garage sale nearby, so decide to walk over to pass some time, and see if there's anything of interest there. After rummaging around for several minutes you come across a battered box, and after brushing off the dust on the top discover that it's a board game. Well, not ideal as you may need to actually engage with someone else to play it, but at least it should pass some time. So, after haggling the price down to a buck you hand over your money and walk home with your new purchase. Once you are back in your bedroom you have a better look at what you've actually bought. What game do you have?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The illustration on the lid looks like trivial pursuits but the writing isn't in English. It looks oriental, and you guess Japanese. Bugger. That puts paid to reading the questions, if they're all in a foreign language. Then you notice drawings around the sides of the box that appear to represent people engaging in various sexual acts. Well, that's not what you had expected. It may still be worth investigating this game! You hadn't realized there was a sex related version. Mind you, it would still be fairly dependent on having pictures on the cards - your Japanese is non-existent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the box, and remove all of the contents. You lay out the board on your bedroom floor. There is a card dispenser, but it seems to be locked or jammed shut. There is part of an instruction leaflet which has been torn. This seems to be in Japanese, although as you turn it over there is a small section written in English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read that the game is called Sexual Pursuits, and you have the deluxe change edition. The object of the game seems similar to Trivial Pursuit, but instead of answering questions you must complete assigned tasks to earn your wedges. Once a player has collected one wedge of each color they make their way toward the central hub for the conclusion of the game, with one final action to be completed.  The categories are: Blue - Nice, Green - Naughty, Purple - Objects, Yellow - Clothes, Orange - The human body, and Red - Sharing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally (you continue reading), most cards (indicated by red borders) are action cards - you must complete the action as defined but change cards (indicated by gold borders) will be randomly dispensed - whatever change is stated or chosen must be completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that all seems a bit tame really. You're not sure what all the categories mean, but guess you could find out by checking over the cards. Besides nobody is actually going to check that you do everything precisely, so there will be plenty of scope to skip a category if it's really too naff. You're also not entirely sure what the change cards are for - presumably (given the title of the game) you swap an object or perhaps items of clothing with the other player, which could make the whole thing a tad more interesting, depending of course on who you play the game with!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your first problem is finding someone to play with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly this would need to be a girl, and preferably someone you fancy, so that you can actually enjoy the game, rather than purely working through the game imagining what you could be doing. Your first thoughts turn to Janie in your class at school - you've had the hots for her for a while. Or (reality check time) you could try playing with your little sister Bryony. She's only 10, so you hope she would't understand the majority of sexual references anyway. You definitely rule out your mom - not a good idea in view of your new understanding of the theme of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a noise at your bedroom door. It opens and in walks...</span></div></div>",

She picks up the pink playing piece, and walks it three spaces down of the spokes towards the edge of the board, ending on a blank space. So now it\u2019s your turn. You roll a 4. You move the blue playing piece along 4 spaces onto a blue space. You know you must take a card from the little dispenser, although are a bit confused why there\u2019s only a single dispenser \u2013 surely you need six sets of question cards \u2013 one for each category? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach forward to press the button on the dispenser Bryony sees what you\u2019re doing, jumps forward and whacks her hand onto the button before you reach it. However, nothing happens. \u201cWhy won\u2019t it work?\u201d Bryony exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s broken!\u201d Oh great. No wonder the game was in the garage sale \u2013 the only functional part of the entire game won\u2019t work. You reach forward to see if you can fix it, but as soon as your hand is over the button you hear a gentle clunk, and a card emerges from the slot near the bottom of the dispenser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s weird.\u201d you mutter. Either it just took a long time to respond to Bryony hitting it, or it somehow detected the presence of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d Bryony cries. She hits the button again, but again nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on. You\u2019ll get your turn in a minute. This card is for me, after all.\u201d The card has a blue background framed in a red border. In the top corner is a symbol which you assume is meaningful in Japanese, with writing in English alongside it stating the category \u2013 \u2018Nice\u2019.

'Do you move forwards? Do you have to answer a question?'<br>\r\n'No, nothing quite like that. It tells me to say something.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does seem a bit silly, although to be honest you weren't sure what a board game called sexual pursuits could really involve, even the deluxe change edition, but if it stays as tame as this then you needn't be worried about Bryony playing it. <br>\r\nOK, so you have to say something nice about Bryony? You raise you eyes towards you little sister. 'You're looking very ni'' you stop and realize that Bryony's hair seems really vibrant, and even more fiery red than normal. Before you even have time to think about it a genuine compliment tumbles from your mouth 'Wow, your hair looks fantastic Bry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silly thing is that her hair really does look really fantastic, almost like it's glowing. Funny really that you've never seen it like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So did the card tell you to say my hair was nice?' Bryony asks. 'That's a funny thing for it to say.'<br>\r\n'Well yes and no. The card told me to say something nice to you, but your hair really is looking good today.'<br>\r\nYour sister gives you a very suspicious look, but says nothing more. You return the card to the slot at the top of the dispenser, where it seems to be sucked inside.<br>\r\n'OK then, it's your turn now.'<br>\r\nBryony picks up the die and rolls it across the board, scoring another 3. She moves her playing piece forwards, landing on a green square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes - Now I get to have a card!' she exclaims.<br>\r\n'Yes, but try and be a bit more gentle on the dispenser this time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches forward and just as her fingers reach the button you hear the same gentle clunk, and a card is ejected from the bottom slot. She looks at it, with her expression getting increasingly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Bryony's card say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She shows the card to you. Ah, right. So this is what the game considers to be something  naughty, eh? Suppose it's all a case of interpretation really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, do I have to do this, then?' Bryony asks. 'I thought you had to answers questions to win the categories, not do things.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, well, this isn't actually Trivial Pursuits ' it's a Japanese variation, and everything's a bit different.' You don't really want to tell her the name of the game, so compromise by telling her that it's a special version to encourage friendly game play rather than rivalry between the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So it's the Trivial Pursuits 'be friendly to your opponent' version, then? Never heard of it. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then your Mom appears at the door. 'You guys OK if I pop out to get some ice? I'll only be a few minutes.'  You know full well that if you Mom pops out anywhere she'll be at least a couple of hours ' and that's assuming she doesn't get sidetracked on the way which could add a further couple of hours on. 'Yeah, we're good.' You reply, and you hear the door close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK, so you've still got to complete your action.' You say to Bryony. <br>\r\n'Yeah, OK. I'll do my 'be friendly to my opponent' bit. ' She moves towards you, with a look of concentration on her face, as if working out where she may have kissed you before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is tricky. I can't remember where I've kissed you before... oh, I know! She seems to have a sudden inspiration. 'I'll kiss you on your chest. I don't think I've ever kissed you there before.' She crawls across to you and pulls up your shirt front. You then feel the smack of a typical child's kiss on your chest. However, you then feel another kiss, and another, and another, each in a slightly different place, and each one feeling slightly different, as if they're getting more tender each time. She then finds one of your nipples which she proceeds to kiss, and it feels almost seductive, and whilst she's probably only licking her lips you feel her tongue moistening and caressing your nipple.  With each additional kiss you also feel less inclined to stop her, just enjoying the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute you realize that you're getting aroused by this attention, and break free of your reverie. 'It's OK, you don't have to keep on kissing me!' However she seems quite preoccupied with what she's doing, and carries on kissing until you actually block her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly pulls back. 'Oh. That was weird. Once I started I sort of couldn't stop myself, and your nipples were nice to kiss.' You can see that she's a bit embarrassed, and her face is turning red. She hurriedly continues 'It your turn now anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull down your shirt again, and you both take your positions kneeling on the floor by the board.  <br>\r\nYou pick up the die and roll this again, throwing a 6. You pick up the blue playing piece and move this forward, this time ending on a yellow space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's the yellow category?' Bryony asks.<br>\r\n'Um, that's 'clothing'.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, this could be more awkward. What if this suggests you need to remove an item of clothing? Oh well, just have to see what it says. You look towards the card dispenser, and there is already a card projecting from the slot. You pull it out.  It doesn't have the has the red border like the previous ones, but a gold border, and the word 'Change' embossed across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the card. It says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess the implication is that you should go and get changed, which seems a bit silly half way through a board game. Well, you'd never go on a date with your sister anyway, so it's a bit academic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What does it say?' Bryony asks. You show her the card. 'Well that's easy. I've got the butterfly dress I had for my birthday party. I'd wear that, plus my white panties with the pink hearts, and my blue sandals. Hmm, I'd tie my hair back, and wear pretty earrings. What about you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To be honest I'm not really bothered.' You reply, struggling to find any enthusiasm for a situation that would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, in that case I shall decide for you.' Bryony replies. 'If I'm going to be wearing my butterfly dress, you could have a bird costume.' You wince slightly, which Bryony notices, obviously remembering a previous birthday party of hers when she insisted that all of the boys - including you as you were forced to attend - dressed in costume.  'No! you wouldn't like that, would you?  I know - you could wear a butterfly dress too, but in a larger size, so we'd match each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, good grief. You reckon Bryony is just trying to wind you up, and this is confirmed by the glint in her eye. You decide there's no point in arguing about it, so you may as well let her continue with her silliness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So would I have pink heart panties too?' you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, don't be silly. You're older, so you could have white lacy ones instead... oh, maybe with big red hearts all over them. And you've got longer legs than me, so you could wear those sandals with the long straps that wrap all the way up the legs.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, OK. Whatever.' you reply. Bryony does seem to be embracing the concept better than you, be it in her slightly warped way, and the slightly unfocused look in her eyes suggests that she's currently imaging herself wearing her butterfly dress - or maybe, perish the thought, you wearing it... . For an instant you try to picture yourself wearing what Bryony had suggested for you, despite the silliness of the whole concept.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this is just nonsense. For a date surely any girl would want to dress up a bit? You cannot help recall a photo you saw in a magazine of a girl wearing something eminently more suitable for a night out (and you remember drooling over it at the time). She was modeling a variation of the little black dress, a strapless baby-doll prom dress with a shimmering bodice over a black mini skirt made up of layers of tulle. Perhaps combined with luminous pink silk underwear (what you secretly consider every girl should wear) and some killer heels... that would be far more appropriate than Bryony's suggestion, and you reckon may even be a better option for Bry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8d/1d/f5/8d1df5156811ebe1f46896054ac840e1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you have failed to notice is that gold border around the edge of the card has started glowing, and a delicate shimmering light is spreading around the room. There's a sudden flash of light. In a split second you snap out of your daydream to find that you - and also Bryony - are wearing different clothes.

Your socks disappear, and your old pumps change into sandals, and you feel the straps wrapping around your legs. The change of pressure under the balls of your feet, and the way you now feel you're falling forwards suggests they've got heels.  After a few seconds the transformation is complete. You're now in a butterfly dress.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'What the Hell?' From the instant before when you were kneeling on the floor wearing an old Tee shirt and pants, you are now wearing a stylish black prom dress with the short layered tulle skirt riding high on your thighs, and stylish  shoes sporting 8 inch heels instead of your old trainers. You can sense something different around your groin, and don't even need to look to know that you are doubtless now wearing luminous pink panties rather than your boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What just happened?' Bryony asks, with a clear amount of trepidation in her voice.  You glance at her to see that her clothes have all changed too, and she seems to be wearing an outfit identical to yours, albeit in a smaller size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I haven't a clue,' you respond honestly. 'I can only imagine that because we were thinking about different clothing, somehow it's become real.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wasn't thinking about anything like this! She says. 'So is that how you imagined you'd dress if we went on a date?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? No!' Then you realize that this might have something to do with the game. The card said for you to imagine what you might wear, and... Oh crap. Surely that's impossible? Well, apparently not.  Guess you'll have to be more careful what you're thinking of next time. 'You started it by suggesting I wear a butterfly dress.  I just thought of a more suitable dress for a night out. I didn't think we'd end up wearing it!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Wow, that's pretty cool really!' Bryony exclaims. 'I didn't think you could really do things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, well, apparently we can now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamber unsteadily to your feet, balancing precariously on the high heels, and try to check out exactly what you are wearing.  There's a mirror by the door, so you walk across (with very small steps and nearly twisting your ankle once) to check out your reflection.  Meanwhile Bryony has quickly and stood up far more easily, coping well with her (admittedly shorter) heels, and has completed a twirl to admire her new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on Terry,' she says excitedly. 'I want to see what'll happen next.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa, hang on just a minute.' You respond. 'I'm not sure if we want to carry on. I know it's pretty fantastic, but we don't know what else could happen.' You are suddenly quite apprehensive about this. After all, this is clearly a sex orientated game, so if it can transform your clothes just by picturing them in your mind, then the next step could have you wearing micro boxers, and Bryony wearing a g-string, or well, anything. Whilst that may be OK for you, you're not so sure about Bryony explaining that to you mom when she comes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Bryony doesn't share your reservations, and is keen to carry on. She picks up the die, and rolls it, disregarding your warning.  She reaches for the pink playing piece to move it forward, and then watches in fascination as it starts moving on its own, sliding forwards along the board to stop on orange square. Another gold rimmed card is ejected from the dispenser, landing face up on the board.  What does it say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You say, although Bryony has already started contemplating improvements that she might wish to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have an opportunity to ponder on this any further, Bryony lets out a yelp. As you look at her you can see that the bodice of her baby doll prom dress previously lying flat against her only slightly developing chest is now pushing outwards as her body is being adjusted. After a few seconds it is quite obvious that Bryony now has quite decent breasts, plus she seems to have grown taller, her waistline has slimmed dramatically, her hips filled out, and now appears to be a mid teenager wearing the prom dress, rather than a 10 year old.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OMG!' Bryony exclaims, I've got boobs! And I'm taller... um, older!. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you really don't know how you're going to explain this to you mom! OMG indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel your skin tingling, like a low voltage electric current is being run through it, and you are aware of different parts of your body, as if being touched or caressed by an unseen force. Then you are left with no misunderstanding what is happening as two bulges appear in your chest and expand to fill out the bodice of the dress, followed by an expansion of your hips, and a slimming of your waist, arms and legs.  'Oh shit!' you exclaim, with your voice also in a more feminine pitch. You instantly reach one hand to your groin, fearing what you may find, and indeed having your worst nightmare confirmed. You are now a girl. 'No! This is wrong! This can't happen!' you find yourself shouting at the game board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite you desperately not thinking about any body improvements, it seems that Bryony's wishes have affected you both, and the result is that you now look like twin sisters, although with different color hair, and slightly different facial features, both dressed in identical prom dresses. How can a frigging board game do this?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Terry?'  Bryony's quiet voice interjects your ranting. Her voice has changed too, becoming more mature befitting her now teenage body, but has a faltering uncertainty about what has now happened.<br>\r\n'Yes Bry. You respond.'<br>\r\n'Are you a girl now?'<br>\r\n'Apparently I am, yes. Um, when you considered who might have a beautiful body, did you by any chance feel generous and all inclusive?'<br>\r\n'Well, I, um... sorry, yes. With us both is pretty dresses I thought... well...'<br>\r\n'OK, no worries.'  Well, actually plenty of worries, but no need to upset Bry too much.<br>\r\n'Can you, um, change back again if you want to?'<br>\r\n'Well, not by any means I know, no.'<br>\r\n'What do we do now?'<br>\r\nGood question. Your sister has aged three or four years and you are now a girl, apparently around the same age that she is now, so having possibly lost a couple of years. Whatever happens you need to do something, as staying like this really isn't an option. But what?<br>\r\n'Well, to be honest I can't see much of an alternative.' You pick up the die and roll it across the board. The only way to undo these changes has got to be by completing the game. However, you fear that things could easily get worse first... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe die lands showing a six, which takes you forwards to a blank space. Bryony then rolls a five, ending on a blue square.  What does this one say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she turns towards you. <br>\r\n'I'm sorry Terry. It's all my fault we're in this mess.'  She edges towards you, and you can see tears welling up in her eyes.  Despite current appearances she's still your kid sister, so you hold open your arms to give her a hug. She moves forwards and places her head on your new bust, and you give her a kiss on her forehead.  Almost as a response she kisses you back, but as her head is buried in your bust she ends up kissing the material of your bodice. So she lifts her head a little and kisses you just above the bodice instead, being one of your new boobs.  This somehow feels quite different to when she kissed your chest earlier, although you guess her lips are bigger now, and your chest is, well, significantly different to what is was before. You kiss her forehead again, and give her a hug. Then she lifts her face towards yours, and before you realize what is happening she kisses you on your lips, and you are powerless to resist, and you kiss her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes the two of you kiss each other fervently and passionately, until you both need to stop for a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealisation then dawns on what you have been doing, although somehow you don't regret it in the slightest, but are merely a bit confused about how and why it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise attracts your attention, and you turn to see the die spinning on the spot where it had last landed on the board. 'How the...' but you're really past questioning anything about this game. The die jumps five or six inches into the air, then drops, rolling to a stop. Your placing piece then moves itself along the perimeter of the playing area, and a card is then ejected from the card dispenser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you have lost any control that you thought you may have had with this game, which now seems set to proceed regardless, but which will involve Bryony and yourself in potentially increasingly intimate activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move forward to see what the card says.</span></div></div>",

Once she is naked you get her to stand (to try to minimise the inevitable mess that will ensue on your bedroom carpet!) and you start pouring the chocolate syrup over her, starting at her shoulders and working down. As you pour some more on, you gently rub it and are surprised that it doesn't seem to run off, but is staying put. You are careful as you rub around her nipples, but her reaction clearly indicates she has no problem where your hands are, or what they're doing. In fact, she seems to be miles away, enjoying the sensations. As you make your way further down her body, you realize that you cannot pour everywhere, but need to pour the chocolate into your hand to transfer to her thighs, and ultimately her pussy. Again her reaction to your rubbing clearly indicates pleasure and not embarrassment which you'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach her feet and continue pouring / rubbing until they are covered. OK, the only bit left is Bryony's head. You presume that this forms part of Bry's 'entire body' although not sure how you'll rub the chocolate into her scalp without ruining her hair.

Bit weird really, especially now it seems to be drying a bit, especially on my eyelids. \"So, is it my thrown now, or what?

Your body moves of its own violation as you also remove your clothes and climb into the bed, alongside her. You see a little fear in your young sisters eyes; however it is only there a second before it is replaced by a look of lust. As you lie on the bed next to her, you notice her breasts have swelled slightly giving her two small A cups with puffy Areola and nipples. Your hand slides onto her stomach and then up her body to cup her newly developed breasts and play with her nipples until they are hard. \"Terry that feels so good, please don't stop.\" she moans as you continue to play with her breasts, your now hard cock rubbing against her young ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to stimulate her breasts as she starts rubbing her ass against your cock. Internally, deep in your mind you are screaming for this to stop, that it is not right, that she is your little sister. But your body is not responding to your wishes, and as your hormones kick in, that little voice of reason becomes quieter and quieter. After a few more gropes of her lovely young breasts, you lay her onto her back and slide your hand down to her tight virginal pussy. You are surprised to find that she has a few small hairs and that the lips to the entrance of her private treasure are now fully developed and inflamed with arousal (which from your limited knowledge of a 12 year old female's anatomy is extremely advanced, so you can only conclude it's another change made by the game...)  You slip your fingers between the lips of her pussy and find her to be quite wet as you middle finger slips easily inside. You bring your lips to her right breast (which you notice has grown just a little bigger still) and suck it into your mouth as your finger slips deeper into her soaking pussy. You slowly and gently finger your sister and play with her nipple with your tongue as she continues to moan underneath you, her hips rising to meet each stroke of your finger. After a few more strokes you slowly insert a second and then a third finger, careful not to break her hymen and getting her pussy ready for your cock. Bryony begins to pant louder and louder until suddenly she throws her hips into the air and lets out a loud scream of pleasure, as she does you push your fingers past her hymen, covering the pain with her pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your fingers out and begin to stimulate her young but apparently ripe clit as you take her breast into your mouth once more and tickle her nipples and Areola with your tongue. You pleasure her for a few more seconds, before you climb over her and position your cock at the entrance of her pussy. In the back of your mind you begin to scream again, screaming that this is not right, that you should not be doing this. You become fully aware of what you are about to do. The first thing you had thought about after reading the last card was impregnating your 12 year old sister, and now the game is making it happen. Your screams go silent as you push your cock into your sister's tight virgin pussy and begin to fuck her. The pleasures you feel are beyond description as you slowly inch by inch, stroke by stroke push more of your hard teen cock into your pre-teen sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony is lying under you, meeting you stroke for stroke. She wraps her arms around your neck as she pants for you to give her more and not to stop. She seems to love the new sensations you are introducing to her young body. It is not long before your cock is buried all the way inside your gasping, moaning sister. The walls of her pussy begin to milk your cock with every stroke inside her and suddenly you feel your release. You let out a load groan of pleasure as you feel your cock explode your baby making juice into her young and fertile womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you lie there together with your cock still buried in her pussy, arms wrapped around each other, as the guilt over what you had just done begins to wash over you. You look into your sister's eyes and see joy and love. \"Terry that was so amazing, I never knew anything could feel so good.\" She says as she strokes your hair. \"You definitely need to do that to me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroke her hair and give her a reassuring smile as you pull your swollen cock out of her pussy. You don't say anything as you look at your beautiful little sister, but deep in your mind you are telling yourself it will <i>never</i> happen again as you continue to beat yourself up over what just happened, keeping to yourself the knowledge that, unless something else happens to reverse it, Bryony must now be pregnant. You both climb out of the bed and get dressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony picks up the die and rolls it onto the board. You let out a sigh realizing that there is nothing to be done but continue the game, and hoping that things cannot get worse, and by finishing the game, things may return to normal. The die stops on 2 and Bryony's piece moves to a green square. Bry picks up the gold bordered card and reads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A change of atmosphere is called for a new player joins the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as she finishes reading the card the door opens and in comes..</span></div></div>",

Amy then tentatively asks Bryony \"Does that mean that I could swap what I'm wearing for your dress, and you wouldn't mind?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you'd like, yes. That's how the game works. It will give you a task to do, or a choice. If that's what you want, then just say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean tell you, so that we can swap stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just say it out loud, so that the game knows what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit silly. The game won't want to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony is giving Amy a look to say yes its silly, but try it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Amy continues, \"I want to swap everything I'm wearing with Bryony's dress.\" She then turns to Bryony, and is about to ask if they should start exchanging clothes when their clothes suddenly switch, so that Bryony is now wearing her clothes, and instead Amy is wearing the prom dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek. How did that happen?\" Amy shrieks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, long story, but just go with it. It'll get better.\" Bryony replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but...\" Amy starts again, but shuts up, and goes to admire herself in the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bryony is looking slightly uncomfortable, and you assume that Amy's clothes are a bit tighter on her. She's fiddling with the elasticated top of the pants she's now wearing, then seems to have found what she's looking for. She turns to you and whispers \"I've got two pairs of panties on now. Think I've got Amy's as well as my own.\".  You think back to what Amy had said. Ah yes, she'd said she wanted to swap what she was wearing with Bryony's dress, so that's what the game did - swap <u>all</u> of her clothes in return for the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was returning back to the game board. \"Cool game, and nice dress. Thanks for letting me play. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony replies. \"The next player throws the dice. That will be Terry. Last time that was really exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, the last throw you had you were effectively forced to impregnate your baby sister. Whilst technically exciting (at least at the time), it was something you'd desperately reverse if you could. However, you realize there's nothing you can do to rectify that without continuing with the game and hopefully finding a choice that will undo what's been done, or perhaps finishing the game may cancel out any changes... so you pick up the dice and throw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your playing piece forward on the board to match the number thrown, and it ends up on purple. You struggle to remember what category that was, finally recalling that it's objects.  You take the card as it's ejected..</span></div></div>",

You can feel a slight bump instead of your normal tackle, and are pretty confident what you'll find if you delve any further. Oh dear. You look at Bryony. She has clearly made the same - but obviously opposite discovery, and based on past experience this swap is just that - a straight swap, which means she is more than likely now sporting a 17 year old's penis and balls between her 12 year old legs - and of course you have her 12 year old vagina between yours. Your concern for your sister overtakes your immediate concerns about your own body, as you feel that it's got to be quite disconcerting for her, if not quite uncomfortable, and probably quite embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her reaction is not quite what you'd expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey Terry. This is bigger than I though it would be. How the heck do you cope with it? Hmm, how do I play with it, you know, like you sometimes do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, perhaps its turned a bit more embarrassing for you instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm older and bigger than you are, so it's bigger, alright? You wanted a straight swap, and that's what you've got - it's not adjusted to match your body!\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Amy interrupts, \"but what's happened? I can't see anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you immediately say to Bryony, spotting the look of mischief on her face. \"Not a good time.\" You then turn to Amy, not entirely sure what to say. \"You know you swapped clothes with Bryony earlier?

She immediately tries to cover her groin whilst simultaneously realizing that her pert little breasts are also uncovered, and so tries to drape her arms across them. She is clearly totally embarrassed by what has happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Why do you still have something on and I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because...\" you start to explain. \"Um, well, the first part is the game deciding that we were over-dressed, so decided we'd loose something. However, when you swapped clothes with Bry earlier you said you wanted to swap <i>everything</i> you were wearing in exchange for her dress - so you lost everything but the dress then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy is now blushing and clearly quite uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" Bryony says, \"You can have your panties back. Mine stayed put when you had the dress, so I've got yours as well as my own.\"  She then proceeds to remove the outer of the two pairs she's wearing, and passes them to Amy. Meanwhile Amy is staring at Bryony's groin, realizing that there's more being restrained by her panties than would be natural for a girl of any age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Bry? Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not, so don't even think it. I am who you always thought I was. This is the swap that Terry mentioned. I've got his boy bits, and he's got my lady bits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!\" Amy cries, clearly perturbed by the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, but for the time being there will be some oddities, and this is one of them.\" Bry replies. \"It's just part of the game.\" Bryony stops and seems to thing for a moment . \"Think if it as... No... Um...  When you started the game with us you joined us in a virtual reality game where anything can happen. It's not real, but only part of the game. When we leave the game everything will be normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shouldn't I have put on a headset or something? And shouldn't I still have it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony replies, as quick as a flash. \"Ah on, this is the latest state of the art virtual reality, and it doesn't need headsets whilst you're in this room. It's so realistic everything here seems real. Good isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm not really naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, of course not. That's only in the 'virtual reality' game. But of course it feels like you're naked, so you may be more comfortable putting the panties on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Then you haven't really swapped body parts with each other either? It's just like a 'choose your own ending 'story - but a bit more weird.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'll do. So anything that happens is just part of the immersive experience, so roll with it, but expect it to be a bit weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy seems to be much perkier now, even though you know full well that Bryony has fed her a load of baloney. However, Amy seems to have accepted it, so, well, guess it's OK. So, what next? Another throw then... It's your turn again, so you throw the die.

After the immediate shock of their bodies changing instantly, they both quite like the idea of having larger breasts - especially Amy who now believes it all to be virtual reality anyway, and so an ideal opportunity for trying things out. \"Terry, look at me again. I want them bigger!\" Without thinking, you do so, and Amy squeals with joy as her breasts grow another size. You keep you eyes focused firmly on her breasts, and they do not change any more. So, the size increase isn't affected by the duration that you look at them, but purely how many times. You wonder what would happen if you blink, and then desperately try not to, just in case. You can't help but notice how Amy's breasts now look really really attractive - although remember than Amy is still only 12, so shouldn't have the firmly shaped breasts supporting the nice perky pink nipples she has now.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that staring at a girl's breasts like this should be making you hard, but then remember than you've lost you penis - and in fact all of your boy tackle -  so you don't have anything to get hard. Mind you, you are felling a bit warm 'down below' so maybe you haven't lost all feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to try to manage the current situation you feel the only safe option is to stare at the playing board and try not to look at either girl.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bry - your turn I think...\" you say, \"and I suggest you take it quite soon.\". However, Bryony doesn't seem to be listening to you, as she doesn't react to your comment. Unwittingly you glance towards her and realize that she has a hand inside her panties. Oh crap, she's playing with herself, or rather with you, as she now has your block and tackle.  Seems you're not the only one who likes the look of Amy's growing assets, which despite your desperate attempts to avoid, you glance at again. Blimey, her breasts must now be a size D (now that you've looked at them again) and looking firm and really quite sexy. You could imagine that if you were still all you, as it were, you would probably have your hand down your own pants, so you can understand the affect on Bryony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bry!

You realize there is really only one possible interpretation of that, and to be honest you're not sure if Amy is really up for it - although realistically Bryony probably wasn't earlier on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know what to do..\" Bry says.  Hmm, you reckon that by now she does really, and it doesn't really take a lot of working out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Amy,\" Bryony starts, \"you know I said this was a very advanced VR simulator, and things can seem very real? Well, this is going to be one of those times.\" She moves towards Amy, lowering herself to a kneeling position facing her friend, who was already kneeling. Then, as if a starting flag has been dropped, she lunges toward Amy, pushing her down onto her back, kissing her on the lips, and then and seriously sucking her breasts. Meanwhile one hand pulls down her panties revealing her (or rather your) proudly erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you shouldn't look, but you have difficulty dragging you view off of the girls, despite their breasts now growing even bigger each time you focus on them. within seconds Bryony is on top of Amy, with the familiar thrusting motion, which you know can only end one way. So, you think to yourself, when Bry swapped her girl bits with your boy bits, it wasn't just 'skin deep' but all the inside workings as well, which means that technically Bryony could be making Amy pregnant! Ah, hang on, no. She's too young. You hope she's too young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Amy is starting to moan and well as Bryony grunting. (Do you sound like that when you're....?) You get slightly worried that the combined noise may be heard outside the room and attract unwanted attention, although you suspect that the game is probably controlling that somehow as well. You really don't reckon that you could get them to keep quieter now without chucking a bucket of cold water over them, so probably not something worth worrying about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBry now seems to be getting towards a climax, and both of them let out almost simultaneous screams, and Bry seems to collapse on top of Amy, as if all of her energy has been used up. Well, guess that's that over then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys OK?\" you ask.  A pair of very contented looking faces look back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're good.\" Bry replies. \"Could we just have 5 before we move on?\" As she says this you notice a slight change in Amy's expression, almost disappointment. Hmm, you don't think she want 5, but wants more of the same...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there's no time limit as such, so guess so.\" you say. \"It'll be Amy's turn next when she's ready.\" Amy's eye seem to light up at that, although you suspect she wasn't listening fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the girls sat up, tidied themselves up, and were ready to carry on. Amy picks up and throws the die. It rolls and stops, and her card is moved forward to... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

At least we still look normal.\u201d You look back at Bryony again, and back down at yourself. \u201cAside from what we\u2019re wearing.\u201d Bryony is still wearing Amy\u2019s clothes, including panties along with her own you suspect, but they seemed bigger now, fitting her new body. YOUR body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you guys really just swap bodies?\u201d Amy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I\u2019m Bryony, but I guess now I\u2019m Terry.\u201d Bryony replies.

Since you impregnated Bryony earlier, because of the game, and you now have her body, that must mean YOU are the pregnant one now. You have mixed feelings about that. You obviously don\u2019t want to be pregnant, but you\u2019re glad your sister at least doesn\u2019t have to go through with it, if it turns out the changes are permanent. At the same time, you can\u2019t help but feel guilty about the NEW issue Bryony has to deal with. Being a teenage boy. Even though it was her own fault that you switched your entire bodies, you can\u2019t help but think it wouldn\u2019t have happened if it weren\u2019t for you. You brought the game home after all, AND you \u2018accidentally\u2019 impregnated her, which may have affected her thought process when thinking about what to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I guess it\u2019s your turn now Amy.\u201d You hear your original voice say.

Everything she's wearing - the prom dress that you inadvertently imagined for her to wear a couple of minutes ago, down to the high heels, is turning a dark chocolate brown color, and before either of you can make a comment about it, it starts softening and within seconds turns into a runny chocolate, like a thick chocolate sauce, spread over most of her body, and now also dripping from her to form a puddle around her. Bryony runs a finger through it, sniffs and then and tentatively licks it. \"It's chocolate!\" she exclaims. \"What on Earth were you thinking of Terry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an overwhelming desire to plunge you face into Bryony to start devouring the chocolate covering, but manage to resist, and reply. \"Well, um, it was a bit difficult keeping my thoughts in order without, um, getting a bit... Sorry, it's not what I would have preferred, but it could have been much worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what am I supposed to do now? I can't stay like this, and I've now got no clothes on!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I'm supposed to lick it off you now.\" You're struggling to control the desperate urge to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That would just be a bit weird..\" Bryony stops for a second and a glazed look passes very briefly over her eyes, \"..but I think I'd like that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you can hold yourself back no more, the urge takes control as you lunge forward, slurping and licking at Bryony's chocolate covering without any further care or concern. Meanwhile Bryony is totally submissive to your advances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started licking at the first available and accessible area, which happens to be one of Bryony's upper legs, but you soon move to her torso and within seconds, and without realizing what you're doing, you're licking and consequently stimulating her young breasts, providing her with her first real sensuous experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continues for several minutes until the bulk of Bryony's upper torso is at least partially licked, or the chocolate has by now mostly dribbled off, although you then realize that you are now also covered by a smeary covering of the chocolate pretty much from head to toe, and you are both lying in a puddle of chocolate on your bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh blimey. What a mess. What now?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony also seems to break from the spell, and realizing she's now naked, sits with her legs together, and hands in a protective posture over her groin, despite the fact that you were licking that area only a few minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'd better clean this up, and get something for you to wear.\" you say to your little sister.

You have navy shorts reaching down to just above your knees, with short navy socks. You are also both wearing black shoes, Bryony's geisha style peep toe high heels, and yours flat leather loafer style.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terry,\" Bryony manages to squeak out, \"What's just happened? Where have my clothes gone? What I am wearing?\" She looks up towards you, and seems to suddenly notice that you're wearing something similar.\"And what are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now calming down slightly from your initial panic. \"Um, not really sure Bry, but it seems to be part of the game, although I'm blowed if I can see how it did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath, and try to think it through. The card said you both need to be dressed more appropriately, but it didn't specify what for. As it's clearly a Japanese game (or at least this was what you deduced from the print on the box) then you are clearly expected to be Japanese, or at least dressed as if you are. How it managed to achieve it you really don't know, but realistically there's nothing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's quite cute.\" Bryony says, apparently calming down a little. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're Japanese school uniforms, as I think it's a Japanese game.\" You look down at your shorts. \"Presumably summer uniform...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they wear high heels to school in Japan? I feel four inches taller with these on.  So what are we supposed to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't got a clue,\" you reply. \"Guess it's just a change of clothing to better fit with the game as it goes on, but otherwise don't know.

Think I have a pretty good idea about it. Not sure what the next bit means though...\"  you look at her quizzically, so she continues. \"It says that if I don't get a good reaction I'll get a forfeit... but if I do get a good reaction <u>you</u> will have a forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, that's new. A forfeit for not doing something - or not doing it well enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno,\" you respond. \"Guess we'll have to wait to find out what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stand, and as instructed Bryony stands tight behind you, reaches her hands around your waist, and commences feeling around in your crotch. Despite every attempt to think neutral thoughts the inevitable happens and Bryony becomes aware of a slight bulge developing, which her hands gravitate more closely towards, cupping her hands around it as best she can. After about a minute you have a healthy erection developing inside your pants, being goaded on by Bryony's hands which are now caressing rather than rubbing. You cannot help questioning yourself how naive Bryony actually is, as she seems to have cottoned on very quickly to how best to fondle you... By the time two minutes have passed you are far less bothered that it's your pre-teenage sister caressing you, and you're starting to loose focus slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Bryony then stops and steps away from you. You take a breath, and try to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Task completed, and I'd guess I got a good reaction, so I won't get a forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fair enough,\" you reply, wondering what the forfeit you will get for actually doing what the card instructed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look expectantly at the board lying on the floor, waiting before you take the next go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Bryony yelps suddenly, pointing.

Oh, its gold. You can't quite remember what that signifies, but you check on the board and the square your counter is on it definitely green.

I've got to stand behind you, put my arms around you, and, um, tickle your nipples for two minutes.\" The card doesn't actually say tickle, but stimulate and arouse, but you're not sure whether to say this to Bry. Again this one has an additional line, suggesting that a good response will be rewarded. Typical, not enough information to work out what it really means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony turns around and you stand close behind her, conscious that your erection has not yet subsided, so you can feel it pushing against her, and inevitably she'll feel it too. Oh well. You wrap you arms around her, cupping a hand over each of her little breasts through the material of the school uniform blouse. One advantage of the four inch heels she's now wearing is that her breasts are at a more comfortable height for you to reach easily, with your waists nearly level. Hmm, you hadn't noticed when the Japanese school uniforms materialized, but under the shirt Bry has no bra, so you can quite easily feel her nipples, although she doesn't yet have a lot in the way of supporting boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start caressing her nipples and after a few seconds of her fidgeting a bit realize she's actually quite enjoying it. At least she's stopped fidgeting, and seems to be responding to your hand movements. After 30 seconds or so you change your positioning slightly and start gently pinching and pulling each nipple, which seems to get a positive vocal reaction from Bry. By the time a minute has passed you feel Bry's hands clutch hold of your buttocks, and this additional stimulus is actually building your erection again, which with Bry holding tight onto your buttocks pushes even more into her own butt. This seems to stimulate her even more, and you could swear she's panting a little.You wonder whether to ease off playing with her nipples, but decide she may as well enjoy it, so carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how you'll know when the two minutes are up, and hear a tiny ping, which you assume is a timing device. You relax your hold on Bry's nipples, but she immediately puts her hands over yours and pushes them tighter again. You know you don't need to carry on caressing her, but guess there's nothing stipulates you can't. However you ease back a bit, recognizing you could well be on way to giving you little sister a nipple orgasm, which when all is said and done could be considered inappropriate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you notice the growing curvature around the base of each nipple, almost if as her breasts were growing larger.

You then recall the timer for the allotted time had sounded, so technically the turn was up, and what did the card say? A good response will be rewarded.

She looks around her with a shocked expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Mother of...  what just happened? How did I get here? Why are you wearing a sailor suit - oh, both of you are ...What the frig is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Becky,\" Bryony replies before you have really taken in what has happened. \"We're playing a magical game that Terry found. I prompted him to think of you, and you've been pulled here to join us in the game. Sorry about that... Hey, I really like your skirt! I do love girls who wear really short skirts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looks dumbstruck. She moves her mouth as if to speak, then stops, then tries again. \"Pardon? What do you mean a magical game? You mean a... um.\" She grinds to a halt.  \"What skirt?\" She looks down at herself. She's wearing a tee over a black micro skirt.  \"Where the hell did this come from? I was wearing pants a second ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/7f/67/9c7f673e48252f7e67d723e243ca0517.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/7f/67/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you aren't now.\" Bry responds. \"That really suits you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell, you must admit that it does suit her. You love seeing a girl, any girl, in a really short skirt, and especially Becky...   oh, hang on a second. That's pretty much what Bryony's just said. Oh crap. Somewhere in the past few seconds it seems you have somehow shared your love of girls wearing short skirts with your sister. No, surely that was just a coincidence - wasn't it?   Well, based on your most recent conversation with her, and the fact that Becky is now standing in front of you, you could well be sharing your girlfriend with Bry too. You're not sure how that is going to work out...  Meanwhile you need to focus your attention on Becky, which admittedly in her micro skirt is quite easy to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where were you, and what were you doing a minute ago? What actually happened to you?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was at home. I'd just had a drink in the kitchen and picked up my bag to go out for a walk. It was a bit weird. There seemed to be a sudden build up of static in the air, and then everything around me seemed to go fuzzy, like way out of focus, and then I appeared here. It only seemed to take an instant. So, what did happen? What did Bryony mean by a magical game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its a long story, but that's pretty much the core of it. I picked up this game at a garage sale earlier, but when we started playing it we realized that its either magical, or has a very high level of future technology built in that makes it as close to magic as makes no real difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" She does not really sound at all convinced.. \"So, why are you both dressed the same?\" She notices your boxer shorts. \"Almost the same... A sailor themed game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Japanese themed, we think. At least it seems to be a Japanese game. Well, not actually Japanese themed really. More, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Be friendly to your opponent whilst wearing a Japanese school uniform.\" Bryony chips in. \"Or at least it was earlier. I think Terry forgot to mention something to then. Perhaps its now 'Be very friendly to your opponent, and see what a forfeit does to their Japanese school uniform.' \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky give you a very quizzical look. \"OK, so why I am I here again? I get the feeling I'm intruding on a private party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you're not intruding,\" you reply, desperately trying to avoid Becky getting the wrong idea. \"You'd never intrude. You're always very welcome here, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here 'cos Terry was thinking of you as part of his last task.\" Bryony says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that goes some way to explain the short skirt then.\" Becky replies. \"Hah! Got it! It's VR isn't it? Yes, of course. I'm not really here, I'm still at home. Wow, it's good isn't it? So, how did you get the VR helmet on me then? That was sneaky. So, I'm not really wearing this skirt, but it just looks like it.\" She feels the skirt with her hand. \"...and feels like it. Grief, VR technology has advanced a long way, hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not entirely sure if Becky is talking to herself, or to you. However, you reckon that her acceptance of it all as being VR is probably easier than getting her to believe the truth, so you're inclined not to contradict her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then. Now you've cajoled me into your VR game, you'd better explain the rules. Can I sit down, or do I have to stay standing up? If I sit down what am I sitting on, or am I already sitting down? Can I tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, you can sit down if you want to.\" you reply. \"In fact you can move around and do anything you like, as if you were really here, so don't worry about that.\"  You decide to continue before she questions her 'real' location any further. \"So, we're playing a game in this VR simulation of my room. We're still getting to understand the rules and objectives, but basically you throw the die, move the playing piece and follow the instructions on the card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so Trivial Pursuits then? Bit boring, and doesn't explain why you're wearing that,\" indicating a figure towards your clothes, \"or what Bryony said earlier.\"  she looks at you, but you look back with a blank expression, as you're trying to recall precisely what Bryony had said. So Becky clarifies... \"Be very friendly to your opponent...?\"  Ah right, that... OK, may be that does need a bit of further explanation.  Especially if she thinks a VR version of Trivial Pursuits is boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so it's not the standard game of TP, but a special Japanese version. It was only once we'd started we realized the potential scope of the, um. tasks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namely...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we think it's basically a sex game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK.\" Becky replies. \"Which is why you're playing it with your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was totally unintentional!\" you respond immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you're here.\" Bry says, stepping in with what you must admit is a very timely and quite diplomatic comment - if not at all accurate.  Then she continues. \"We've only just started playing, and really haven't got very far at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you thought you needed someone to try out you newly acquired  sexual techniques on, eh?\" Becky asks, looking at you. You don't notice, but Bryony's eye's, that have been fixed on Becky since she appeared, suddenly brighten, and a slight flush comes to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, if you've up for it.\" you reply. You're really not sure if you're happy Becky is joining the game or not. You didn't have much control earlier, but you have a feeling things could get much worse. Then again Becky thinks its just VR, so guess you could get away with quite a lot before it becomes too embarrassing for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count me in then.\" Becky announces. \"What do I do?\"    <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm to make Becky feel welcome and make sure she's happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shouldn't be difficult. She seems ready to join the action.\" You turn towards Becky, who has sat the other side of you. \"You're happy enough, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony realizes that this is not going to be as easy as she'd hoped, and is also aware that the card mentioned a forfeit if she's unsuccessful in improving Becky's happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but the task is for me to make Becky feel more welcomed and to make sure she's happy, so I need to do something... Tell you what Becky, why don't you come and sit between us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Becky replies and crawls past you, and sits equal distance between you and Bry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite an unusual little skirt,\" Bry says. \"It looks really nice on you, you know. You've get really nice legs. That dress makes them look really slim and long. Wish I had legs half as nice as yours. Yours are as smooth as anything too - I guess you use something to keep like that - but they look so soft and natural.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I shave them every week, but rub in baby oil every day. That keeps them soft, and gives them a subtle glow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I wouldn't have thought of that.\" Bry says.\"Would you mind if I touch one, just to feel how soft it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, of course I don't mind! I don't spend all that time shaving and oiling them, just to have them ignored. It's nice to have someone who actually notices them, and appreciates the effort to keep them looking good.\"  You're aware of the slight sneer towards you as she says this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBry reaches out with one hand and gently touches Becky's shin, and rubs her fingers gently up and down. She gives a slightly disappointed look, as if this was neither as smooth or soft as she's expected.  Becky of course notices this. \"Don't be silly!\" she says. \"You've picked one of the worse bits. That's right on the bone, so you can't expect it to be at it's softest there.\" She pulls Bry's hand further up her leg, and then guides it gently up and down, so that Bry's fingers are now running up and down Becky's thigh. \"Generally speaking, the higher up you go, the softer the skin will naturally be, so if you want to feel the softness it's up here... \" and Becky pulls Bry's hand even higher up her leg, so she's now rubbing her upper thigh, right at the edge of the micro skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you are wondering what the heck is going on, and whether Bry is doing this intentionally, or merely trying to make Becky feel a bit more relaxed (in which case its a weird way of doing so, all things considered). You are slightly concerned about the potential issue of Bry apparently now sharing your like of girls in very short skirts, as Becky clearly is now wearing, and whilst you don't have a particular problem with your little sister rubbing her hand up and down your girlfriend's thigh, you wonder where this may be leading...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Bry has stopped rubbing Becky's thigh, and is again focusing on Becky's shin. Oh, hang on, the other shin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I see what you mean,\" Bry says. \"It's soft here,\" (with her hands resting on Becky's shins), \"but as you move up...\"  (as her hands slowly move up to Becky's thighs) \"it really does get softer and smoother. You really do have beautiful skin. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky is clearly quite relaxed about this all, and seems to be enjoying the attention, and not at all perturbed by her boyfriends's little sister touching her thighs, um, OK, now her inner thighs, OK, maybe not touching, but <i>caressing</i> her inner thighs. OK, there's definitely something going on here, but you're not sure what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK with me doing this?\" Bry asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, yes.\" Becky responds. \"That's just fine. You can do that as much as you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBry is now stroking Becky's legs pretty much their entire length, from the tops of her thighs right down to her feet now, and Becky is clearly enjoying every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony, in an attempt to work out if she'll be liable for a forfeit or not asks \"Are you feeling happier now Becky? I can stop if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmmmm. I am very happy, thank you.\" Becky responds, in a somewhat coy and diminutive voice. \"Please stop only if you want to. Otherwise I would be happy for you to continue... I only want to please you... Miss.\"    <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen Becky pulls up her ruffled micro skirt, revealing her panties, and lies back, closing her eyes. Bry's hands have been quite close touching Becky's panties, but she has been consciously avoiding doing so until now. She seems a bit uncertain, but after her previous experience rubbing you in the equivalent place she places one hand over the outline of Becky's pussy through her panties and starts gently caressing. The response from Becky is immediate.   \"Ooooh... that is so good. Thank you.\" Her eyes open, and she looks at Bry with a weird expression. \"Please tell me what you want me to do for you Mistress. I want to please you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit, you think. What the Hell is going on? \"Um, Bry...\" you say, \"Is there something you forgot to tell me earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, this isn't quite what I expected.\" she replies, a bit flustered and embarrassed by what is happening. \"I was tasked to make her happier, otherwise I'd get a forfeit. When it said she'd become submissive I thought she'd just let me touch her a bit more readily, but not this. What do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tempted to say she should have thought of that before, but realize that's a bit futile in the circumstances.  Is Becky only submissive to Bry, or you as well? Will it only last until the next throw, or longer? Will Becky remember any of it later on? This could turn out either very good, or very bad. Whilst you are weirdly quite enjoying watching your little sister playing with your girlfriend, and getting quite excited yourself, you sort of feel it should be you doing it, not Bry, so perhaps you'd be OK moving things along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you either carry on what you're doing, but I'm not sure where that will go...\" <i>Actually you half hope she <u>will</u> carry on, as this is getting quite, um, entertaining (as your throbbing cock confirms).</i>  \"Presumably if she's calling you Mistress she's sufficiently submissive, so I guess that means you've successfully completed the task.\"   <i>Hmm, that would be a bit of a shame really, although Bry is only 12, so maybe it a bit of a stretch for her to take a dominant role if it were to continue...</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe we should try carrying on the game with the next throw?\" you suggest, sort of hoping in equal measures as to what she decides.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes have become focused very tightly on Becky's ruffled micro skirt, whilst her hands are still caressing Becky. Then she starts muttering quietly to herself. \"I do love girls in really short skirts...  I do love girls in really short skirts...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst one of her hands stays seemingly well attracted to Becky, the other makes it's way back to her own panties, and Bry starts playing with herself, pretty much in unison with what she's doing to Becky.

Hang on, this is what Becky was trying to describe early - a build up of static in the air. Then you notice everything is going slightly out of focus, and then, in an instant everything seemed to change. There was no big bang, no black out, and your vision is now crystal clear again. Except you've now moved, and somehow are propped up right next to Becky, with one hand caressing her panties. Before you have a chance to consider what has happened, there's a shout from a few feet away in a male voice \"What the.. Oh, crap, what the hell have you done??!!\" You look up to see yourself looking back at you.  It takes a second to work out that it is you, which then leads to ... you look down at yourself, and realise you are no longer you, you are now Bryony. \"Oh crap...\" you echo what Bry had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do?\"  Bry in your body asks. <br>\r\n\"Nothing. I was just watching the two of you. I didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"God, were you jacking off watching us?\" Bry asks, noticing your / her hand wrapped around your cock.\"<br>\r\n\"No! Well, not really. I was just appreciating the view. I wasn't doing anything more than that. I certainly wasn't doing anything worse than you, playing with yourself and Becky at the same time.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I think there was some influence of the game with that. You had no excuse...\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I think we have a bigger issue to tackle here though, don't you?\" you ask. \"Like the fact that we seem to have swapped bodies.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, guess this card may have something to do with it.\" Bry says, indicating the card laid on the game board. 'Are there any changes you want to make to any of the players?'.  You obviously wanted the change to be swapping bodies with me.\"<br>\r\n\"No... Oh... Ah... \"  Then it hits you. \"Oh flip. No, I wasn't even aware of the card. But I did think it was a bit unfair I was on the sidelines, and wanted to swap to be where you were. That's not the same as wanting to swap bodies with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry to disappoint, but seems I'm the big brother now. So, am I still me, or am I really you?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, what?\"<br>\r\n\"So, has my brain swapped over, or just my consciousness, or am I really still in my body but think I'm in yours?\"<br>\r\n\"I really haven't a clue. Does it matter?\"<br>\r\n\"It might. Don't know yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must admit it does all seem a bit surreal listening to your voice coming from someone else - well technically not someone else, but somewhere else, and without you controlling it. Meanwhile whenever you speak it's with Bry's higher pitched tones. and of course, you also now have her body. So you're a girl - a tweeny girl. Maybe something you'd want to investigate a bit later, if the actual owner of that body wasn't staring at you from four feet away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what now. Becky seems to be coming around from her magically imposed slumbers, so you're going to have to explain what's being going on to her.  You immediate withdrawn you hand from near her panties. Probably best not to cause any distractions explaining that. Oh, what a mess. OK, quite a fun and intriguing mess, but a mess nevertheless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if that last turn was yours,\" Bry asks, \"Is it my turn now, or does Becky get a look in?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a fraction of a second you want to correct her assumption, but then decide that trying to tell her you're not actually Bry, but only happen to be in Bry's body, and Bry in yours, seems a bit outlandish, so you decide to shut up.

A further search brings up a host of different comics and their characters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Bryony asks. <br>\r\n\"Potentially a safe option.\" you reply, whilst still scrolling down the list on your phone.\"I need to nominate a character I aspire to being more like, and I'm not entirely sure what this game will do once I've made a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean like Pokemon or Donkey Kong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, but I think they're just video games, not comics, although you're probably right. They probably started out as comics - manga. I was thinking something a bit more real to life - after all I don't want to end up dressed in a furry costume next, which I have a feeling this game may just about be able to do.\" You look down at the Japanese school uniform you're currently wearing, and appreciate this game seems to be able to do quite a lot, so a furry costume would be easy. You continue searching for a male character who's decent looking, dressed in relatively normal clothes, and potentially the good guy, but there are loads of different ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got to name one, or just think of one?\" Bry asks, whilst peering as best she can at your screen. \"You might have trouble pronouncing some of those names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grief, I hadn't thought of that.\" You look at the next one ... Wo Jia Dashi Xiong Naozi You Keng. What? Oh hang on, that isn't the character, that's the story. Here's another one - Akui Hibiki... Oh, no. that's a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that you are probably running out of time, so decide to ignore the web search, and try to focus on what you think a character might be like. If it's a comic then it would be a drawing, so not really lifelike. You blank out any thoughts of Pokemon or similar. You did watch one Japanese animated video once, but that was a boy having sex with, oh, his mother and sister. Whoops, not that... Come on Terry, think.. Your thoughts switch between trying to visualize animated characters, but draw back when all you can think of is Sailor Moon or other girls with over large eyes and very short skirts, and instead turn to your real life heroes, including your (new adopted) heroin Ariana, and her cute cat ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel something again. Oh crap. It's that breeze again, but instead of just blowing through your head, you can feel it all over. \"But I haven't chosen yet...\" you think to yourself. Suddenly your body feels like a lead weight, although it eases after a few seconds. Then you seem to return to relative normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey. I'm glad that's over.\" you say.

I mean what has happened to your hair? Are you wearing cat ears?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" is all you can say in response. \"I'm not wearing cat ears\". you reach your hands to your head to feel for these apparent cat ears, only to find that you do indeed have cat ears, but more worryingly they appear to be attached to you, and as you move your hands around your head you cannot find your own ears. You jump up and head to the mirror and are are shocked to find that your rather scraggy brown hair is now dark blue and sticking up in spikes, and you have a pair of enlarged and somewhat pointed ears nearer the top of your head instead of your own ears which have disappeared, or presumably mutated into these new alternatives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit. How the Hell am going to explain this to mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean. Can't you just take them off.\" Bry asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. They're well and truly attached. They seems to have replaced what was there before. I now have cat ears instead of my own.\" You realize that actually your hearing has improved immensely, and it almost seem like Bry is shouting at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your hair?\" Bry asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno about that.\"  you reply, suddenly thinking a bit more about the implications of the change. \"Guess as I was thinking about cats ears, the game picked a suitable manga character that it obviously reckoned I somehow aspired to be more like...  A character with spiky blue hair and cat ears...  that I've never read about, or seen. Oh shit. Whoops, sorry Bry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess at this stage is as good as mine, but based on what seems to be happening I think we're going to find out a lot more about  Japanese comics and / or animation..\" (or probably sexy outfits / sexual preferences and possibly weird Japanese amine, you think to yourself)  \"...than we probably would ever want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the hairs quite cool,\" Bry says, \"and the ears are kinda cute on you, you know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but <i>you</i> don't have to wear them, or rather, um, <i>your</i> ears haven't been replaced by them...   You are tempted to purr at Bry, but decide not to.  That might freak her out, although if she thinks you look cute, maybe not. \"Your go Bry....\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony picks up and throws the die.

Whilst you're not entirely comfortable in the Japanese school uniform, you're a bit worried what the game would be likely to change it to. You must admit, though, that the school uniform does quite suit Bryony, and her short pleated skirt and long socks make here legs look longer and slimmer than normal... Well that could all be about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the card from the dispenser. <i>&lt;Now that you have chosen your Manga character, your clothing should match&gt;  </i>    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, there you are. Just as you thought - another change. But who is the character the game's referring to, you wonder, so what clothing does he wear? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increasingly familiar feeling of a transformation comes over you, and as you look down you can see the school uniform fading away and transforming into something else.  After a few seconds it's all done, and you inspect what you have on. \"OK, you've got to be kidding!\" you exclaim. You are wearing a cropped black top, almost a vest with both of your shoulders uncovered, quite tightly fitting, stopping just above your navel. Below this you have long black pants, again quite tight fitting, although quite comfortable. However, on each arm you have a sleeve matching the top running down from above your elbow to your wrists.  Whilst odd enough, you are taken back by a glove on your right hand.with what seems to be metal spikes or claws on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Bry says, her mouth gaping. \"That's so cool. So who are you?<br>\r\n A sort of cat boy? \"If you weren't my brother I'd seriously consider you as a pin up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well.\" you reply. So who the heck are you supposed to be?. You are torn between checking it out on the internet or playing along without knowing - after all there's not much you could do to control it either way. You look in the mirror again. Actually you do look quite cool, and you give yourself a smile, although to you it seems quite flirtatious. Do you usually smile like that?  Whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, cat boy,\" Bry says, interrupting your thoughts. \"You've been admiring yourself for long enough now. Think it must be my turn now. Hope I get to wear something different like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBry then throws the dice, and moves forward to ...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realise that this is the first time anything has happened to Bry's body - the previous changes were only to her clothes, so this is the first chance you've had to see what happens from an onlooker's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are first aware of a slight fuzziness to her appearance. You're not sure if it's your eyes at first, but when you look away from her everything is crystal clear. Nope, she's gone slightly fuzzy, almost a bit out of focus, however that is possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair is the first thing you notice changing.The color is changing from her natural redhead to, well, pink, quite a vibrant pink, and you can see a couple of mini ponytails appearing. On top of this you can see some form of a hat materialising - like a black beanie forming into a point at either side like horns or bat ears.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice that the Japanese school uniform is fading, and in some areas disappearing entirely, being replace by a red two piece, with a lot of Bryony showing in between. The top is a tube with straps over her shoulders, ending right under her chest like a bikini top, but it looks like bat wings spread across her chest. The bottom part is like a swimsuit bottom in boy shorts style, but it also has the bat wings, so she appears to have a red bat across her chest, and another across her bottom. Her arms are now bare, along with most of her torso from the bikini top down to her waist. She's wearing thigh high socks striped red and white, and black ankle boots with bat wings at the ankles. You also notice that she now has a tail! It's black, very slim and quite long that ends in an upside down heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also seems to have grown taller, like she's a couple of years older, and her facial features are a bit more mature, so perhaps just into her teens, with long slender legs. You half wonder if it's possible for her to have really gotten older, or is it just her external appearance?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is so cool!\" she says. \"Far better than that school uniform.\" she looks herself up and down, then turns to the mirror, when she becomes aware of her tail swaying behind her.  \"What the heck is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving you the chance to answer she concentrates a bit, and her tail starts moving under her control, bring the black heart around to her front. \"Wow, I've got a tail! How cool is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool,\" you reply, wondering both what the purpose of the tail is, and what character she is now dressed as, or rather, has become, as clearly she has physically changed to become the character, much like you have with your cat ears. You decide to take the opportunity whilst Bry is checking out her costume, and her new body, to pick up your cell, and run a search of manga characters with Bry's fairly specific features. It didn't take long to bring back a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/10/46/b5/1046b5678f5d43f0c3bce7e1a224cdc7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap, you think to yourself. Your sister seems to have morphed into a manga sex bomb with a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"OK, so I know who you are now.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Amulet Devil!\" she replies in a weird cry, that seems to have its own echo.<br>\r\n\"Um, yes. How the Dickens did you know - I've only just found it, um you, now.\"   <br>\r\n\"Not sure, but I know I'm Amulet Devil, and that I've transformed into this from my true self, Amu Hinamori, and I'm feeling a bit wicked and ready for some fun.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so not quite the outcome you had expected. Bry seems to have taken on not only the physical appearance but also some physiological traits of her character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK pussy cat boy, what do you fancy doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. A thought occurs to you. If you have been able to find Bryony's manga character, you should be able to find yours too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your cell again and, rather than running a fresh search, an idea comes to you that the two characters may be connected, so you look for other characters associated with Amulet Devil. This takes you to Hinamori, Amu, which is odd, 'cos Bry had said the name the other way around. OK, later. You then have a list of other names, but one image stands out - a boy with blue hair. OK, so this must be you then - Ikuto Tsukiyomi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/f2/5a/86f25aedce85f8409189094620dc86f0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/f2/5a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read on. Here it is - he has a Chara-change (whatever that is) that transforms him into Black Lynx, with cat ears and a tail, and causes him to behave much like a cat.  Oh, crap, so Bry calling you pussy cat boy wasn't too far from the truth. However, despite having the cat ears, you don't have a tail, which you reckon is a bit odd. Surely you should be one or the other - either, um, Ikuto Tsukiyomi or Black Lynx - although if as Black Lynx you start behaving like a cat, maybe it's as well you're somewhere between the two.  Oh crap. You notice one last thing. Seems that Ikuto has a thing for Amu, and whilst he teases her a lot is actually in love with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryony distracts your attention from your searching  \"Come on pussy cat boy. I'm waiting for an answer, and you really don't want to keep me waiting... \" What you gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

He's also getting slimmer around his waist and as you watch he's becoming more like you in appearance.

That does not bode well for the future. Your Dad is clearly not gay - having made his his personal preference for the female sex very clear, and you really cannot get your head around how he could possibly be your lover. You can only assume that the game should be played with people of different gender, and therefore the question assumed the other player would be the opposite sex, which would make more sense.  Hmm, perhaps best not to say anything about your Dad's change yet - after all, he'll doubtless find out soon enough, and it may be better if he doesn't make the connection with this question that you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you done then?

The way the previous moves in the game appeared to be going, you were a bit worried that you and you dad may have been forced to, well, engage in an activity that you really wouldn't have wanted to. Especially with your own dad. Ugh. Hopefully having a girl here could make things a bit easier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your Dad, equally flummoxed by the appearance of a semi naked girl in the room, lets out a slow whistle and then says \u201cWell, hello there, and who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you realize she isn't real. She's a life size, um, doll. However, a second after your Dad speaks, she turns her head towards him, and replies  \u201cWatashinonamaeha r\u012bnidesu\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. Not only is the game Japanese, but the talking doll is too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, do you speak English?\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head turns towards you. She speaks again. \u201cEigo o kenshutsu shite imasu. Eigo o hanasu y\u014d ni henk\u014d shimasu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not going well, you ponder. Then she speaks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is R\u012bni.\u201d She speaks with a distinct Japanese accent, although now at least in English so you can understand her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello Rini!\u201d Your dad jumps back in. \u201cThat's an unusual name. Does it have a meaning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d R\u012bni replies, \u201cit means little bunny. I am here to be your little bunny today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'm sure that won't be a problem in the slightest...\u201d your dad replies. He turns to you, and in a loud whisper says \u201cWhere the Hell did she come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all part of the game. I don't know how it does it, but it can make things appear, and um, change, and, well, I don't know what else yet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admit to being quite fascinated by the doll, or rather, R\u012bni. So far her body hasn't moved, but her head clearly has, and whilst her mouth clearly isn't as sophisticated as a real mouth, it moves in sync with the speech, so all really advanced robotic technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad then asks \u201cSo Rini, how can you be our little bunny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very inviting, satisfying, highly energized and very prolific. If you trust me with your little kokku, I will give you a big jiku. You will not be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you've got to agree she's quite inviting and could imagine she could be satisfying, obviously in a pretty specific way. Presumably she's got high output batteries or something, although at the moment she's not doing much, so wonder how she would be energized. You're even less certain about her being prolific. What is that supposed to mean? Maybe its just a translation thing, and means something, well something different? And what are kokku and jiku?  Guess little and big suggest something, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",

You guess some of the translations aren't complete, but that doesn't really help your understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile R\u012bni's arms have moved in an almost lifelike way, and undone the buckles holding up the front of her outfit, uncovering her breasts, which you have to admit are quite worthy of your attention.

Somehow. At least your dad won't be watching you bonking a sex doll, which is probably a good thing. You approach R\u012bni. She wiggles her breasts at you. No doubt her idea of foreplay.

You can feel one of R\u012bni's hands on your thigh, moving up towards your crotch, and starts caressing you through your jeans. Despite knowing she's not actually alive, you sense the adrenaline starting to pump around in your body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please kiss my oppai,\" R\u012bni says, and she pushes her breasts towards you, \"My tits.  I will do something with your little kokku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you have a hand on one breast already, and the other isn't far from your mouth, so you tilt your head down slightly, place your lips around the free nipple, and start kissing and sucking it. Oddly you can feel it responding to your kissing, growing stiffer and bigger. Then you feel R\u012bni's hand around your cock. Ah, your kokku. Of course. Mind you, you do wonder how the heck a sex doll could get your jeans undone as quickly as that and be able to control her hand so accurately... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will now make you little kokku into a big jiku, and then we can join together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes her manipulation in your pants has indeed made you little kokku grow a lot bigger than it had been, although whether it's now a jiku you really haven't a clue. Combined with what R\u012bni is doing down below, kissing R\u012bni's tits is quite absorbing, and you've forgotten any concerns about her being a sex doll. She feels and responds pretty much like a real girl which you know is pretty weird, but you're starting to get used to things being weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both collapse onto the cushion, with her underneath and you naturally on top. \"Now it is time.\" she says. \"I want your jiku inside my chitsu to make new little bunny.\"  You assume its effectively pre-programmed sound bites, as clearly you can't actually make a sex doll pregnant to make anything new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no hesitation in lining up your jiku with what you assume is her chitsu, and you slide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel her responding in a way you're not sure a sex doll should (having never used one before), and you can feel her hands caressing your backside (which you're sure they wouldn't do!) as you start building a thrusting momentum. As you continue to do this, R\u012bni starts making moaning sounds (again, you assume pre-programmed sound bites), and she seems to grasp your buttocks, pulling in time with your bouncing thrusts. This continues for several seconds, and despite your best intentions you can feel yourself getting to the point of no return. R\u012bni grabs your buttocks even tighter, and in a much louder and almost agitated voice, says \"I need your sheshi. I need your sheshi now! Let us join together now, we can be within each other!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're barely aware what she's saying, and in reality are well passed doing anything other than letting rip and pumping yourself hard into R\u012bni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climax in an explosive blast, oblivious to anything and everything else. You're caught up in sheer bliss, pumping and thrusting, imaging the two of you somehow intertwined and interconnected, merging together in this ecstatic frenzy. It feels almost like you're hammering your essence into Rini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you are spent, and can do no more than pant and try to relax as you feel exhausted like you've just completed a full marathon in record time. Weirdly you feel really numb all over, like your senses have all shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calm down a bit, and try to focus your eyes and mind back on reality again.</span></div></div>",

However, you know you'll have to persevere. \"R\u012bni has exchanged with Terry-san, and will be continuing the game for him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why did you say K\u014dhai?  You thought nookie, or at least thought you had... After all you weren't actually propagating, although actually in a way you were. You realize you also now know what kokku and jiku are, and shinzui. Oh crap. You now realize you had shared your shinzui - your essence with R\u012bni, or rather with the silicone robot doll. And what you have back is the body of a Japanese girl, and apparently the ability to think and speak the language. Nice. Pretty useful in the right place, but not really here or now.  You're actually a bit more concerned that your body now appears to be a silicone robot doll, presumably now occupied by the essence of R\u012bni. However, logically you realize there's not much you can do about it now, but best to continue the game, and hopefully things will eventually work themselves out again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you will need to throw the dice now.\" you say to your dad, in your now strongly Japanese accented English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then, this could be more fun than playing with Terry anyway, wherever he's gone.\" You turn around. The Terry doll has disappeared - your only connection to your own body. So, you definitely have no choice now. Unless you want to spend the rest of your life as a Japanese girl, you must play on. Yabai, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dad picks up and throws the dice. He moves his player forward to the ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will do everything it is required to do, either as a jiku or a chitsu. And you can replace your little kokku with a big jiku whenever you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I think I could do that before.

I'm having trouble remembering anything at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so do you remembering playing the board game with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, sorry. I can vaguely remember something about a board game, but I don't think I was playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Is it possible that the game has taken your dad's unwitting request to acquire Trudy's attributes further than even you could have expected, and over-written his consciousness, wiping out his memories? Presumably it can't replicate Trudy's memories as she isn't here to access them, so your dad now has none of her memories, but her personality and a recollection of a few minimal facts. So, does he now truly believes he is Trudy, be it with a memory issue? This could get very awkward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what do you remember? Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. You're Terry. You're my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you here? Or rather why are you here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess because we're, um, boyfriend and girlfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite what I meant, but never mind. So, do you remember why you're wearing the clothes you have on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my goodness. I don't know. This is really weird.\" He / she has a genuine look of panic. \"Do you have any idea what's going on Terry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're not yet totally convinced that your dad isn't still there, acting and pretending, but your gut says that what he / she is saying is truthful, although having this dialogue spoken in Trudy's sweet and dulcet tones and 100% with her natural inflections is definitely helping to convince you. OK, so supposing its true. Your dad has effectively been replaced in body and mind by a clone of Trudy, albeit with no memory. So, until something else happens in the game to change things again, the other player is now a girl who thinks she's Trudy. Maybe you'd better think of her as Trudy2, as she's clearly not your dad any longer. Hmm, guess you can't call her Trudy2 without upsetting her. OK, Trudie. Sounds the same, but you know the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you start to explain. \"It's a very long and complicated story, but I came across an old board game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one?\" she asks, indicating the board in front of you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this one. However, a lot of things have happened since then, some which I'm not sure if I can explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like why I'm dressed in a jacket and shirt with no pants, and can't remember anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, pretty much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a couple of options I guess. If you're uncomfortable you could get changed into something better fitting. Or we could just carry on with the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that wise? Didn't you suggest the strange things started happening after you started playing the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, that's true. But I think that might be the only way to understand what's going on, and try to fix things.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Trudie say?  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It's actually called Sexual Pursuits. It has six categories - blue is nice, green is naughty, purple is objects, yellow is clothes, orange is the human body, and red is sharing. I assumed it would just ask a question and if you're right you have another go. But it's a bit more intense than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIntense...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you don't really have an option to not answer, or not take on the challenge.

So it may be a secret wish, but that's all it will ever be. Is that naughty enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it works for me.

Then she pulls off the jacket that she's wearing, leaving her wearing the white shirt your dad had on originally, plus his boxer shorts, albeit it quite loose fitting on Trudie. She climbs astride you, and starts kissing you more forcefully, whilst undoing her shirt buttons until her breasts fall free. She pulls your hands up to her breasts, cupping one of your hands on each. You have to admit that despite your reservations about getting too involved with what is technically your dad, you are quite enjoying this now, and are happy to respond by returning her kisses and caressing her breasts. For a few moments your mind is definitely distracted from the worry of what could happen next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a gentle gong sounding, and realize this must be the timer for Trudie's task. However you're quite reluctant to stop now \u2013 until a few seconds later the gong is repeated, but louder. OK, hint taken.  You both sit up. Trudie asks if that made you happy, and you have no hesitation in confirming it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we now just continue?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, my turn next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it will carry on until someone reaches the center of the board?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, guess so, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest I haven't a clue. I didn't get that far in the instructions before we started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good grief Terry!  Don't you think it might be an idea to check and see what will happen when one of us reaches the last square? I'd like to think I'll get my memory back, and hopefully my own clothes too. Do we need to get that sort of thing resolved before we get that far, or will everything revert to normal once we're done?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admit to being a bit flummoxed and recognize Trudy's rather more logical and measured attitude towards things, rather than your standard 'suck it and see' approach. OK, so looking at the board your playing pieces are indeed a fair way along the path towards to center, so guess it might be as well to see what will happen. You look around and spot the instruction leaflet, and then remember that most of it is written in Japanese, and what was in English was torn, so may not prove as helpful as you hope. You scan down the text.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach each colored square you complete an assigned tasks. Once a player has completed the required action for every color they make their way toward the central hub for the conclusion of the game, with one final action to be completed. Bugger, you realize you haven't been collecting colored wedges to verify your progress \u2013 although notice there aren't any colored wedges or anywhere to put them... OK, so how do you know when to go to the middle anyway?  Hmm, you read on, although now the text is fragmented because of the paper being torn. The player to reach the center will have a randomly selected category to complete an action for, that must involve both players. Assuming this is completed successfully the game will end and the winner will decide.... and there the text stops.  Well, that's not a lot of help. The winner will decide what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou outline your findings to Trudie, who is not entirely happy with your fairly gung-ho attitude \u2013 although you recall it wasn't actually you who started playing the game, but your dad, before you'd actually read this far through the instructions, and definitely before you realized what would happen during the game. So really it wasn't your fault... although you realize you can't tell Trudie that without having to explain everything, which realistically is something you really wouldn't want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so I guess we'd better make a note of what colors we've completed so we avoid hitting them again. Then we don't seem to have a lot of options other than continuing and trusting to luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to remember the colors each of you (well your dad and you) had landed on previously. Of course, that doesn't mean its plain sailing to only land on the remaining colors, but at least you'll know when to head for the middle square. So, you... orange, green, green,  and Trudie (or your dad) \u2013 red, yellow, blue. So, still a long way to go, but at least you know which colors you need to target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, time to move on. You pick up the dice and throw it across the board. Hmm, now you'll need to consider options, as you don't really want to repeat a category, as that won't help getting the game finished. So you look at the board and assess which way you could move.  OK, so looking at where you could move, you could go to...</span></div></div>",

The card tells you to think of a sexy outfit that would turn you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck does that mean? Presumably an outfit for Trudie to wear, as you wouldn't really get turned on by anything that you'd wear... well, perhaps aside from the strappy latex underwear, but you'd pretty much concluded that would just look stupid, so it certainly wouldn't turn anyone on, least of all you. No, it must mean something for Trudie. You try to recall what Trudy's favorite underwear is, and if she has anything that you'd call sexy. To be honest she's not really one for lace or anything fancy, but would certainly favor something hot pink or flame red.

It's Trudie who is blurred, a bit like your dad was earlier when he changed.

Her key areas are covered \u2013 although only just \u2013 and a range of straps and bands spreading out from her breasts and crotch. To complete the outfit she has matching pink sandals with straps wrapping around her legs to her mid thighs. Well, you may have considered this as being your personal secret outfit, but it doesn't half look good on Trudie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYikes!\u201d Trudie exclaims. \u201cWow, I wasn't expecting that to happen! Not sure what that card said, but I get the feeling I know what you were thinking about. Your naughty secret is out now!  Well, at least it fits me better than that shirt did, and I feel a bit more feminine.. well, actually a lot more feminine now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Trudie confirms what you'd thought \u2013 Whilst the the small pieces of material covering her nipples would be OK, the tiniest little panties she has on are so small they would definitely not have covered anything on you. You're sort of glad you never tried to follow through on that particular fantasy, as it clearly wouldn't have lived up to your hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I'd guess you somehow wished for me to be dressed like this, and the game made it happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not exactly, but, um, yes, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did you have anything specific in mind that we might do once I was in your naughtiest secret wish outfit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I...\u201d  You realize that you hadn't actually thought that one through, but had merely responded to the specific action that was stated on the game card. The fact that Trudie is now wearing that specific outfit is a fairly fortuitous outcome (and all things considered, far better than if you'd ended up wearing it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudie continues. \u201cWell, you could carry on staring at me like you are now, or you could take advantage of my absence of any significant clothing and we could have a few minutes interlude, or I guess I could throw the dice, try to land on an equivalent square, and strip you down to next to nothing \u2013 but obviously in a very tasteful way...\u201d She smiles at you with the disarming Trudy smile that melts your insides, and would easily let her persuade you to do anything...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what will it be?

So basically you've swapped outfits. Whilst it's fairly clear what's happened you reckon you'd better check... and find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did the card say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was given a choice.\u201d Trudie replies. \u201cEither swap clothes with the other player, or think of a outfit that both players would wear. I considered a few options, but either you'd end up in a bra, or I'd end up topless unless it was fairly generic, in which case it wouldn't be particularly sexy. I pondered on a baby doll for both of us for a second, but thought you may object. So in the end I though you could try the outfit you always wanted to, and I'd be, well, I'd be no worse off that I was earlier. At least these fit me a bit better than the shirt I had before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes, of course. That reminded you that Trudie technically isn't Trudie, but you dad, not that you could tell any more, and she has zero recollection of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to forget that for a minute. You really need to focus on the immediate issues and can come back to the finer detail later...  like how to get your dad back, although that would mean losing Trudie, and despite not actually being Trudy, your girlfriend, you're actually getting to like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you need to focus on what's happening, and locking your eyes onto Trudie and imagining the contours under the shirt you must admit it does fit her very well, and you can clearly make out the shape of her breasts and the firm little mounds of her nipples. Meanwhile you're in your ultimate naughty fantasy outfit, however weird that might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so now I get to stare...\u201d Trudie says, with her eyes drawn along the latex webbing down to your crotch. \u201cI think a dusty blue may suit you better, but hot pink's OK.\u201d She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I've got a handle on the game now.\u201d she continues. \u201cI think we've been hoping for the best but fearing the worst, and ultimately aiming to get to the end, but in reality the game is a form of foreplay, and we can do just about anything we want to with it. We can stop playing and have sex now, or carry on a bit more, and potentially every move will increase our endorphins until we get to a point when we won't be able to hold back at all...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you want to have some fun now, and see how it goes, or savor it a bit longer and blow our minds in a few turns? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on.\u201d you reply. \u201cYou mean basically not worrying about ticking off the colors, but just go for the category that's most, um, sexy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not necessary sexy, but anything. Interesting, inviting, kinky, sensuous, erotic... Think of a word. Basically we can try to embrace each turn and make the most of what happens. It's supposed to be a game, not an ordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you hadn't considered it like that, but trust Trudy to... ah, whoops, Trudie. So you have to admit that Trudy / Trudie always had the logic and intelligence that sometimes skipped past you, but given her thoughts on the topic it does make sense that there would be a purpose behind the game, and it is called Sexual Pursuits, so what she's says does make sense. And logically at the end of the game everything should revert to normal, which in some ways would be a shame... but you really should try to get your dad back, even though you'll loose Trudie... Mind you, the instructions suggested the 'winner' may have a choice over something, so who knows? In the back of your mind you really know you need to win... to try to get things back in at least some semblance of normality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what will you do - sex now, or later?</span></div></div>",

Your pants have disappeared and you're now wearing a short plaid skirt, but along with this a lacy white blouse with a loose tie, white knee length socks and black mary jane shoes. What the heck was Trudie thinking of? You look up to see Trudie. Her clothes have changed as well, and she's now wearing exactly the same outfit, although you're pretty certain it looks far better on her. Through the lace of her blouse you notice the shape of a white bra. Checking your own top you discover that you have one on too, in white satin.

OK, this is nowhere close to what you might have expected, even allowing for the uncertainties of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo dare I ask what the card said, and what you thought of?\u201d you ask Trudie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not this exactly. I had to think of an outfit that would suit us both. I thought of sticking with your strappy latex underwear, but reckoned you might have been a bit embarrassed wearing it. So I considered other outfits, but they can be quite gender specific, like a dress, or a suit. Beside I wanted something a bit more minimalist, so with a bit easier, um, access.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I've got that. But how did that end up as a girls school uniform?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking of an outfit being in general terms, not specifically a girl's. So I thought about a summer outfit for teenagers. I'm not sure why that turned into the school uniform, and I'd assumed you'd have the boy's equivalent, not actually an identical outfit to mine...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling your earlier encounter with Rini, some things make a little more sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so it seems to be a Japanese game. I'd imagine that would account for the Japanese style uniform, and guess this is considered their summer outfit \u2013 well for school anyway. However why the game thinks this would suit us both is another matter entirely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I don't know. I think you look quite cute in it. At least I've got you out of that tatty old shirt and pants you had on. \u201c She leans forward and gently rubs her hand up your thigh. \u201cYou're definitely a bit more accessible now.  And I feel a bit more at home in this than I did in your underwear, if you know what I mean, so all in all it's not bad at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApart from me being in a skirt...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll be surprised how accommodating a skirt can be, especially one as short as this. Besides, it isn't a permanent feature. It wouldn't take me three seconds to remove it from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell that Trudie seems ultimately intent on one thing, which realistically doesn't need any clothes, although actually seeing her dressed in the uniform with the short skirt is quite a turn on, so you're half tempted to let her stay dressed for a few minutes. You pull her close and give her a kiss, and you can feel her breasts pushing against your chest, with only a little satin and lace between them. You reach with your hands and cup one around each of Trudie's breasts, and you can clearly feel her nipples through the thin material. What was it? Oh yes, oppai... tits in Japanese. Amazing what you can learn from a Japanese sex doll... You are already well aware that your kokku is big enough to be a jiku, assuming you've got the subtleties right.. All you have to do now is persuade Trudie to let you into her, um, chitsu - although you reckon she won't need any persuasion.  As you caress her tits you feel her hands on your backside, caressing you through the satin panties, which you must admit is far more sensuous than it would have been naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take longer before your hands are inside her blouse, but caressing her tits through her satin bra whilst she does the same to your erect jiku through the satin panties seems to take everything to another level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure if we can just stop part way through the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you mean we may be in a secure temporal displacement environment generated by the technology controlling the game, and can only return to normal time / space once we've completed the specific actions to conclude the trial's session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you realize your dad has definitely picked up Trudy's intellect and scientific focus. But he's jumping way ahead of what you were thinking.  \"Um, I just reckoned it wouldn't like us stopping halfway through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. You might be right. Wonder if there's any way to break the program. This is too good an opportunity to lose.\" He then surveys his new body, and his clothes struggling to say in place. \"Guess you don't have any of Trudy's clothes here that I could put on, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What sort of relationship do you think we have? Best I could do would be some of my stuff I guess. It may at least cover you up a bit, if you're conscious of exposing yourself. Although if we're in a temporal displacement thingy like you suggested, then it's only me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough, and I imagine you've seen Trudy topless, so this can go...\" He pulls off the jacket and shirt that he had been wearing, exposing his, or technically Trudy's breasts, and leaving him in just his boxers and socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're now facing what seems to be Trudy's near naked body, but containing your dad, apparently now wanting to stay as a Trudy, or at least as a girl.

You are growing more worried by the second, and that is compounded multiple times when you recognize the shape coalescing to be that of Trudy, who pretty much pops out of thin air. She's standing, and  looks totally confused and shocked. \u201cWhat the Hell?!!!\u201d She exclaims. <br>\r\nThen she sees you and your dad. \u201cHow the Hell did I get here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not entirely sure.\u201d you answer, \u201cThere are a lot of strange things are happening right now that we can't quite explain...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy is wearing her netball kit, and you remember that she plays every Saturday in the school league. So you wonder exactly where she was until a few seconds ago, and guess that somehow she's been teleported here from there... you just hope she wasn't playing at the time. That would cause havoc if she just disappeared in the middle of the game, and particularly if she was in view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you doing? I can't see why that could cause me to physically relocate, but guess something caused it. Guess some form of physical slipstream between locations that I fell into, but an odd pairing of locations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad said he likes you better than me. That seems to have been the trigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty unlikely. Where is your dad then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're standing next to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that's not your dad... That's not.... oh, hello. Who are you?\u201d She immediately seems to blush, and her eyes lock onto your dad's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm Garry,\u201d your dad replies. \u201cWhy don't you sit down for a minute. You must be a bit in shock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waiting for the invitation, Trudy sits down immediately beside your dad, with her gaze still locked on him. \u201cSo, you must be Terry's brother or something then. I can see why he didn't tell me about you. I knew he was keeping something secret from me, I just didn't realize it would be someone as nice as you.\u201d She grabs hold of his hand and squeezes it, then snuggles herself up against him. \u201cSo what are you playing Garry, and how the heck could it have created a displacement portal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, your girlfriend has gone from total shock at her teleportation to being totally entranced by your dad in about 5 seconds flat, and now seems to be ignoring you entirely as if you didn't exist. You have a strong feeling that whatever you may do or say will not have any affect on her sudden infatuation with your dad, and could probably make the whole situation worse, so you decide to keep quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it looks like you've just lost you girlfriend to your dad \u2013 albeit the new younger version of your dad. You glance behind you, where the silicone body of Rini is still seated. Somehow you've lost Trudy and gained a sex doll. Not really a fair swap. You can only hope it doesn't get any worse than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather reluctantly you pick up the dice again. Whatever happens, you realize things will only get resolved once the game is over, so you may as well get on with it. You throw the dice, then move the game piece forwards.

You move the red playing piece along 4 spaces onto a red space. You realize you must take a card from the little dispenser. There seems to be a button on the top, which you press, and a card is ejected from a slot at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card has a red background, and in the top corner is a symbol which you assume is meaningful in Japanese, with writing in English alongside it stating the category \u2013 \u2018Sharing\u2019.

But is it somehow possible that it's the game that's responsible?  You decide to carry on, but to be very cautious about every card pulled, and to keep very alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the die again, and move your player forwards. This time you land on a blank space, and quietly sigh in relief. However, your relief is short-lived, as this merely means Adam will throw again - and you don't really want a re-run of his last turn. Adam throws again, and moves his player along the board. This time he lands on a Blue space.  You glance at the instructions, and are slightly relieved that this category is 'Nice', so fingers crossed nothing to be worried about.

I think Yin and Yang is Chinese, so I guess In and Yo must be the Japanese equivalent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what's Yin and Yang then?\" Adam asks, and you can clearly detect unease in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Yin and Yang generally represent opposites which are interconnected and interdependent. I think some some people interpret them as being complimentary, like salt and pepper, black and white, rather than, um, good and evil. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And therefore?\" Adam asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then recall something Adam mentioned. \"Did you say it's got a golden border? Oh, shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a problem because?\" Adam asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I didn't mention to you earlier. A gold bordered card represents a change that will happen, rather than an action that we've to complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. But why is that such a big deal? We haven't had a change yet in the game, have we? Surely if the game says we're to change something then we just ignore it and carry on.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no. We have had a change already, only I didn't tell you at the time. You remember when you had to imagine the other player in naughty underwear, and you finally admitted that you'd limited your final thoughts to red satin boy shorts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Why?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this game not has the ability to make us do things, possibly against our better judgment, but also to change things. I was wearing normal boxers when we started playing, but on the turn when you pictured me wearing red satin boy shorts, that's what they changed into. The game can physically change things... A gold border means a change, and whatever the game interprets In and Yo to represent, that is going to happen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm not sure what you mean. The game will create a Yin and a Yang, so two opposing things? Could be interesting to see, whatever it is.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, perhaps. But as the game's participants, whatever In and Yo are will happen to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both realize that something is happening. You can feel the strange tingling again, although it's not limited to your crotch like earlier, but you can feel it all over. Then, just as suddenly it stops, and...  </span></div></div>",

So, if your clothes are now all girl's, what else has changed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head for your bathroom, and immediately see make-up that certainly was not there before. Now you are getting worried. You (perhaps inadvertently) saved the changes that the game had made. Is there now any way to reverse those changes to get you back to yourself again, or are you now stuck as a girl until you play the game again and hopefully can undo this all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... </span></div></div>",

As far as you're concerned he's at best your co-player, and at worst your opponent, who seems to have developed a lot more interest in the game after you had your clothes reconfigured into a naughty school girl's costume, and particularly after you were subsequently turned into a girl to fit said costume!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the amount of alcohol that must by now be washing around in his bloodstream, in touching distance of a scantily dressed girl who's certain to be loosing three items of clothes in the next few minutes, and you seriously suspect the prospect of sex before the game is finished, you are considering him something of the arch enemy who needs to be kept under control.

What did that last card say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open you mouth to reply but need to take in what you are looking at first. Adam had been kneeling on the floor in just his jeans and sneakers (having taken off his shirt earlier in the game as a forfeit). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is now still in the same kneeling position, but he is looking somewhat different. His sneakers and socks have disappeared, and in their place he has leather bands around his ankles, linked by metal chains to similar leather bands around each wrist. He has a leather collar secured around his neck, with three large metal rings attached to it, with a chain from two of these to his wrist bands, and a third to a metal ring just below his chest, where further chains link from here around to his back and down to his thighs, which you realize are bare, his jeans having also vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes follow down the last chain from his chest ring, and nearly choke as you see his underwear has also vanished and this final chain is attached to a coiled metal cock cage. You cannot fail to notice a secured padlock keeping it in place. Additional chains securing the cage in place run around his buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, your thoughts of keeping Adam under control have been interpreted by the game like this. Not quite what you would have thought of, although possibly this could do the job. You're aware of something touching your neck. You put your hand up, and find a slim chain around your neck, holding a key. It takes only a micro-second to realize what the key is for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's odd, but from your earlier quite negative thoughts about Adam and his potential motives since you were turned into a girl, now seeing him naked, bound and restrained, and knowing you have the key, you're weirdly feeling a bit aroused. You can feel your nipples pushing against the material of the halter top as they harden up, and they seem to be tingling, and you have a similar feeling down below - where your manhood used to reside, somewhere in your now lady bits.  Maybe its not all as bad as you'd thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind returns to Adam's question. Do you tell him the truth? That you wanted to restrain him as you thought he may get carried away as you loose your clothes thanks to his clothes spell bonus? Do you tell him you wanted him to be in bondage chains?  Do you blame it on the game (which after all is probably closer to the truth anyway)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asked to think of a present for you - but this wasn't what I had in mind.\" you say. \"I'm afraid the game has misinterpreted it completely differently. Actually now that you've taken in everything you're finding it quite fun. Adam does look quite appealing like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll just have to accept it for now,\" you continue, as you look at the secured cock cage. \"May keep your mind focused, anyway.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. D'you know anything about these things?  It's gonna stop me getting it up at all, so it could get  uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the the cage is bent downwards, and whilst there's a bit of room for expansion, you'd agree that any semblance of arousal could probably be painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou subconsciously choose that moment to stretch. You reach up with your arms over your head, which forces your chest outwards, and therefore pushing your breasts further out in front of Adam, who cannot fails to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" he says, clutching unsuccessfully at his penis which does the inevitable in the circumstances. \"Cut that out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, perhaps this could be fun after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm sorry.\" you say, demurely. \"Your turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam reaches forward with one hand, which means the other is close behind due to the short length of chain between the two.  He throws the dice, and moves his placing piece forwards, landing on a green square. He reaches across to take the card. It says...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another forfeit. I'm to have another drink - of your choosing. At least I don't have to down this in one.\" He looks at you expectantly. \"Could we miss out the extra vodka this time please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, last time you had a similar situation you'd thought of adding extra vodka to Adam's drink which probably tripled the alcohol content. For some reason a double rum and coke came into your mind, and almost instantly a glass appears in front of Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks it up and sips it. \"Decent choice at least. OK, your go now Terry.\" He looks at you. \"Sorry, it doesn't seem right referring to you as Terry. After all you're a girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not permanently.\" you respond. At least you sincerely hope not! \"I was Terry before and I'll be Terry afterwards.\" you say, realizing that you too don't really feel comfortable in your current situation using your proper name. If you end up making out with Adam, as seems to most probable outcome, you'd perhaps like to think of it as being someone else, or you in someone else's body, so perhaps you could use a different name temporarily, just whilst you're a girl.  \"Suppose you could call me Terri - like the female version?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's the same thing really - the spelling might be different but that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. You'd come to the same conclusion...  \"OK then, how about... um.. \" You glance around the room for inspiration.  You eye catches on some CDs in the rack... Judie Tzuke, Cher, Rihanna, Natalie Imbruglia. That'll do. \"Call me Natalie.\"  Actually you feel that sounds about right. You'd always liked that name, so now you can actually use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then... Natalie... it's your go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reach for the dice and suddenly realize that because Adam has not fulfilled the requirement of his turn, his previous bonus (you loosing an item of your clothing for his next three turns) was not being activated. Phew. One down, three to go. You pick and and throw the dice, and move your playing piece forwards. It lands on ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You've got to be kidding!\" you reply, your voice actually reaching an octave higher than you have for years, and sounding very girlish. He turns the card around so that you can see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then... <i>Natalie</i>... I think it may be payback time for you putting me in this.\" He indicates the bondage chains and cock cage. You consider very rapidly if now would be a good time to use your gender swap card, but you decide not. Things could get a lot worse, and you may regret using it too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" you reply, \"guess that's fair.\" You hold your hand up as instructed and wait to see what Adam will do. You are still wearing the 'naughty schoolgirl' costume that Adam dreamt up earlier, and despite his later clothes spell - where you will loose an item of clothing each time Adam successfully completes his actions on each turn, you're still wearing everything - including the bra and cropped top, so you're not sure how Adam is supposed to suck your nipples - perhaps through the clothing, or by removing them? (Assuming that is allowed by the game).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approaches you with a serious glint in his eye, and you can see him trying to work out the same thing. In the end he decides to throw caution to the wind, and hooks his fingers under the top and bra and lifts them upwards, revealing a pair of size C breasts and the waiting nipples. You have a feeling he may have done that before to a previous female acquaintance...  You glance down, but the clothing is now gathered up over the top of your breasts blocking your view, which you do feel is a bit unfair. After all, they're your breasts, but Adam is seeing them before you!   He leans forward and starts to suck one of your nipples, and then has to lick his lips before trying again. It's a bit of a ticklish feeling at first, and you wonder what the big deal is. However, after a few seconds sucking with moist lips, and you're sure the occasional lick,  the ticklishness is replaced by another altogether stronger and more intense feeling, and you quickly cotton on to what the deal is after all. Adam continues for about two minutes, and then stops, clearly in some form of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" he says. \"That's not fair at all. How am I supposed to do this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you're not the only one getting a buzz out of the nipple sucking, but Adam's cock cage is now doing it's job and preventing him from getting too excited - be it in quite a painful way. You remember that you do have the solution to this problem - the key hanging around your neck - and are dearly tempted to unlock him so that he can continue sucking, but you reckon the moment has probably passed.... and unlocking him might lead to other problems later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, guess I'm done with that now.\" Adam says. \"I daren't do it any more. Hope it was 'nice' for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes\" you reply, \"It was, thank you.\"  The trouble is you mean it, it was really quite nice. You pull your bra and cropped top back down again, covering your breasts.  You reach for the dice to throw for your next turn, and the instant you touch the dice your cropped top seems to fade out of existence, leaving you now wearing only the bra above your waist. \"What the...!\" you start, and then remember the clothes spell. As Adam has completed his action, you loose one item of your clothes.  Oh well, nothing you can do about that, but you also remember you have a couple of tricks up your sleeve, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to the next throw, which moves your playing piece forwards, landing on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

What sexual fantasies?  Surely any fantasy you've had had has been with you as a boy, so may be this could be way of swapping back.  Mind you, knowing this game it could pick up one of your fantasies but put you into the female role. Oh not so good!  You also recall you've had the occasional fantasy where you haven't been a boy. There was one video you saw with two girls in micro skirts and bobby socks and not much more making out, and you'd fantasised a bit about that one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could one of your fantasies actually happen?  What if your fantasy was on the moon or something? No, perhaps that's a silly question - it seems that pretty much anything could happen in this game, so you'd better be careful - again.

You tell Adam, \"I'm not going to get a forfeit. You can help me or not, but I'm getting you naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam doesn't help you but he doesn't fight you either. He stands there stoically. You cut his pants and boxers off. You start to cut his socks off but he decides to kick his shoes off himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's naked, he covers himself and turns around facing you to sit down. \"Let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game appears to be satisfied, so you roll the dice. You land on a green square (naughty). \"AAAAaaaaagh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the card, \"Your partner's body turns you on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Adam. Somehow he looks hot with his sculptured, chiseled features, his soulful brown eyes, his sturdy legs. You shut your eyes but it's too late. Your cock has tented your very tight compression shorts which reveal every detail of its shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam says, \"I hope we get more liquor soon.\"</span></div></div>",

For some reason you couldn't really care what she does to your hair - even if she dyed it red white and blue. You are just content with the feeling of her hands playing with you hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes she stops and steps back. <br>\r\n\"OK, that's you done.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, so your turn now.\" you reply. For some reason you trust Janie to have done what was required, and have no specific desire to see the results. So you swap places, so that Janie is now seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her blond hair cascading over her shoulders, and look at the tools available to you. Without giving it any thought you select a short grade comb for the clippers, and start attacking Janie's hair. With each sweep up and over her head, much of the length of her hair drops to the floor. Your then trim around her ears, and giver her a round neck line - your general preference when you have a short cut. You make sure everything is even and tidy, and tell her she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanie stands, looks at the clippings of her hair on the floor without remark, and brushes a few remaining strands from her shoulders. \"OK, you were right - that was all a bit silly and pointless.  Shall we carry on with the next roll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see no reason why not, and are quite oblivious to the fact that you have decimated Jamie's hair - and she also seems totally unaware. As you move back towards the board you notice your reflection in a mirror, and hardly give it a second glance. Whilst you had cut Janie's hair short and into a boy's style, she has treated yours as if a girl's. It's now longer (with extensions), with curls and more body than you've ever had before, color highlights, and a pink flower clip in it. The fact that it would be suitable for a girl, and definitely not a boy does not even occur to you. You merely see it as being a tidy cut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you both sit down by the board, both sporting haircuts suitable for the other's gender, but neither noticing anything untoward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the die and throw it across the board.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, that's an odd one. Whilst Janie was happy and quick enough to swap her shirt with you, this may be going a little too far, as this would involve her - well both of you - undressing completely, and then getting redressed in each others underwear. Actually you reckon this doesn't make any sense. You had assumed the game was designed to give opportunities for, well, like sexy games - but this, to your mind, doesn't really fit... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the card say this time?\" Janie asks.\"hope it's a bit more exciting than the last task...\"<br>\r\n\"It says we're to sw...\" you start to reply, but stop as you feel a weird sensation over your body.<br>\r\n\"What the...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a microsecond you're wearing Janie's bra and panties, and she's in your boxers - and nothing else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell!\" Janie exclaims, and realizing that she's now topless puts her hands over her breasts. \"What did you just do - and how?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I just starting reading the card. The rest wasn't me. I'd say it must be the same ghost or oompa loompa again, but this is all getting a bit freaky.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, so what did the card say - you never finished.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. It said that we're to swap underwear. Somehow it's done it for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Janie wearing just your boxers, and then down at yourself in her sports bra and panties. You're slightly relieved that she had been wearing briefs rather than a thong, although even these are on the snugger side on you.    <br>\r\n\"I guess the game reckons we're supposed to find this a bit of a turn on or something.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Janie replies, \"you do look kinda cute with your long hair and wearing my undies.\"<br>\r\n\"What long hair?\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Well the extensions I put in, and... oh crap. Why did I do that? Didn't you realize what I was doing? !  I don't even know how to put extensions in! How the Hell did I manage to do that?\" OMG - I even styled it like a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then instantly have the equivalent recollection and recognition about what you'd done to Janie's hair. <br>\r\n\"Oh my God. I'm sorry Janie!\"  Instantly Janie reaches to her head and runs her finger through the half inch long soft spikes over her scalp, and then hurries to the mirror to have a look. It's odd, but as Janie has always been something of a tomboy, seeing her with short boy's haircut and wearing boxers isn't quite as strange to you as it could be. She's quite slim, and what are best described as petite hips, so with her short haircut could almost pass for a boy - well, when looking at her from the back. Perhaps you wouldn't describe her as cute 'dressed' as a boy, but to be honest, yes, a bit of a turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't freak out as much as you thought she might, and soon composes herself. \"So, it's not oompa loompas then - it's this game. It seems to have some weird power to make us do things without realizing it. So, I'd guess that we wouldn't be given an option to swap undies back again... Hey, and where have out clothes gone anyway?\" You both look around, but can't seen them anywhere. <br>\r\n\"Look, you can grab one of my shirts from the closet if you want.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Nah, s'ok.\" Janie replies. \"If this game can do that, I'd guess you'll be seeing these soon anyway.\" and she lowers her hands to her sides, revealing her bare breasts. <br>\r\n\"Um, yes, I guess.\" you reply, having difficulty tearing your eyes away from them. Whilst she isn't the most buxom of girls by any means, breasts are breasts, and you're not complaining at the view.  <br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Janie interrupts your staring.<br>\r\n\"Baby oil...\" you mumble quietly to yourself..<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, guess we role the dice again, and see what's next for us... Um, your turn, I think. \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanie picks up and rolls the die, which lands on...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She reads the text - 'Do something naughty to the other player'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to think what she could possibly do to you that would be considered naughty. Does that mean something like oral sex, or what? Surely that would be do something naughty <i>with</i> the other player? She casts her mind back to when she was young, when naughty would have meant doing something bad - although now it seems to mean no end of things - although she realizes it mostly seems to refer to girls - either flirting and teasing suggestively, or dressing in clothes a bit too risqu\u00e9 or revealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then realizes that with you already dressed in her bra and panties perhaps she could do something that would be considered naughty by this 'dirty girl' type of definition. However a boy wearing a bra and panties is realistically verging on amusing rather than titillating or teasing - even if they were somewhat sexier than her sports bra and 'proper' panties. So what could she actually do? She looks at you. She rules out anything with your clothes. She reckons the only way of making you look more titillating would be if you actually had boobs to fill out a bra, but clearly she couldn't magic those out of thin air. So, what else? She reckons it could be fun (and potentially naughty) making you look even more like a girl than you already are (the extensions in your hair and wearing her underwear). Besides, that would be perfect retaliation for the short haircut you've given her. She briefly tried to imagine you as a girl, which isn't too difficult, but not as a particularly flirty or seductive one. So she tries to imagine you with pierced ears and earrings, or even body piercings. No, equally impractical. Instead she starts thinking of things she could physically do to you, but she's struggling to decide what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna tell me what the card says?\" you ask, after what you consider a reasonable time for her to read and absorb the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. It says I've got to do something naughty to you, but I can't figure out what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind immediately jumps to the conclusion that it's Janie who's got to do something naughty, and you start imagining the sexy or kinky things Janie could do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the game has deduced enough from Janie's surmising to complete the move, and you become aware of another strange feeling... </span></div></div>",

You look down towards Janie's white sports bra that had been strapped to your chest to discover two things. Firstly it's no longer either white or a sports bra, but is now a black wet-look vinyl lace up bra, and also you appear to have breasts, growing larger as you watch filling out the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you exclaim. \"What the Hell is happening?!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh grief!\" Janie replies. \"I don't know. Well beyond the obvious anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"I've got tits!\" They have now stopped growing and have settled at around a C cup size. \"How? It can only be the game somehow doing it. Um, what was the naughty thing you were going to do, 'cos this certainly wasn't what I was expecting!\"<br>\r\n\"I hadn't actually decided.\" Janie says. \"I was still trying to work out what naughty really meant. Guess the game somehow decided what actually constituted naughty - and I suppose this is pretty much fulfilling that. Giving you tits to fill out your is definitely pretty naughty!\"<br>\r\n\"Great! Not only an I wearing a bra, but now I've got boobs as well - and presumably your choice of a sexy bra?\"<br>\r\n\"Not actually my choice - and its not only your bra.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\nJanie points towards your crotch where your panties have also transformed into a matching black vinyl lace up thong, which is fortunately large enough at the front to cover everything - although the loose knot in the lace is obviously straining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what has happened to your top half you hadn't even noticed anything changing lower down. For a split second you fear the worst, that you may have lost your manhood, but the pressure inside the thong is enough to reassure you that the boner that you have been developing over the past few minutes is still well and truly there.<br>\r\n\"OK, so I'm a boy with tits in sexy underwear. Jeepers.\" You decide to have a look at yourself in the mirror, and are quite taken aback by what you see. Your hair is now well past your shoulders (thanks to the extensions), with curls and highlights, and you're now sporting genuine tits in what you must admit is quite a sexy bra. \"Crap. What's this game trying to do. Thought the idea was to provide a bit of a sexual thrill, not make me look like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Janie says as she steps up behind you, \"Now that we're getting to see what this game is capable of, I think we've just got to accept it all as a bit of fun. To be honest, the bra does look far better on you than it did before - and you do look quite sexy. You've got to admit you're quite turned on now, so maybe all is not yet lost!\"<br>\r\n Clearly she's also noticed the bulge in your panties, or rather, your thong. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, may be, so long as it doesn't go any further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so it's your turn to roll the dice Terry.\" Janie remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, OK.\" You return to the board and pick up the die, and roll it again. It lands on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, yes.\" You realize that after the earlier rounds things have got a bit muddled up. You'd decimated Janie hair to half an inch from her scalp, and similarly she'd added extensions to your hair. You'd then swapped underwear, and you now have a larger bust than Janie. \"Yes, but it's really patently obvious what our genders are, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily, at least not externally. I'm slim, have virtually no hips, and now have a crew cut.  And I'm wearing your boxers. You've got bigger tits than me, hair that many girls would die for, and you're wearing a sexy bra and lace up thong.  You've got to admit that it could be tricky for someone to tell who's who - at first glance anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, in that case I'm taking no chances. You reach down to the thong with the intention of undoing the tie, and letting your manhood out, and thus proving to anyone who might be watching (of which of course there isn't anyone) that you are definitely male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull on the loose end of the lace....<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

However, her breasts have also disappeared, leaving her with what you'd describe merely as a boy's chest. \"Oh no, that's...\" you stop. You realize that it isn't impossible as clearly it has just happened. \"OK, so exactly what has happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanie replies, managing to keep herself relatively calm. \"Well, the game has taken the potentially uncertainly that we'd noticed ourselves, and followed it through to the ultimate, but obviously wrong conclusion. You looked like a girl, so it's made you into one. I looked more like a boy, so I now am one.\" You cannot help noticing that her voice is sounding a little deeper, and somehow less girl-like. Janie continues.  \"I know I used to be a bit of a tomboy, but didn't think I'd end up turning into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, OK. I didn't realise I looked quite so girlie - well aside from the breasts. Oh, and the hair extensions.  And the clothes...

Clit would be OK, or vagina. Are you a girl all the way through? Well, it's probably difficult to be sure without an internal examination, but your voice has gone up in pitch <i>(which you hadn't noticed)</i>, and mine's feeling a bit funny <i>(which you had noticed)</i>. Also I'm having trouble concentrating when I look at your breasts, so to be honest, yes, I think we've fully switched genders, not just had a few external changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, balls!

I'm game if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, right.\" you reply, a little taken aback by how quickly Janie stepped up for the activity. You stand facing her. \"Who starts the timer?\" you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think before I start it may be helpful if you take off your bra,\" Janie says. Whilst it may well be nice and sexy, it won't look so good smothered in oil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" you respond, not really taking in the fact that you are now the female in the relationship. You look down at the bra in a slightly confused state, and which point Janie reaches between your breasts, pulls at the lace tie in the center, and the bra falls open. With that Janie squirts baby oil straight from the bottle onto you breasts and starts caressing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, this is a new experience for me as well as you,\" she says. For the first few seconds you're unsure about it, as the sensation is quite new to you. Then Janie's fingers find your nipples and you suddenly find the experience very pleasurable indeed, and you realize the difference between being turned on as a boy and a girl. As Janie continues to caress your breasts your hands seem to develop a mind of their own and reach out to Janie's boxer shorts, wrapping around her butt. Your fingers delve into the back of her boxers, reaching down until you're clutching her buttocks, and pulling her closer to you, at which point you can clearly feel her erection pressing hard against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminds you that perhaps you need to revise your perceptions, as Janie is now most definitely a boy, and you are the girl, so you really shouldn't be referring to her as, well, her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Janie continues caressing your oiled breasts and tweaking your erect nipples giving you little erotic electric shudders throughout your body and somehow forcing you to clutch her, um his, buttocks even tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize you're making this a lot more difficult?\" Janie says. \"The tighter you pull me towards you, the less room I have to  fondle you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you respond, \"you can't expect me just to stand there and do nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're supposed to do nothing. I think you're supposed to stand there and enjoy it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a challenge, but I'm doing my best...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you hear a subtle chime, which you assume is the 2 minute timer. Janie stops caressing you, and you release you grip on her / his butt. You look down to see your oiled breasts and erect nipples, still a weird concept for you, and realize that despite Janie's best endeavors quite a lot of the baby oil has dribbled down further, so you tummy is also well covered, and your little black vinyl thong is also damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's next then?\" Janie asks. \"Your turn I reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis breaks your focus on reviewing the state of your body, and brings you back to the game.  \"Ah, yes, guess so.\" Somehow you can only see this going one way at the moment, and whilst you had for a long time fantasized over sex with Janie, she was always just your best friend and not really anything more, and of course she was a girl then... Somehow the concept of sex with her as a boy and you a girl had not even entered your wildest imaginings. Oh crap. A horrible thought occurs to you. Surely as a girl (as you now are) you're a virgin, so if this does follow through as you suspect, then Janie could be the boy to break your hymen, and that's supposed to hurt, isn't it?  And then... if you're now a girl, as in <i>really</i> a girl, presumably you could get pregnant? Oh crap again. Janie notices your delay reaching for the die, and asks if you're OK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just hadn't thought of this from a girl's perspective before. Just getting my head around it, I suppose.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, you can't really stop the game now - you'll have to hope that when the game is finished you'll both return to your former selves. It could certainly be a bit awkward facing your parents - or anyone else - as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the die and give it a toss onto the board. You move your playing piece forward, and this time you land on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mom is wearing a lime green dress shaped as three leaves, one cover each of her breasts, and the other reaching down to cover her groin, but leaving her thighs totally uncovered. This is attached to the back, shaped as one large leaf pointing down with what looks like leather cord threaded between the fron and back halves. Attached to the back of the costumn is what seems to be a pair of large wings. You are quite aghast to see quite so much of your mom, but relieved that she has a slim figure and actually looks weirdly good. She is holding what you can only describe as a fairy wand in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume this is the game's version of Tinkerbell, which seems to be taking the standard version as a basis, and then sexifying everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little sister - well she's 13 so not really that little anymore - is wearing what seems to be a pale blue bikini top, and harem pants covering her legs. This is in a matching blue and is made of a soft almost transparent material, revealing her slender legs beneath. Her hair is pulled back and tied into a ponytail. she has a headband with a single large sapphire in the center. She has a golden sheen all over her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's Jenny, your girlfriend. Jenny has dark hair naturally but it now seems to be jet black.

It has little puff shoulders attached to a red and black striped bodice, pulling tight and low on her breasts, with a light grey skirt barely covering her panties underneath. Under this she has matching grey self supporting stockings, and black heels. She has a red bow in her hair. For some inexplicable reason she is holding a bright red apple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, well you seem to have your family now dressed as rather raunchy versions of Tinkerbell, Princess Jasmine, and Snow White.

Your hand is outstretched to grab it, as it disappears. An unprincess-like snarl on your face. You doubt, meeting either the guards or the magic will kill you outright. But, it was frustratingly silent on the consequences of running into either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShielding your eyes from the Sun, you scan the palace skyline. There's a green glow around the top of one of the towers. It pulses slowly, until you get your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tension hangs in the air, an electric crackling catches your attention. Across the garden from you, a ball of green and blue livid magic, shimmering between, flames, and ball lightning is heading in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you head off in the opposite direction. The choice already made, you head inside. You start by running, but in only a few paces, you change to a steadier, smoother pace. Your jarring run, threatening to make the girls jump from the constraint of the halter top. Thankfully, you can move very quietly with your slippered feet making virtually no noise on the marble floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in your haste, you almost walk into one of the guards. Instead, you duck behind one of the pillars, until he passes. Listening intently, you can no longer hear the ball of wild magic. You plan out your route to reach the tower.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, it's not as if you can really take it back and demand a refund, so you take the lid off to see what's inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a playing board, with four playing pieces (cardboard cut outs of princesses on molded plastic bases), a cardboard castle to erect at one end of the board, and a chunky plastic magic wand. Well, to be honest it looks like the real thing, so assuming the wand works to tell you your moves, then it may be OK to play with your little sister (or just to give it to her to play with her little friends). You decide to check the battery, as doubtless it will have been removed or drained, but find that there's no obvious battery compartment. Instead you press the button on the side of the wand, and the head of the wand glows, at least signifying that there is charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so you could play the game on your own (are you really that desperate?), try to find someone to play with, or just abandon the game completely and let your sister have it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trudy is 10 years old and generally a bundle of mischief, and frequently annoys the hell out of you.  'Hiya sis!' she says as she scans around looking for anything new or interesting that she can beg, steel or borrow,  frequently for you never to see again. 'Oooh, what you got there then? You're not playing a game on your own are you?' That's not much fun. I'll let you play it with me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, well, I wasn't really going to do much with it. I hadn't realized what it was when I got it. So I thought it may be a bit more appropriate for you to play with some of your friends anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? Disney's Princesses? Come off it Katy. I'm 10. Last time I played that I was around 6!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I know. Bit of a bummer really.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never mind. We can give it a go anyway. I know mom's banned you from just about everything else, so if you don't mind lowering your expectations a bit it may be a laugh.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, perhaps she's right. If you don't play the game, then you'll have nothing else to do (apart from possibly your household chores or homework, but they don't really count as priority activities for a weekend), so you semi-reluctantly agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens first?\" you ask her, as Trudy clearly has a better idea about it than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy. You pick one of the princesses as your playing piece, and then the younger player starts by waving the wand. I think I'll be Sleeping Beauty.\" She picks up one of the cardboard figures and looks a little more closely at it. \"Oh, apparently <u>not</u> Sleeping Beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what do you mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the picture's definitely wrong - Sleeping Beauty never wore a mini skirt and thigh length boots, and besides it has a name at the bottom -  Bouncing Beauties.  I think she's a bit top heavy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a closer look, and indeed this is not the Sleeping Beauty you remember, but a somewhat raunchier version!

Hmm, interesting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your Twinky Belle playing character next to Trudy's Bouncing Beauties at the end of the board closest to you ' at the gateway into the castle grounds as depicted on the board. Trudy picks up the wand and waves it in the air to start the game, expecting the first (potentially randomly generated) instruction to be announced from the little speaker on the wand's shaft. The top of the wand starts glowing again, but this time it also seems to be emitting sparks into the air. Suddenly Trudy yelps 'Ow! That's hot!' and lets go of the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of falling to the floor the wand seems to hover in the air, still emitting multi-colored sparks. You're not sure whether to be worried or impressed. Then you hear a voice.

Your little white socks then start extending up your legs, and within a few seconds start turning color too, but also seem to fragment as they reach further up your legs. You realize that they're turning into matching fishnets, and as they reach your thighs they form into garter buckles, which then reach on under the bottom of your new little skirt, no doubt connecting to a garter belt that you didn't have before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that whilst watching what was happening to your bottom half, you had failed to notice that your tee had virtually disappeared entirely, now being a sheer mesh, almost transparent but for the lime green hue, bunched on each of your upper arms, and barely reaching under your breasts, leaving your tummy uncovered down to the top of your micro skirt. Your bra is now a metallic green micro bra with transparent straps, with enough shiny material to cover your nipples but not much more, all clearly visible through the mesh top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlimey.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Brian.  You are a 14-year-old boy who has recently been forbidden from any sort of screen time by your mother after she caught you pulling yet another all nighter skyping with your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this blows,\" you mutter to yourself, unconciously pushing some of your brown hair out of your eyes.  Now you had to find something to preoccupy yourself for the day.  \"God, what is there to do in this stupid house,\" you brood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, you could look downstairs for some old board games or something that the previous owners left.\"  You turned to see your mom standing with a full laundry basket balanced on her, admittedly, generous hips in your doorway.  \"I just do not want to see your face glued to another screen today, mister.  Maybe you could even clean the area up down there.  God knows it could use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom was right, the basement was a mess.  You'd been living in your house for years, but no one had ever really tried to go through the piles of dusty boxes down there.   In fact, it was one of the chores you still hadn't done that had pushed your mom to enact the screen ban for the week in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom turns to go sort the laundry in her room, you sigh and decide to take her advice.  After heading down the first flight of stairs, you fumble for the switch in the darkness at the top of the basement steps.  With a *click*, the suprisingly large basement suddenly glows under the pale light of a string of incandescent bulbs.  Each piece of junk scattered across the floor and shelves casts a shadow creating a rather ominous atmosphere.  Being careful not to the trip on the rickety bottom step, you begin to walk towards the back where the pile of old boxes left by the previous owner is located.  As you force your way past the junk, avoiding snagging your t-shirt on old furniture pieces and coathangers, it becomes more and more apparent how long it's been since someone has been back here.  The cobwebs and layers of dust are abundant and thick when you reach the yellowed cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, you begin to scan the labels on the various boxes written in a spidery hand.  Towards the top of the pile, you spot your prize.  <i>Games</i>.  Tentatively placing your sneaker on a box labeled <i>Books</i>, you probe its strength and use it to boost yourself up to reach the game one.  Securing your game box prize, you are surprised by its weight and quickly place it down on the concrete floor of the basement.  Opening its folds, you peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box is certainly full of board games, and something about the prospect of playing a really old game actually is starting to sound rather exciting.  You eagerly pull out a few games so that you can better see what you're dealing with.  Curiosity leads to confusion when you realize you don't recognize a single one.  Tearing through the box, you realize that there are no Monopolies, Snakes n Ladders, or even an Othello in this box.  Not even a Parcheesi.  Instead, you find there are five games you've never heard of before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first box is rectangular with cartoonish drawings of buff surfer dudes and buxom, bikini-clad ladies.  The title is splayed across the front in big, red letters:  BEACH BOD - Compete with members for their best traits come swimsuit season!  Winner takes all!  You can't really make out how to play the game.  The gyst you get from looking at the back of the box is that players take turns going around the board with a chance to draw a wacky random trait card or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting that one aside, you pick up the next box.  This one is much smaller.  The blocky lettering spelling its title reads, TRUTH OR DARE... OR CHANGE.  The box promises an ironic punishment for liars and take-backers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third box was large and pink and looked like one of those romantic couple-y games, which you sorta ignored in favor of looking at the one below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis box was more what you would expect from a spooky basement.  The title, written in red gossamer handwriting, was OUIJA - See things from the other side!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the Ouija boardgame to the side, you look at the final box.  This one was too old and faded to really make out what it's contents were.  As you try to make heads or tails of what its contents might be, you suddenly feel a strange tickling sensation on your right hand.  Nonchalantly glancing down, you see what can only be described as the largest spider you have ever seen in your life, slowly walking toward your forearm.  Freaking out and swinging your hand frantically, you desperately stand-up, grabbing one of the games as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging through the old junk twice as fast as it took you to get through it before, you sprinted up the basement stairs with your selection clutched closely to your chest.  You flick the lights off, and slam the door shut behind you, eliciting a brief scolding from your mom from upstairs.  Gaining your breath back, you calm down enough to look down at which game you brought with you.  Which one did you select?</span></div></div>",

Instinctively you reach for your pocket, but then remember that your mom has confiscated your phone, and instead, the sound is coming from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian, dear!\" your mom calls down, \"It's David!  You can talk to him briefly, but I want the phone back as soon as you're done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\"  You sprint up the stairs and grab the smartphone from your mother's manicured fingers.  \"Hey, Dave.  How you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, could be better,\" comes the sound from your friend on the phone, \"I know this is kinda presumptuous, but I was really hoping I could chill at your place today?  My sister has her friends over, and they're driving me insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, man.  But...\" you sneak a quick glance at your mother who is waiting, arms crossed, at the top of the stairs for you to finish, \"I don't think we'll be able to do any videogames or anything like that.  Mom's rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'alright, dude,\" David says, \"I'm game for whatever.  Just gotta get out of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sweet.  See you soon, Dave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, see you in five, Bri Guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, there is a knock on your door.  Springing up, you open the door to your gangly friend smiling goofily at you.  For everything he lacked in width, your friend more than made up for in height.  At age 14, he was already 6 feet tall, more than a little higher than your 5'6\" stature.  As he steps into the entryway, David embraces you in a contricting hug.  Being a beanpole, Dave's hugs were more of a nusance than anything else, and you retaliate with a hug that makes his back pop.  Those basketball muscles were coming in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you been bud?\"  Dave grins.  Dave's half-smile along with his piercing blue eyes were always enough to drive the girls in your grade wild, but he was always way too insecure to realize.  Something was off about his charm though today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty well.  You got a haircut,\"  you say, pointing at Dave's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" he responds, running his hand through his dirty-blonde, now buzz-cutted hair, \"My mom said it was getting too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I feel you,\" you respond, briefly flicking a bit of your dark brown hair out of your equally brown eyes, \"Anyways, did you have anything you wanted to do today?  I found something that might interest you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't have anything in mind.  Whatcha got?\"  Dave responds, following you into the livingroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already taken the game out of its box while waiting for David to arrive, and the game board sat on the glass coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what kind of game is that?\"  Dave says with a hint of awe in his voice, \"It looks vintage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.  You arrived right when I was about to read the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Beach Bod', huh?  Sounds interesting.  Alright, read the rules aloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the top of the box which contains 6 game pieces, a card dispenser, and a 6-sided die.  Below the pieces which you scoop to the side, is a small rulebook.  You clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Beach Bod!  The game that giveth, and the game that taketh away!  Do you have what it takes to get your ideal beach bod?\"  You pause, and make eye contact with David quizzically before continuing.  \"The goal of the game is simple!  Take turns rolling the die to move.  First person to reach the end wins!  The winner may choose to either keep their traits at the expense of everyone else, or may choose to give up their traits to the other players!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause again.  \"The fuck does it mean by trait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, man,\" David responds, \"Keep reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou oblige and look back at the rules.  \"The board consists of several different colored spaces you can land on.  Each space has a different effect!\"  You and Dave turn to look at the board, which looks remarkably like the CandyLand board but set on a beach background.  You turn back to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">RED</span> spaces - You must choose another player to trade a trait with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">ORANGE</span> spaces - Choose another player; gain a copy of one of their traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">YELLOW</span> spaces - Choose another player; they will gain a copy of one of your traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">GREEN</span> spaces - Increase the size of one of your traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">BLUE</span> spaces - Decrease the size of one of your traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">PURPLE</span> spaces - Changes one of your traits at random<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">PINK</span> spaces - Balances out your traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">BROWN</span> spaces - Chaos space (You and David note that there are only four of these spaces)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHITE spaces - Free space; nothing changes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not sure I understand what a trait is in reference to this game,\" David says slowly, \"Is it like a roleplay thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure,\" you respond, \"But I don't think we have to worry because it says the traits that change will come from the card dispenser.\"  You say this and tap the machine next to you.  It's oddly advanced looking to belong to this game now that you look at it.  It has what looks like an LED display on top and is painted a sleek red everywhere else.  Honestly, it looks like a prop from Star Trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..kaaaay,\" David says, still confused, \"Well regardless, I'm game if you're game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely game, but there's one problem,\" you say, \"The game says we need between 3 and 6 players; we're a player short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave opens his mouth, a solution to your problem presents itself.  The kitchen door opens, and in comes...</span></div></div>",

Oh, and call me Elizabeth.\"  She winks and turns away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom sashays back into the kitchen while David stares, mouth nearly agape.  You've known for a while your friend has a bit of a crush on your mom, and honestly, you could understand it. Your mom had had your older sister when she was really young, and had you a few years after.  As such, she was a bit younger than the other moms, and even with that in mind, looked damn good for 42.  Not to mention how flirty she'd become since she'd divorced your dad a few years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nudge David out of his drooling, and he looks sheepishly at you.  You start to say something to tease him when your mother opens the door again with the plate of crackers.  This time, you can't help but stare either.  Your mother wasn't the tallest person in the world, only standing at 5'10\", but with the 4-inch heels she always wore, she always gave a bit of an intense aura.  Not to mention how she dressed.  Elizabeth Roberts looked good, and she knew it.  Her large, DD-cup breasts, today smooshed into a low-cut button-up, were framed by a mane of dark-red, almost black curls.  Age hadn't been completely forgiving, and Elizabeth had gained some odd pounds here and there, but she carried it well.  Most of the weight had gone to her stomach and hips, not to mention her large, heart-shaped ass, but they worked to her benefit to give her an amazing hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the food, boys,\" she says, in a rather husky alto, \"What game are you two playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid interrupts before you can speak.  \"It's a new one that Brian found.  You should join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom flashes a smile.  \"That sounds lovely, but I'm not sure if I have time for a full game.  I'll play a few rounds with you two, but then I'll have to get back to preparing dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are kind of annoyed at your friend for involving your mother, but you do need three players, and you suppose your mother is a better alternative to your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, mom, we all need to place a piece onto the start of the gameboard.\"  The pieces are rather non-descript; just small blocks of colored wood.  You choose the red one, David chooses the blue one, and your mother chooses the yellow one.  \"Okay,\" you say, \"Who should roll first?\"</span></div></div>",

As you hand the dice over to your friend, he starts to stare at you intently.  \"You feeling alright, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" you reply, \"Why do you-\"  You're cut off by a sudden rushing feeling that spreads from your head down to your feet.  A tingling begins down on the soles of your feet.  It feels like your feet are swelling, growing outward and lengthening.  \"Ow, fuck!\" you accidentally swear, briefly looking guiltily at your mother as you do so.  Oddly, she doesn't seem to hear you; instead, she is looking with a mixture of horror and awe at your feet.  Following her gaze, you realize what caused you the burst of pain.  Somehow, your feet have outgrown your shoes.  The seams have burst, and your enlarged feet have burst through the soles, giving you ridiculous looking anklets made out of the remainder of the tops of your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you, Dave, and your mother continue to stare, you're again aware of the tingling feeling spreading up your legs.  As it climbs, the three of you are acutely aware of your legs lengthening, gaining muscle, and copious amounts of dark leg hair springing up like sped up timelapse of grass growing you saw in class that one time.  The tingle continues climbing your body, making you larger, stronger, and with a generous sprinkling of body hair across your now 18-year-old body.  Unlike your shoes, your other clothes fare a bit better.  Your t-shirt now stretches across your chest and abs so tightly that you look like an underwear model, but it holds.  Your pants, which thankfully for both you and everyone else were some of the more stretchy basketball pants in your closet, have held as well, though you can feel a slight breeze in your nether regions, your underwear apparently not having survived the growth.  The most obvious change occurs when the tingle hits your face.  Though you aren't able to see it, your mom and friend watch in shock as your face becomes decidedly masculine and attractive.  Your chin grows stronger, your eyebrow ridge grows out a bit, and you gain a handsome amount of facial hair - almost as though you haven't shaved for several days, but have been trimming to keep it a uniform length.  The only thing that remains unchanged, which both David and your mother note, is your nose.  It remains small and dainty, in direct contrast to the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes seem like they're about to stop, you begin to feel an incredibly pleasurable final tingle in your groin.  It's all you can do not to moan as your testicles grow, gaining a smattering of extra pubic hair, while your penis nearly doubles in length.  As it turns out, you were going to grow up to be a really damn attractive man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ...\" you begin before placing your hands to your mouth and neck, \"Testing...\"  Your voice has definitely dropped a bit, not too much, but enough that it sounds odd to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you stay in shocked silence, your two compatriots watching as you begin to flex and test your new muscles.  Finally, David breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game is real,\" he stares at the dice in his hand with newfound appreciation, \"Even your noses changed before, we just didn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should stop, kids,\" your mother whispers nervously, \"David's right, and we have no idea what this game is capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, now flexing your biceps.  \"Yea we do, mum!  We have the rules.  Besides, nothing bad has happened.  I feel great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother gives you a concerned look before looking back at David.  \"Dave, sweety,\" she says, laying on as much of her charm as possible, \"I certainly don't think we should be toying around with something we don't understand.  I'm sure you're mature enough to understand where I'm coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave sort of flounders, considering what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you pick up the dice to put it away you sneeze, causing you to drop and roll the dice. You didn't notice it first, but at the center of the board you see there is a tiny speaker.

The game is not over until there is winner and no one may quit until then. If player does try to quit they will be penatly. If you lose an article of clothing you can not get it back or wear anything in its place. Since you need at least four players,  a fourth person has been chosen by the game. Next thing you all know your creepy landlord that none of you like appears. His character that was chosen for him is Robbie Ray from Hannah Montana. He isn't happy to be here either. He is wearing shirt, shorts, and sandals.  A little about him. He is slightly overweight. He thinks Kathy and her daughters are a huge pain and always wanting to waste his time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asks what is going on.
