He reached her large indoor heated barn and opened the door to find her standing in the center of the straw covered building a look of annoyance on her face.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason...did i not tell you to wake me early\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only bow his head in shame and wait for his mistress to carry out a punishment...and the hoof marks on his back suddenly felt fresh and new, with a failed attempt to hide his fear Jason slowly looked his mistress in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Lucy i apologizes i....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE...i will decided on a punishment later for know make my coat presentable for my guest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached his mistress in silence and took the brushes from there resting place, he began to slowly brush her coat making show it was left soft and smooth, while he was doing this his mistress studied him quietly her look gave nothing away but Jason was becoming concerned with her recent interest in his approaching birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason i expect the food to be washed and ready for my guest he does not like to be kept waiting and any annoyance on his part will look bad on me...so do your best\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nuzzled Jason's cheek before letting him finish her morning brush, once he was done she left the barn to conduct her inspection of the land she owned, knowing full well Jason would be preparing thing for her guest. It was times like these that Jason was sure his mistress had a more tender side but he knew that to question it would be a stupid thing to do so he headed to the store room to collect food for his mistresses guest. Jason quietly washed several large bunches of top quality carrots he knew that his mistresses guest would not be a carnivore...but then the stories he had heard suggested that some of the larger herbivore types such as cows and horses had some times taken to eating there disobedient slaves, Jason shuddered at the though and focused his energy on the preparation of food...he was sure his mistress was not planning to eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finished washing the carrots and placed half of them in a large bowl before carefully carrying them outside, he started towards his mistress private glean knowing she would no doubt be waiting for him to arrive with the food, however a sudden heavy object crashed into him and sent him and the carrots flying to the floor. After a moment of confusion Jason saw what had knocked him to the floor and he gasp with fear as a very large and powerfully built mustang stood before him its eyes glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave how dare you walk into me...do you not know who i am\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason trembled in fear he did not know who the mustang was but he knew from the large birthmark on his neck that he was of the pure bloods line and one of the ruling lords of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason what is going on her and why is the food all over the floor\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his mistresses voice Jason could only look up at her as she stood over him a look of anger in her eyes, careful not anger her of the lord mustang any further Jason quickly bowed before his mistress and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress i must apologizes i was reckless and my actions caused me to spoil the food and cause the lord mustang a great humiliation i except any punishment\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and tell me are there any more carrots that are unspoiled\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason silently nodded his head and his mistress seemed less angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bring them to the glean...my lord i apologizes for my slaves clumsiness he meant no disrespect\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted...i shall overlook it this time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hung his head as his mistress and the Lord Mustang headed to the glean as he raised his head Jason saw the Lord Mustangs belly and he was slightly confused at first to see that it was very large and filled out the space between his back legs...it almost looked like something was faintly moving inside? Quickly Jason headed inside and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything felt so very\u2026 strange. You couldn\u2019t muster real thoughts. You couldn\u2019t see anything clearly. Eventually, almost as if by force of will, your surroundings become more concrete. You were sitting on a giant plate, on a table, in a huge kitchen, almost as if you were the size of an ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really caught your eyes was your mistress, Vela, looming ominously over you. She was normally very large, but now, she seemed like she was the size of a skyscraper. It took a few moments for you to realize -- she hadn\u2019t grown taller, YOU had shrunken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lips her licks hungrily as she looks down upon you, and you realize her true intentions. \u201cMistress, no!\u201d You scream, loud enough for her to hear. \u201cI\u2019m not food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your complaints fell on deaf ears.

You had apparently sleepwalked into the middle of the forest overnight. You open your eyes with a yawn, looking up at the smiling face of one of your mistresses, Cassiopeia -- or just \u201cCass\u201d. Physically, she appeared to be a normal appaloosa horse, with a brown torso and a white, spotted rear end. However, unlike most natural horses, she was almost 9 feet tall, and had the ability to speak fluently (in a stereotypically cowgirl accent, no less). She was also significantly more aesthetically pleasing than a normal horse, with a curvier body, thick lips, large emotive eyes, and a more expressive face. <span class=\"cbrown\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cC\u2019mon, sleepyhead, up and at \u2018em. We\u2019ve gotta leave in an hour.\u201d</b></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression immediately softens when she sees your face. <b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cAre you\u2026 crying?\u201d</span></font></b> She asks. You wipe your eye with your hand, and find your face covered in tears. You hadn\u2019t even noticed. <span class=\"cbrown\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cAwww. Aden, did you have a bad dream?\u201d</b></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. You didn\u2019t want to talk about your nightmares, but they\u2019d been getting worse, and you didn\u2019t know how much longer you could take them. Perhaps talking about them would be healthy. <i>\u201cYeah,\u201d</i> you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass lays down on her belly on the ground beside you, and let you lean sleepily against her side. You were always comforted when snuggling against a huge animal\u2019s warm, furry body. Sometimes, when you were extra good, one of the mares would let you sleep on top of their big, pudgy bellies for a night. It was like the most comfortable beds in the whole world, especially since you could hear their heartbeat. Anyway, being so close to Cass immediately made you feel a little better. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</span></b></font> She asked, gently, with sincerity in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou normally get too anxious to talk about your dreams, but being so close to her calmed you down. <i>\u201cEhhh\u2026 it\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d</i> you relent. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, sometimes, I get a little scared that Vela might decide to\u2026 eat me.\u201d</i> Cass seemed distressed by this, which you expected. Of your two mistresses, Cass is definitely the kindest and most caring to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cAww\u2026 it\u2019s okay to worry sometimes, Aden, but there\u2019s really nothing to be afraid of. You may technically be our\u2026 servant,\u201d</span></b></font> she reassured you, carefully avoiding using the word \u2018slave\u2019, <b><span class=\"cbrown\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cbut we love you like a member of our family. Even if Vela may have trouble expressing that.\u201d</font></span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYeah, I understand that. I think I just get anxious over nothing sometimes\u2026\u201d</i> You say, thoughtfully. Unlike Cass, who loved humans with all her heart, Vela hated humans, seeing how violent and vicious they were back when they were the dominant species. She even swallows humans that get on her nerves sometimes. Your mother was the only human Vela ever liked. In fact, Vela was outright in love with her; you never learned exactly why, except for the fact that your mother apparently saved Vela\u2019s life at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you were younger, your mother was eaten by a pack of wolves, before you could even remember. Vela was devastated by your mother\u2019s death, and turned to Cass for emotional support; this ended up with the two of them becoming mates. In the end, Vela decided to take you in, as you reminded her of your mother. Vela was cold towards you at first, but she\u2019s warmed up to you over the years. While she can still be cruel, she does genuinely enjoy your company, though she\u2019ll never admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cAlright now, little guy, let\u2019s go home. Hop on,\u201d</span></b></font> she said, and you climb up onto her huge back. You take the opportunity to cuddle comfortably against her back as she walked. She takes you out of the forest, back to the city. The city used to be occupied by humans, but after the take-over, it now consisted mostly of abandoned, dilapidated ruins. When they became mates, Vela and Cass had claimed an abandoned gymnasium as their home, mostly because it was one of the only buildings they could comfortably fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCass stepped inside the gymnasium, and Vela came into view. She was even bigger than Cass, and had more of a classy aesthetic than Cass\u2019s cowgirl demeanor. She was definitely a lot more vain than Cass was; her fur was a beautiful white and was perfectly groomed, and she rested her head on a humongous stuffed pillow you had made. As she looked up to see you, you realized how much trouble you might be in. If she thought you were trying to escape\u2026 well, who knows what kind of punishment she would give you. Since she lacked hands, Vela had to come up with creative methods of punishing you when you did something wrong. Nowadays, when she gets mad, she just uses you as a seat cushion for a few hours. She was over 9 feet tall, and her huge, round rump was bigger than your entire body; thus, being stuck under her butt for so long was obviously very uncomfortable. Sometimes, when she was REALLY mad, she came up with even crueler punishments. You shudder at the memories. <b><span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cYou found Aden? Oh, thank goodness. Where did he run off to?\u201d</font></span></b> Vela says, looking surprised to see you resting on Cass\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cPoor little guy got a nightmare. Sleepwalked right into the middle of the forest,\u201d</b></span></font> Cass explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cHe was just sleepwalking? Are you sure?\u201d</font></b></span> Vela raised a brow, disarmed. It seemed she had thought you had ran away. She had probably spent the whole morning thinking of all the ways she was planning to punish you for daring to make an escape attempt. She almost looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. He wasn\u2019t trying to run away or anything,\u201d</span></b></font> Cass insisted in your defense. <b><span class=\"cbrown\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Aden?\u201d</font></span></b> You noded eagerly. Vela looked like she kinda still wanted to punish you, but Cass glared at her, and she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAlright, then. I guess there\u2019s no helping that,\u201d</b></span></font> Vela says, picking you up by your shirt with her mouth and placing you on the floor in front of her pillow. <span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cWell, you got back just in time, Aden! I need my hooves manicured before the klatsch. I can\u2019t have Lynx seeing me with disheveled hooves.\u201d</b></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYes, mistress,\u201d</i> you say in monotone, as you sit down in front of the giant mare. Vela and Cass need to have their hooves maintained often, as they were unnaturally large, and they couldn\u2019t do it themselves, so hoof grooming was one of your primary responsibilities. Vela offers you one of her forehooves, which by itself was almost as big as your head, and you get to work grooming it. You start by grabbing a hoof pick, and using it to clean all the dirt and rocks from her hoof. You then grabbed a hoof nipper, and used it to trim her hoof so it maintains a perfect shape. Finally, you applied shoe polish and hoof dressing, resulting in perfect, shiny white hooves. You then repeat this process on all of her other hooves. You hum a tune as you work, finding that it makes your constant labor less tedious. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWonderful work as always,\u201d</b></span></font> Vela exclaims, admiring her newly polished hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cass had been packing various items in her saddlebags to bring along; mostly bits of treasure that Vela had collected. <span class=\"cbrown\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cAre y\u2019all ready for the party yet?\u201d</b></font></span> Cass asked once her saddlebags were stuffed to the brim with random junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s not a party, dearest, it\u2019s a <i>klatsch</i>! There\u2019s a very important distinction!\u201d</b></span></font> Vela insisted as she finally stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cHeh. Whatever you say, darlin\u2019,\u201d</span></b></font> Cass chuckled at her mate\u2019s pretentiousness, as they walked outside and began their trip to the \u2018klatsch\u2019. As Cass was in charge of carrying all the valuables, you got to ride on Vela\u2019s back this time. It was a little more intimidating, as Vela is even bigger than Cass is, but it was also a bit more comfortable, as Vela had a bit more weight on her and had much softer fur. You try to ignore your worries, and instead, just cuddle up against the mare\u2019s soft back and get a few extra minutes of rest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Commorancy. Some called it an orphanage, some called it a sanctuary, others called it a auction house. In truth, it was more akin to an inescapable prison. Whenever a human was born without a master willing to claim them, they were sent there. There they live, learning about the animal-dominated society, and hopefully eventually being sold to a new master. These soon-to-be slaves were cared for the by four \u2018administrators\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animal who founded the Commorancy, over a hundred years ago, is a titanic green dragon who goes by <span class=\"cgreen\">Athena</span>. She apparently used to run it by herself, but she\u2019s since left managing the Commorancy up to the other administrators, while she runs off and lives a lavish, greedy lifestyle. Because of this, Athena was rarely around -- which was probably a good thing, because she was quite dangerous. Every time a \u2018tenant\u2019 of the Commorancy turns 16, they\u2019re deemed \u2018unsellable\u2019, and they\u2019re sent to Athena to be devoured. In the rare occasions when Athena actually visits, she tends to swallow tons of tenants just because she can, and leaves with a belly full of dozens of squirming humans. Of the admins, she seems to be most apathetic to humans, and even to the Commorancy itself, looking only for profit. For some reason, this made you resent her more than any of the other admins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were thinking rationally, <span class=\"clblue\">Rosie</span> was probably the one you should fear the most. Rosie is the largest, most powerful admin, being a ~70 foot long megalodon (a giant shark), and serves as the disciplinarian and the overseer of labor in the Commorancy. She\u2019s charged with having the kids do various jobs for the Commorancy to make sure they earn their keep. Her hunger, and her temper, are uncontrollable -- a solid half of the tenants end up in her stomach at some point or another. You had to be constantly walking on eggshells when around her, and most of the time, it was best to just avoid her notice. Luckily, she was constrained to the ocean, so you only had to deal with her every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was <span class=\"ctan\">Sanaa</span>. Sanaa is a titanoboa -- a type of ancient, humongous snake, more than 40 feet in length and 3 feet in width. Sanaa is charged with educating the \u2018tenants\u2019 and preparing them for their upcoming lives as slaves. You didn\u2019t know how to feel about Sanaa, to be honest. Compared to Athena and Rosie, she was friendly enough, you guess, but quite mischievous, and enjoyed toying with her \u2018apprentices\u2019. Those who are obedient and work hard, she usually treats kindly, even granting them special privileges like allowing them to live with her in her lavish quarters. However, she\u2019s not afraid to simply devour those that underperform. Because of your work ethic and quietness, you were on Sanaa\u2019s good side for now, but to survive, you had to be constantly aware of the fickleness of her opinion. Many times, tenants she was incredibly fond of one day ended up in her belly the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, but certainly not least, there was your favorite administrator, <span class=\"cred\">Terra</span>. Terra was a siberian husky, only about 5 feet tall; her most noticeable characteristic is her fur, which has a shade of vibrant dark red instead of the usual black. This made her look very distinctive against the boring grey walls of the Commorancy. Terra\u2019s primary occupation is keeping morale up. She occasionally organizes birthday parties and fun trips, and she serves as a guidance counselor that the kids can freely visit whenever they want to talk. Unlike the other administrators, Terra loves humans with all her heart, and does whatever she can to help them. This doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t eat humans occasionally, of course -- Terra hates those who won\u2019t stop bullying the other kids, and won\u2019t hesitate to swallow them whole. You were her favorite tenant, as you always agreed to give her belly rubs and massage her massive, soft paws whenever you visited her office, which she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you? You were nobody, really. Just another kid trapped in the Commorancy, trying to take things day-by-day. Your only hope was to wait it out and hope you got purchased by a kind master. The thought of escaping had crossed your mind, of course, but you didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. Animals ruled the whole world now. Fighting back would be a death sentence. So you had to make due with what you got. Right now, you had just had breakfast, and were wandering the wide-open hallways. You had to report for hard labor this afternoon, but you had a few hours to kill until then. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

For the most part, you keep to yourself, focusing on currying favor with the administrators so as to reduce your chances of getting devoured one day. But you do know someone that you trust and respect; Terra, the most recently hired administrator. None of the other admins like Terra; they consider her a \u2018bleeding heart\u2019 because she loves humans so much, and argue with her constantly. The only reason she doesn\u2019t get fired is because she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s great with kids, and is thus necessary to maintaining peace and order. The parties and trips she frequently organized offered a few hours of escape from the constant deluge of labor and abuse you suffered through, so it should be obvious why you respected her so much. She\u2019s actually saved your life once or twice, in fact. You decide, since you didn\u2019t have anything expected of you for a few hours, you might as well visit her office. Terra\u2019s office was open all throughout the day for kids who needed advice, or a shoulder to cry on, or just someone to talk to. You pushed the door open quietly, poking your head inside. <b>\u201cUhh\u2026 miss Terra? Are you here?\u201d</b> you call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAhh, Jonathan! Come in, come in! We haven\u2019t talked in awhile,\u201d</span> Terra said, sitting at her desk as she gestured you to come inside. The husky\u2019s primarily red fur was beautiful and well-groomed, and her face looked warm and expressive, especially for a canine. She was the only animal you\u2019ve ever met that treated you gently and with respect, and while she was quite a bit taller than you, she wasn\u2019t scary or intimidating. It was because of all this that you\u2019ve always had kind of a crush on the giant husky, though you would absolutely never admit it. You take a seat, the canine looming over you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHow have you been holding up, little guy?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been fine. I\u2019ve just feeling a little\u2026\u201d</b> you say, reaching a hand of your shoulder to rub your aching back. <b>\u201c... tired. And sore.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSorry about that. I\u2019ve been trying to convince Rosie not to work you guys so hard,\u201d</span> Terra sighed, sympathetically. You always found Terra\u2019s office to be the most comfortable place to be in the whole Commorancy. While the rest of the complex felt cold and metallic, her office\u2019s cheap carpeting, cheesy decorations and wooden walls made it feel homely. The office even had this strange smell that reminded you of homemade apple pie. It was almost nostalgic somehow. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIs there something you wanted to talk about?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to see you,\u201d</b> you say. <b>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not busy.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, no. I always have time for my little pumpkin!\u201d</span> she smiled. As she sat there facing you, she timidly presented her hind paws. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, and uh\u2026 do you mind\u2026? I mean, it\u2019s been a while...\u201d</span> You chuckled. Due to an odd condition she has, Terra\u2019s paws ached constantly, and thus, getting them massaged was her favorite thing in the world. You were always more than happy to comply. It was the least you could do, after all. Due to her size, her paws were unusually huge, almost bigger than your entire hands, which you found quite fascinating. Wordlessly, you started kneading her paw pads, and she shuddered. You smiled as you saw her tail wagging quickly, her face showing pure bliss. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s nice\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, you continued your conversation, while also continuing to massage the husky\u2019s paws. <b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 do you think I\u2019ll ever be purchased? Y\u2019know\u2026 in time?\u201d</b> you ask. You still had a few years left, but as you grew older, you started to worry more and more that you may never make it out of here. Perhaps you were doomed to your fate in Athena\u2019s stomach\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou\u2019re a great kid, y\u2019know. If anybody\u2019s going to make it out of here, it\u2019ll be you,\u201d</span> she promises. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIn no time at all. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</span> You\u2019re quiet for a while, taking the moment of peace to ponder your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBut\u2026 even if I am bought, what are the odds my new owner will be nice?\u201d</b> you lament. <b>\u201cWhat if my new home is even worse than this place?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to worry about things like that, little guy,\u201d</span> she advises. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThe future can\u2019t be helped. Just try to think about happy things for now.\u201d</span> You were silent for a long time, thinking. Terra always did her best to comfort you, but her words fell on deaf ears. She constantly reassured you that you would be bought by a new owner someday, but\u2026 you didn\u2019t want to be purchased by some stranger! There was only one animal you would want to spend your life with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t you buy me?\u201d</b> you finally manage the courage to ask. <b>\u201cI can do any work you need me too, I swear!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAww, pumpkin!\u201d</span> she frowns. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m an administrator here. You know I\u2019m not allowed to take any tenants home with me. It would set a bad precedent.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019ve seen many animals. And every one I\u2019ve ever seen has been, just\u2026 evil,\u201d</b> you admit. <b>\u201cThere\u2019s no one I would want to be owned by more than you.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Johnathan,\u201d</span> she says, sadly. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI would love to take you in, but\u2026 my paws are tied. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find somebody, one of these days.\u201d</span> You didn\u2019t want to bother too much. You understood her dilemma, and you didn\u2019t blame her. But\u2026 you just think of how happy you\u2019d be to live the rest of your days with her. You couldn\u2019t imagine a better life. However, instead, you were almost guaranteed to be bought by some cruel creature that would devour or torture you, or spend the rest of your short life in the hellish Commorancy until you are \u2018put down\u2019. As you realized this, you almost wanted to cry. As your emotions swelled, your massaging of Terra\u2019s paws slowed, and she took notice. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</span> she asks. You try to bottle your emotions, but you couldn\u2019t help but have a tear roll down your cheek. Seeing this, Terra wrapped her forepaws around you, giving you a long hug. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAww, there, there, pumpkin\u2026 there\u2019s no need to cry...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press your face against her huge, furry chest as more tears roll down your face. You don\u2019t want her to see you like this, but you couldn\u2019t help yourself. <b>\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair\u2026\u201d</b> you sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI know\u2026 I know...\u201d</span> she whispers into your ear, in that same soothing, songlike tone. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m here for you...\u201d</span> You hold on to the hug for a minute or two, until you can finally regain control of your emotions. You withdraw, regaining your composure as you wipe the remaining tears from your eyes. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cNow, I have business to attend to elsewhere, but if you want, I can bring you along on my back,\u201d</span> she offers. You nod, wordlessly, and she lets you climb onto her red, furry back. It was always a comfortable perch, though it gave you a bit of vertigo. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHang on, little guy!\u201d</span> she smiled as she stood on all fours, and starts trotting around the complex, with you riding along on her back. As you laid there, you notice the other kids at the Commorancy flashing you dirty looks as you pass by. Your friendship with Terra made you an incredibly unpopular outcast among the other humans, as they accused you of being an \u2018animal sympathizer\u2019 or a \u2018traitor\u2019. Many even made rumours that you were in love with her, which\u2026 weren\u2019t entirely inaccurate, you had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you felt the cold air as she stepped outside. You were only allowed outside the Commorancy when accompanied by one of the administrators, and thus, you rarely got to see the sky or feel the grass. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cLook at that...\u201d</span> she said, wistfully, as she stopped for a moment to stare at the wonders around her. At this time in the day, the horizon was running with beautiful streams of blue and white, as if someone was painting the sky. To Terra, the horizon was beautiful. To you, the horizon was simply a reminder of all the places you couldn\u2019t go. All the opportunities you would never have. A reminder that you would never be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a comfortable, half hour trek deeper into the relatively empty city, Terra stopped at a strange, unmarked concrete building. Judging by the sounds of metalworking emanating from within, you could tell there was another animal inside. After checking over her map for a second to confirm she was at the right place, she picked you up by your shirt collar and set you on the ground. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAlright, Jonathan. I can\u2019t bring you inside, so just wait right here for me, okay?\u201d</span> she says, as she walks in through an open garage door. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it!\u201d</span> As she disappeared into the dark structure, everything went silent. You couldn\u2019t even hear any birds chirping. Suddenly feeling uncomfortable, you sit in the grass, trying to distract yourself. You\u2019re not used to being this alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time drags on without her returning, you start to grow worried. What if another animal wanders by before she comes back? Would they think you were a runaway? Would they consider you a simple snack, or toy? While you waited, you only grew increasingly frightened. You really hoped that Terra would be out soon...</span></div></div>",

An icy wind had picked up and nipped at your bare skin, sending goosebumps down your body. The city around you was eerily quiet, almost as if it was abandoned. But it wasn\u2019t it was well full of life, teeming with animals just waiting to gobble you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you felt the ground underneath you shake. It was barely noticeable at first, but over time the tremors in the earth intensified and you feared the worst. What was taking Terra so long!? She wouldn't have abandoned you out here, would she? You gulped an excess of spittle that was building in your mouth, nervous sweat trickling down the side of your head as you spun your head around, looking for the source of the shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the source of the tremors was revealed, as an animal turned the corner of the city block you were on. She was a 40 foot something hippopotamus, clad in a tight, black, sparkly one piece outfit that left practically nothing to the imagination. Brown-sugar pantyhose, bright red pantyhose, light eye shadow. You would have thought her kinda pretty if it wasn't for the fact she was a hippo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt goes without saying, but she was rather portly, like most hippos. Her perky yet large breasts bounced gently in her bra, while her chubby stomach slightly wiggled with each and every footfall. You could only think of how many humans she could have eaten to get to that size. And than she saw you, a lone human out in the city, cross into her eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as you made eye contact with the massive animal. You had been praying to whatever higher being there might be that you would go unnoticed, but it appears you have been met with indifference. The hippo women was know walking quicker, with as set destination in mind. You told the muscles in your legs to get up and start running, but your body was unresponsive, wracked with fear and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you knew it, you were cast in darkness as the hippo blocked out the sun and loomed over you. She bent her knees and lowered herself down to the ground to get a better look at you. You didn't notice it before, but it would seems that she was smiling at you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked up at the massive pachyderm\u2019s face to see that she bore a warm, and almost inviting smile. She gave a quiet giggle as she looked down at your relatively small form, scared to the point of immobilization. It didn\u2019t register in your head before, but her eyes had a particular shade of blue reminiscent to a sparking sapphire. You must have been to busy being panicked over your life to notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were still deathly afraid of the huge animal, but so far she didn't make any signs of malicious intent. Tired of the pregnant silence between the two of you, you nervously offered a meek cough to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello\u2026?\u201d That was the first thing that you said to the hippo, and whether or not it was your intent, she seemed satisfied with your apparent ability to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a minute there I thought you were a mute, honey~.\u201d the voluptuous hippo giggled in a feminine tone. She stopped bending down on her knees and sat her thick, plush posterior on the ground in front of you, rumbling the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little thing like you doing out in the big, bad city?\u201d She asked you in a...genuine tone? It was hard to place it, but somehow, this animal\u2019s tone of voice and choice of words reminded you a lot like Terra\u2019s. She was still smiling cheerily at you, expecting an answer to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-well\u2026\u201d You stammer out, trying to formulate a coherent sentence. \u201cMy...my friend dropped me off out here while she was inside.\u201d You pointed to the building where Terra was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hippo widened her eyes at your statement, apparently big news to her. \u201cNow, that\u2019s funny. I was just running late on my way here to visit a couple of friends of mine here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching you off guard, she actually began to avert your gaze and shifted her head up a little higher. A rosy hue creeped up on her grey, shiny skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to put you on the spot or anything, but...is your \u2018friend\u2019 called Terra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your jaw went any lower, it would have landed on the ground. \u201cYou know her!?\u201d You asked. You knew that the siberian husky had to have a seperate life outside of her work at the commanacry, but...a hippo as a friend? She was five feet tall, and the animal in front of you was roughly eight times her size! For you, the rule of thumb with bigger animals was that they were demeaning to those shorter than themselves, like Rose and the rasre times you got to see Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes! We\u2019ve been friends since childhood!\u201d The hippo responded eagerly to your question. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends since childhood, always looking out for one another\u2026\u201d She paused, having a flashback to the good old days when she was young. She remembered the first time she met Terra. A group of bullies were making fun of her weight, when Terra came onto the scene and defended her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was before she had gone through her growth spurt, shooting up from a measly 6\u20193\u2019\u2019 to the double digits, but the husky still defended her, even if the bullies got larger. Ever since than, the two had been best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell than\u2026\u201d The hippo said, shaking herself out from her daydream. \u201cIf you know Terra, than you must be from the commonarcy.\u201d She gave you a sad smile. \u201cHow about i help you on inside? I\u2019m sure Terra wouldn't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo proceeded to hold out a pudgy hand in front of you, so large you could have been hidden away from the world inside it. \u201cMy name is Charlotte, it\u2019s nice to meet ya!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to you that she was offering to give you a handshake. You weighed the choice in your head. True, she was seemed nice, but what if it was all a front? You heard stories of animals acting all mushy gushy over humans when they go to but them, but turn into total monsters outside. But the hipp-...Charlotte said she knew Terra, and you knew her too well to think that this was some trap laid out by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you slowly rest your hand on Charlotte\u2019s chubby hand flesh. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you Charlotte.\u201d Which was not a complete lie. The hippopotamus carefully encased your hand, as well as your entire right arm, in a handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, instead of letting go, Charlotte raised her hand back up to her height, with you still clasped in her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d You exclaimed as you were suddenly lifted into the air. Had you made the wrong choice? Fortunately, that appeared to not be the case, as Charlotte simply got up and unclenched her hand, with you hoisting yourself up into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the fright, honey. I just though this wood be the best way to get you inside. I don\u2019t want to keep Terra waiting any longer.\u201d And with that, Charlotte walked towards the front door of the building, with you in her open palm. You gulped as she knocked on the wooden, double door. You couldn't help but be nervous and intimidated by the hippo\u2019s size and weight, no matter how friendly she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open to reveal...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charlotte, her body getting momentarily caught in the doorway by her rather ample backside and waist, trekked into the building with you in her pudgy hand. The building, as it turned out, was in fact a lived in residence. You were in what you assumed to be the Foyer area of the home, with fancy and lavish decoration adorning the walls and furniture, signaling that whoever lived here must have been very well off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions started to bubble into your mind, question such as: Why did Terra come to someone\u2019s house? It could not have been her house, it was far, far too big for the five foot husky. It was built more for people along the size of you hippo friend. Another question popped into your mind: Why was Charlotte, the hippo in question, here too? By looking around at the surroundings of the Foyer, you found your answer almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced on the walls and on top of desks and shelves were pictures of the grey, shiny hippo in different poses and locations. She was here because this was her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection. It was their house. For in almost every picture of Charlotte, there was also another anthro of equally large height and girth. An elephant, with glossy, hot brown skin always dressed in clothes that were several sizes too small for her to show as much bare flesh as possible, not unlike Charlotte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask the meaning of all this to the hippopotamus you were being carried by, Charlotte raised her free hand to her mouth to amplify the coming shout. \u201cTerra! Irene! I\u2019m home, and I found our little friend!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-m-ms. Charlotte!\u201d You stutter, a bit shocked at how all of this was turning out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey hippo looked down at you with the same, warn smile that she gave you before outside. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise~\u201d She giggled, and your focus was drawn away from her as you heard another person\u2019s heavy footfalls resonate through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the corner, the brown skinned Elephant from the photos, most likely the Irene Charlotte was addressing to earlier, entered the foyer with a very familiar looking Siberian Husky in her hand. The Elephant of around 75 feet tall looked down on your diminutive form held in Charlotte\u2019s hand and let out a squeal of delight. \u201cLike, oh my God, he\u2019s even more cute than you said he was Terry!\u201d She cooed at the apparent cuteness of your body to the husky that took care of you at the Commorancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! He\u2019s a sweetie pie, alright!\u201d Terra nodded in Irene\u2019s grasp as she eyed you over like deciding which candy to pick from a store. \u201cSorry for the shock, puddin\u2019. We just wanted this to be a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm..not to sound rude or anything, but\u2026\u201d You felt very, very awkward being the center of attention by the oversized animals that had big smiles on their faces. \u201cWhat is...all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ladies shared a brief look at each other, before bursting out into guffawing laughter. You quietly chuckle to yourself as well, to seem as if you were in on this inside joke and not left hopelessly isolated by the confusion of this situation. After the laughter died down, Irene move forwards to Charlotte, and in turn you, her whole body shaking and quivering with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe move the closed fist that carried Terra next to hand that Charlotte was carrying you in, and opened it to allow the Siberian husky some room to move. She hopped down from the Elephant's hand and on to Charlotte\u2019s, making her way towards you and wrapping you in a big hug with her bushy tail before you could get a word in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my little sweetums.\u201d She whispered lovingly in your ear. \u201cI couldn't stand to see you so miserable at the rotten orphanage, so I decided to take things into my own paws.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Terra?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, these two Pachyderms...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
