            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been said that in the year 2012, the world would end. Well, it had been said by the Mayans and rebuked by the rest of the world. How could an ancient civilization truly predict the end of the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they weren't completely wrong. It wasn't the end of the world, per say, but the end of freedom. The end of the world as anyone knew it. And this was according to a different, more accurate prophecy that had been undiscovered, a prophecy set forth in the middle ages, when wizards, witches, and magic still existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prophecy states that, in this year 2012, a powerful magical being would return in some unknown land, looking to unlock a secret that will allow this being to become all powerful, and rule the world in his image. The prophecy also stated that the only way this being could be defeated would be if two younger lads, two teenagers, were able to lead an army and save the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the good wizards and witches of the world knew this prophecy, but they also knew the vagaries of it. Would this magical being a wizard, a witch, perhaps a demon? Would it disguise itself as a modern person, or would hide in the woods, biding its time? And where was this unknown land? Much of it was a mystery to even the most powerful beings. So they began to search for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this search for answers, the practice of magic slowly disappeared from the world, and the stories of the magic of the middle ages became myth. And by the time 2012 began, all these Wizards would know was that this unknown land was most likely Middleview, a small American town that, for some strange reason, gave off the strongest aura of magic ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the magical being also knew of this, and had been preparing his time, almost ready to strike on the unsuspecting town. However, the final part of the prophecy, the teenage heroes and the army that could defeat him. How could this be prevented? He couldn't kill them all. That would take up too much dark magic, and even a being bent on world domination had some morals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, of course! He could use the dark magic to transform them into something other than teenagers! That could prevent the prophecy, right? Even if it would alert the other wizards and witches of his presence, they could do nothing to stop it! The prophecy says they cannot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, in the year of 2012, the teenagers of the town of Middleview would become transformed, and it would take them on a magical quest to discover the conspiracy around them and stop the world from being destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which of our heroes do you want to follow?</span></div></div>",

He cried out like one who's been startled and woke up to his pitch black room. There were no monsters out to get him, nor demons to torment him... or so he thought.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nDeep beneath the earth, a dark and evil creature brooded upon his throne, his magic scepter in his hand and his familiar raven perched upon his shoulder. The green orb atop his staff caught the patches of light from above and lit the room just enough that if one were to look carefully they would see strange and grotesque figures writhing about in the shadows. The Being, for so he is called by those who rightly fear his true name, rose and spoke in a dark and terrible voice, \"Yes, that seems like a lovely idea! Don't you agree Molinus?\" The raven squawked in response, \"Good boy.\"<br>\r\nHe stopped and glared at one of the writhing creatures which had given him a funny look, \"What are you gawking at?\" it quickly looked away and went back to its writhing.<br>\r\nThe Being rose from his throne as he raised his great staff and cried to his masters below, \"Brengtus carvinach durentun! Juventak Korotak!\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nGordon stumbled into the bathroom, his stomach in extreme pain. He gripped the edge of the sink and started coughing uncontrollably. His hands, covered in sweat, slipped from the sink and he fell to the floor... A few hours later he came around again and staggered up again as best he could. He looked the mirror and everything was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Heaven's Love Magitech services, this is Calinus, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n\"Heaven?\"<br>\r\n\"Outsourcing's a bitch ain't it! Any way, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, Im just your evil lord of darkness, and I found out not too long ago that theres this prophecy that says two teenagers will lead an army against me, you know the drill. And there from a specific town so I got the idea to turn all the teenagers into small children.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, that must take up a lot of dark energy. How much did you spend?\"<br>\r\n\"About thirty-eight percent.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah now that could have been avoided if you had the new Psych-Gnom 12.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I just want to know how to-\"<br>\r\n\"Let me explain, we put a series of psychic gnomes into your staff and they sense when a spell isn't going to work and preserve the dark energy for later that would otherwise go to waste.\"<br>\r\n\"The great, but in the meantime-\"<br>\r\n\"And for just thirteen easy payments of 6 souls a month you'll get not only this but a-\"<br>\r\n\"Look, just tell me how to fix this!\"<br>\r\n\"Did you check the battery?\"<br>\r\n\"This thing has batteries?\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nGordon enjoyed a nice bowl of corn flakes after his ordeal which went down surprisingly easy considering how he felt this morning. All except that last bite when some of his teeth fell out of his mouth. He had barely gotten over the shock when he felt a tugging at all of his bones and heard his shoes clunk to the floor as they fell off his diminished feet followed by his snake like socks. Soon more of his teeth fell out as his throat jumbled and moved around, locking off his deeper bass and leaving him with the high soprano of a young and helpless boy. He looked down in shock and horror at his now smooth and hairless legs, wearing his boxers like a pair of oversized shorts. This is impossible, he thought, it just isn't possible!<br>\r\nAlas, it was possible, not only for him, but for every single teenager in town.

He had not known that his nemesis had an apprentice. He quickly pointed his staff at his nemesis. She turned, and threw her pupil off her. Desperation settled in. The girl closed her eyes and started to light up. The light expanded in a sphere around her, pushing back the darkness. The males under 20 started to change, becoming shorter, their hair growing longer, their chests expanding. As they changed, his spell seemed to lose its effect on them. The little girl that had cast the spell collapsed to the ground, exhausted from the large amount of magical energy that she had expelled. The man cursed himself for not seeing this coming. Still, it did not matter. He now had a powerful sorceress under his command as well as an army of mind controlled minions. It was time to leave before any mages sensed the large magical energy release in the area.

Lilith wiped away another tear. This was no time for crying, she had a job to do. She found her mistress's large spell book and started to look through it for the contact spells. Like all young mages, Lilith had been taught to read from a young age in all languages, so that she could read spells written by witches in other countries as well as her own. She finally found the spell she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Council of Mages, I am Lilith Paltrow, Apprentice of Mage Janine, I seek an audience with you on an issue of huge importance,\" Lilith waited for a moment, and then six lights appeared in the room, each one a different color: red, yellow, green, blue, black and white. These lights were representative of each of the six elemental mages. Red for fire, yellow for air, green for earth, blue for water, black for darkness and white for air, each of the lights would allow Lilith to communicate with one member of the council. Her voice would be heard by all of them no matter where they were. <br>\r\n\"Why have you called us, Lilith Paltrow?\" asked Fire Mage Heatron \"We told Mage Janine only to use this spell in case of an emergency.\" <br>\r\n\"This is an emergency,\" said Lilith \"An evil sorcerer that we've had some trouble with before has come and used a spell to take over the minds of everyone in the town except for the women under twenty, I released a lot of raw magic which turned all of the males under twenty into girls, which stopped the spell on them.\" <br>\r\n\"This is troubling,\" said Dark Mage Drokon \"I will find out who in my order has gone rogue, then I will return to this council.\" <br>\r\nThe dark light vanished. <br>\r\n\"There still remains the problem of the spell you cast,\" said Fire Mage Heatron \"I assume they have the potential to learn magic now?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lilith \"That was the second reason I called this council, I need permission to train them in magic so we can go up against the evil mage that is took control of everyone in this town, including my mistress.\" <br>\r\n\"How much did Mage Janine teach you?\" asked Fire Mage Heatron. <br>\r\n\"She taught me how to control all of the different forms of magic, I wanted to have a diverse range of skills when I become a mage like her,\" explained Lilith \"I have managed to master all of these forms of magic.\" <br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Fire Mage Heatron \"You have a week, after that, we will have to mobilize a force against the evil mage that started this, we can't let any mages rebel, or they might start a magic civil war.\" <br>\r\n\"I will not fail,\" said Lilith \"We will be ready in a week, ready your army, we may need it.\"   </span></div></div>",

They needed an army, these people were the only ones that were unaffected by the dark sorcerer's mind control spell. Lilith couldn't trust anyone except the council. But even the council would be affected by the spell if they were attacked by the sorcerer, so Lilith couldn't even count on their help. Lilith's thinking was interrupted as she had to dodge a fireball from Gordon. <br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said \"The basic fireball takes the least energy to cast, you can cast this spell repeatedly at the enemy, this is good if you want to force an enemy back, but in order to gain that advantage, you need a distraction.\" <br>\r\nLilith jumped, bringing her hand down onto the ground, causing the ground to vibrate. All of the former boys had trouble staying on their feet. Lilith took the opportunity to throw a fireball at each of them, knocking them all to the ground. <br>\r\n\"That's the basic knockdown combination,\" said Lilith \"You can also manipulate the air around you in order to fly, but this takes a lot of energy, which is why we magi use enchanted items -brooms, flying carpets and the like- to fly, although we can fly without them.\" <br>\r\nLilith demonstrated by floating into the air. Several of the others joined her, one of which was Gordon. <br>\r\n\"Air can also be used to your advantage in combat,\" said Lilith, putting both of her hands together, she created a funnel of air which spun all the former boys around and around in the air \"On the ground, the air can be used to slow down enemies.\" <br>\r\n\"There are two more elements I have to teach you,\" said Lilith \"Water and light.\" <br>\r\nShe landed back on the ground. The rest of the former boys joined her. <br>\r\n\"Water is everywhere around us, the air is full of evaporated water from the water cycle, you just need to harness it, change its state from gas to liquid, or ice if it suits your purpose,\" said Lilith, holding out a cup and demonstrating water pouring out of thin air, then turning to ice. <br>\r\n\"Light is your final element, it includes summoning lightning, blinding the enemy and, when you're a master, removing mind control,\" explained Lilith<br>\r\n\"So if we go up against our own parents,\" said Gordon \"How do we remove the mind control?\" <br>\r\n\"The dark sorcerer is the original caster of the spell, if we can destroy his staff, all spells cast with it will be reversed,\" said Lilith \"Apart from that, I don't have another way to reverse the mind control.\"  </span></div></div>",

Just then they both hear their mom call them for breakfast. \"I don't know but I'm hungry and can use some food.\" Melissa exclaims. Seemly not caring about their nude state they both run downstairs for food.</span></div></div>",

Then as if on cue her alarm went off forcing her to wake up to turn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Melissa knew from years of experience was that she was not a morning person, she was able to get ready for school mainly out of ritually doing it everyday. But for the most part her body was on auto pilot through out the entire process. That being said as she laid in bed she could tell something was off. She couldn't put her finger on it right now but her room just felt different to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was just morning grogginess messing with her she began getting out of bed. That is when she heard a distinct crinkle from under her covers as she moved. This immediately brought her out of her grogginess. Never had she heard a crinkle when she was getting up in the morning, was she right about something being off this morning? she wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried the sound was real and not just in her head she shifted in her bed again hearing the crinkle once more. Carefully she lifted her covers and looked down. To her horror she was wrapped in a big disposable diaper. She poked it a couple time to make sure she wasn't still dreaming. As she touched it it dawned on her that it was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she decided to change out of it before someone came into her room to check on her or something. She ran to her dresser and opened her underwear drawer only to see where her panties used to be now sat disposable diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201d She said to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher mind seemed to be having trouble processing what was going on this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she walked over to her closet and opened it only to discover....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then struggled out of her blanket and realized her problem. When she looked at her hand it wasn't there, but instead a small paw covered in blonde fur was in its place. \"What the hell is going on?\" she yelled. When she looked over her body she saw she now had four paws, a tail, and was covered in blonde fur the same shade as her hair. She also notice her room was significantly larger. Melissa jump off her bed to her mirror to see what happened to her. When she looked in the mirror she saw a blonde cat with her pajama top on staring back at her. \"I'm a cat!?\" is all she said. For the next 5 minutes all she did was stare at herself. \"Ok, I'm a cat. Not sure how or why I'm a cat but I need to get out of here and find mom or Ashley.\" she thought.

All I know is when I woke up I grew this\" Ashley then pulls down her pajama pants and panties to expose to top of her ass. What Melissa sees surprises her. A cat tail cover in brown fur, that was the same shade as her sisters hair, sat swaying back and forth on top of her ass. \"You're turning into one to!\" Melissa exclaimed. It was then Ashely felt tingling in her ears. Before long her ears pointed, became covered in the same brown fur and migrated to the top of her head. \"Well, now you have ears to match the tail\" Melissa laughs at her. \"Haha, very funny. What should I do Mel? At this rate I'll be completely a cat in less then 10 minutes\" she tells her sister. \"I honestly don't think theres anything we can do right now\" Melissa tells her. \"Maybe you should open the door since mom and dad aren't home. We'll figure something out after you change\" Melissa continues. \"Ok\" Ashley says a lil annoyed as she opens the door. \"I'm taking my clothes off though. They're making me hot and I feel confined with them on\" Ashely say. \"That would be the cat side of you talking\" Melissa laughs. Melissa watches as her 17 year old sister stripes in front of her. She was a little surprised her sister didn't seem to care. Ashley had always been self conscious about her body due to her pudginess. \"That feels better\" Ashley says when she finished discarding her clothes. \"Looks like your pubic hair has turned to fur Ash\" Melissa tells her. \"Hm, look at that\" Ashley thought as she looked at the brown patch of fur. Ashley then walked over to the mirror to watch the rest of her change. \"Well, I guess I can say goodbye to these for now\" she says as she cups her CC size breasts. \"Don't worry Ash, that fact you'll get 6 more teats will make up for it\" Melissa tells her sarcastically. \"Yea, I'm sure\" she laughs. Over the next few minutes the watch as she becomes more and more feline. After about 7 minutes all thats staring back at them in the mirror are a brown cat and a blonde cat. \"Ok what do we do now?\" Ashley asks Melissa.</span></div></div>",
