Use proper grammar, spelling, and contribute more than one line additions. No one likes one line additions :)<br>\r\n- To extend on the previous rule, I reserve the right to decide what kind of chapter is 'low effort'. I will try not to remove too much, but if you write sloppy, short chapters riddled with errors I will extend my right to remove your chapter.<br>\r\n- Please keep writing from the perspective of second person. IE, \"YOU looked up at the towering girl\", \"YOU ran to the side to avoid her step\", etc.<br>\r\n- Keep the main character nameless and keep their gender ambiguous- no clearly stating their pronouns. I want this story to be enjoyable to everyone that wants to be tiny around HDN characters, not just the boys!<br>\r\n- The tiny this story follows should only be interacting with the girls- nothing against giant boys, just not what this story is for! There aren't many guys in the HDN games anyway so this shouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n- All fetishes are allowed, go wild~<br>\r\n- The girls can be whatever kind of giant you want, gentle, cruel, playful, whatever. Just try to give them justification that fits their character!<br>\r\n- Try to keep the story going and don't write it into a dead end or kill the main character without giving an option to continue another storyline. IE, if you're going to write a chapter where the main character gets stepped on by Vert and you want the main character to die, include one option where the main character dies and at least one option where the main character lives.<br>\r\n- Similarly, the story ends when/if the main character dies.<br>\r\n- You can be tiny in the presence of more than one girl at a time- if you want a chapter where Vert decides to share you with Chika, that can definitely happen~<br>\r\n- The main character starts at two inches tall. Size changing can happen, but please keep them no smaller than 1/4 inch and no taller than 12 inches (one foot.) None of the girls can grow but if you want some of them can shrink, IE maybe Noire can shrink Neptune so she can play with you and her together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know there are a LOT of characters in the Neptunia series but I will try to give options for all of them! Let me know if I missed any and I will try to add chapters for them, thank you <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most important thing is, have fun!
