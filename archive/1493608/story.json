If you have any troubles, get me right away if it's an emergency, otherwise slip a trouble sheet under my door and I'll get to it as soon as I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spend most of my nights watching black &amp; white reruns on my 55\" color tv.  I keep the volume down, so as not to disturb the other tenants and visitors walking past my door on their way to the stairway or elevator, which, by the way, has a mind of it's own.  I'll leave you with that, so be forewarned should you prefer to risk your life in that ... that ... steel contraption of a box rather than taking the stairs, which, by the way, is better for your health, unless of course you have a heart condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riverside Apartment building is located on the bus route; I've posted the schedule on the bulletin board.  If you'd like a copy of your own, slip a dollar in my mail box with your apt number paper-clipped to it and I'll put a schedule in yours.  If you give me two dollars, I'll include a copy of the menu to the Chinese restaurant down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd much prefer if you'd iron out your complaints amongst yourselves. I'm not good with drama and I hate to have to pick sides. Besides, Riverside Apartments  has a reputation to uphold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time of this writing, all the units on the second floor are available.  When those fill up, head on up to the third floor. Just remember, 201 is right above my apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, as your landlord of Riverside Apartments, have the right to:<br>\r\n* Search your apartment.<br>\r\n* Make any repairs if necessary.<br>\r\n* Evict you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We were <i>so</i> lucky to find Riverside Apartments and to actually <i>rent a unit here</i>, weren't we, Chase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase turned his view from overlooking the river from their second floor apartment to Livi and gave a reaffirming nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the landlord .. what's his name?  Matt?  Marvin?  Chase, do you remember?  Anyway, he's such a nice guy.  I love his round glasses and beer belly. I'll bet he'd make a great Santa Clause come Christmas time. Sooooo, we left two dollars in his mail slot with our apartment number paper-clipped to them, just like he instructed, and wouldn't you know,\" she started to giggle, \"We found the bus schedule <i>and</i> the menu for the Chinese restaurant, in our mail slot.  Ooooooo,\" she let out, recovering from her moment of sheer joy, \"He's such a nice guy.\"  She took a few steps over to chase and slipped her arm under his and clung to him, peering up to his grey-blue eyes.  \"Did I already say that?  'He's such a nice guy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let loose of his arm and traipsed over to the leather couch and plopped herself down, kicking her feet over the arm rest. She retrieved the tv remote from the coffee table and pressed the button to turn it on.  The screen lit up with some nouveau art of a saxophone, a guitar and a set drums along with some text displaying the song title and artist of the smooth jazz tune that suddenly filled the room.  Chase enjoyed relaxing to this kind of music at the end of a long day at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started up again, \"It's been so quiet here, what with us being the only tenants, so far.  Well, other than the landlord, Mitch.  Or was it Mike?  Mmmm anyway.  I think he mentioned there were a few others moving in soon.  I can't wait to meet them,\" she smiled and turned to look for Chase, who was now sitting at the kitchen table checking his cell phone for the latest on his social media apps. \"We should have them over for dinner, don't you think, Chase?  Darling?  Even if it's something we pick up from the Chinese restaurant. Chase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a noise that sounded like something affirmative and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they deliver?  Did you happen to notice if they deliver, Chase?\" She turned and saw that his attention was focused on his phone. \"Chase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm yeah... I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it doesn't matter.  Just as long as we have a good time visiting.\"  She suddenly popped up from her laid back position on the couch. \"Ohmigosh!  I need to go!  I have to call my mother.  Talk to you later.  Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that's not to say you won't be able to hear your neighbors next to or above or below you, or see them in the stairway/elevator through the peephole in your door, or even smell what they've been cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've been careful to select and accept only the finest of tenants.  However, even with the best intentions, your neighbors may be nosey, noisey, gossipy, or just quirky.  They may be kind to you, be suspiscious of you, find your habits as strange or inticing.  They may depend on you, avoid you, absolutely despise you or even be your lover.  Watch and listen closely, because they're doing the same!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building, loacted on Riverside Drive (along the east side of the building), overlooking Pleasant River (to the west) is comprised of a parking area (in the basement), a lobby with the landlord's apartment, building office, tennant mailboxes and intercom system, and several floors (to be determined by the contributors), each with 4 apartments and a central elevator and stairway.  Each apartment covers a corner of the building.  So, on the second floor, Apartment 201 is situated on the northwest corner of the building with a view of the river and would be immediate neighbors with apartment 202 (in the northeast corner) and apartment 204 (in the southwest corner).  Kitty-corner to 201 would be 203 (in the southeast corner) which would be blocked from view by the elevator and stairway.  (Any questions, drop me a note.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n<pre><br>\r\n+-----+-----+<br>\r\n| 201 | 202 |<br>\r\n|-----+-----|<br>\r\n|   +-+-+   |<br>\r\n|   |E|S|   |<br>\r\n|   +-+-+   |<br>\r\n|-----+-----|<br>\r\n| 204 | 203 |<br>\r\n+-----+-----+<br>\r\n</pre><br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Welcome to <span class=\"cBlue\">Riverside Apartments</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Welcome home!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
