            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Want some new powers to use, hmm? Well, why not. Now then, just to give us some variety, I will reveal the first 2 powers as options. The first power to be revealed is none other than the power of Typhokinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what it is, Typhokinesis is the ability of absorbing, controlling, and redirecting smoke, fire, and embers. This type of power allows it's user to get up close and personal with the enemy with quick and violent attacks. Though it isn't a melee-type superpower, you also have the Smoke Shot, which looks like a fireball; it can be fire at a rapid pace, with the drawback being a low damage. The Smoke Shot can also be charged up and shot in a form similar to a blast, called Cinder Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who want to be non-lethal, you can use a grenade-like ability called Sulfur Bomb. When used, it knocks back all meant enemies, choking them a bit with smoke. Don't worry, it isn't going to kill them, but rather, keep them occupied until you subdue or execute them, depending on your choice. If you need to do some serious damage, you can use the Cinder Missile, which is a propelled explosive mash-up of smoke, ash, and flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for getting around the environment, you can use the Smoke Dash, which causes you to turn into a wispy cloud of smoke and embers and rematerializing into your original form moments later. This is perfect for getting through structures with openings, like chain-link fences, iron bars, and other pipe-like structures. But if you're talking about the Smoke Dash's combat efficiency, it will allow to dodge faster than a normal person, nimbly moving around the battlefield with inhuman speed, as you close the distance with your enemies and use melee on them. Also, you can use the ventilation system to your advantage, appearing almost instantly on the roof of a building. Along with the Smoke Dash, you have access to the Smoke Thrusters, where you expel smoke from your arms, boosting your momentum &amp; slowing down your descent, allowing you to glide. Using the Smoke Dash along with the Smoke Thrusters will boost your gliding distance further before touching down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for when it comes to melee attacks, I would suggest using a chain. Combining your powers with the chain allows you to superheat, turning a simple chain into a powerful whip that would have explosive but small puffs of ash and embers to occur upon contact, damaging enemies within range. And for a combination of overkill and raw power, you are able to use a powerful Smoke ability called the Orbital Drop. When used, it will allow you to dispatch a large number of enemies at once. Once triggered, you momentarily charge up, then condescending into pure smoke and shooting upwards into the sky. From there, you reform back into a humanoid shape, before rocketing back down to terra firma, using the Smoke Thrusters to accelerate your descent, and then exploding on impact, before reforming back to normal. It is best advised not to use this ability indoors, like a building or an area with a roof above you, otherwise you'll just hit your head against the ceiling and it won't work, so use this ability in a outdoor area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you have all this power at your fingertips, you're only able to hold so much energy, so you need to \"recharge\" your abilities via draining and absorbing sources of Smoke, whether said source is from a roaring fire, a burning car, or anything else you can think of that disperses smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, the second power to be revealed is Electrokinesis &amp; Electromagnetism. As for why there's an extra power in there, Electromagnetism is the same as Electrokinesis, but it feels more like an upgrade to electrokinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abilities used in these electric-based powers are similar to Typhokinesis, but instead of smoke as the primary element, it's electricity. With some minor differences of course. For example, as a means of locomotion, you can use the electricity pulsating in you to grind along anything metallic to increase your speed and move faster, whether you're grinding along a telephone wire or a railroad tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the Orbital Drop, instead of turning yourself into a human nuclear missile, you can call upon the most natural form of electricity, lightning, to aid you, as you guide the lightning bolt across the battlefield, making your enemies feel the sting of millions of volts through electrocution. Though, one of the weaknesses that come with electric superpowers is water. Sure, a small drop isn't going to do bodily harm to you, but submerge one third to half of your body in nothing but pure H2O, and the results are fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there you have it, ladies and gents. So, which power do you choose for your adventure into Flonyard? Smoke, or Electricity? Your choice.</span></div></div>",

Well, you WERE human, anyway. Nowadays, you became what some would call \"the next step in human evolution\": a Metahuman. Or to be more specific, someone with superpowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't capable of moving faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, nor being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, or even all of the above. Instead, you had the power of Typhokinesis, the ability to manipulate smoke, whether it was turning your entire body into smoke to pass through chain-link fences, or something as simple as shooting a fireball out of the palm of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike other superheroes, you were a rebel, putting you squarely in the Anti-Hero section. After all, you had a habit of doing artistic graffiti, as well as trying to keep the streets a little safer with your newfound abilities. However, you were given the name \"The Psycho Smoker\", because it wasn't just that you had a lot of guts in a fight, risking your own ass to protect those who are....less fortunate, but you were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), an Autistic disorder, since you were a young boy. However, you definitely weren't challenged that's for sure, you knew that modern-day politics were as crooked as the devil himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were finishing up your latest graffiti mural on the rooftops in Downtown San Francisco, shortly after doing your nightly rounds in the area, trying to make sure nobody got mugged, raped, or murdered. After all, you dropped out of High School during the second semester of your Senior year, just a few months before Graduation Day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you finally finished the mural and backed away to see it in it's glory, you were currently wearing your red beanie hat, gray and navy blue tennis shoes with a pair of stonewashed jeans that were made for the parkour movements you use to move across the rooftops aside from your powers. On your upper body, you were wearing a green shirt with an enlarged 7up logo on the front, with a dark jacket with the sleeves torn off, turned into a makeshift vest, as the the vest had and enlarged logo from the Mortal Kombat video game series. Finally, you had a gray bandana wrapped around your neck, which you use as a makeshift mask when you pull it over your mouth and nose. Along with the bandana, you had a 5 foot long industrial chain wrapped around your right arm, using it as a whip when you combine it with your smoke powers, as well as wearing a black fingerless glove on your left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for physique, you were a pretty athletic guy, athletic enough to do the sort of activities you carry throughout the city. Unfortunately, little did you know, but a certain event was about to change your life forever, as....</span></div></div>",

However, little were you aware of at the moment, but you had a visitor. A four-legged visitor, to be more accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it barked at you getting your attention, as you quickly turned around to find out that there was only a medium-sized dog standing merely 10 feet away from you. It was wearing what appeared to be a orange scarf wrapped around it's neck, as if the article of clothing was a dog collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously seeing that it wasn't what you would call an actual threat, you approached the scarf-wearing canine, knelt down on one knee, and began to gently scratch it behind the ears, causing it to stick out it's tongue and pant heavily, as you spoke to the dog and said, \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Hey there, buddy. How did you get up here, anyway?</span>\" However, just as you were taking a bit of a liking to your new canine companion, the dog suddenly rammed itself into you, knocking you onto your back, just as a decorative knife planted itself into the rooftop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it wasn't the knife falling from the sky that got you, but rather, it was what the knife did a few short seconds after it planted it's blade into the concrete rooftop that definitely caught you by surprise, as it made what appeared to be some sort of swirling vortex that glowed a pink hue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much to your displeasure, it was sucking you into it's grasp! <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh come on! Haven't I been through enough craziness in my life as it is!\"</span> you yelled, as the vortex's vacuum became more aggressive, dragging you closer to it's gaping maw. Instinctively, you attempted to grab a ventilation filter, holding onto it for dear life. However, before you could even get a apprehensive grip on the vent filter, your fingers slipped on your left hand, causing a chain reaction to lose your grip on the filter, sending yourself flying into the vortex, as you screamed, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"WHY ME!?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat almost felt like a few minutes became a few seconds, as you came out of the other side of the vortex and noticed an entirely new landscape, with lush forests and...floating islands? And yet, the worst of it all could be summed up in 7 words: You. Were. Falling. From. The. Freaking. Sky!! You were completely unsure how high you were from the ground, you could only guess at around almost a thousand yards in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the adrenaline pumping through your veins, you attempted to slow your descent down some, as you realigned your physical stance, so your feet were the first to face the ground below. Then, you activated your smoke powers and used your Smoke Thrusters to  decrease the speed of your descent by half, since you appeared to be falling at around 90 miles an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you were doing your best to control your descent, you noticed what appeared to be a stone temple with a large flat area for a roof. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"This...is definitely going to suck.\"</span> You said, cringing a bit from the thought of landing hard, since you were still descending fast enough to cause some physical injury upon you. In the end though....</span></div></div>",

Aside from the scrapes upon your skin, you were mostly in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you began to stand back up onto your own two feet, you suddenly noticed that you were not alone, becoming aware of a someone...mostly human in appearance, as she pulled down her white hood from her head, revealing what and who she truly was underneath her white &amp; pink hooded cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her head, she was sporting medium-length pink hair, which was shorter at the front, but her hair was longer in the back, tied up in a pretty magenta pink/red ribbon bow, looking at you with a pair of purple eyes. As for the outfit she wore underneath her hooded cape, the girl was wearing what appeared to be a custom-made princess dress, the kind that would be fitting for a Disney Princess, as the dress had multiple colors onto it's design, which include pink, magenta pink, white, and a sliver of yellow around the chest &amp; waist area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what made you question your sanity a bit was when you saw what the girl sported on the upper sides of her head; A pair of pink furry dog ears, along with a fluffy dog tail sticking out from behind her, where you noticed the pink furry appendage wagging for a second there. Judging from her appearance and her clothing, you had to guess that whoever she was, she was some sort of princess at the age of 18, maybe a little older...you weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Nice to meet you. You must be the Hero that was summoned to our world.\"</span> She said to you, her voice sounding a little too cheery, almost as if she was the one who dragged you here. And yet, the weird part of it was that her voice sounded like she was a few years younger than she initially appears to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Wait a sec, you're the one who dragged me down here?!\"</span> You answered, as You quickly summoned your smoke powers once more, as you aimed your left hand toward the dog-like girl, ready to use Smoke Shot, obviously not happy from what she did. But as the smoke and embers swirled around your left arm, the canine girl could see that you were not exactly in a bit of a good mood. After all, you just got yourself pulled inside a swirling vortex and just fell from the sky within the past 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Wait! I understand that you must be greatly frustrated from what has just occurred, but hear me out for a minute, would you?\"</span> She replied, fully aware of your current mood, judging from how...hostile you became toward her just now. However, from the way she was...pleading for you to listen to what she had to say, you let out a frustrated sigh, as he snuffed out the smoke and embers on his left hand via shaking that limb twice, then looked at the doggy girl and answered, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Fine, Ms....whoever you are. You got 60 seconds to explain yourself and why you yanked me out of San 'Fran.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Thank you. My name is Millhiore Firianno Biscotti. I am a princess from the Biscotti Republic, and of course, I was the one responsible for summoning you here to our world, Flonyard.\"</span> She said, both introducing herself to you and explaining to you on your current location. This eased you up somewhat, making you less hostile toward Millhiore due to her giving you an honest answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Well, at least I'm getting some answers. So...what's with the dog ears and tail, Milliore?\"</span> You asked, obviously mispronouncing the canine princess's first name, prompting her to speak up and answered, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Actually, it is pronounced Millhiore, Sir Hero.\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Okay, first off; my name isn't 'Sir Hero', it's Ash. Ash Krieg.\"</span> You said, correcting  Millhiore about your name, preferring not to being called \"Sir Hero\". Besides, it sounded too prissy for your tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"My apologies. Anyway, as for your question about my ears and tail, I, as well as my own people, are Biscottians. We are almost the same as your race...minus the dog ears and tail, of course. *giggle*\"</span> Millhiore replied, giggling a bit, since your jaw dropped a bit from finding out that there was a real living race of dog people, just as you shut your mouth as she spoke to you and asked, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Now allow me to do the same. When you held out your arm and pointed it toward me, smoke started swarming around your limb. What is it, exactly? Is it one of the Emblem Arts?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Emblem what? Wait a minute, did you mean my smoke powers?\"</span> You said, quickly understanding what the canine princess meant when she saw a glimpse of your Typhokinesis. In response, she nodded yes twice, confirming what you said just seconds ago.</span></div></div>",

Thank you for escorting him here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Wait a sec, your that dog's owner?\"</span> You asked, noticing how friendly \"Tatsumaki\" was toward Millhiore, as it went back down on all fours, while the Biscottian Princess stood back up to look at you and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"I apologize for the interruption, but yes, I am Tatsumaki's owner. Now then, you were saying about your, um....smoke powers?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yeah, well. You see, I'm not...a normal human, princess.

Now I don't know jack about what these Emblem things are, but from where I'm standing, it looks more like magic in my opinion.\"</span> You answered, obviously never heard of the Emblem Arts until now. But from wheat you've been through, you could see that Millhiore had some power in her, if she was able to \"summon\" you into her world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Now, I understand that you must be confused as to why I've summoned you here, but...\"</span> Millhiore said, as she calmly approached you, right up to the point where you were merely inches away from her, getting a good comparison at both her height and your height. <span class=\"cppink\">\"...Will you please hear me out upon our current situation, and lend us your aid?\"</span> Millhiore asked, finishing her sentence, using both of her silky gloved hands to hold onto your left fingerless gloved hand, subtly pleading for your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although you were known to be a rebel in the eyes of law enforcement, you were best known as a \"rebel with a conscience\" in the eyes of the public, due to your work as a vigilante.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short moment later, you looked at the Biscottian Princess in the eyes and answered, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Millhiore, I-\"</span> Unfortunately, before you could fully answer her question, you both heard what sounded like several loud thunderous booms off in the distance, interrupting you and grabbing the attention of both you and Millhiore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring out the source of the noise, Millhiore looked out toward a nearby valley in the distance, where a fortress stood with a large castle positioned almost a few miles away. You followed her, noticing what appeared to be several large white explosions above the fortress. Out of concern, she said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh no! It has begun!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"What's begun?! Are you saying that your people are in the middle of a war?\"</span> You asked, connecting the dots as to what was going on.

You weren't sure why you were doing this, but...there was something about Millhiore that attracted you. Whether it was out of being attracted to her or because of your own conscience, you made up your mind on what to do, as you had Millhiore look at you and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Alright, Milly. If you really desperately want my help in stopping these Galette jackboots, then I'll help.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words from your mouth raised Millhiore's spirits a great deal, causing her to hug you tightly, wrapping her arms around your neck and replied, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh thank you, Sir Ash! Thankyouthankyou!\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yeah, you can say all the thank you's you want later, Milly. But right now, we got a battle to win!\"</span> You said, reminding the Biscottian Princess that there was still a war going on, as she let you go from her embrace and answered, <span class=\"cppink\">\"You're right, Sir Ash. And I happen to know a way to quickly reach the battlefield.

After all, this was one of the things you did when you were taking down several of the local gangs in San Francisco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure on what you meant, Millhiore apple to you and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"What do you mean, Sir Ash?\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"What I'm trying to say here is how many soldiers do they have? Do they any other forces besides their foot soldiers? Who are the commanders of this invasion? You know, those kinds of questions. I mean, I've only been on your world for at least a few minutes, and I need to know how dangerous these Galette guys really are. After all, a friend of mine once said 'keep your friends close, but your enemies closer'.\"</span> You answered, just as you both sprinted down a winding pathway along the cliffside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"But why would keep your enemies closer, Sir Ash? Should it be the opposite?\"</span> Millhiore said, obviously had never heard of that phrase before until now. In response, you did a quick facepalm on yourself and answered, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"It's an old human proverb, Milly. It means you need to know your enemy before you attack him....or her. Well, you know what I mean!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh. I see. Well, here we are!\"</span> Millhiore replied, as the two of you stopped in front of what appeared to a large bird. From your perspective, it was most definitely bigger than the largest bird on Earth, the Ostrich. From it's appearance, it had these cream white feathers, with a large yellow beak with a pair of sapphire blue eyes. Around it's neck, it had these pink ribbons that acted like reins on a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it turned it's head and noticed you both, letting out a bird caw toward the two of you. Thinking it was hostile, you readied your smoke powers once more, but before you could open fire on the avian creature, Millhiore stopped you and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"It's alright, Sir Ash. She's a friend.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Your friends with a giant....bird?\"</span> You replied, cocking an eyebrow in a skeptic tone. After all, you've seen some weird stuff, but this definitely took the cake on your end. In response to your skepticism, Millhiore approached the large bird, stroking it's left wing and answered, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Mm-hmm. Her name is Harlan, and she is my Cercle, Sir Ash.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I'm guessing you and your people ride on these things, then?\"</span> You said, starting to understand piece by piece that this place was different from Earth. From there, you saw Millhiore hop up onto Harlan's back, mounting the giant bird like a horse, just as you saw the Biscottian Princess emit some sort of glowing pink energy into Harlan, making the giant bird creature glow a pink hue for a moment or two before the glowing died down and returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Millhiore did however, was giving her Cercle the ability of flight, as Harlan fully spread her wings out. From there, Millhiore extended a silky gloved right hand toward you while holding onto Harlan's reins with her left hand. Seeing it as a gesture to get onto the Cercle's back with her, you grabbed Millhiore's right hand with your own, as you got yourself sitting on Harlan's back behind the Biscottian Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Millhiore used the reins to guide Harlan toward the edge of the cliff, where the dog-girl of a princess turned her head to look at you with her purple eyes and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Now, if I were you, I would best suggest you hold on tight, Sir Ash.\"</span> Expecting what was going to happen next, you hers Millhiore's words of wisdom and held on tightly, bracing yourself for what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like you had thought, Millhiore commanded Harlan to fly, as the giant sprinted toward the cliff edge, wings spread out, where it leapt forward and started flying at around 150 to 200 miles an hour. While flying above the battlefield, Millhiore....</span></div></div>",

Surprised by this dark reminder of human history, Millhiore gasped a little, then spoke to you once more and asked, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Humans actually...k-kill?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"*sigh* Unfortunately, yes. You can say that this is one of the main reasons why I use a chain as a weapon, at least it wasn't designed to kill someone, like a sword or a gigantic axe.\"</span> You answered, noticing how the Biscottian Princess stuttered when she was saying the word \"kill\". After all, you couldn't blame her for being nervous about that infamous four-letter word. However, you noticed that she started to calm down some, now aware that you weren't going to be pulling any fatalities anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Thank you.

But then, as you and Millhiore dismounted Harlan, a set of double doors opened just 16 feet away from where you were currently standing. From there, you saw some movement from behind doors, only to reveal....</span></div></div>",

Judging from their physical appearances, they were definitely Biscottians, as you noticed the dog ears and tail on each individual maid. However, you took notice of one of the maids, who appeared to be the leader of this squad of maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dark pinkish hair, that was tied up in the back of her head, wearing a short-sleeved version of the maid uniform. And yet, unlike her fellow maids, her eyes were closed, sporting this happy-looking-no-matter-what-situation-may-occur smile on her face. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Princess, we are glad to see you have safely returned.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Yes, I am to see that everyone in Firianno Castle is alright, despite my short absence, Rizel\"</span> Millhiore replied, happy to see that the castle hasn't been attacked yet. But then, Rizel turned her head in your direction, becoming fully aware of your presence, then spoke to the Biscottian Princess and asked, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"My Lady, is this who I think it is?\"</span> <span class=\"cppink\">\"Indeed, Rizel. This young man standing beside me is the Hero who was summoned to our world. His name is Ash Krieg, and I must inform you and your fellow maids, he has these...intriguing abilities. The type of abilities that are drastically different from the Emblem Arts.\"</span> Millhiore answered, informing Rizel and the 5 maids behind the dark pinkette Biscottian of your smoke powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Ash, allow me to introduce you to Ms. Rizel Conchigile, the leader of the Princess Maid Squad. They are not just responsible for the castle's maintenance, but also for my heath and safety.\"</span> Millhiore, said, introducing you to Rizel and her team, as well as explaining what their occupation is, precisely. In response, you spoke to Millhiore and replied, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"So, they're basically your maids slash bodyguards in a nutshell, huh? Hmph, now that's an interesting idea.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Yes, it is a unique concept. Now then, we need to have you prepared for your debut as the Hero of Biscotti, Ash. My maids will have you don the armor.\"</span> Millhiore answered, as she grabbed you by your right wrist, preparing to take you inside, so Rizel and her fellow maids could outfit you in some armor. However, despite seeing that this world has made war an equivalent to a competition, you were aware that Biscotti was losing ground. Someone had to turn the tide of this battle. Fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Look, I understand that the wars you have are different from the ones on Earth. But with all due respect, your highness: I don't have time to get myself into a suit of armor right now! Someone's got to stop Galette from advancing any further.\"</span> You said, declining on getting yourself suited up in heavy armor, as you got your wrist free. Unfortunately, you noticed that the Princess Maid Squad wasn't going to let you off the hook, as Rizel pulled out her dual rapiers and replied, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Oh no you don't, Sir Ash! You are going to get yourself outfitted in a suit of armor, willing or forcefully!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Alright, Ash. Since you seem this eager to aid us, I understand.\"</span> Millhiore said, surprising not just Rizel and her fellow maids, but you as well, causing Rizel to retaliate a bit and replied, <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Princess, what are you doing?!\"</span> <span class=\"cppink\">\"Rizel; Ash truly wants to help our people in this moment of desperation, so I'm allowing him to do so. After all, as we speak, the Galette Lion Army is slowly advancing toward Firianno Castle.\"</span> Millhiore answered, sounding both serious and calm simultaneously, surprising you at how understanding she was of your intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Thank you, Millhiore. I won't let you or your people down, and that's a promise!\"</span> You said, nodding your head once, thanking her for letting you loose. However, just before you were about to do a full-on sprint jump from the castle, Millhiore then spoke to you once more, as the Biscottian Princess replied, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Ash, wait a minute! I almost forgot to tell you something, it's important.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Willing to listen on what she had to say, you stopped, turned around, and asked, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Alright, I'm listening.

But please, be very careful when facing her, she is a ruthless warrior.\"</span> Millhiore answered, giving you vital information about who was the head honcho of the invading army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her words, you looked at the Biscottian Princess and replied, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Thanks for the advanced warning, Milly. This will help me out in case I go up against her. However, can you do something for me?\"</span> <span class=\"cppink\">\"Of course! What do you need?\"</span> Millhiore asked, willing to give you support in the upcoming battle. So, you spoke to her answered, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"If you have some way of communicating with your soldiers, tell them that I'm gonna need them to start some fires. As for why I'm saying this. You see, my powers are abundant but finite, which means I would eventually run dry if I use them too much, so I need to recharge them from absorbing sources of smoke, like from a roaring fire. Believe me, if you can do that, it will be worth it in the long run. Do you understand what I'm saying?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Of course. I think I understand what you are telling me, Ash.\"</span> Millhiore said, getting a better understanding of your smoke powers, displaying that trademark caring but understanding smile of hers toward you, causing you to let out your infamous smirk and replied, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"I appreciate it, Millhiore Biscotti. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some Galettean tails to twist!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you ran into a full-on sprint once more, perform a running leap off of the terrace. At first, Rizel and her fellow maids thought you were crazy. But when they saw you use your powers and performed the Smoke Dash, as your body turned into a wispy cloud of smoke and embers, accelerating your momentum and speed, the Princess Maid Squad was shocked to see your powers in action, just as you reformed your body in mid-air and used your Smoke Thrusters to glide down onto the ground with a bit of a thud, where you sprinted toward the front lines of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, the voluptuous Galettean known as Leonmitchelli Galette des Rois, stood there with a calm and almost ominous tone in her posture, crossing her arms, looking at her forces succeeding, as she thought, <span class=\"cblue\">\"Soon, this battle will be over. And yet, I almost feel sorry for Biscotti Republic. Sorry, Millhiore, it's nothing personal, it's merely diplomacy.\"</span> However, just as it seemed like an inevitable victory for the Galette Lion Army, Framboise Charley, the male Galettean battle broadcast announcer, appeared on the floating cube monitors and said, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Well, it seems that Princess Millhiore has an announcement to make. Any guesses on what this announcement might be? Only one way to find out. Ladies and gentlemen, Princess Millhiore Biscotti!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as you used a combination of your parkour skills, Smoke Dash, and Smoke Thrusters to traverse the landscape, making your way to the front lines, you heard Princess Millhiore's voice over the speakers, as she spoke to her people and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"People of Biscotti! I understand that we have been suffering loss after loss upon the battlefield, well I say no more! Because now we have a Hero! Ladies and gentlemen, allow me, Princess Millhiore Firianno Biscotti, to introduce you all to our country's Hero, Ash Krieg!!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, just as she said your name and the \"cameras\" honed in on your current location, you were currently fighting against 7 Galettean foot soldiers, using Sulfur Bomb to stun half of their numbers, where you used Smoke Dash to get up close and personal, as you used your chain as a whip, smacking and bruising the stunned Galetteans, knocking them out and turning them into furballs, where you then fired off Smoke Shot to your left a few times, blasting smoke and embers in their faces. Then, you used Smoke Dash once more and delivered a haymaker to the face on a larger Galettean, using your chain like a set of makeshift brass knuckles, knocking the big cat-man out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your handiwork gave the Galetteans a shocking surprise, while it gave the Biscotti forces a big helpful boost in morale, especially how fast you were in taking down that squad of Galettean soldiers.

It was there that you saw the fighting skills of the famed Biscottian Knight known as Laurent Martinozzi, as the warrior with dog ears fended off the Galettean foot soldiers using a shield in one hand, but a lance in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, one of the Galettean soldiers got through, with the intention of attacking the armored warrior from behind. Sure, you could see that the Biscottian Knight was wearing some metal plated armor, but you were all too familiar of the infamous backstab. So, with no time to waste, you started sprinting toward the Galettean \"assassin\", firing off a few Smoke Shots from your left in the process, as the smoke &amp; ember projectile hit the feline assailant right in the face, stunning him, coughing from accidentally inhaling the fumes from your Smoke Shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you used Smoke Dash once more, closing the distance between you and the soldier, as you reformed and quickly used the extra momentum to instinctively grab the Galettean soldier by his neck with your right hand, performing the notorious \"Choke Slam\", knocking the soldier unconscious from the surprise blitz attack, as he turned into a furball with cat ears and a tail, just like his other fallen comrades<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the skirmish was over, Laurent turned around and noticed you, as he approached you and said, <span class=\"ctan\">\"Judging from your appearance, I assume you must be the Hero that the Princess has summoned, the one they know as Ash Krieg?\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"The one and only. You may know my name, but I don't know yours.\"</span> You replied, confirming your identity to the Biscottian Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Laurent Martinozzi, at your service. I am the leader of the Biscotti Knights. Has the Princess been able to explain to you about the other rules in this current war?\"</span> He answered to you, explaining who he was and asking you a certain question. However, what he asked made you rub the back of your neck, thinking you might've made a mistake, and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yeah, I was sort of in a rush to get to the front lines, since you guys were getting forced back from their advance. I mean, I saw how bad things were when Milly flew us here in the first place!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"That's alright. I can understand that you seem to have taken this conflict of ours much more serious than others.\"</span> Laurent answered, understanding your reasons for being in such a rush in the first place, as well as noticing how serious you took this conflict between Galette &amp; Biscotti. In response, you stopped running the back of your head, looked back at the Biscottian Knight, despite him being a few inches taller than you, and replied, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yeah, you can say it's a long story.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before you could say anymore, the two you heard the sound of several dozen Galettean soldiers heading your way, as they were starting to appear on the other side of the battlefield, forcing both you and Laurent to face the invading forces approaching, then you spoke to the Biscottian Knight and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"And speaking of the devil, what do you say we show these felines what happens when they try to kick down this country's front door?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes, it would seem like the best strategy as of now.\"</span> Laurent replied, readying himself to attack, as you crack the knuckles on your hands before getting ready to unload your powers onto the oncoming Galetteans, as smoke and embers swarmed around your arms, ready to dual-wield your Smoke Shot ability.</span></div></div>",

Although you were making an impression upon both sides, you were currently more focused on what was happening around you, as you fired off several Smoke Shots from both hands, aiming at a number of Galetteans from different directions before switching your Smoke Shot ability back toward your left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Sir Ash, behind you!\"</span> Laurent said to you, warning you of a heavyweight Galettean wielding a large two-handed sword, charging toward you from behind to deliver that perfect downward strike. Fortunately, you noticed just in time, as you quickly used Smoke Dash to get behind him, just as his giant sword swung down and hit the ground on impact, making this guttural clang noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as he missed, you jumped on top of the large Galettean swordsman, delivering a few hard punches to his face from behind, where you then wrapped your chain around his neck like a metal noose. From there, you jumped off and used the momentum to yank your bulkier opponent down toward the ground hard, knocking the big guy out cold, causing him to turn into a slightly larger furball due to his physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after taking down the big feline, you used a combination of your powers, skills, as well as using that chain of yours in multiple creative ways, to take down most of the Galettean soldiers, since a few of the surviving warriors started to have a change of heart, just from seeing you taking down their comrades with such ease, as they retreated back down the route they used to get here, forfeiting the skirmish with you and the Biscottian Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, judging from how efficient you were, I am guessing this wasn't your first time in actual combat, Sir Ash?\" Laurent said, glad to see that Millhiore summoning you as the Hero of Biscotti was worth the effort. In response, while you wrapped the industrial chain around your right arm to sheath it, you spoke toward Laurent and answered, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Back in the city I called home, I was, and still am, a vigilante. In case you don't know what I'm saying, it means that I'm someone who fights crime outside of law enforcement. So yeah, this isn't my first song &amp; dance when it comes to fighting other people.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming a little surprised of your previous occupation, Laurent was also slightly confused by your answer, so he asked, <span class=\"ctan\">\"Outside of law enforcement? If your intentions were to 'fight' crime, wouldn't your world's peacekeepers be willing to help you?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"It's....complicated, Laurent. Look, as much as I really want to answer your question, I need to see if I can help help your nation win this battle!\"</span> You answered, but just as you were about to sprint off in the same direction as the retreating Galettean soldiers, Laurent spoke to you and said, <span class=\"ctan\">\"And how do you plan on helping my people succeed, exactly?\"</span> To answer his question, to turn your head, looked at Laurent with a serious look on your face and replied, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Simple; I'm going after the leader of this invasion! I think you know her better as 'The White Lioness of Galette'.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurent already was aware of who you were talking about when you spoke of her notorious title, but it took him by surprise, seeing as how no other Hero before you would simply just go for the leader first, making the Biscottian Knight think that you were either intelligent, reckless, or just plain crazy. So in response to your answer, he spoke to you and replied, <span class=\"ctan\">\"You must be either an intelligent Hero, or a crazy one, Sir Ash.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"*chuckle* What can I say? I am one CRAZY Hero, Laurent Martinozzi.\"</span> You answered, playing off of your Autistic side of your personality. After all, even though you were diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age, you thought of your mental disorder as one of the unique aspects of your personality. However, just as you were about to sprint off into the distance...</span></div></div>",

And two, you needed to recharge your smoke powers. After all, if you were going to take the fight to the infamous White Lioness of Galette, you were going to need to use every Smoke power in your sulfuric arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face the Base Camp, you noticed a well-lit fire, with small wooden logs as it's fuel source, where you walked toward the flaming pile of burning wood, speaking back toward the Biscottian Knight and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"I'm guessing that the Princess did send you a message about starting some fires, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Actually yes, she did. Though I am unsure why our dear Princess would have this...odd request, be carried out, Sir Ash.\"</span> Laurent replied, just as you stood merely several feet away from the roaring flames. From there, you moved your right arm and hand out in front of you, as you began to absorb the copious amount of smoke fuming from the flames. The manipulated wisps of smoke channeled through your arm, swarming around your right arm somewhat, as the smoke and embers were absorbed into your body, refueling a bit of the energy you spent from the skirmishes against the Galetteans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurent had a look of both surprise and curious intrigue from seeing you absorbing the smoke like a sponge absorbing water, as you stopped feeding from the flames. From there, you turned around as Laurent spoke to you and said, <span class=\"ctan\">\"I have beared witness to many strange events in my life as a Knight, Sir Ash. But you....you are something...unique.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Well, I aim to impress, Laurent. Anyway, is there anything I should know before I deliver Leonmitchelli a serious beatdown?\"</span> You said, asking Laurent if there was anything ahead that you needed to be aware of before charging in. In response, Laurent looked at you and answered, <span class=\"ctan\">\"My younger sister, Eclair, should be beyond the trail those Galetteans used to approach and attack us. She is the vanguard keeping the main Galettean forces from passing. I am guessing a few of them managed to avoid her attacks, seeing as how we encountered merely a few dozen foot soldiers. You should recognize my sister by her short green hair and blue eyes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Thanks. If your sister might be in some trouble, I'll see if I can help her out.\"</span> You replied, as Laurent responds with a single nod, watching you sprinting down the same trail as the retreating Galetteans from earlier, using a combination of your skills in parkour and you smoke powers to quickly traverse the environment at a rapid pace.</span></div></div>",

Enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, as you just made your way out of the forest trail, you felt an explosion go off a foot or two away from your left, the concussion of the blast was enough to knock you off your feet and land hard on your front. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Agh! What the hell?!\"</span> You said, quickly grabbing the side of your head a bit, just you heard this ringing noise from being too close to the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the ringing subsided, just as you heard the voice of a certain Galettean, where she spoke to you and answered, <span class=\"cblue\">\"So, you must be the Hero known as 'Ash Krieg', hmm? You have become quite the nuisance in Galette's efforts to succeed.\"</span> Upon hearing that voice, you quickly stood back up onto your own two feet, ready to face your opponent. But it was there you heard Framboise announce something important and said, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"She's here! Ladies and gentlemen, your Queen, the White Lioness of Galette, Leonmitchelli Galette des Rois!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing what Framboise had said, it was there that you realized who your attacker truly was; the White Lioness of Galette herself, Leonmitchelli Galette. And just like what Millhiore had said to you earlier, the legendary Galettean sported silver-white hair, cat ears, &amp; tail, looking at you with a pair of golden yellow eyes, wearing what appeared to be a blue and black armored trenchcoat, as well as a white corset top, displaying both her womanly curves and large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"So, you're the infamous White Lioness of Galette, Leonmitchelli, huh? Let's see if you live up to that nickname of yours. Come on!\"</span> You replied to Leonmitchelli, where you fired off a Cinder Missile at the albino Galettean, which she barely dodged in time, leaving some burn marks on her trenchcoat, starting the fight between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation to your first strike, Leonmitchelli quickly pulled out her trademark battleaxe, charging at you with the heavy melee weapon, while you use your smoke powers to increase your speed, leaving a trail of smoke and embers behind you, as you sprinted toward the white-haired Galettean, ready to take the fight to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Firianno Castle, Millhiore saw what was occurring upon the giant cube monitors, clasping her silk gloved hands together, praying that you would be safe as she thought, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Ash...please be safe and win this fight.\"</span> Meanwhile, just as you and Leonmitchelli clashed, you knew you had to disarm the notorious leader, for this was not just a one-on-one battle between you and the White Lioness, it was also a fight between speed &amp; agility against sheer strength and power, as you avoided her downward swing with that two-handed battleaxe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, even though she didn't look the part, but you can see that Leonmitchelli had a lot of strength in her, just from seeing her handle that large battleaxe as if it weighed around 10 pounds instead of 50 to 70 pounds, making you realize that you had to hit her hard and fast, along with staying light on your feet, using your Smoke Dash to dodge Leonmitchelli's incoming attacks, flank her from the sides, and delivering a few jabs before Smoke Dashing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as she was up to your strategy and tripped you, causing you to stumble and unintentionally rolling on the ground a few times before stopping, Leonmitchelli charged toward you, battleaxe in hand, ready to deliver the apprehensive blow, you forced out both hands toward her, charging up your Smoke Shot, turning it into a knockback ability called Cinder Blast, hitting her at point-blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the concussion of your Cinder Blast, it caused the battleaxe to be forcefully knocked out of Leonmitchelli's hands, sending the heavy melee weapon flying until it was planted firmly into the rocky ground several hundred yards away, disarming the notorious White Lioness of one of her weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, before she had time to react, you quickly used Smoke Dash to get some distance from her, as you quickly jumped back up onto your feet, looking back at your deadly opponent. Getting over the sense of surprise, Leonmitchelli looked back you with a pair of yellow eyes, just as the two of you slowly circled around one another and said, <span class=\"cblue\">\"Impressive. There are a rare few who were capable of disarming me of my battleaxe. If only you were allied with Galette, but that is no longer an option.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yeah well, beggars can't be choosers, L. However, I can say this though; By the end of this battle, One of us will be standing. While the other shall fall.\"</span> You answered, quoting a remixed version of Optimus Prime's quote from the first live-action Transformers movie, just as Leonmitchelli quickly pulled out her sword to quickly strike you down, barely dodging a few of her swings, cutting through your green 7up T-shirt a few times before you instinctively used your chain to block the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you quickly wrapped the chain around Leonmitchelli's arm, twisting the limb to her back, an delivered a solid left kick to the albino Galettean's back, knocking the sword out of her hands, as it made this metal clang noise when it hit the rocky ground you both stood on. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Well, it seems that Ash is giving the White Lioness of Galette a run for her money!\"</span> Framboise said, just as Leonmitchelli called for her black-feathered Cercle, where she then mounted up and had her avian mount gallop toward the direction of her main forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you weren't having none of that, as you sprinted after and yelled, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hey! You're not going anywhere, lady! We're not done yet!!\"</span> From there, you quickly shot off a few Smoke Shots from your right hand, hitting the black Cercle in the left leg to slow it down, where you then used Smoke Dash to ram into Leonmitchelli, knocking her off of her avian mount. Unfortunately, by the time you did so, you and your female opponent were at the top of a rocky hill, causing the two of you to violently tumble down the gravelly hill, still engaged in some intense close-quarters combat, along with giving both sides some tense and concerned stares as to who will win this deadly stalemate, as you and Leonmitchelli exchanged blow after blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the intense chase/fight ended as you both landed hard against the rocky gravel, causing this giant cloud of smoke to cover both you and Leonmitchelli, as the two of you kept fighting. Nobody was sure who was winning this intense duel. But in the end though....</span></div></div>",

Ash has defeated the unstoppable White Lioness herself!! BISCOTTI HAS WON!!\"</span> Framboise said, his reaction in both extreme shock and surprise, not expecting you, the underdog, to beat a living legend like Leonmitchelli Galette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this sort of news and seeing what has occurred on the floating cube monitors caused every Biscottian, whether soldier, civilian, or royalty, to start cheering from this shocking victory, as you stood over the unconscious Leonmitchelli, bearing a few minor injuries across your body. Some of them were bleeding cuts from the White Lioness' sword, other injuries were several bruises from either exchanging fist blows with Leone, or from both you and the albino Galettean tumbling down the rocky hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, one thing's for sure; you were most definitely banged up from your fight with Leonmitchelli. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Well, at least my scuffle with her allowed Biscotti to win the fight.\"</span> You said, breathing heavily from your injuries, as you turned around and started to slowly limp away from Leonmitchelli's unconscious body, due to your right leg getting a few bruises on the outer thigh, giving you some nasty muscle pain from hitting the rocky hillside during the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, around ten to fifteen seconds later, Millhiore along with Laurent and his sister Eclair, managed to find you, just as you noticed them. From there, Millhiore, glad to see you were alright, ran ahead and hugged you out of relief as she said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Thank goodness you're alright, Ash!\"</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Nngh! Aaagh!!\"</span> You growled, reeling some from the pain, prompting the Biscottian Princess to instantly let go of you from hearing your painful yells, as she looked at you in concern and asked, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh my! I'm so sorry, Ash! I didn't realize you were in pain.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"*sigh* Yeah, I thought that me slowly limping away would be enough to warn you, Milly.\"</span> You answered, still having that sense of humor of yours. But then, just as she was looking at how much damage you've received from your fight against Leonmitchelli, Millhiore quickly noticed something happening with the sword cuts on your chest; they were healing! Sure, the healing process was slow, but it was noticeable, and seeing this gave her quite a surprise, as Millhiore backed away a bit and said, <span class=\"cppink\">\"Ash, your wounds! They're...they're-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Healing? *sigh* Yep. Like I said to you back when we first, Milly; I'm not a normal human being. As a Metahuman, my body's able to heal itself from wounds that can make a man bleed out. Those cuts on my chest will be gone within half an hour, though my bruises will take at least an hour or two to heal, since bruises are merely just damaged muscles. So yeah, I'll be fine. It's just going to take a short while for me to recover, that's all.\"</span> You answered, doing your best to reassure Millhiore that you were going to be alright, putting a right hand on the Biscottian Princess' left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eclair and her slightly older brother Laurent looked at both you and Millhiore, with the tsundere Biscottian looking at the two of you and said, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"So, that's our country's Hero?\"</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes, sister. From what we had witnessed, it seems that our Princess's plan has succeeded, even if Ash's abilities are....different than expected.\"</span> Laurent answered, leaning his lance against his right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unlike her 21 year old brother, the 18 year old Eclair crossed her gauntlet-covered arms, with a cold serious stare aimed at you like daggers, as she spoke to Laurent and growled, <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Hmph! Even if he did give us this victory, I still don't like this 'Ash Krieg', brother.\"</span> <span class=\"ctan\">\"Maybe, but this is always how you usually react when it comes to meeting new people, Eclair.\" </span>Laurent replied, knowing his sister's personality and behavior toward meeting new people. However, back on your end....</span></div></div>",

I cant help but wonder what it would be like to be in that world.\u201d</span> And as if on cue, you heard a cat call to you and you noticed it had a dagger and letter on its back. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHello little one.\u201d</span> You took the letter and noticed it was addressed to you.

Sounds fun. How do we get there?\u201d  But in response the cat stuck the dagger in the ground and some kind of seal appeared on the ground. \u201cWhat the?\u201d You felt the power in that seal, and you knew it would lead you to that world you kept hearing of. You would be a fool to pass this up, and once you gathered a few things, including some ninja gear, you decided to jump into the seal, and in an instant you entered the realm of Flognarde. As you descended you noticed a huge city near a beautiful ocean, and you seemed to be heading towards some kind of castle. Judging from the view alone this world was pretty peaceful. You then noticed a platform that was rising out of the sea. You landed onto the platform but you had some kind of magic around you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell that was a first.\u201d</span> You stood up and dusted yourself off, but then you noticed someone walking towards you. She seemed to be a beautiful woman with lovely yellow eyes, silver hair, and much to your surprise cat ears. You even noticed the lion-like tail on her. \u201cThis is getting more and more interesting\u201d you thought to yourself. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWelcome, my hero\u201d</span> she said extending her hand.

And I promise you I wont disappoint.\u201d</span> She smiled and took you to get geared up for battle, giving you armor and a ring that had the weapon called \u201cEx Machina\u201d inside it. Leone told you it could become any weapon you desired. And to match Shinku you first made it a staff. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cA similar weapon to Biscotti\u2019s hero.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI may be good with a staff, but my preference is the sword.\u201d </span>As if responding to your request it became a blade, and as you held it, it was easy to wield, the length perfect and the hilt wasn\u2019t too shabby. As one of the maids for Leone tried to place a helmet on you, you, you refused it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSorry, but helmets aren\u2019t my thing.\u201d</span> Leone smiled. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNow then, be ready for my call.\u201d</span> You nodded and she walked off to broadcast your entry. And as soon as three of her warriors were knocked out for now, Leone started her broadcast. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s been too long, Shinku Hero of Biscotti.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYour majesty!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve come back stronger.

The hero of the Galette Lion Army!\u201d </span>A platform was raised but to the crowd\u2019s confusion you weren\u2019t on it. But as the fireworks began to go off, you stood on one of the sharpened walls of the stronghold and moved to the pillar, showing of your flexibility and ninja skills. Even swinging the sword in a way to show your skills and landed on the platform, fireworks still going off. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI was summoned by her majesty, Leone. My name is Sasuke Uchiha, here to fight as Galette\u2019s hero!!\u201d</span> As the crowd roared in excitement, the princess Millhiore had introduced Rebecca to the crowd and things resumed. You went in blazing with your sword heading to Shinku to test his skills. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShinku, here I come!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\"Sasuke!\"</span> You looked and noticed Leone riding a bird. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Get on!\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"With pleasure.\" </span>you said as you jumped onto the bird.

Sure enough you and Shinku were running side by side to get some space for the two of you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShinku, I gotta admit, the wars here sure are a lot of fun!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI know right?

And the battle had begun, the announcers even focusing on your battle for a bit. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good Shinku, but I\u2019m gonna step it up a bit!\u201d</span> you said as you pushed him back and landed a kick that send him sliding back. The first thing you did was change your staff into a sword now that you knew he could handle it. The two of you were giving off so much energy that both sides were taking a small hit from the first around you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI must admit, Leone is strong and beautiful, and the Galetteans are very kind to me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAnd all the Biscottians are kind and fun\u2026\u201c</span> you both jumped in the air and clashed <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to introduce you and Becky to them all later\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSounds good\u201d</span> you said as you both landed on the ground. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut before all that\u2026\u201d</span> The emblem of Galette appeared behind you.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cI\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d</span> he said as Biscotti\u2019s Emblem appeared behind him. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cWin this battle!\u201d</span> you both said as you fired each others Emblem Cannon at each other <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNeptune Water Emblem!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cInfernal Fire Emblem!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cFull power!!\u201d</span> Both of your attacks had about ten smaller ones coming form your hands and they collided with each other, causing a huge blast. Of course the attack was basically raining attacks on both sides of the area, meaning that both armies took a hit there. Needless to say, Becky was more than a little surprised by all this. Once the dust cleared you were ready to fire again, Shinku was not. But due to Rico on Shinku\u2019s team, and Vert on your own, both yours and Shinku\u2019s armor were destroyed by magical rounds and arrows. So the two of you were temporarily knocked out of the fight, which was just at the time it was the official lunch break for the war. And the thought of that kind of thing alone made you like this world even more, the fact wars are so civilized here you can actually have a lunch break. But then before things could get started again, The whole thing was interrupted by a 3rd country, Pastillage. Apparently this was a race of squirrels this time. And the princess, who was pretty young, form the look of it she was about 12 years of age, wanted Rebecca to be her county's hero. And that\u2019s when things really got interesting.</span></div></div>",

Our plan is to simply defeat both Pastillage and Biscotti, but I wonder what our hero will decide.</span>\u201d <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cI personally want to get Rebecca back.

At first Biscotti and Galette went to fight each other, but when the impressive airborne mages took out a good chunk of a few formations, it became a team-up against Pastillage, so it was apparent you and Shinku stopped your battle for the moment. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOur fight\u2019s on hold, let\u2019s go rescue Becky together!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span> But Calloway, the captain of Pastillage\u2019s army, arrived on a bird. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cExcuse me, honored heroes. Rebecca is valuable to my master. So I cant let you pass.\u201d</span> He said taking to the air and began to attack you both. But you could easily avoid it, but in the air he shot at you, but Shinku blocked it with an attack of his own. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you Shinku.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cSasuke, can you use Bright Power Gear?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWatch and learn. Materialize the emblem and gather your Bright Power.

Water formed a pillar around you and you were riding on top of a bright gear that are like shark, and rode it like a board. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAlright! Galette is the capital of water, blessed by both ocean and river. That\u2019s why I\u2026\u201d </span>you said as you jumped into the air attacking him. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWill be the surfing hero!\u201d </span>you said as you used the water to get airborne. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget me!\u201d</span> both you and Shinku worked together and destroyed Calloway\u2019s armor, forcing him to retreat. \u201cThat takes care of that, now to get Rebecca.\u201d you said riding your Shark Board you nicknamed \u2018Mako\u201d to get her back, however Couvert had announced you and Shinku ran out of time and Rebecca became her hero before your eyes. She even took to the skies on a broom like a classic witch. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh this is just getting more and more interesting.\u201d</span> you said with a smirk.

Her weapons were apparently magical cards that could either explode or rain some energy down on the enemy, in an attack known as the \u201cCrystal Magic Shock\u201d . It would seem Couvert had somehow taught her a lot in such a short time. Speaking of, Couvert was also in the fray riding a magic carpet. Assisting Rebecca in taking down Rico\u2019s anti-air force. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cGood work Rebecca! It seems my eyes didn\u2019t deceive me after all!\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThe controls on this broom are like a video game, I can easily get used to this.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLet\u2019s split up. I\u2019ll head to Galette, and you head to Biscotti.\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cRight.\u201d</span> The two split and Rebecca was closing in on Biscotti and Millhiore, but you and Shinku went after her. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cBefore that\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019ll have to fight us, Becky!\u201d</span> The two of you charged for her and prepared to attack, you even raised the water into a hill so the two of you could get airborne, calling on your emblems. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cInfernal\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNeptune\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"clred\">\u201cTwin God Fist!\u201d</span> both of you said firing a blast from your emblems, not as strong as the emblem cannon, but they are strong together. But Becky was able to dodge and continue her advance towards you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cShe dodged it?\u201d</span> <span class=\"corange\">\u201cExplosion Shot!\u201d</span> she said leaving two cards behind, right in front of you both. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDamn!\u201d</span> The two of you were each caught in an explosion and you both fell into the water below. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI did it!\u201d</span> Both you an Shinku got on your boards, both of your armors completely destroyed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShe\u2019s more skilled than I thought.\u201d</span> you said to yourself. Becky had attacked Millhiore and she in turn attacked Becky, but they ended up hitting each other, and both of their armors were destroyed. Couvert kept searching from the skies for Leone. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLeone come out! Fight me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for me, I\u2019m over here!\u201d</span> Couvert had a surprised look on her face seeing what Leone came into battle with. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cEek, Grand Vert?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s right! This is Galette\u2019s holy sword, Grand Vert, the demonic battle axe!\u201d</span> Couvert prepared to strike with her holy sword, which was currently in the shape of a gun. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Garnet Spark, full power!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEat this! Demon God Wind Slash Carver!\u201d</span> she said unleashing the power of Grand Vert with one swing. Couvert attacked as well, but unfortunately for her, was hit in the process. Leone on the other hand just sliced the attack in half and didn\u2019t get a scratch on her. Couvert crashed and slid right into the medical area, disoriented but unharmed. In the fighting that proceeded from there, the heroes were at the center of the excitement. And eventually the time was up, it turns out Galette was the victorious country, followed by Biscotti in 2nd place, and finally Pastillage in 3rd place. At the end of the day, after a large feast in celebration of Galette\u2019s victory, Couvert asked you and Shinku if she could keep Rebecca with her in Pastillage. The two of you agreed to it and Leone had something to discuss with Millhi and Couvert in a matter concerning the three countries, so the three of you were free to relax and do as you pleased. Even after the battle was done you knew the fun wasn\u2019t going to stop. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you, Leone.\u201d</span> She just smiled at you. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cCouvert, your ears are so cute.\u201d</span> Couvert giggled. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cPrincess.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cSay Shinku, would you take a walk with me in the morning?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cWe can bring Sasuke and Rebecca if they\u2019d like.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLet\u2019s all go!\u201d</span> You looked at the two of them. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOn a walk??\u201d</span> You didn\u2019t know what this would entail around here, but you would be entertained regardless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No killing of the MC or the girl of your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.If you have sex with the girl of your choice give me a warning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Unless it's the chaos option, I don't care about the name, but you need t make it seem like an anime name, or at least, go with something like  \"Shadow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.I will allow foot fetish and sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Normal will have you as the hero of the 2 countries, which means you can use their powers, HOWEVER you need to see the show at the very least and use powers like or EXTREMELY similar to the show to go with it, I will attempt some changes here and there to the chaos option. Also, the women will be AT LEAST 18 years of age <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Im adding a readers choice to add new powers. enjoy yourselves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. I would like it if you had the dialogue you have for your characters in different colorations please. makes things a little easier to read at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Have Fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
