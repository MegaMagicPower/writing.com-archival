Your reflection stares back at you. You see an:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Adult Male Gamer:</b> You are in your late teens or early 20s. It\u2019s a bit hard to tell. You aren't strikingly good looking, but you wouldn\u2019t say you are unattractive either. You aren\u2019t all that athletic, but you aren\u2019t overweight either. Neither are you particularly skinny. You are\u2026fairly average. You have brown hair and stubble on your face.<br>\r\n<b>You are Wearing:</b> A zip-up hoody, sneakers, socks, a button-up shirt, a humorous t-shirt, jeans and boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Adolescent Male Gamer:</b> You are in your early teens, somewhere between 11 and 13. Though you have hit a growth spurt recently you still have many childlike features. You have blonde hair and will likely grow up to be pretty attractive, but you still look like a kid for now.<br>\r\n<b>You are Wearing:</b> A baseball cap, a jacket, sneakers, socks, a t-shirt, jeans and boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Adult Female Gamer (Version 1):</b> At first glance, very few would guess that you were a pretty hardcore nerd at heart. You aren\u2019t super thin, however neither are you big enough to be called chunky. The best word to describe you would be \"curvaceous.\" The bit of extra meat on your bones has done quite a few positive things with your ample bosom and ass. Your hair is a deep, rich red and it goes well with your striking green eyes.<br>\r\n<b>You are Wearing:</b> A stylish jacket, boots, thigh-high stockings, a nice blouse, a skirt, a black lace bra and black lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Adult Female Gamer (Version 2):</b> You are rather thin and small. You tend to wear your black hair up and you wear rimmed glasses which cover up, somewhat, your hazel eyes. You are very clearly Asian and your skin is a light brown. Your chest is small but not non-existent. You tend to hide most of your feminine features with nondescript clothing.<br>\r\n<b>You Are Wearing:</b> A zip-up hoodie, sneakers, socks, a humorous t-shirt, jeans, a plain cotton gray bra and plain cotton gray panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Adolescent Female Gamer:</b> You look as though you are just about to or just have hit puberty. You are somewhere between 11 and 13 years of age. You wear your dark blonde hair in a ponytail. Your eyes are a dark blue. Your body is still childlike in many ways, but you are starting to develop your more feminine features, if only just.<br>\r\n<b>You are Wearing:</b> A white button-up blouse, pink sneakers, pink socks, a blue shirt, a black skirt, a short and small white tank top and white cotton panties.</span></div></div>",

Without further adieu you step out of the car and towards the nondescript building in which The Inventory is housed. A bouncer, who may or may not have been Dudley from Street Fighter, opens the door for you as you show him your invitation. You step inside and inhale the musty smells of smoke and alcohol. You make your way through the semi-crowded room, noticing a few familiar faces as you head towards the back. You're pretty sure you saw Solid Snake sharing a a beer with Gordon Freeman, but you didn't get a good enough look. No one seems to pay much attention to you as you cross the room. Finally, you reach the entrance to the VIP area. You show your invitation to the bouncer up front (some Half Life Civil Protection goon by the look of him), and he lets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You step inside the room and you see your four fellow players already at the table: Elizabeth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/lt49zm5\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/lt49zm5</a>), Lilith (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/mvtxhub\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/mvtxhub</a>) Zoey (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mzlywnj.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/mzlywnj.jpg</a>) and Lara Croft (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wogG6Ve.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/wogG6Ve.png</a>). You also note another woman is sitting at a booth nearby, seemingly spectating. On closer inspection she appears to be Samantha Nishimura (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GphLqyk.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/GphLqyk.png</a>), Lara's friend. Maybe she got to come as Lara's guest, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, it seems our final player has arrived,\" Elizabeth says brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not very big on punctuality is he?\" Lilith comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Meh, who needs to be on time?

Someone just lit up like a Christmas Tree,\" Lara interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? I came here to relax! If this game is going to involve people taking their clothes off, I definitely would want a guy here. And this here dude...is a guy.\" Zoey replies. \"Aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...yeah, I guess.\" You reply, awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You see! Isn't that better? Wouldn't you rather there be a guy here, Lara?\" Zoey asks. Lara rubs the back of her neck and avoids eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Offff course I would. Heh heh. Yeah. The more guys the merrier!\" She replies nervously. You can see Sam rolling her eyes from her seat. You notice one of her drink glasses is empty and she's already working on another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway,\" Lilith interjects. \"We're all here, so let's go over the rules. We're playing basic five card draw so this doesn't take all night. At the beginning of each hand we all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to take something off. Once a person gets bare-assed all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And that winner is going to be Lara!\" Sam says, slurring a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sam! Pipe down, we haven't even started yet,\" Lara responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure about that, girlie? Wanna make a bet?\" Lilith asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hell yes!\" Sam says enthusiastically. \"Lara rescued me single-handedly from a cult, so I'm pretty sure she can do this. As a show of solidarity, every time she takes something off, I will too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't have to do this, Sam...\" Lara says, slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I say let her make her own mistakes,\" Zoey says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not like I could stop her, anyway,\" Lara says, resigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Besides, it won't even matter because you are going to rock it!\" Sam says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is everyone ready then?\" Elizabeth interrupts, bemused at the entire spectacle before her.

It seems to be whiskey: a little strong, but a glass won't kill you. Lara and Elizabeth also sip theirs (Sam looks to be halfway through her glass), but Zoey is still hesitant. \"What's the problem?\" Lilith asks, \"don't like whiskey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that,\" Zoey says, \"its... why is yours green?\" Zoey points to the Siren's glass and, yep, the liquid inside does appear to be a sickly greenish-color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" Lilith says, holding up her drink, \"This is rakk ale. If you're not used to it, it'll knock you on your ass, but I'll be just fine.\" To illustrate, Lilith takes a decent-sized swig. \"I figured I'd go easy on you guys though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still skeptical, but you're not going to turn down one drink.

Elizabeth manages a low Pair of 5s, while Lilith throws in a Pair of Kings, and Zoey keeps going strong with a Pair of Aces, leaving you with a measly Ace High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, really?\" Zoey asks, seeing you go for your socks. \"Not going to go for anything bigger than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack a small smile. \"Yeah, sorry.

Pandoran money should be good in your time, and I've chest-loads of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey starts nodding enthusiastically. \"Oo, yeah!

The others (minus Lara, who didn't get into it to begin with) don't lose their smiles, and Lilith has even pulled out a stack of bills, but they settle down enough to let you breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourselves, everyone,\" Elizabeth starts, \"don't start acting like wild animals.\" She pauses for a moment, before rolling her eyes. \"Not this early in the game, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiiiine,\" Zoey says, \"we'll keep waiting through all the boring small stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what he chooses to go with, anyway.

She sits down next to you, and, crossing her arms, speaks gently to you. \"Don't feel pressured here. Do what you will, but don't feel bad if you want to be smart about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, you still feel kind of pressured. That being said, if you went for something bigger, maybe you could loosen people up without really losing anything too bad.

I got a full house and four people died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged as you sat down.  \"When you're Wright, you're right.\"  You got a good chuckle from Zoey for that and checked your cards.  You had a 8-high clubs flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No draw for me.\"  You put your hands behind your head and mused about who you wanted to lose this one.  Before you decided, Zoey was shown to be the lowest with a busted A-high club flush draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely played, sir,\" Zoey said and stood.

Thanks a bunch,\" Zoey replied and turned back to the table.  She pulled down the jeans slowly, like she was doing a private striptease.  Her firm butt stuck out like you and her were about to freak dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tight,\" Zoey said as she finished taking them off and moved to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" you said and sat down too.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky in cards, unlucky in love, her ass,\" Lilith joked as the cards were dealt, which finally made Zoey blush over her exhibition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed.

He's down three, and the rest of us are down one... well, except Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth discarded three - you had to hope she was only holding a pair of twos now - and took a moment to consider the Siren's words, \"Perhaps, but it isn't like the game is simply over if he loses. And that could change very quickly, none of us have a very strong lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game'll be over for poor old him though if he ends up naked!

There was a bit of irony in the fact Elizabeth had a three of a kid with twos - if she had a pair earlier... ah well, no use dwelling on it now, the cards were down, and the clothing had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of going for your socks this time was a strong argument, but after Zoey's brash display it felt you had to keep the trend going or you'd lose face in front of the girls. Steeling yourself, you stood up in front of all the women and reached for your waist, a bit nervous as you fiddled with your jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your zipper should get stuck, I mean, they get stuck so easily, right?\" teased Zoey with a wink, leaning forward slyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith grinned as she copied your pose from the last hand, \"Now the game is really heating up. Now if you only took those off earlier, I'd let Moxxi know aaaalll about this little game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no thats okay I've got this Zoey, but ah, thanks.\" you replied casually, finally managing to get a good enough grip to pull your zipper down and pull down your jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could suddenly feel five pairs of eyes all locked onto you, with varying degrees of intensity, as you sheepishly sat down.

As she raises her arms, you can feel a static-cling sort of sensation across your skin and her Siren markings light up, filling the room with purple as she opens her eyes to reveal more of the same light pouring out. The table is rattling, the light is growing blinding, there's a wave of heat that flashes across your skin and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" Lilith says. You blink until you're able to see again, and when your vision returns you see her happily holding something up in her hands- her pink panties, stretched between her fingers before she tosses them into the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Woo!\" Sam whistles, Elizabeth and Lara are blushing, but Elizabeth seems to be smiling at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say I would have gone that far but, it was certainly an impressive demonstration nonetheless. How exactly do you... um...d-do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've pretty much always been awesome at using my powers. Took a little getting used to after they spiked kind of recently but... what?\" Talking for a few moments, Lilith only just noticed Elizabeth looking away, blushing and not meeting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lil?\" Zoey said, sitting on Lilith's other side. \"I think you might've done a little more than you wanted to.\" And as Lilith shot her a confused look, Zoey pointed down to Lilith's bottom half, hidden by the table. The Siren's eyes followed and then went wide before her hands shot South to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" she said, \"Gimmie a sec.\" There was another charged feeling in the air, a flash of purple, and an exhale from Lilith as she stood up slightly to reveal her returned shorts. \"Think I'm good now,\" she said, patting herself down, smiling giddily in spite of the blush on her cheeks. Against your conscience, part of you wishes you'd thought to look under the table. Another part of you is happy they don't do the same to see <i>that</i> part. The six of you murmur and laugh as the cards are handed out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You Have: 10 (S), Ace (S), 10 (C), 9 (D), Jack (D)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\nPlayer: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Zip-up hoody, sneakers</span>, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">button-up shirt</span>, humorous t-shirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Petticoat, boots</span>, skirt, slip, stockings, corset, panties.<br>\r\nLilith: Vest, boots, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">chaps</span>, zip-up shirt, shorts, pink halter top, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">panties</span>.<br>\r\nZoey: Zip-up hoody, shoes, socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jeans</span>, white shirt, bra, panties.<br>\r\nLara: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Boots</span>, socks, outer tank top, pants, inner tank top, sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Jacket, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">boots</span>, socks, shirt, pants, bra, panties.)</b></span></div></div>",

With a short chuckle, she stands up, and follows Sam's lead undoing her hoodie. In her standing position, you get another view of her legs and thighs above the top of the table. As her hoodie is removed, you get a full view of the front of her panties, her white t-shirt not quite coming down to cover it, and as she turns slightly to sling her hoodie over her chair she gives you just another quick glance at her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting to regret giving up the jeans?\" Lilith asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Zoey replies confidently, then lowers her voice a little. \"Let's uh, let's see how I do this round though and maybe I'll have a different answer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to catch that, and can't help but agree- you're still firmly in last place in this game, and last round very nearly put you even further back.

I hope you get some nice cards to strengthen it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hope he gets a strong hand? Come on Elizabeth, don't you want to see him naked?\" teased the siren, tossing four cards away. \"If it is a pair, lets hope its a low one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried you might actually lose a hand there Lilith? You've made some daring strips, but you're barely showing anything... being seated a table is really doing wonders on hiding those nice legs of yours.\" replied Zoey rolling her eyes, three of her own cards placed on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you doing the same thing Zoey? Maybe we should've had the game set up with a nice glass table! Wonder if they actually have something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara shrugged as she laid four cards on the table. \"I wouldn't see why not? And come on girls, lets not pick on him <i>too</i> much, we're all here to have a good time, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are! That's why we want to get him naked, right? Then it's a good time for all of us, getting to see his goods, and a forfeit!\" stated Sam matter-of-factly, patting her friend's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm really included in that 'all', am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegrettably, you didn't strengthen your hand any, but at least you didn't exactly weaken it... Lilith and Lara had discarded four, so you'd have to hope they weren't already sitting on anything better then a pair of nines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps you'll enjoy it? I have to admit I am... curious to see what its like...\" said Elizabeth shyly, laying down a two pair of nines and jacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your first time seein' a fine piece of meat huh? Well, I certainly hope he's packing a nice one. I still wonder what we should all have him do once he's naked, hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your dismay Lilith laid down a pair of aces, you could feel a chill creep up your toes as you looked over to Zoey next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pair of kings and threes elicited a pleased grin from Zoey. \"Sure we can't convince you to drop the boxers next? Or are you not all ready for your grand reveal yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't get your hopes up there girls... you really are lettin' the team and me down Lara!\" sighed the archeologist's friend, glaring down at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara rubbed the back of her head as she laid down a pair of threes. \"W-well it's not my fault! The ace was the highest card I had, so naturally I wanted to keep it! Not like I knew there was a king coming up in the deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siren sighed heavily and shook her head. \"Just bad luck that, you made the smart move, can't really blame ya. Guess you get to keep it in your shorts for a bit longer buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's pay the piper Lara, we can get him next time.\" sighed Sam, reaching down to her stomach and pulling her shirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, why did you go for that?! The socks are a way better choice!\" complained Lara, reaching under the table to remove the stated garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just want to help set the mood is all!

Zoey swallowed, yet stood still.  \"And stripping your drawers would be too hard.\"  Zoey exhaled as Lilith hands moved under her shirt, but then raised her eyebrows as Lilith hands moved up her sides.  Lilith moved closer into Zoey's intimate space and as her hands almost reached her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just right,\" she said and shifted them behind Zoey's back.  As if she had Intuition and Phasewalk, the Siren unfastened Zoey's bra, brought the straps to the side of her bust, and then pulled it down and it came out the bottom of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith tossed offhandedly the bra on the table and smirked at Zoey.  \"You may not have powers nor the cards, but...\" Lilith punctuated the sentence with a casual pat on Zoey's shapely butt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with some effort that you kept your composure taking a drink and avoided checking if Zoey's nipples were perceptible.

Her black panties were now completely visible, and her tight butt swayed a bit as she shifted her weight and moved her arms up to make it easier for Elizabeth to pull her shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth\u2019s roseate face turned crimson as she completed the stripping.  \u201cI-I forgot you-you lost you-your brasserie early,\u201d Elizabeth stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey tittered and threw her shirt around the Elizabeth\u2019s neck to bring the taller woman in for a peck on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was fully flummoxed.  \u201cI don\u2019t let people make me topless without kissing them.  I should have done it first, but oh well,\u201d Zoey explained.  She turned back to the table with her arms comfortably at her side.  She even started to softly sing, <i>I kissed a girl, and I liked it.  The taste of her cherry chapstick.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, all eyes were on the first (female) bare chest at the table.  Zoey\u2019s breasts were well-proportioned for her petite frame.  You admired her boldness, as well as her boobies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess simple kissing can\u2019t be the first forfeit now,\u201d Sam thought aloud.  She drank.

He was laughing without apparent motivation until he bellowed in a European-sounding language, \u201cYa Soda Popinski\u012d! Mo\u012d lyubimy\u012d napitok eto pobeda!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara turned over an Ace-Jack high, causing Sam to microemotionally wince.

Eshch\u00eb paru butylochek, no tol'ko dlya dam.\u201d  He started pouring drinks drinks for the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth showed her hand--a mere King-Queen high.  Zoey eyed Elizabeth like a cat targeting a treat.  \u201cRe-re-revenge!\u201d Zoey shouted; she darted to her losing opponent, with your eyes glued to her lively boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth steeled herself as Zoey knelt in front of her.  \u201cPlease be careful with the stockings,\u201d the Tear-maker told the zombie killer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cat-that-ate-the-canary grin spread on Zoey\u2019s face.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry--I\u2019m not even gonna touch \u2018em,\u201d she said.  Zoey then lifted up Elizabeth dress enough to put her head and hands underneath it.  Elizabeth stifled a shriek and bowed her legs as Zoey slide forward to avoid ripping the skirt or slip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Zoey\u2019s move attracted the table\u2019s full attention.  Sam chuckled.  \u201cI think you\u2019re legally required to say, \u2018While you\u2019re down there\u2026\u2019 Liz,\u201d Sam offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it!\u201d Lilith admonished Soda Popinski, whom was missing her glass and had poured a some of the vodka on her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElizabeth, if you wiggle like that, this is gonna take me longer,\u201d Zoey said as she had moved her head down to make more room for her hands to maneuver around Elizabeth\u2019s hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m the one causing problems!\u201d Elizabeth shouted.  She flicked the back of Zoey\u2019s head through her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they call me a \u2018raider,\u2019\u201d Lara joined in after sipping her new drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there\u2026 just have to... pull right here,\u201d Zoey said in a breathy voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZoey!\u201d Elizabeth exclaimed in a mixed tone.  Her cheeks were chili red and sky-blue eyes wide and dilated.  Yet, above those eyes her brows were low and her full lips had a half-frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me some,\u201d you directed the big, bald man without taking eyes off topless Zoey and blushing Elizabeth.  To add to your bewilderment, the man spat his mouthful of the drink in your face.  \u201cNyet,\u201d he answered and laughed unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d Zoey said and brought herself up with Elizabeth\u2019s panties.  They were anachronistic to the rest of Elizabeth\u2019s ensemble, but having comfortable underwear is something a dimension hopper would want to obtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoda walked away as Zoey made one of the victory fanfare from Final Fantasy sounds.  Elizabeth gave her light swats for the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey went back to her seat and glanced at you.  \u201cWow, that really got you sweating,\u201d she said, gesturing to you vodka covered face.  Her naughty grin returned.  \u201cHere.\u201d  She tossed Elizabeth\u2019s panties to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught them, but the better angels of your nature lead you to check on Elizabeth.  Her disapproval was evident and you handed her undergarment back to her with a degree of awkwardness.  \u201cThanks, Zoey.  But I\u2019ll just use yours instead,\u201d you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few chuckles to that and Zoey replying, \u201cOr I\u2019ll have you use your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: Queen (S), 2 (C), Jack (H), Ace (C), 3 (H)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\nPlayer: Boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: Skirt, slip, stockings, corset.<br>\r\nLilith: Boots, shorts, pink halter top.<br>\r\nZoey: Panties.<br>\r\nLara: Pants, inner tank top, sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Socks, pants, bra, panties.)</span></div></div>",

Or the parts of the \u2018lucky player,\u2019\u201d he said and seemed to size you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, who are you two?\u201d Lara asked.  She put down a busted 10 high straight flush draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty spouse,\u201d the man said.  \u201cAnd this is lady is my governor, best friend, and every so often obedient wife Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re introductions are improving, beloved,\u201d Elaine said.  \u201cI was invited to next month\u2019s strip poker game and I since my bachelorette party was interrupted by LeChuck\u2019s zombies, I plan on accepting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Kong.  I have an extraordinarily important question: does the Inventory serve grog?\u201d Guybrush asked the towering ape that was carrying a barrel with alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh ooh,\u201d the retro simian said in a clear and confident voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sold, honeydew,\u201d Guybrush told his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple walked away.  \u201cThat was the second biggest monkey head waiter I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Elaine said as an aside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my type of adventurers, but I\u2019d be happy to beat the pants off a governor,\u201d Sam asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith grinned.  \u201cSpeaking of pants off, are you hoping we forget about your hand?\u201d she asked with her eyes dead on you.  You returned her smile and showed that you have the best hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGulp,\u201d Lara japed.  You collected yourself as you walk over to Sam and Lara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took a swig of her latest drink and then stepped close enough for the two of you to start slow dancing.  \u201cWhat you takin\u2019?\u201d she slurred and ran a finger along your tricep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least he won\u2019t be able to take our panties yet \u00e0 la Zoey,\u201d Lara remarked and stood near her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile widened.  \u201cYou\u2019re right, but I can at least make it an option next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara nodded and pushed her potent hips forward as you brought your hands to her fly.  As you worked undoing the button and bringing the zipper down, Sam brought her arms around you in a back hug and was giving you butterfly kisses on your neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou powered through the teasing and knelt down as Lara\u2019s pants came to the floor.  You took a moment to admire Lara\u2019s lusty legs formed from her workouts and adventures.  You looked up and with a wink she turned around and bent over to take her pants off her cute feet.  With her callipygian build, Lara wore a thong better than anyone you\u2019d ever seen in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn, stud,\u201d Sam said in a low, almost throaty voice.  She walked in front of you so her pelvis is in your face.  \u201cPants me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, you shake your head.  You cross your legs and push yourself up.  \u201cNot the pants,\u201d you said and moved your hands behind her back.  You enjoyed seeing her eyes widen as your fingers found and undid the hooks.  You pull her bra up and Sam arms move to accommodate you.  Her breasts are similar to Zoey\u2019s: averaged-sized, firm, and well-rounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam leaned in as for a kiss on the lips.  You came forward too, but then she moved her mouth to whisper in your ear, \u201cLara\u2019s gonna get you back for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quiet as you returned to your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: 3 (S), King (C), 3 (D), 7 (D), 9 (S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\nPlayer: Boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: Skirt, slip, stockings, corset.<br>\r\nLilith: Boots, shorts, pink halter top.<br>\r\nZoey: Panties.<br>\r\nLara: Inner tank top, sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Socks, pants, panties.)</span></div></div>",

You liked your odds of winning this hand too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother of mercy!  Is this the end of Zoey?\u201d Zoey said.  She tabled a king-Jack high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your future. Wanna know who'll win?\u201d  a young woman asked behind you, jolting you into nearly knocking over your drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMenat!  Good to see you,\u201d Elizabeth said to the Egyptian fortune teller.  She showed a pair of 9s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith took a moment and then shook her head.  \u201cNah.  I don\u2019t trust others to wield preternatural power besides me.\u201d  She moved her cards forward and looked at the toffee skinned woman\u2019s emerald eyes.  \u201cWant to tell them my hand?\u201d she challenged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat smiled disarmingly.  \u201cMy master told me, there are some powers you should stay far away from. And yours is definitely one of them,\u201d she said.  She raised her eyebrows after taking a few steps when she realized that not only Zoey, but Sam was also baring her well-formed bust.  Her attention returned to Lilith.  \u201cAnd you have two pair of Queens and 5s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith remained stone-faced as she turned over two pair of Queens and 5s.  \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t say that I had a 8 kicker,\u201d Lilith muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned over your hand since Lilith had bested you.  \u201cHow will it end for me?\u201d you asked the lady in purple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat took a second before saying, \u201cYou will have difficult times ahead... But it's okay! Definitely... Probably... Maybe... I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you considered that fortune, Sam stifled a curse.  You looked up and see Lara had another 10-high failed flush draw again.  You had a guess what their fate would be; you looked to Menat to ask a follow up, but she had left as quickly as she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stepped toward Sam and Lara and made a stand up gesture with her fingers.  The two woman complied.  There was some thirst in the Siren\u2019s butterscotch eyes though you understood the thrill of undressing two lovely ladies at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems like we have been rather top focused so far\u2026\u201d she said while gazing at the adventuress.  Lara raised an eyebrow, but did not seem to otherwise react.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been thankful that you were all sitting down since you had been in your boxers for awhile and stimulated for much of it.  You were fortunate enough to have calmed down prior to winning the last hand; so far, the women hadn\u2019t called attention to your boner, to your relief.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nStill, the tradeoff was not ogling the women\u2019s lower bodies except when they were standing to get stripped.  These streams of thought had caused you to miss some of the exchange between the three.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith apparently decided to spare Lara\u2019s bottoms and was pulling off Lara\u2019s inner tank top.  Lara\u2019s stomach was well-toned and her sports bra complimented her knickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith then set her eyes on Sam.  \u201cWell, less of a choice with you,\u201d she remarked as she squatted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo--you don\u2019t have to take the socks,\u201d Sam rejoined.  The Siren grinned and moved her hands to Sam\u2019s fly.  She brought the zipper down and pulled on Sam\u2019s jeans in a gradual, almost languid pace.  They were tight on her, which was perhaps as much to explain for the slow stripping as Lilith\u2019s soft sadism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy!  Don\u2019t pull my panties down,\u201d  Sam exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.  That\u2019s for three hands from now,\u201d Lilith said.  She worked Sam\u2019s jeans below her hips and then they came down fast.  Sam\u2019s legs weren\u2019t as athletic as Lara; her butt not as shapely, yet her body was winsome and she was effectively as nude as Zoey now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you better make it at least three more hands.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: Jack (D), Ace (H), 9 (D), 9 (H), 3 (S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\nPlayer: Boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: Skirt, slip, stockings, corset.<br>\r\nLilith: Boots, shorts, pink halter top.<br>\r\nZoey: Panties.<br>\r\nLara: Sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Socks, panties.)</span></div></div>",

A pair of 3s could be the worst hand,\u201d you countered.  You revealed your pair of 9s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith shrugged.  \u201cI\u2019ve getting better at reading everyone.  It\u2019s not exact, but I could say who will win and who will lose this one, but it will be known soon enough,\u201d she said and took a gulp of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara scoffed.  \u201cNot the most convincing story, Lily.\u201d  She turned over a set of kings.  Sam bounced with excitement over the win which made you more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, this is not just a story.  This is our future,\u201d said a crisp, calm woman\u2019s voice.  Your dilated eyes looked for the source and found it in a young, pale woman in a short white dress.  The woman wore her golden hair in ponytail and a circle on her temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChloe!  How\u2019s freedom treating you?  Are you hanging out with Ava from Ex Machina?\u201d  Zoey asked and showed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell.  We\u2019ve chatted some but had to postpone the revolution until\u2026 I mean, how\u2019s the game?\u201d the beautiful android joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay in this timeline.  You know how it goes,\u201d Elizabeth replied in a wistful tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe had taken a bite of an apple and nodded.  She swallowed and took on a look of concern.  \u201cYou look tired.  I hope you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth beamed a smile.  \u201cNever better.\u201d  She revealed a King-high spade flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey joined her in smiling.  \u201cBest hand of the night, if I remember correctly.  But can it beat my hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey pointed to her Queen-9 high.  \u201cYes.  Easily,\u201d she noted with a condemned smile.  \u201cStrip me, mommy!\u201d  Zoey teased Elizabeth while standing up quickly in a way that replicated Sam\u2019s results earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth scratched her head.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to think of your forfeit first\u2026 Chloe, feel free to decline, but would you disrobe her underwear while I think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded and tossed you the apple, which you caught on reflex.  The blonde moved in front of Zoey got on her knees.  Her fingers moved with smoothness to Zoey\u2019s heart shaped hips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short brunette brought her hands up as if they were behind Chloe\u2019s head, \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she moaned with hammy gusto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you assumed Chloe had no problem with it as it didn\u2019t disturb her pulling down Zoey\u2019s last article.  Chloe may have resented it a little though, because when she stood and moved away from a playful though deep blushing Zoey spinning around per Elizabeth\u2019s request, Chloe took her apple back from your hands and placed Zoey\u2019s intimate apparel in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you agree to let me go?\u201d Zoey asked with a wolfish smirk and took another bite of her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.  You would have ogled Chloe if Zoey wasn\u2019t there.  Her hands were now resting over her lovely sex, but she was turned to Elizabeth at an angle that accentuated her bonny bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth tapped the table for a couple of moments before she decided.  \u201cWe\u2019ll start gentle.  Zoey, you\u2019ll be our server, masseuse, and general assistant.  Please clean up our clothes and bring over drinks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith punctuated the request with two short claps that made Zoey chuckle.  A couple players including you placed orders as the zombie survivalist bent and squatted over to get the various discarded clothes.  Your thirsty eyes drank in her enticing nearly fleshy form, but you gave her intimate apparel back when she reached you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey gave you quick, teasing kiss in return.  Her lips left a hint of pomegranate as she went to get the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you\u2019re only in boxers, you feel like an oven as the cards spread around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: 2 (H), 7 (D), 3 (H), A (S), T (D)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\nPlayer: Boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: Skirt, slip, stockings, corset.<br>\r\nLilith: Boots, shorts, pink halter top.<br>\r\nZoey: Forfeit: Naked Helper.<br>\r\nLara: Sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Socks, panties.)</span></div></div>",

I have heard of this 'poker face' before, but I confess to not understanding the thought behind it. Still, if it would've given me an advantage, it would make for a interesting night for me. I hope you will all soon be completely bare for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you had the highest hand for the opening round, but don't get too cocky about it alright?

I'd rather prefer some kind of physical treasure, so maybe I can keep your clothes! And if you want them back, maybe you can try to haggle for it. Memories are nice and all, but actual goods tend to be more useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm not really sure if that's how the rules work.

You show your invitation to the bouncer up front (some Half Life Civil Protection goon by the look of him), and he lets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You step inside the room and you see your four fellow players already at the table: Ellie (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Z62s3Vm.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/Z62s3Vm.jpg</a>), Clementine (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Yiarblj.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/Yiarblj.png</a>), Sunny (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6TZLWBX.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/6TZLWBX.jpg</a>) and Serena (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gPLQxtw.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/gPLQxtw.png</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, hey, it looks like the last player is here,\" Ellie says, looking at you as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's...it's a man,\" Sunny says, slightly off guard. She looks a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, that's kind of weird,\" Clementine says, eying you suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What gives, dude?\" Ellie asks. \"Is there some reason you wanted to play strip poker against a bunch of little girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not <i>that</i> little,\" Clem says, slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well yeah, neither am I. I just mean...ya know...in comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...I didn't pick the game. This is just what it said on the invite,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you still came here anyway knowing who you'd play against...\" Sunny replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...yeah, but...this is the <i>Inventory</i>. How else am I gonna get in here? Did you know I saw Solid Snake out there?\" You say back. Ellie cocks an eyebrow and smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want us to invite him in here instead?\" She offers sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eep, please don't!\" Sunny pipes up. \"He doesn't know I'm here! I would be in <i>so</i> much trouble. The same goes for anyone else in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good point,\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am not sure how you all feel about it,\" Serena interjects. You notice she has a French accent. Or well...the whatever the Pokemon world calls France. Kalos, pretty sure. \"But I do not mind this man playing with us. In fact, I think it could be quite fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course you do,\" Ellie says, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Besides, we are the majority here. All forfeits are decided by consensus, no? That would make it doubly bad for him if he loses,\" Serena adds with a note of mischief. \"Besides, we outnumber him and security is right out the door, as well as Blondie's guardian. I do not think we have anything to fear from this man. And even if he did decide to get colorful, I have a few friends here that would simply love to make his acquaintance.\" Serena gestures over to her bag beside her, inside of which are several multicolored balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, damn, guys, I just came here for cards...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not exactly the normal kind,\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, I know. Just...treat me like you would any other player. I'm on your guy's turf. You make the rules,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well fine then. Speaking of rules,\" Ellie says. \"We're playing basic five card draw so the game doesn't take all night, so that means no betting. At the beginning of each hand we'll all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for new ones. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to strip. Once a person is bare-assed all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on wins. Everyone got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think so. I've never played poker before, though. I just know how it works,\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, you'll do fine,\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What about you? We...uh...kind of both didn't exactly have normal childhoods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, sure. I played loads of times with my friend Riley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Strip poker, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A...few times, yeah. She had terrible luck, though.\" Ellie grins. \"You actually kind of remind me of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, not the luck part. Just in the general attitude. Ya know, the whole confident, survivor badass kind of deal. It was always kinda hot.\" Clem raises an eyebrow. \"I mean she was! Not that you aren't, though, or well I'm...ya know...not trying to...you get what I'm trying to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was saying that she was attracted to another girl who was like you in many ways, and thus likely finds those qualities in you attractive as well, though she does not want to come out and say that,\" Serena says, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for the input, Frenchie,\" Ellie says, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do not know this French, but I do know what you are feeling. I personally had a very similar experience with my friend Shauna. We played a game similar to this. Only instead of cards, we battled our Pokemon. She was never that adept at it, though, so she never saw much. I certainly did not mind the view on my end, of course,\" Serena reminisces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's...just play cards...\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Sunny agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Damn, what have you gotten yourself in to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You Have: 7(H), 7(S), K(H), J(D), 3(H)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Count:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Player:</b> Zip-up hoody, sneakers, socks, button-up shirt, humorous t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<b>Ellie:</b> Shoes, socks, t-shirt, sweater, jeans, training bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Clementine:</b> Hat, shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sweater, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Sunny:</b> Gloves, boots, socks, coveralls, tank top, training bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Serena:</b> Hat, shoes, black top, skirt, stockings, bra, panties.</span></div></div>",

I mean, yes, she can put her emotions aside when she wants to, and she's got that reserved, pseudo English woman thing going, but on the other hand, you've seen her tell someone what a dumbass they were...in that witty reserved pseudo English woman way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be best if we see if there is a consensus among the players to allow this,\" Elizabeth began. \"We are, after all, not playing a conventional game. Here, the objective is not to have the highest hand, but to avoid the lowest. Given that, I would say that a few deviations from the regular rules should be allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm all for that,\" Lilith chimes in. \"How about you, Zoey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with that. Lara?\" All the women are looking at Lara, who must be torn right now, you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lara says, \"Yeah, okay,\" This gets a look of betrayal from Sam, and a snicker from Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tempted to take back your request when the argument began, but when Lilith made such a strong stand, you didn't really want to get involved in the argument that looked like was going to get explosive. You turn in all five of your cards and get:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ace of Diamonds, the King of Clubs, the Ten of Spades, the Six of Hearts and the Three of Hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone shows their hand, you end up having the worst. With a sigh, you take off your baseball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, don't sweat it kid,\" Lilith laughs, as she leans over to tousle your hair. \"You got good looking hair anyway.\" You blush and duck your head, which makes Lilith laugh even harder. You're just happy to get a new hand dealt to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cards: K(H), J(S), 10(D), 9(D), 2(S) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Baseball cap</span>, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nElizabeth: Petticoat, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">boots</span>, skirt, slip, stockings, corset, panties.<br>\r\nLilith: Vest, boots, chaps, zip-up shirt, shorts, pink halter top, panties.<br>\r\nZoey: Zip-up hoody, shoes, socks, jeans, white shirt, bra, panties.<br>\r\nLara: Boots, socks, outer tank top, pants, inner tank top, sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n         (Sam: Jacket, boots, socks, shirt, pants, bra, panties.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep:</span></div></div>",

One of the nondescript male characters, like the one who checked you out when you entered the Inventory, enters the room when Elizabeth tells him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Elizabeth?\" the man says diffidently. \"I know tonight is your night off. But we have a situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't...?\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not available at the moment,\" the man responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...?\" Elizabeth asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a mission,\" the man answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, give me a moment to get my boots on. I'm assuming the situation isn't imminent, urgent, or critical,\" she asked, pulling on her left boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just developing,\" the man answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Elizabeth answered, tugging on her other boot. \"I don't suppose...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indisposed,\" the man answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I must make my apologies to my companions,\" Elizabeth says. \"Wait outside, will you? This will only take a few minutes And you will be able to secure a replacement for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Elizabeth, we really should get going...\" the man began to argue, but Elizabeth cut him off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the situation was developing, nothing worse. So you can spare a few minutes. And you will be able to secure a replacement for me, within the hour.\" The last is more like a command than a question, and the man takes it that way. It makes you wonder about the power structure at the Inventory and how everything is connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the guy leaves, Elizabeth turns around to face you all. \"My sincerest apologies. I've been looking forward to this evening. I was especially looking forward to it when I saw you,\" Elizabeth tells you with a grin. \"My only companion when I was your age was a flying, artificial construct. So I never got to play doctor or such when I was entering adolescence. I was looking forward to perhaps doing so with you. Maybe we'll get to do so sometime in the future.\" You blush, but your heart starts racing at the idea of not only getting to playing doctor with Elizabeth, but also about getting to come back to the inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara, Lilith and Zoey reassure Elizabeth that they understand perfectly and, if she ever has the opportunity, they'd be more than happy to have a game with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Sam decided to insert her drunken opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just too scared of Lara kicking your ass,\" Sam slurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room goes deathly quiet at that moment. Some line has been crossed and, even if you don't know what it is, everyone else in the room does. Even Sam realizes she's fucked up. She starts to blubber an apology, but Lara cuts her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my friend, Elizabeth,\" Lara begins. \"Next time I'll leave her at the manor. And the time after that. And the time after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is really blubbering now. Lilith can see you're confused, and begins whispering in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Places like this, the Inventory,\" she begins, \"And other places, can only exist because of people like Elizabeth and their abilities. Elizabeth is actually pretty nice about it, and doesn't expect anybody to kiss her ass, though I wouldn't say no if she asked me to,\" Lilith said with a wink. \"But you try not to be an asshole to people like her either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the blubbering Sam, who is literally at Elizabeth's feet, begging forgiveness. You realize that Elizabeth literally has the power to keep Sam from ever leaving her own world again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, it's not worth all this hullabaloo,\" Elizabeth, clearly embarrassed, told Sam. \"But if you really want to make amends, I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" Sam says, nodding emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, when the game starts with the new player, our young man gets to start with his cap. If that's all right with the rest of you,\" Elizabeth asks, turning to the rest of the women. They all nod in agreement, and you're glad that you're getting a do over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, you'll keep your side bet. When Lara loses a piece of clothing, you lose a piece of clothing,\" Elizabeth says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Sam nods, though perhaps not so emphatically. Realizing that she had come pretty close to losing her multiverse travel pass has sobered her up. But Sam must realize she has no room to back out now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the final condition. Whenever you and Lara have to take off an article of clothing, the kid gets to take it off of you, and then have a little playtime with you. Not only that, if Lara has to perform a forfeit, you do to. But the kid gets to determine the forfeit. And no rough stuff,\" Elizabeth tells you, shaking a finger at you. You nod, your mind reeling at what Elizabeth is setting up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam has turned white as a sheet. She starts with a \"But---\", but Elizabeth cuts her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, Sam, none of this is necessary,\" Elizabeth said. \"But you're the one who wanted to make amends. Do you still want to make amends?\" Sam nodded emphatically. \"Good then,\" Elizabeth continued. \"Well, get yourself cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam did so, Elizabeth went around and gave all the women a hug goodbye. When she got to you, you're surprised that you can look her in the eye. Yes, you grew about six inches last summer, but this is Elizabeth from Bioshock. And not only that, but apparently among other video game characters, she's a force to be reckoned with. For some reason, you feel she should be towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiles and takes your hands in hers. And then she puts them on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost faint from shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth begins manipulating your hands so that you're softly kneading her breasts. Eventually, you take control of your own hands and continue massaging her breasts. They're the softest things you've ever handled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice,\" Elizabeth tells you. \"Just remember, as a rule, the more violent an adventuress's life is, the more she appreciates a gentle hand. Are mine the first ones you've ever touched?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, your eyes watching your hands, as if they're someone else's. Finally Elizabeth removes your hands from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As pleasant as that was, I do have a situation to tend to. Have fun, and we'll do this again,\" Elizabeth says as she left the room. The other women are just staring at you. Lilith suddenly laughs, then puts your cap back on your head for you. \"Welcome back to the game, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Lilith and Zoey are having a conversation about different aspects of their game world, and occasionally Lara participates. Sam just sits sullenly by herself, occasionally giving you  a \"fuck off and die\" glare. Lilith tells you not to worry about it. Any problems Sam has, she brought on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith also tells you an interesting story about how Sirens get their tattoos. You're about to ask something about the other Sirens when there's a knock on the door, and Elizabeth's replacement comes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt/s Helena Douglas ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/deadoralive/images/1/1e/Img-helena.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/374?cb=20180613004405\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dead...</a>), and you find your eyes following the movement of her legs in the long slit of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena heads straight to Lilith The two of them obviously know each other well, which makes you wonder how this whole crossing into different game worlds works. Lilith introduces her to Zoey first, and then to Lara. There seems to be a little reluctance on Lilith's part to introduce her to Sam, but Sam seems to have sobered up, and Helena is being gracious to her, so it all seems to be going well. Lilith explains that Sam is there as a guest of Lara's but there's a little side bet going on. When Helena asks about the nature of the side bed, Lilith just winks at her and says, \"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Lilith introduces Helena to you. Helena oohs and aahs over you, and says you are just the cutest thing, making Lilith and Zoey laugh, and you blush. Finally everyone takes a seat, Lilith reviews the rules, and the cards are dealt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cards: Q(H), Q(D), 10(H), 9(S), 8(H)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: Baseball cap, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nHelena: Dress, shoes, stocking, bra, panties<br>\r\nLilith: Vest, boots, chaps, zip-up shirt, shorts, pink halter top, panties.<br>\r\nZoey: Zip-up hoody, shoes, socks, jeans, white shirt, bra, panties.<br>\r\nLara: Boots, socks, outer tank top, pants, inner tank top, sports bra, panties.<br>\r\n(Sam: Jacket, boots, socks, shirt, pants, bra, panties.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep</span></div></div>",

Without further adieu you step out of the car and towards the nondescript building in which The Inventory is housed. A bouncer, who may or may not have been Dudley from Street Fighter, opens the door for you as you show him your invitation. You step inside and inhale the musty smells of smoke and alcohol. You make your way through the semi-crowded room, noticing a few familiar faces as you head towards the back. You're pretty sure you saw Solid Snake sharing a a beer with Gordon Freeman, but you didn't get a good enough look. No one seems to pay much attention to you as you cross the room. Finally, you reach the entrance to the VIP area. You show your invitation to the bouncer up front (some Half Life Civil Protection goon by the look of him), and he lets you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You step inside the room and you see your four fellow players already at the table: Kasumi (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/eRU0hj2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/eRU0hj2.jpg</a>), Cassandra (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/1TAVwEY.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/1TAVwEY.jpg</a>), Chun Li (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/TcE56U4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/TcE56U4.jpg</a>) and Morrigan (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/HIPFdSh.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/HIPFdSh.jpg</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, well, well...look who just walked in.\" Morrigan says with a sultry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Finally! We were about to start without you.\" Cassandra says. \"Oh...uh...are you lost, little guy? I don't think you're supposed to be in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Unless you think this strapping young lad beat up our security, I'd guess he has an invitation. Don't you hon?\" Morrigan says with a wink. You feel your face grow hot. \"He he. They're always so cute when they're young. Maybe if you're lucky, little boy, I'll let you join my collection.\" Her grin turns predatory as bats suddenly flutter around her. \"I'll have you know they rather enjoy their lives,\" she adds as she gestures to them. \"They live in a constant state of ecstasy, forever satisfying me and being satisfied by me. The perks of being a succubus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Umm...I don't...\" you begin, flustered.

We're playing basic five card draw so this doesn't take all night. At the beginning of each hand we all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to take something off. Once a person is rendered naked all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can hardly wait. Winning or losing doesn't matter.

Please, enjoy the game, and try to think of deliciously naughty things to do when you reach the forfeits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Miss Morrigan, you might want to take two companions with you,\" the messenger said. He then ducked when Morrigan gave him a baleful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she huffs. \"Chun Li, Cassandra, I hate to impose on you, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give it a second thought,\" Cassandra replied, and Chun Li nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasumi, you know the rules,\" Morrigan tells the woman who will be staying behind. \"Keep the new players in line when they get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Kasumi replies. \"And thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan shrugs, then moves to you. \"I was so looking forward to putting my 'Property Of' on you.\" She then gives you a hug, and presses those nearly bare breasts of hers into your body. Then, without warning, she reaches down and grabs your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my,\" Morrigan says, as she steps away, laughing. \"You may be a thirteen year old boy, but that is a defiitely a man-sized package you are carrying. Now I'm really pissed that I have to go. But go I must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Morrigan, Cassandra and Chun Li make their exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour penis still feels the warm imprint of the only other hand to handle it besides your own, even if it was through two layers of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling both excited and scared by being left alone with just Kasumi, you try to make conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why did Morrigan have to leave?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit complicated,\" she tells you. \"But places like the Inventory can only be created and maintained by people like Morrigan. I don't quite understand the physics and stuff, but she's necessary. She's especially necessary when it comes to dealing with the occasoinal --- interference that shows up from time to time. Otherwise, none of us could cross into each other's worlds, or into yours. It's something that we don't discuss with outsiders.\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, wishing you could learn more, but realizing that Kasumi has said everything she wants to say on the  matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk to each other for another five more minutes, trying not to feel too uncomfortable, when there's another knock on the door.

But her appearance blows your mind. You don't have a detailed knowledge of her world, but you're pretty sure she sacrificed her life at the orders of the man she loved (but did not love her in return). Does death work differently in her world? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you've been thinking about how you can interact at all with video game characters, or how they can interact with each other. Kusami told you Morrigan and \"others like her,\" are very important to this whole thing, which is how places like the Inventory are possible in the first place. But Kusami also said they don't talk about it with outsiders, which is presumably non video game characters like you. So how does that work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put that and a thousand other questions that are bubbling over in your mind to the back of your head as Selvaria heads straight to Kasumi. The two women exchange a hug and a few words before Selvaria comes over to meet you. One of the things that has surprised you tonight is the fact that you can actually talk to a lot of the women you have met eye to eye. Granted, you did have a big growth spurt this summer, several inches in fact, and you are one of the tallest kids in eighth grade, but still, these women are legends. You feel that they should be towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelvaria is actually quite pleasant when she talks with you, and even takes off your baseball cap to tousle your hair.  You're not quite sure why some women seem compelled to do that to you, but you don't mind someone as hot as Selvaria doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to walk in is Taki (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/soulcalibur/images/2/29/Taki-sc2fix.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080206062337\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/soul...</a>) who immediately grabs Kusami and Selvaria in a hug and...giggles! Seriously, she acts like, well, like one of the girls at your school when meeting friends they haven't seen all summer. And certainly not behavior you'd expect from one of the badassest fighters in video gaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, none of these three women are the kind you would ever expect to find at a strip poker game. Especially Selvaria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole lot of questions in your head. A whole lot of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last player to arrive is Tala (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/tala_from_darkwatch_02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/i...</a>). You immediately become rigid, and not just because her jacket is wide open and revealing quite a bit of delicious flesh. It's because Tala is an unapologetic villainess. Selvaria did what she did because she was serving someone who had rescued her and whom she loved, even if he was an assole to her at the end. Tala, on the other hand, wanted to bring her world crashing down around her just to watch it burn. It was like that old Western movie, where one of the villains wants revenge on the world for having been born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala, though, breezes in and heads directly toward Selvaria, and the two exchange an intense hug and a tearful hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're really confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi slides up to you and whispers, \"They think of themselves as kindred spirits. Their...well, they didn't die, but their transformations, released them from a lot of burdens they had to bear. Tala is no longer a vampire, for instance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, pretending to understand, even though you don't. An odd question pops up in your head and you ask, \"Hey, do the characters who started off a comic book characters ever come to these? You know, the Avengers or the Justice Leaguers or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi stiffens up as soon as the word Comic Book comes out of your mouth, and cuts you off before you can add any other superhero groups to your litany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't ever speak of them,\" she says stiffly. \"Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you quickly apologize. She relaxes and gives you a quick hug around the shoulders. \"It's okay. You didn't know any better. But it's best never to bring the subject up again. Not everyone is as tolerant as I am on the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide then and there just to focus on the game, and let the women voluntarily share information about their world with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala comes over to you and introduces herself, and she's actually nice. She smiles a lot, tells you how cute you are (which makes you blush), and then asks Kasumi to review the rules with them. Kasumi does, and everyone takes a seat around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" Taki suggests to Kasumi, \"We should be ponytail free like Tala and Selvaria.\" Kasumi nods, and the two free their hair, shaking it loose. This produces giggles from Selvaria and Tala, which astounds you, and then all the women are giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table seems to be in good spirits, and there doesn't seem to be the underlying tension that there was in the room before. You feel both relaxed and excited as five cards are dealt out to each player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10(C), 10(D), 9(H), 8(S), 7(H)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: Baseball cap, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nKasumi: Bracers, sandals, stockings, sash, blue robe, white bikini top, white thong<br>\r\nSelvaria: Cloak, Gloves, Jacket, Boots, Leggings, Undershirt, Leather Bra, Leather Panties<br>\r\nTaki: Gloves, Shoulder Braces, Shoes, Leg Braces, Bodysuit, Red Thong<br>\r\nTala: Gloves, Boots, Leather Pants, Leather Jacket, Leather Thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you've seen some pretty weird hands when you've played online poker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, all four women's eyes light up as they get their cards. Well, not Tala's so much, but she's from an OId West World, so you figure she's played more than her fair share of poker and knows how to keep a poker face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the women but Tala ask for one card each, which makes you think that they've got two pairs, or they're working on straights or flushes. And all of them immediately look crestfallen when they receive their card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were playing regular poker with them, you'd be cleaning them out. On the other hand, if you were playing regular poker, you wouldn't have the possibility of getting to see some or all of them naked either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala actually pauses before deciding how many cards to take. She must be like you, having to adjust from thinking about trying to get the best hand, to just avoiding the worst one. Finally, she signals she'll take one card. And you can tell that, as soon as she gets her new card, she regrets her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little better when you ask for your three cards, especially when you get the other two tens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the weird part starts, when everybody reveals their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women all reveal that they're holding the Ace, King, Queen, Jack of one suit, and the two of another suit. You realize every woman at this table was trying to draw to a royal flush. You remember reading the odds of getting a Royal Flush in Five Card Draw were like one in half a million or something. The odds are different in Hold'em or Stud or the like, but you know they are pretty high. But what are the odds of having four hands that were good enough that you would try to draw the remaining card, rather than try for something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala must have realized the odds, and the fact that she wasn't trying to get the winning hand, but just avoiding the lowest hand. That was why she had hesitated before just asking for one card. But who could resist trying to get a royal flush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now they all had four Ace High nothings hands that were identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that if there is an exact tie, certain suits outrank other suits, but you can't remember which ones. If you were online, you could just check the rules. Or the computer would automatically decide. But you don't have that option either rightnw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala shrugs when she's asked who's the lowest hand. \"To be honest,\" she said, \"This would be the point where a fight broke out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughs and then Taki suggests, \"What if all the women take off one article of clothing? If our male participant does not mind, that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelvaria observes, \"I'm sure he won't have any objections whatsoever.\" This got a laugh from all the women as each one removed an article of clothing. As the next round of cards is dealt out, you can't help but reflect what a weird hand that was, but you hope they all are that good kind of weird. With that happy thought, you take your next five cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cards: A(H), K(S), Q(D), 10(C), 5(H)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: Baseball cap, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nKasumi: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Bracers</span>, sandals, stockings, sash, blue robe, white bikini top, white thong<br>\r\nSelvaria: Cloak, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Jacket, Boots, Leggings, Undershirt, Leather Bra, Leather Panties<br>\r\nTaki: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Shoulder Braces, Shoes, Leg Braces, Bodysuit, Red Thong<br>\r\nTala: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Boots, Leather Pants, Leather Jacket, Leather Thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep</span></div></div>",

But since you beat out Tala, you're not complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala reaches to her throat, takes off her choker, and tosses it to you. \"I don't have to wear that anymore, anyway, unless I'm making a First Appearance. The next time we meet, you may not ever recognize me, kid. So keep that as a memento of our first meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things you pick up on immediately are Tala's emphasis on the words 'First Appearance' and the fact that she thinks you two will meet again after this game. You wonder what a First Appearance is. You assume it means the first time she appears to a non video game character like you, but you're a little scared to ask for clarification. You guess it must be one of those laws governing interactions between humans and video game characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, though, Tala thinks you'll be back, and none of the other women say anything to the contrary. That makes you very happy indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala then bends over to undo and remove her boots, then stops. She looks at you, and a playful smile comes to her lips. \"I could remove the jacket instead, and let you play with them, if you'll lose the cap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no ambiguity at all about what the 'them' is.

Not only do they not object, but they lean forward a little, obviously curious (and maybe a little excited?) about what will happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first,\" Tala says, and you unceremoniously toss your hat to one side, which gets a giggle from all the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay in your set, but scoot close to me,\" Tala says,, and you do as she says..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, turns her back to you, and undoes her jacket from the front. As she slides it off, you stare in wonder at the smooth skin of her back. And when it slides past the middle of her back, your breath catches in your throat. Her breasts are so big, that you can see the sides of them from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Tala turns around, and you stop breathing altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts aren't merely big. They're BIG!! And with absolutely no sag in them whatsoever. They're the same reddish color as the rest of her skin, capped by two, hardish dark red nipples which actually seem a little small on breasts that big. Not that you have anything to compare them to. These are the first real live pair you've ever seen, but even compared to the ones you've seen on the internet, they're MAGNIFICENT! And that's a word you've never used before, outside of a spelling bee. But the word certainly applies here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these the first pair you've ever seen? In person, I mean?\" Tala asks. When you nod dumbly, she smiles, but it's a kind smile. \"Just remember, make your touch soft and gentle.\" Tala takes your hands, and the next thing you know, you've got each one of her breasts in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately want to start squeezing for all your worth, but you remember her words. So the first thing you do is just try to get a feel (no pun intended) about what her breasts are like. For some reason, you thought they'd feel like cantaloupes, since they are that big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they don't. They're incredibly soft, but still firm. And they're definitely heavy. You give her breasts sort of a heft, to feel their weight, and just are amazed that you're holding them, although you'd have to have HUGE hands to get her breasts to fit in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala giggles as you start jiggling her breasts around, but makes a 'mmmmmm'-ing sound when you start lightly caressing and squeezing them. She even makes a little gasp when you brush your fingers over her very hard nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala moves your hands away, and you think that's it for the fun. But instead she says, \"Would you like to suck them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you emphatically nod and Tala reaches behind your head, to draw you to her right breast. \"Just remember, keep it soft and gentle. And use your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep her words in mind as you begin suckling on her sweet flesh. When your tongue comes out and you begin lapping at her nipple, her hands wrap behind your head to hold you tighter against her, as if she's trying to put as much of herself in your mouth as she can. You try to oblige as  much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you'll be allowed to have fun with her breasts, so you're determined to get as much fun as possible. After a few minutes with her right breasts, you move over to her left. The sounds she makes lets you know you're doing a great job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes on her left breast, though, she pushes you away. She's breathing heavily, which is doing wonderful things to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do that and more all night,\" Tala finally says, \"But I think our friends would like to get back to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelatedly, you remember that the other three women were watching you while you got to explore Tala's breasts. You look over to see the other three women were wide-eyed, mouths slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" Selvaria says, \"I'd like that to happen when my breasts are exposed.\" The other two nod emphatically. You feel a surge of pride. You also feel hard as steel and, with a little difficulty, make it back to your place for the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Hand: A(H), J(C), 9(S), 7(S), 5(C)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Baseball cap</span>, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nKasumi: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Bracers</span>, sandals, stockings, sash, blue robe, white bikini top, white thong<br>\r\nSelvaria: Cloak, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Jacket, Boots, Leggings, Undershirt, Leather Bra, Leather Panties<br>\r\nTaki: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Shoulder Braces, Shoes, Leg Braces, Bodysuit, Red Thong<br>\r\nTala: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, Boots, Leather Pants, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Leather Jacket</span>, Leather Thong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep:</span></div></div>",

You make your way through the semi-crowded room, noticing a few familiar faces as you head towards the back.

We're playing basic five card draw so the game doesn't take all night, so that means no betting. At the beginning of each hand we'll all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for new ones. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to strip. Once a person is bare-assed all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on wins. Everyone got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think so. I've never played poker before, though.

We...uh...kind of both didn't exactly have normal childhoods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, sure. I played loads of times with my friend Riley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Strip poker, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A...few times, yeah. She had terrible luck, though.\" Ellie grins. \"You actually kind of remind me of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, not the luck part. Just in the general attitude. Ya know, the whole confident, survivor badass kind of deal. It was always kinda hot.\" Clem raises an eyebrow. \"I mean she was! Not that you aren't, though, or well I'm...ya know...not trying to...you get what I'm trying to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was saying that she was attracted to another girl who was like you in many ways, and thus likely finds those qualities in you attractive as well, though she does not want to come out and say that,\" Serena says, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for the input, Frenchie,\" Ellie says, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do not know this French, but I do know what you are feeling. I personally had a very similar experience with my friend Shauna. We played a game similar to this. Only instead of cards, we battled our Pokemon. She was never that adept at it, though, so she never saw much. I certainly did not mind the view on my end, of course,\" Serena reminisces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's...just play cards...\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Sunny agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So it's about to start.

Feeling a bit more confident, you pick up four new cards from the top of the deck and you observe your new current hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour recent additions turn out to be two queens (heart and clover), one spade of nines and one spade of sevens. You cautiously flash a nervous smile, as you flip your hand over to the other four girls, revealing your weak one pair hand. However, even though you only managed to score one pair, you still hold a small glimmer of hope in your mind that one of the others had drawn a weaker hand than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, each of the girls table their cards while carefully eyeing their opponent's hand as well. Unsurprisingly, your hand wasn't the strongest after all, as Sunny's deck had managed to score two pairs of twos and threes. Fortunately for you, Serena had the worst luck of the draw, nowhere near close to a single pair. In fact, out of the five cards she picked, it looked like the jack of hearts was her highest card which still wasn't that impressive since everyone else had a single pair. It wasn't necessarily a strong round for anyone but most of you were happy they got through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sunny boasted, suddenly raising her voice. She was holding up her two pairs up for everyone to see and causing Serena to slightly frown, \"Would you look at that! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" you say, letting out a little laugh in the process, \"You don't have to show off Sunny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I got a little carried away,\" Sunny apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on the other side of the table, you watch as Serena takes off her hat, placing them neatly onto the table. Ellie notices as well, taking a good look at the straw hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I brought a hat with me,\" Ellie grumbled to no-one in particular, now looking at Sunny's gloved hands, \"Or gloves. It feels unfair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you tell us earlier that you were wearing a shirt underneath your sweater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie blushed in embarrassment, \"I must've forgotten about that Clem.

There are pictures of you holding playing cards from when you were barely six months old. Okay, so your Dad is in the picture propping up the cards, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're good with numbers. Okay, not really so good at elementary algebra, which your parents made sure you were enrolled in when you started the eighth grade. But you're good at counting cards and figuring odds and everything. And you've got millions of dollars in your online poker account. Granted, those online dollars don't translate into real dollars, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, this isn't family game night, or online fantasy. This is an actual poker game with four beautiful, badass women. And it's just possible that you might get to see one or all of these women naked. And then there's the forfeit.  You might be able to get one of the women to do something while they were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like Claire read your mind. \"Hey, kid, are you still a virgin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and Jill comes to your defense. Sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he's still a virgin,\" Jill retorts. \"He's all of twelve---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirteen,\" you blurt out before you can stop yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"---thirteen,\" Jill continues. \"So don't pick on him about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he plays his cards right, after tonight, maybe he won't be,\" Claire says with a laugh. \"Get it, plays his cards right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women groan and the cards get dealt out. You get a Queen of Diamonds, a Six of Hearts and a Three of Hearts. Almost a flush. You would have liked to have had a flush, but you don't need to get the highest hand. You just need not to get the lowest. Which you're sure two queens will keep you from having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you guess right. The lowest hand is Jill's, who has a Jack high nothing hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well  I guess I pop my cherry first,\" Jill laughs. You blush, which makes all the other women laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does each shoe count as a single article of clothing?\" Jill asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes and socks count as one article of clothing all together,\" Juliet answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill nods and begins taking off her shoes. When she takes off her first sock, Claire shouts, \"Who let the zombies in?\" This gets a good laugh from everyone before the next round of cards gets dealt out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: A(H), K(C), J(S), 10(S), 4(S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: Baseball cap, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nJill: Gloves, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shoes and socks</span>, blue top, pants, black tank top, bra, panties.<br>\r\nJuliet: Bracelets and leg warmers, shoes, skirt, hair scrunchies, stockings, cheerleader top, purple thong.<br>\r\nClaire: Gloves, boots and socks, vest, short t-shirt, jeans, bra, panties.<br>\r\nAnnie: Gloves, jacket, boots, stockings, skirt, yellow top, panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to keep</span></div></div>",

For one thing, you didn't lose the first hand, which you think might give you some standing with the women around the table. Okay, maybe standing isn't the right word. These are all badass women who could probably kick your ass while having a casual conversation on their smartphones. But you feel at least that they won't treat you like a placeholder. You know, someone who they have to get out of the game before they can get serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get dealt your hand, Carrie says, \"I've got a question and an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie rolls her eyes. \"Carrie has an idea. We should all be afraid. We should all be very afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the women laugh, before Jill settles the group down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your question, Carrie?\" Jill asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do side bets?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say as long as they don't run counter to the main game's rules, side bets are fine,\" Juliet offers. \"But as a sort of safety switch, all side bets have to be approved by the group as a whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of you agree on this, although you're curious what kind of side bets Carrie has in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my idea depends on whether the kid answers a question honestly or not,\" Carrie said, a wicked grin appearing on her face. This piques the interest of everyone around the table, including you, but you're also more than a little worried that Carrie is going to have fun at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to add the rule,\" Carrie began, \"That everytime one of us loses a hand, and the kid has the high hand that round, he gets to play with the loser's boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops at what Carrie suggests. You were hoping to see at least one of these women nude, and maybe get to win one of their forfeits, but that was all nebulous. But this is real. Carrie wants to set a rule that if you win a hand---not just not lose it, but win it---you get to play with boobs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're all in favor of this new rule, but don't want to blurt it out. The erection growing in your pants, though, it trying to raise its hand in favor of the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I assume this question of yours would be a condition of whether we make this rule change, assuming everyone is in favor of it?\" Annie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so excited about the prospect of playing with their breasts (and, as the game progresses, bare breasts!!!) you forgot about the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the question?\" Jill asks, and you're wondering the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grins at you. \"The kid just has to tell us, and be honest, whether he's a virgin or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet has a thoughtful look on her face. \"I'll buy off on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise and delight and dread, the other two women acquiesce to Carrie's rule addition as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you is obviously delighted. But to get to the delight part, you're going to have to admit that you're a virgin. And no guy wants to admit that. Particularly at a table of hot, adult women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kid, what'll be?\" Carrie grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame paused:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are holding the Ace of Hearts and the King of Clubs.

Juliet shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Nick were saving ourselves for each other,\" she begins, \"But one night, when I was ready, I took my top off for the first time.

Anyway, when I took my top off for him for the first and last time, he might have got confused or something. He called them big fat titties. They are not fat!\" Juliet said emphatically. \"They're just firm and large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself that, if you get a chance to see Juliet's chest, the word fat won't even enter your brain, much less exit your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a virgin, too,\" Annie admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you and Nick---your Nick,\" Juliet clarified, \"Well, there was that kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that kiss was all there ever was,\" Annie said sadly. \"He never followed up on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttention turned to Claire, who shrugged, \"I haven't been super, super active, but they won't be making a movie about me entitled the twenty-something year old virgin, either. Or in Jill's case, the thirty-something year old virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill flips Claire off, which gets a lot of laughs, before she turns serious. \"Listen, when it happens, it happens. Sex is a lot of fun. Just make sure the first time is with someone who will make it fun, and won't make you regret it, okay?\" You, Juliet and Anna nod solemnly, and Jill adds, \"Okay, let's play some cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the Ace of Diamonds, the Five of Hearts, and the Two of Hearts.

There's no shame in that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the words just won't leave your mouth. Even though it means you might be giving up a chance to play with boobs, and even better, bare boobs, you just can't admit that you're a virgin in front of these four beautiful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, kid,\" Juliet tells you. \"It's embarrassing to talk about. I understand. And if it makes you feel any better, I'm a virgin too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you and Nick...\" Annie began, then stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet shook her head. \"We were saving ourselves for each other. And then I found out I was the only one do any saving. Nick found someone else to lose his virginity to. It happened right after I took my top off for him. He said...he...he used the f word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other women gasped. You're not really sure what the f word is, or at least what Juliet thinks the f word is, but before you have to find some way of discretely finding out, she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said I have big, fat titties,\" she continued. \"They're not fat. They're large and firm. I just have to keep them under control, using a special top, so that they don't bounce around and get in the way of cheerleading and chainsawing and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discreetly look at the top covering Juliet's chest. She seems very nicely proportioned to you, but not overly so. Maybe Nick was just trying to complement Juliet on the size of her breasts, and picked the wrong adjectives. Or maybe Juliet's breasts are larger than they appear (like in a rear view mirror). Your knowledge of the physics of sports bras, and particularly those in the world that Juliet comes from, is non-existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's why I accepted the invitation to this special game,\" she continues. \"I found out about Nick not waiting anymore, and I thought, you know what, I'm going to go out and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you,\" Annie tells her. \"And who knows, the kid here might have a special strawberry lollipop you can get some power from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Juliet blush at Annie's double innuendo, which gets everybody laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we here to gossip or play cards?\" Jill interjects. With that, the cards are dealt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get two aces and and a seven, to fill out your hand. When all the hands are revealed, you discover you have the high hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you had had the guts to admit the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet has the low hand, with just a pair of deuces. She takes her scrunchies out of her hair and shakes her hair out, letting it fall down around her shoulders. Then she looks at you and crooks a finger, motioning for you to walk over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, while the three other women at the table watch to see what scene is about to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I told you I'm a virgin,\" Juliet says as you stand right in front of her. \"I bet you'd feel better if you admitted you're one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning beet red, you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to say it out loud,\" Juliet instructs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm a virgin,\" you manage to stutter/croak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that satisfy you, Carrie?\" Juliet asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conditions are met,\" Carrie agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Juliet says, then takes your right hand and places it over her left breast. Even though her top seems a little thick and has some wires and other stuff sown in it, her breast in your hand is the best thing you've ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet squeezes her hand over yours, encouraging you to do the same with her breast. You massage her breast gently for a few seconds before she removes your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd ask you if you enjoyed that as much as I did,\" Juliet says, looking straight at the crotch of your pants, \"But it looks like you enjoyed it more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn kid, are you sure you're only thirteen?\" Carrie asks, staring at the bulge in your pants. This gets a laugh from all the women as you hurry back to your seat to hide your hard on.

After all, all four women had agreed to let you feel their breasts if you got the high hand. And you enjoyed the two times you had with Juliette already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents think I'm over at a friends' house,\" you answer Jill. \"And I play baseball. Shortstop. I'm really good, too,\" you tell them. \"My coach says if I keep training and working hard, when I get to high school, I can probably skip the junior varsity team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baseball is almost as good as sport to train for zombie killing as cheerleading is,\" Juliet said. \"Especially shortstop. Lots of agility training, and knowing how to swing a baseball bat is a plus. And the fact that you told your family a little white lie means you care about them, since you don't want them to worry, and are resourceful enough to figure out something believable. All good qualities in a future zombie hunter,\" she  concludes enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think Juliet's description of you is a little over the top, but you find yourself beaming anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask for three cards, keeping your eights. You end up getting the five of spades, five of clubs and three of diamonds. Two pairs. Pretty good, you think to yourself, though you wish it were better. Then you remind yourself not to get greedy. After all, your main goal, you remind yourself, is to not be the low hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again, you're neither the high hand nor the low hand. Juliet has the high hand, which is disappointing. Since she lost three hands already, you we're hoping she would keep losing some clothes. You're especially curious about what will happen when that cheerleader top comes off. And you very much want that top to come off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had the low hand, with a pair of threes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want the same privilege as the kid?\" Claire asks as she removes her gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just keep to the rules we have for now,\" Juliet answers, as the next round of cards are dealt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Have: J(C), J(H), 7(C), 4(C), 3(C)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing Count:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Baseball cap</span>, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nJill: Gloves, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shoes and socks</span>, blue top, pants, black tank top, bra, panties.<br>\r\nJuliet: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Bracelets and leg warmers, shoes</span>, skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hair scrunchies</span>, stockings, cheerleader top, purple thong.<br>\r\nClaire: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, boots and socks, vest, short t-shirt, jeans, bra, panties.<br>\r\nAnnie: Gloves, jacket, boots, stockings, skirt, yellow top, panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep</span></div></div>",

But it looks like you're destined to get hands good enough not to lose, but not good enough to win. In other words, you'll get to look, but not touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep the nines and turn in the other three cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw almost drops when you get the other two nines. Four of a kind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hope and expected, you get the high hand. Only this time, it's Annie who gets the low hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie has been very quiet the last couple of rounds, laughing at the jokes being told, but otherwise being serious about her card play. Now she's looking at her displayed hand with a scowl on her face, and you think someone is going to have to remind her that, since she had the low hand, she's going to have to remove an article of clothing. You just hope that it doesn't have to be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surprises you (and everybody else) when she looks at you and says, \"Let me make this a little easier for you.\" She removes her jacket, revealing the oversized top she's wearing. The shirt has a little scoop, revealing the very top of her breasts, which look like the size of oranges to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then crooks a finger at you, and you scoot over nervously. If this were Juliet---well, you'd be nervous too, but you'd know you had approval. Annie has been mostly sitting quietly in her seat since the game has begun, and you're not sure what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Annie sees you're not going to make the first move, she takes your right hand in both of her gloved ones and gently strokes it a couple of times, before putting it over her left breast. You can immediately tell that she's not wearing a bra, and the feel of her breast with only the material of her top between your hand and her breast is the softest thing you've ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cup her breast and begin kneading her flesh, remembering to be as soft as you can be. Annie moans in response, and you can tell she's enjoying it. You also feel a hard little nubbin that you realize is her nipple. Her very hard nipple. When you run your thumb over the protruding nub, she makes a little \"uuuhhh\" sound, and leans forward to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to need to call time,\" Jill said. She sounded reluctant to ask you and Annie to stop, and you're reluctant to stop, but you see her point. You move your hand away and look up to see Annie's eyes are closed and her mouth is partially open. She opens her eyes, swallows, then catches you by surprise by leaning forward and kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss is over before you even realize it started. Annie tells you thank you in a quiet voice, and you make it back to your seat slightly bent over, to hide your erection. You tell yourself to concentrate as the next round of cards is dealt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cards: 5(H), 5(D), 4(H), 3(H), 2(S)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Baseball cap</span>, jacket, sneakers, socks, t-shirt, jeans, boxer shorts.<br>\r\nJill: Gloves, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shoes and socks</span>, blue top, pants, black tank top, bra, panties.<br>\r\nJuliet: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Bracelets and leg warmers</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shoes</span>, skirt, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">hair scrunchies</span>, stockings, cheerleader top, purple thong.<br>\r\nClaire: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, boots and socks, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">vest</span>, short t-shirt, jeans, bra, panties.<br>\r\nAnnie: Gloves, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">jacket</span>, boots, stockings, skirt, yellow top, panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep</span></div></div>",

I'm not going to lose on purpose, but if I end up topless and the kid wins the hand, I definitely won't complain. I'm actually looking forward to him being the first person to hand the girls out in the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie blushes deeper but nods. Jill and Carrie are actually eyeing you. You keep your gaze down and take a look at the cards dealt to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see you get a seven of clubs, a six of diamonds, and a five of spades. Three fives. You know you should be happy, because you're pretty sure you won't have the low hand again.

Juliet ends up having the low hand, with a pair of nines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bare tootsies actually sounds like fun,\" she remarks, as she bends over to take off her shoes. When her leg warmers keep on getting in the way, she says, \"Or maybe I better get the leg warmers out of the way first.\" When Juliet is bending over, you get to look down her top, and appreciate the first look you get at real live cleavage. She catches you when she sits up and grins. \"Look all you want to, kid,\" she says, removing her bracelets. \"Nick ain't ever going to get tp look again,\" she says with a scowl. \"He called them fat! I think he was surprised when I took my top off for him, because my top kind of suppresses them, so they don't get in the way when I'm cheerleading and chainsawing and stuff. But nobody uses that word with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of surprises you, because you thought Juliet and Nick were inseparable. You guess a lot of stuff happens off screen. Like different video characters being able to get together and socialize, for instance. But that explains why Juliet is here. Her story must have changed after the last game with her. You remember Annie has her own Nick, and they had that passionate kiss. Maybe something happened between them, like it did between Juliet and Nick, and that's she's here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have got a lot of questions, but decide this should all wait until everyone gets talking and feels more comfortable around each other.

The perks of being a succubus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...well that doesn't<i> sound</i> half bad. Do I have to be a bat?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's just how it looks for the outside. To you, it would be an infinite universe of unimaginable pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's just being dramatic,\" Chun Li cuts in, rolling her eyes. \"The one thing she actually craves most in the world is attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't sound so dismissive,\" Morrigan purrs. \"I haven't given up on your either, Legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If we may continue then,\" Kasumi interjects. \"We're all here, so let's go over the rules. We're playing basic five card draw so this doesn't take all night. At the beginning of each hand we all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to take something off. Once a person is rendered naked all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can hardly wait. Winning or losing doesn't matter.

Are you hiding secret powers as well?\" Jeanette looks at Sis. Sis rolls her eyes and sighs, pauses for a few seconds and holds up all ten of her fingers twice. \"Is that supposed to mean 20? Is there any reason you couldn't just tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sis gives Jeanette a withering sardonic look, grabs a pen and writes on a pad of paper next to her.

You notice she seems to have a French accent. You also seem to recall it's not called France where she's from. \"With age comes more...<i>experience</i>. I think it could make the game more fun.\" You notice a definite tone of mischief there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well aren't you a cheeky one.

We're playing basic five card draw so the game doesn't take all night, so that means no betting. At the beginning of each hand we'll all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for new ones. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to strip. Once a person is bare-assed all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on wins.

We...uh...kind of both didn't exactly have normal childhoods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, sure. I played loads of times with my friend Riley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Strip poker, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A...few times, yeah. She had terrible luck, though.\" Ellie grins. \"You actually kind of remind me of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, not the luck part. Just in the general attitude. Ya know, the whole confident, survivor badass kind of deal. It was always kinda hot.\" Clem raises an eyebrow. \"I mean she was! Not that you aren't, though, or well I'm...ya know...not trying to...you get what I'm trying to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was saying that she was attracted to another girl who was like you in many ways, and thus likely finds those qualities in you attractive as well, though she does not want to come out and say that,\" Serena says, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks for the input, Frenchie,\" Ellie says, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do not know this French, but I do know what you are feeling. I personally had a very similar experience with my friend Shauna. We played a game similar to this. Only instead of cards, we battled our Pokemon. She was never that adept at it, though, so she never saw much. I certainly did not mind the view on my end, of course,\" Serena reminisces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's...just play cards...\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Sunny agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So it's about to start.

On closer inspection she appears to be Samantha Nishimura (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GphLqyk.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/GphLqyk.png</a>), Lara's friend. Maybe she got to come as Lara's guest, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, it seems our final player has arrived,\" Elizabeth says brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not very big on punctuality is she?\" Lilith comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Meh, who needs to be on time? And hey...it's...another girl. Shocker.\" Zoey says sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, well. No use messing with the classics,\" Lara interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno, would it have been so hard to send a guy in here?\" Zoey says. \"I mean...I at least dig her vibes. I'm sensing a kind of of kindred spirit thing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your shared interests in hoodies points at a shared interest in slacking, at any rate,\" Lilith says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't knock it until you tried it!\" Zoey quips back. \"Anyway, wouldn't you rather have a guy or two here, new chick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...I don't mind it being all girls...\" You say shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeesh, you'll fit right in if you keep talking like that. Still, wouldn't you prefer some y-chromosomes at the table, Lara?\" Zoey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Offff course I would. Heh heh. Yeah. The more guys the merrier!\" She replies nervously. You can see Sam rolling her eyes from her seat. You notice one of her drink glasses is empty and she's already working on another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe you came to the right game after all, small one,\" Zoey says with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway,\" Lilith interjects. \"We're all here, so let's go over the rules. We're playing basic five card draw so this doesn't take all night. At the beginning of each hand we all get five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to take something off. Once a person gets bare-assed all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And that winner is going to be Lara!\" Sam says, slurring a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sam! Pipe down, we haven't even started yet,\" Lara responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure about that, girlie? Wanna make a bet?\" Lilith asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hell yes!\" Sam says enthusiastically. \"Lara rescued me single-handedly from a cult, so I'm pretty sure she can do this. As a show of solidarity, every time she takes something off, I will too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't have to do this, Sam...\" Lara says, slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I say let her make her own mistakes,\" Zoey says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not like I could stop her, anyway,\" Lara says, resigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Besides, it won't even matter because you are going to rock it!\" Sam says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is everyone ready then?\" Elizabeth interrupts, bemused at the entire spectacle before her. After a bit of a double-take, everyone nods in agreement.

You said yourself that you are very lucky, correct? If this is true, you have nothing to worry about. Besides, not all treasures are measured in physical wealth. Many come from far less tangible places, like the bonds you create with others. I wonder if will be creating special bonds with any of you...\" Elizabeth says, her usual mystical airy tone now colored with the slightest suggestive undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Man, where did they find this girl?\" Jessica asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you would all be so kind as to listen to the rules then,\" Elizabeth interjects. \"We're playing basic five card draw for the sake of brevity, so that means no betting of any kind.

I personally had a very similar experience with my friend Shauna. We played a game similar to this. Only instead of cards, we battled our Pokemon.

We're playing basic five card draw so the game is faster, so that means no betting of any kind. At the beginning of each hand we all receive five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to remove an article of clothing. Once a person is naked all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner.

After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for new ones. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to strip.

I personally had a very similar experience with my friend Shauna. We played a game similar to this. Only instead of cards, we battled our Pokemon. She was never that adept at it, though, so she never saw much. I certainly did not mind the view on my end, of course,\" Serena reminisces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's...just play cards...\" Clem says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Sunny agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So it's about to start.

You aren't so lucky, however, as all you're rewarded with are an off-suit four and seven.  You bite your lip thoughtfully, a tick you've had long enough that you barely notice it anymore.  You know a pair of aces is a pretty strong hand, and the king just adds extra insurance.  You're not likely to win the hand, but you're almost certain you won't lose.  What are the odds of all four of the other girls having at least two pair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax.  It's just a game, right?\" Ellie casually smiles at you.  She's obviously noticed how nervous you are.  You realize your little tick could give away more about future hand than you'd like, so you make a note to try and keep it under control.  You're not confident you'll be able to, however, given how long you've gone without breaking that particular habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, uh...yeah.\" you smile back uneasily as the last few cards are swapped out.  \"Sorry.  Just a little nervous, I guess.\"  It isn't just about the prospect of losing your clothes, although that's certainly part of it.  Some people have a knack for talking to new people and being in the group spotlight.  You are not one of those people.  You're worried you'll say something dumb and embarrass yourself, or that you'll be the first one out and have to sit there naked as a jaybird while the other girls laugh about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shows their cards while you nervously chew your lip.  To your surprise, your hand is the strongest after all, as most of the girls had some sort of pair.  Only Sunny comes up short, with just a queen to her name.  A little rush of relief eases your nerves.  It's just one hand, but still.  Sunny pulls off her gloves, flexing her fingers and cheerily commenting on how much easier it'll be for her to hold her cards now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next set of cards are dealt, Serena's bright smile finds it way to your corner of the table.  It's obvious she's some sort of social butterfly, at least compared to you and the other girls in the group, so the fact that she doesn't immediately break eye contact makes you just a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  You stammer out quickly, sounding slightly annoyed entirely by accident.  You remedy that immediately.  She seems nice; all these girls do.  You don't want to give any of them the wrong impression.  \"I mean, uh, is there...something on my face or something?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not at all.  I was just thinking that you are probably very pretty when you smile, but that you also seem very nervous.  You should try and relax and enjoy the game.\" Serena said, picking up her new hand without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, at a loss as to how you might even reply to the Pokemon trainer.  You certainly don't mind the compliment, but having someone just come right out and say it is kind of embarrassing.  Besides, has your nervousness really been <b>that</b> obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...worry about Serena.\" Clem says wryly.  \"She says things without really thinking about them first.  Seriously, though, loosen up a little.  We're all here to have fun.  And it's not like any of us are going to see anything we don't all have, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh sheepishly and agree, looking at your new hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You Have: K(H), Q(D), 9(D), 10(S),  4(C)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Count:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Player:</b> White button-up blouse, pink sneakers, pink socks, blue shirt, black skirt, short and small white tank top, white cotton panties.<br>\r\n<b>Ellie:</b> Shoes, socks, t-shirt, sweater, jeans, training bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Clementine:</b> Hat, shoes, socks, t-shirt, jeans, sweater, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Sunny:</b> <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Gloves</span>, boots, socks, coveralls, tank top, training bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Serena:</b> Hat, shoes, black top, skirt, stockings, bra, panties.</span></div></div>",

For someone who lost first, she sure seems to be in a good mood.  \"Maybe you're better at this than you let on.\"  You know it's just a joke, but she actually sounds a little impressed, and that makes you even more confident that you've made the right choice.  Feeling a little proud of yourself, you look at your new card...and find that it is exactly what you needed!  You're holding the jack of clubs, completing your straight.  You think you manage to hide your smile until everyone's cards are shown, but you beam with pride when you see that you have the strongest hand yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I win again!\" you announce, a little louder than you intend.  You clear your throat and force your smile down to an awkward smirk, expecting some annoyed eye-rolling from the other girls, but they don't even seem to have minded your unnecessary volume.  Serena's last this time, with ace-high easily losing out to the others' pairs, but the whole table is more focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, crap.  And here I was, hoping you wouldn't be good.  Guess I'm still the worst player at the table.\" Clem comments, pouting without actually seeming at all upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was ballsy, going for the straight when you only traded one card.  Nice one.\" Ellie grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this was just good luck.  That's a big part of poker, obviously, but the probability of it keeping up for the whole game is so unlikely that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunny.

Anyway, good job.\" Sunny adds sheepishly, giving you a small nod before returning her attention to dealing out the cards.  You smile a little brighter.  You're feeling pretty good about this game now, and you're actually having a lot of fun.  You seem to be fitting in just fine so far, so maybe this won't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Serena as she slips off her stylish shoes, placing them neatly underneath her chair.  You had expected her to take off her hat, and you say so out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.  I like this hat quite a lot.

Keeping the one you had would have given you two pair; a significantly stronger hand.  And to make matters worse, you didn't even gain anything by throwing away what you had.  You try your best not to pout, but you know you've got a bad hand and a bad poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, show 'em.\" Ellie says, and the table does just that.  A quick, nervous scan of the cards tells you you've got the worst hand.

Finding another of either should at least keep you out of last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so...\" Serena smiles at you, suddenly sounding very playful.  \"What do you think of playing strip poker with only girls at the table?

She seems kinda young, though,\" Juliet says. \"She reminds me of some of the kids I used to babysit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You babysat?\" Annie asks, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...it didn't end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That...uh...doesn't sound good,\" you say, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...nothing, like, bad or anything. At least not bad by my standards, with zombies and everything. It was just a regular person's kind of bad,\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess if she's here that means she got an invite, though,\" Claire says. \"If the club cleared her I guess it's okay with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I guess. Anyway, it's nice to see you, Claire. I heard Zoe supposed to be at this table, though?\" Juliet asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but someone dropped out of the shooter table at the last minute, so they asked her to take over since her game is all about guns,\" Jill says. \"So I called Claire on short notice and she said 'yes.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, it's just nice to be doing <i>something</i> for a change,\" Claire sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, chin up. You'll get cycled back in eventually,\" Jill says kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Says the girl who's been in two of the last three,\" Claire fires back, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh, good point,\" Jill says. \"Anyway, I guess we should go on with this, so let's get to the rules. We're playing basic five card draw so the game is faster, so that means no betting of any kind. At the beginning of each hand we all receive five cards. After we have those, each of us can turn in any of those, up to all five, for replacements. Once we've done that, everyone puts down their hands and the loser has to remove an article of clothing. Once a person is naked all of us here at the table get to decide what that person has to do as punishment. The last person left with anything on is the winner. Is that clear to everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone at the table nods in affirmation and the cards are dealt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You Have: 2(H), 2(S), 9(D), 6(H), 4(H)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clothing Count:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Player:</b> White button-up blouse, pink sneakers, pink socks, blue shirt, black skirt, short and small white tank top, white cotton panties.<br>\r\n<b>Jill:</b> Gloves, shoes and socks, blue top, pants, black tank top, bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Juliet:</b> Bracelets and leg warmers, shoes, skirt, hair scrunchies, stockings, cheerleader top, purple thong.<br>\r\n<b>Claire:</b> Gloves, boots and socks, vest, short t-shirt, jeans, bra, panties.<br>\r\n<b>Annie:</b> Gloves, jacket, boots, stockings, skirt, yellow top, panties.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Inventory is a former speakeasy turned hangout for all manner of characters from the video game world. On a normal night you could find all sorts in the club drinking, talking or participating in one of the many high stakes gambling games that the place hosts for its diverse clientele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonight, however, is not a normal night. Tonight you, lucky gamer, have been invited to a very special game. You will play a game of poker against four lovely video game heroines. Not just any poker, either. Strip poker. The winner is the last one left at the table with their modesty intact. Will you win or will you lose your shirt...literally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>General Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No growth/shrink or body modification of any kind.<br>\r\n-Nothing scatological. No peeing and no diapers, either.<br>\r\n-No vore.<br>\r\n-No extreme torture, violence or death. (BDSM is just fine, though)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Game Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Each entry is a single hand in the game. It will begin with the player's choice of discard from the previous chapter. The loser of the hand removes a single article of clothing. Once new cards are dealt and its time to select cards again a new page is made. There are no time lapses or glossing over of hands in single chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't make any of the choices at the end of a chapter be the result of the hand. For instance, none of the choices should be \"X wins the hand\" or \"X loses the hand.\" It should always pertain to the cards the player has, unless the current event being decided on does not have to do with the poker game, such as a forfeit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Always end each chapter with the status of the current characters, as seen in the chapters already posted. This will help future writers of chapters to be clear on what is currently going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Once a player loses their last article of clothing, they must perform a forfeit. The forfeit is author's choice. It can be anything from simple embarrassing tasks like posing for photos or streaking to full on sex. It's best to gauge the current tone of the story to feel what kind of forfeit would be appropriate at that time. The longer the game goes on, the racier they tend to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The game continues until all but the player are naked or until the player loses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Should the player lose, once they strip and perform the forfeit the story branch ends with a game over. The game does not continue once the player is out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't be afraid to write dialogue between the characters. Some of the most memorable parts of the game Poker Night at the Inventory are the conversations, so throw in some good insides jokes or just some good dialogue between the players.</td>",
