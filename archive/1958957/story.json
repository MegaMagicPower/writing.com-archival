Crossover can happen to all fictions hint  why the Fan fiction Genre in here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in story Jason can live forever because since both has mix of kitsune and demon blood as well he can't get disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly way he can die is from an sword, bow or gun or even laser weapons if we get that far in future<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has two type of magic, Soul Magic( Informality called Dark magic) and Mana which is life-force<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are you waiting for write something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
