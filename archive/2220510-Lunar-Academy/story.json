            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sigh escapes my lips as I take in my new surroundings. The large expansive castle-like building is pretty impressive I have to admit. The grounds are kept to perfection. I continue my perusal as I take in the lush grass and vegetation. My wolf gets restless. He wants nothing more than to take a run through the acres and acres of forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot now, I tell my wolf. I know you want to explore and get a feel for your new home, but first we have to get settled in. Plus we couldn't miss our photo time and welcoming address by the Headmaster. This school is known for its strict rules. Second chances were not often given. Mom would kill or worse (in her mind) disown me if I messed up and brought dishonour to the family name. I know because a heard this speech a time or a million. There were few things the Sinclair name couldn't fix, but this prostegious campus was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wolf was not happy, but I could feel him  settling down. I was glad. The last thing I needed was to fight with my wolf on my first day. My wolf and I honestly were able to come to a reasonable conclusion most of the time. The beginning of puberty was rough. At least for us. My school, on the other hand, probably thought it had hit the jackpot after all the \"donations\" my family made to make a little \"incidents\" disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until this point in my life I had been surrounded by either other wolf born or humans. In general the werewolf population was not openly out to the humans. There were people in high ranking government positions who knew of our existence. They kept it quiet as well. We all knew that mankind was not very accepting of people who are different. History taught that lesson over and over. And even they didn't know all of our secrets. Like the fact that a werewolf was too broad a term. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all fell into one of four categories: Wolf born, wolf, bitten, wolf bound, and wolf blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf borns were people that were born into a werewolf family. Werewolf could mate with other species. The offspring would only be a wolf however if 2 werewolves, who were mated, were the parents. We wolf borns place a high importance on keeping our blood lines pure. In fact, most families could trace back their ancestry for centuries back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the wolf bitten. These are people who were turned into werewolves. Most wolfborn considered them as not real werewolves. While none of the 4 types of wolves intermingled too much, wolf born and wolf bitten were pretty much enemies. I wouldn't even want to repeat some the things my older brothers had said about the wolf bitten. They likewise didn't want anything to do with us because we looked down on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf blood and wolf bound were also enemies. The wolf blood were also part vampire. I couldn't imagine having a wolf and a vampire in my mind. They had the reputation as the \"bad boys\" of werewolves. There tempers were pretty volatile. The wolf bound were also witches. They had magical gift along with the benefits our wolves gave us. I was warned not to mess with them. They might not be as fierce, but they were cunning with their gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted all of these things were hearsay. So much of my life actually was what somebody else told me or wanted me to do or be. I was looking forward to the next 4 years. These might be the most freedom I ever got. I knew once I graduated I would be expected to step into the formal responsibilities of my family. It was what a Sinclair was all about. Power and appearances. I knew this, which was why I planned on making the most of the next four years.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I followed the signs to find my registration tables. I entered the massive gatelike doors. Inside the doors was a elegantly dated foyer. The room had high ceilings with natural looking exposed beams. The expansive window were ordained with drapes of deep, rich colors. The golds, burgundys, and navys mixed together form an impressive picture. Speaking of pictures the ornate frames were filled with dated artwork. I didn't have an eye for art, but I was sure these were original and probably highly sought after art. One would think that with a campus as a large as this estate, there would be signs inside to lead the newbies to the correct location. One would also be wrong to think that way. Instead I noticed older students who were wearing lanyards. Every so often of of them would say first years this way. I decided to follow their directions. After a series of turns down long, equally ornate hallways, my path finally opened up into brightly lit room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed four different tables were set up in each corner of the room. There were no labels to signify which table was which. Each corner was decorated with a different color however. All of my older brothers had attended this school. Therefore I knew that the red table was for the bloods, the green for the bounds, the yellow for the bittens, and the blue was for the borns. I made my way towards the blue corner. I had never been around this many different types of wolves. I noticed my wolf began to perk up. I wasn't sure why. I was too busy scanning my surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed many people were mingling around catching up. I noticed a couple of girls from my high school: Ashley and Jasmine. I wanted to avoid them with every fiber of my being. Ashley Langshire also came from a very prestigious family. We ran in the same social circles and often found ourselves attending the same publicity events. We were friendly, but she never wasted an opportunity to let me know she would like to be more. That was not something I was interested in. Luckily for me, she was very into her conversation with Jasmine and another male whom I didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my wolf began to try to rise to the surface. That was weird. He had been antsy since I entered this room, but I wasn't sure why. I closed my eyes and took a few seconds to reason with him and calm him down. Once I  opened my eyes I saw another familiar face. Nadia Hazel. She was another wolf born from my town. We went to different schools. While my family was thought of as powerful due to our history and money, Nadia's were known for their work. They devoted their lives to bring important issues out to the open. Therefore we were not often at the same events. Her family didn't necessarily get an invitation to the social events my family deemed acceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Nadia had changed since the last time I saw her, or I was just not paying attention. She was absolutely gorgeous. She was rather petite for a wolf, but her body both curvy and fit. Her luscious ebony locks fell wildly down to kiss her shoulder. Currently she was talking to her twin brother, Marcus. Twins were very rare for wolves. Which is how I knew about Nadia and Marcus. I also knew that she was thought to be extremely smart. Other than that, I really didn't know a whole lot about her. I hoped that I could fix that soon. Why not start now. I made my way towards her when I was approached by....</span></div></div>",

I guess I would have to wait to get to know Nadia. Once Ashley had her claws into me, it was difficult to get free. Once again I felt my wolf growl. That was weird, my wolf normally tolerated Ashley. \"Hi Ashley. Did you have a good summer?\" I might as well be polite. It was what was expected of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I had an amazing one. I couldn't wait to graduate and start real life\" Her face formed into a pout. \"I was disappointed that I didn't see you any over the summer. I can't believe you missed Brock's graduation party. It was epic!\" she continued to ramble on about her summer plans. Never once did she ask about my summer. My eyes continued to find their way back to Nadia. She was talking to Marcus and some guy I didn't know. My wolf began to pace restlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It sounds like a lit party. I need to go register and then drop my things off in my room before pictures. I'll catch up with you later?\" I rushed off. Not giving her a chance to argue or worst try to come with me. I made my way towards Nadia's group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately Ashley was not the only one who stopped me. I ran into some other students from my school. They all wanted to chat. Since it was basically ingrained in me to be polite, I had to proceed in the appropriate amount of small talk. By the time I made it to the registry table, Nadia had left the room. I let out a breathe and tried to focus on what the volunteer was telling me. I had a hard time focusing; partly because I frustrated and partly because my wolf was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving my room information, the school handbook, and some other information, I decided to head up to my room. I could freshen up some before heading back to meet up for pictures. This campus was huge and it was going to take me a little time  to become accustomed to it. Once I made my way to my room, I found Finn was already there. More surprisingly, he had already unpacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're finally here!\" Finn called in greeting to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man\" I absently responded back as I looked around the room. I approached the unclaimed bed relaxing a little. Finn had left me the bed furthest from the window. My wolf would definitely rest better not being closest to the door. All in all it was a pretty sweet room. Sure it was much smaller than my room back home, but it was a good size for a college dorm room essentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you glad your dad was able to pull some strings and get claim us sweet room. I passed by Eric on my way here and man his room is tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged noncommittally. My parents were always pulling strings. I guess I was just used to it by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you run into Ashley,\" Finn said way too pleased with himself. \"She was asking about you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn was my best friend. Our families went way back for generations. We were pretty much opposites. Finn was one of those people who would always tell it like it is. If he thought about it, he was more than likely going to say it. I on the otherhand tended the be the think, then think again type of person. \"Yeah. I saw her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, \"Good I knew you wouldn't want to miss a chance to run into her.\" Finn knew how I felt about Ashley. At first when she began to pay attention to me, I will admit, I was pretty flattered. Don't get my wrong, I have never been in want of girlfriends, but Ashley was something of a queen at my school. The one girl every guy wanted a chance with. She was gorgeous, confident, and loaded. However, once I spent time with her, she quickly began to get on my nerves. I couldn't count the number of times Finn has had to help me escape her clutches. Her family and my family have some business ventures together. I was explicitly told not to anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I didn't think I was going to be able to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just shook his head and laughed. \"I don't see what the big deal is. She is hot! If I were you I would just go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot him a look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I know she can be a little annoying...or mouthy, but I bet you can think of other uses for that mouth. Plus lets face it, your families have probably just about married you two off to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered. He wasn't wrong, mom had mentioned many time what a \"lovely your lady\" Ashley was before she gave me a warning about keeping up partnerships and etc. \"If you think so, then you date her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem with that is I\"m not a Sinclair. She only has eyes for you. Plus I am not planning on getting tied down to one girl. Did you look at all the babes? The next few years are going to be epic! Just think of the party scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to unpack some of my things while Finn rambled on about the party scene and the girls.I was only listening off and on. Until he mentioned a name that perked up my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have you seen Nadia Hazel. Man that girl is FIIINE! I can't wait to get to know her a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to force a growl back from my wolf. \"Did you talk to her?\" I tried to ask casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? She was too busy asking questions for me to get a word in. Plus when I got close she gave me a dismissive look that could have killed. She may be hot, but she's got some ice too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprisingly pleased with this information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways its about time for us to head down. You ready?</span></div></div>",

        "created":1588115040,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a story based off of Alyssa Rose Ivy's and Jennifer Snyder's Lunar Academy, Year one series. In this series Lunar academy is a college for werewolves. Every student is sorted into a house based off of what kind of werewolf they are. The houses are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Wolf Born: Think the upper society. They are pure blood werewolf and have a healthy confidence because of if. Many of them believe themselves to be royalty because their blood lines are pure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Wolf Bitten: These are the ones who were bitten by a werewolf and turned. Some were attacked against their own will. Others chose to become a werewolf. Either way this group tends to have to battle with control of their wolf since they haven't grown up with a wolf. Some of them are really bitter about their situation. Others are extremely excited to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Wolf Blood: These are werewolf and vampire hybrids House colors. Due to the fact that they have both a wolf and vampire in their minds, they can come across as very intense and at times intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Wolf Bound: These are werewolf and witch hybrids. They are not born with magic however. They normally gain use of magic sometime after puberty. If they do not gain magic by 19th birthday then they no longer qualify as wolf bound. They tend to be quirky. While they are normally not the most adept fighters, most other breeds tend to stay away due to the magic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 4 part series. I am only on book 2. Honestly the authors don't give a lot of details as to how any of this is possible, but I thought this would be a fun story to follow and create. Let your imagination run wild. This is purely for fun so feel free to dive in a write a chapter (or more).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only rules are keep it clean. Nothing crude, nasty, or trashy. You may allude to whatever, but nothing graphic.</td>",
