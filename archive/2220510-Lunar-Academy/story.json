The grounds are kept to perfection. I continue my perusal as I take in the lush grass and vegetation. My wolf gets restless. He wants nothing more than to take a run through the acres and acres of forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot now, I tell my wolf. I know you want to explore and get a feel for your new home, but first we have to get settled in. Plus we couldn't miss our photo time and welcoming address by the Headmaster. This school is known for its strict rules. Second chances were not often given. Mom would kill or worse (in her mind) disown me if I messed up and brought dishonour to the family name. I know because a heard this speech a time or a million. There were few things the Sinclair name couldn't fix, but this prostegious campus was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy wolf was not happy, but I could feel him  settling down. I was glad. The last thing I needed was to fight with my wolf on my first day. My wolf and I honestly were able to come to a reasonable conclusion most of the time. The beginning of puberty was rough. At least for us. My school, on the other hand, probably thought it had hit the jackpot after all the \"donations\" my family made to make a little \"incidents\" disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until this point in my life I had been surrounded by either other wolf born or humans. In general the werewolf population was not openly out to the humans. There were people in high ranking government positions who knew of our existence. They kept it quiet as well. We all knew that mankind was not very accepting of people who are different. History taught that lesson over and over. And even they didn't know all of our secrets. Like the fact that a werewolf was too broad a term. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all fell into one of four categories: Wolf born, wolf, bitten, wolf bound, and wolf blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf borns were people that were born into a werewolf family. Werewolf could mate with other species. The offspring would only be a wolf however if 2 werewolves, who were mated, were the parents. We wolf borns place a high importance on keeping our blood lines pure. In fact, most families could trace back their ancestry for centuries back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the wolf bitten. These are people who were turned into werewolves. Most wolfborn considered them as not real werewolves. While none of the 4 types of wolves intermingled too much, wolf born and wolf bitten were pretty much enemies. I wouldn't even want to repeat some the things my older brothers had said about the wolf bitten. They likewise didn't want anything to do with us because we looked down on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf blood and wolf bound were also enemies. The wolf blood were also part vampire. I couldn't imagine having a wolf and a vampire in my mind. They had the reputation as the \"bad boys\" of werewolves. There tempers were pretty volatile. The wolf bound were also witches. They had magical gift along with the benefits our wolves gave us. I was warned not to mess with them. They might not be as fierce, but they were cunning with their gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted all of these things were hearsay. So much of my life actually was what somebody else told me or wanted me to do or be. I was looking forward to the next 4 years. These might be the most freedom I ever got. I knew once I graduated I would be expected to step into the formal responsibilities of my family. It was what a Sinclair was all about. Power and appearances. I knew this, which was why I planned on making the most of the next four years.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I followed the signs to find my registration tables. I entered the massive gatelike doors. Inside the doors was a elegantly dated foyer. The room had high ceilings with natural looking exposed beams. The expansive window were ordained with drapes of deep, rich colors. The golds, burgundys, and navys mixed together form an impressive picture. Speaking of pictures the ornate frames were filled with dated artwork. I didn't have an eye for art, but I was sure these were original and probably highly sought after art. One would think that with a campus as a large as this estate, there would be signs inside to lead the newbies to the correct location. One would also be wrong to think that way. Instead I noticed older students who were wearing lanyards. Every so often of of them would say first years this way. I decided to follow their directions. After a series of turns down long, equally ornate hallways, my path finally opened up into brightly lit room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed four different tables were set up in each corner of the room. There were no labels to signify which table was which. Each corner was decorated with a different color however. All of my older brothers had attended this school. Therefore I knew that the red table was for the bloods, the green for the bounds, the yellow for the bittens, and the blue was for the borns. I made my way towards the blue corner. I had never been around this many different types of wolves. I noticed my wolf began to perk up. I wasn't sure why. I was too busy scanning my surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed many people were mingling around catching up. I noticed a couple of girls from my high school: Ashley and Jasmine. I wanted to avoid them with every fiber of my being. Ashley Langshire also came from a very prestigious family. We ran in the same social circles and often found ourselves attending the same publicity events. We were friendly, but she never wasted an opportunity to let me know she would like to be more. That was not something I was interested in. Luckily for me, she was very into her conversation with Jasmine and another male whom I didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my wolf began to try to rise to the surface. That was weird. He had been antsy since I entered this room, but I wasn't sure why. I closed my eyes and took a few seconds to reason with him and calm him down. Once I  opened my eyes I saw another familiar face. Nadia Hazel. She was another wolf born from my town. We went to different schools. While my family was thought of as powerful due to our history and money, Nadia's were known for their work. They devoted their lives to bring important issues out to the open. Therefore we were not often at the same events. Her family didn't necessarily get an invitation to the social events my family deemed acceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Nadia had changed since the last time I saw her, or I was just not paying attention. She was absolutely gorgeous. She was rather petite for a wolf, but her body both curvy and fit. Her luscious ebony locks fell wildly down to kiss her shoulder. Currently she was talking to her twin brother, Marcus. Twins were very rare for wolves. Which is how I knew about Nadia and Marcus. I also knew that she was thought to be extremely smart. Other than that, I really didn't know a whole lot about her. I hoped that I could fix that soon. Why not start now. I made my way towards her when I was approached by....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a story based off of Alyssa Rose Ivy's and Jennifer Snyder's Lunar Academy, Year one series. In this series Lunar academy is a college for werewolves. Every student is sorted into a house based off of what kind of werewolf they are. The houses are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Wolf Born: Think the upper society. They are pure blood werewolf and have a healthy confidence because of if. Many of them believe themselves to be royalty because their blood lines are pure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Wolf Bitten: These are the ones who were bitten by a werewolf and turned. Some were attacked against their own will. Others chose to become a werewolf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Wolf Blood: These both werewolf and vampire House colors (red)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Wolf Bound: These are both werewolf and witch <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 4 part series. I am only on book 2. Honestly the authors don't give a lot of details as to how any of this is possible, but I thought this would be a fun story to follow and create. Let your imagination run wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only rules are keep it clean. Nothing crude, nasty, or trashy. You may allude to whatever, but nothing graphic.</td>",
