A lot of times it hold the gods personally and memory inside it.  Though the ages after Rome fall.  It was loss until World War One in no man\u2019s land a Big Bertha Artillery shell uncover the ring and a American solider found it.  More like hit him on the head and collect it for his wife.  The solider went home after the war, both was kill in Chicago during the Al Capone control the city.  The ring was taken by a dirty cop and sold to a pawn shop.  The Ring was lost after the pawn shop owner didn\u2019t pay enough for a dirty cop and got a bullet in the head.  The ring was lost after that and for almost a century it was lost until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking towards home when I notice a garage sale.  I walk to the driveway and I saw the house was for sale.  I walk down to the driveway and saw a lot of old stuff.  I look for something unreal or one of a kind.  Then I found a golden thick ring with a hippopotamus on it.  It have a huge belly on it like it was pregnant.  It have ancient Egyptian glyph on it.  I took it and ask for how much for it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to bother you madam.  But can you tell me how much this ring worth?\u201d  I ask the elderly woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a nice young lady with manner now these days.  Last young lady without manners call me a old bone hag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ring is free.  I forgot to ask your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatherine is the name.  Kat to friends.  Thank you for the ring and here five dollar for the ring.  Then I started to walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way walking back home I decided to try the ring on my finger.  The next thing I know the whole world turn black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world I knew was gone, like god turn off the sun with a light switch.  I know I\u2019m still can see but nothing.  I hear myself breathing.  The next think I knew the light was back on.  But I wasn\u2019t in America.  The city I was in look like city in THE MUMMY 2(before they were attack by the Dog Creatures).  Like hym, kya, whatever city.  I walk down the street, I hope it was.  I saw a red carpet, a verrrrrrry long carpet straight to a massive building.  I think it was the Palace of all places.  I put both feet on the carpet and the next thing I was moving fast.  The carpet was moving like cartoon \u2018The Jetson\u2019 where the sidewalks move.  Not like highway speeds.  I want to scream for both fun and fright.  Well I did scream(Don\u2019t look at me like that, well you are).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to stop.  The carpet was no more so I have to stop.  The room where I stop was full of people well all woman and no men.  I saw what it look like an ancient Egyptian party.  I walk in the party, they didn\u2019t notice me.  Was I look into the past?  They didn\u2019t have red carpets faster than car?  Who knows!  Stranger thing have happen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange thing do happen Kat.\u201d  I yelp with a screech and the woman from the party kneeling to the woman who was behind the massive silk curtains.  I can tell she was on a chair but it could be a throne.  Crap I in it now.  \u201cPlease do not knee for me.  You do not know who I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do want to know how you know my name?\u201d  That a good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you put on the ring I knew who you are.  I show you who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman finish talking I saw her shadow from the curtains and she was walking towards them.  The curtains open and my mouth was on the floor like those cartoon when they saw a hot babe.  She was black hair lightly tan.  Egyptian make-up, the breast was the size of a VW beetle and the woman was extremely pregnant.  The woman belly was a perfect sphere.  Her belly is the size of two city bus and the weird part is (beside that she naked, no amount of clothes can cover that belly and breast) that she still can walk.  She waddle to me and I said the most stupid thing to say to a pregnant woman in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you go in labor, It will be a flood and I will drown.\u201d  I clap with both of my hand to don\u2019t say another word.  Every woman in the room look at me and the only sound is chuckles from the pregnant woman.  \u201cThat was the fist time in thousands of years I laugh.  The name is Tawaret.  I am the Egyptian\u2019s goddess of pregnancy and childbirth.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explains the breast and the belly.  I see the babies kicking though the skin.  She is immortal, she look at the age of 19.  I have to ask Tawaret a few questions.  I hope she don\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour in the ring that contain everything about me.  Any woman who wear the ring, with my aid and I show you my powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat like your permission right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is.  Before you ask another question.  You want to know about my powers?\u201d  I nodded.  Tawaret smile.  Five woman from nowhere appear on the steps, they have cloth cover breast and pelvic area, it like the first bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese servant will help me to show you the extent of my power.\u201d  They undo the cloth cover the breast.  The servants breasts was in the state of expansion.  Now I feel envy for them from being flat as a board to the size of DD.  \u201cI can increase the breast size to any size you wish.  I can\u2019t create pregnancy, but I can create the illusion of the pregnancy until I steal the real one for you.\u201d  What did Tawaret mean by steal the real pregnancy?  \u201cI can transfer the pregnancy from person to person.  The person who had the pregnancy transfer won\u2019t remember being pregnant and any proof of it will vanish.  When the pregnancy return to the person the memory will return and the evince will come back.  I help the body by strengthen the back and legs to help you carry the babies.  I also prevent the childbirth or labor for as long as I want.\u201d  Prevent labor?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean prevent labor?\u201d  I said with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can extended the pregnancy from the normal to as long as I want.  The babies will grow older inside you and stay pregnant.  My most powerful magic can prevent the babies aging\u201d  I have a image of a pregnant woman who pregnancy pass twenty years with triples.  She will make Octomom look skinny.  \u201cI can change memories from the people around you think either you are normal or pregnant.  Transfer and extended pregnancy I can do for now.  The magic I have is lock because I am too weak to use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you unlock it?\u201d  It was a good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy using my powers.  When I grow strong enough I can unlock my powers one by one.  Outside the ring I can talk inside your head and use your five essence.\u201d  Essence?  Does she mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSight, hearing, touch, taste and smell?  That do you mean by essence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawaret nodded and smile.  \u201cYou are ready with my help to the world.  I will learn what you will see and gain from your memories from objects I don\u2019t know.  In the ring it been a hour when you enter, outside it been a moment.  I hope you don\u2019t trip when you return to the world.\u201d  Tawaret wave and the very second she stop waving I was back on the sidewalk.  I look at my watch and it was a few seconds gone. <span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cHELLO KAT!\u201d</span>  I heard Tawaret scream in my mind and I jump.  Unluckily for the dog owner bark at the same time that Tawaret scare the crap out of me.  The man said he was sorry and I told the owner that I was thinking of history in my head.  The guy walk away.  I heard laughing and I have to talk like a mind reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Tawaret for scaring me like that.  I nearly jump on that small dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.  I don\u2019t like dog.  Dogs make me remember a family member I hate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got off the bench and continue to walk home.  In the time I walk home, I\u2019ve had a idea for the weekend and today is Friday.  I enter in my home and I saw a note on the table.  It said that mom is picking up supper and she won\u2019t be home until later.  The only one home was Alyix my seven year old little sister.  I walk to her room and I saw that Alyix with her friends.  Playing with dolls and games.  Alyix look like I do at her age.  I enter my door and look at my mirror.  I have brown hair nicely long in a pony tail.  Green eyes and nice lips.  Normal but not too big and red.  Face look attractive.  Five foot eight inches.  A body of a teen boy.  I\u2019m flat as a board in the breast department.  Alyix was look like me in the same age.  Mom look like me in the same way but her hair to her butt and her breast is the size of volleyballs.  Mom got really big when she was pregnant with Alyix.  I feel a bit left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI herd a knock at the door and it was....</span></div></div>",

Alyix felt pressure in her stomach and she look down.  She saw that her dress was moving forward and she saw that her belly was blowing up like a balloon.  She was smiling ear to ear.

She lift up the dress and saw her belly look pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis, I\u2019m having a baby.\u201d  Alyix giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlyix remember, there no baby in there and you light as a feather.

Unaccustomed to her new form and nearly falling over from it. Already gasping for breath as she reached the front door, she took a deep breath and peered through the peep hole. There she saw a woman in her mid thirties who had short brown hair in a pixie cut, curvaceous in denim pants, tank top and sweater jacket as she had two kids with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Ms.Wallmore, our neighbor.\" Kat thought as she slowly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kat! Sorry if its a bit late but can you watch Rachel and Mindy for me. If its not a bother.\" Ms. Wallmore said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can transfer Alyix's babies into them...\" Kat thought as she turned to Ms. Wallmore. \"Sure thing!\" Kat said with glee as the two ran in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They early wakers but they sleep early so I'll be back in the morning for them.\" Ms. Wallmore said as she handed some money to Kat. Kat took the money and placed it in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two behave! Give mommy some sugar!\" Ms. Wallmore said as the two giggled and kissed their mom, one on each side of her cheek. Kat only smiled as she cradled her belly. Kat closed the door as Rachel and Mindy were inside. They playmates of Alyix and maybe they could help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Alyix?\" asked Rachel as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's upstairs.\" Kat pointed up as the two ran up. Kat slowly followed them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way thats real!\" Kat heard as she reached her room. She saw Mindy and Rachel were next to Alyix who was sitting on Kat's bed. Alyix's hands on her large twin size belly. The two were poking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna be like her too?\" Kat asked as Rachel and Mindy looked at Kat iin a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember I used some of my magic to alternate their memories so they believe that not only you but Alyix is pregnant all this time.\" Tawaret said in Kat's head. Kat shook her head, not used to mental telepathy, Rachel and Mindy looked at each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

She couldn't move since she couldn't carry her belly. Kat was startled by the reaction but it was better in her favor. Mindy too was excited as she jumped up and down. Mindy was the classmate of Alyix while Rachel was 7. They both had short brown hair and looked like their mother except Mindy had a dress while Rachel was in a jogging attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats unfair! I wanna feel too! It can't be just Rachel!\" Mindy pouted as Kat approached the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! No need to yell!

They closed their eyes as Kat placed her hands on top of their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll do the rest.\" said Tawaret in Kat's head. Kat only sighed as she felt a surge of energy flow through her and into her hands as Alyix's belly began to shrink and Mindy's and Rachel's grow to full term with one a piece. They stumbled backwards opposite of each other as they opened their eyes. It went wider as they saw their huge bellies and placed their hands on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it move!\" Rachel said in an excited way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mine kicked!\" Mindy said in an excited way too. Kat was happy to transfer them elsewhere and she needed to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so cool, Kat!\" Alyix said as she went back and forth between Rachel and Mindy. Feeling their bellies as they laughed and giggled. Kat let them but after 5 minutes. Rachel and Mindy found out they couldn't get up. Their bellies too heavy for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its really heavy!\" Mindy said trying to get up. Cradling her belly but failing. Rachel doing the same but with the same results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to take them?\" Kat asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" They said in unison as Kat put her left hand on Mindy's belly and her right on Rachel's belly. Then she felt the same energy as before flow within her then into each of her hands. Then Rachel's and Mindy's began to deflate until they were flat again. Kat wondered what happened then felt her belly surged forward! She arched her back as it continued to grow. To twins full term she felt it continue to grow even larger reaching more the 2 feet from her as she reached full term with triplets as she stumbled on her back. Panting for air as she felt the three inhabitants move. She groaned as she used her elbows to lift herself a it, her belly blocking her way in sight of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?? Alyix said with a confused look. The three had the same expression and seemed to be playing with Alyix's dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Tawaret...\" Kat thought as she looked at her ring. \"Nothing, just the triplets really moving in there.\" As Kat rubbed her belly. The three continued playing together as Kat struggled to a sitting position. She hoisted herself up on the bed and looked at her large belly. It nearly covered her lap as she felt the kicks and elbows, rubbing the contusions of the three. She was in a bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was past 9 in the evening as the three were fast asleep in thier pajamas while Kat looked on watching them soundly as she leaned on the door. They had dinner composed of chinese food. She slowly made her way to her room and sat on her bed once more. Carressing her belly as she looked at the ring once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you can alter memories as well.\" Kat said to the ring. She heard what seemed to be someone stirring in their sleep, then a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry child I must've fallen asleep after todays events. Yes I did so after I transfer the remaining two into you. Doing this has never made me so tired.\" Tawaret said yawning once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it has been a while since someone used you so I can see why.\" Kat giggled, carressing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you seem to enjoy yourself. I have one last gift before I go back to sleep.\" Tawaret said as Kat felt energy within her surge once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and what's that?\" Kat asked in a puzzled way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that you have the original pregnancy in you. I'll transfer what was left now into you.\" Tawaret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was left?\" Kat said as she felt her thighs grow. Her hips widen to accomodate her large belly as she felt herself rise from the mattress since her butt was also growing. She was gaining a more maternal figure as she stood up and explored herself. She rubbed her butt then her hips and last her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I look so motherly!\" Kat blushed as she twist and turned to look at her body then she felt warmth in her chest. She looked down as she cupped them. Her once flat chest now had lumps growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.... Is this for real??\" Kat thought as she felt them continue their growth. From mere lumps as they raced through the alphabet only to stop at D cups. She cupped them and squeled at their sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! I have breasts!\" Kat squealed somemore as her occupants began to move about more causing her to moan as she sat on her bed. One hand cupping her breast while the other carressing her belly. She was tired as she hit the way. Smiling as she carressed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts had expanded about four sizes, and her areolas were larger and incredibly sensitive to touch. Each touch sent a shiver down her spine. Her ass and hips had grown as well, to help accommodate her large belly. She felt her ass and felt it jiggle as she felt it. Her belly was huge and stretch mark free. Her belly button was popped out and her belly had a slight shine to it. Kat smiled as she pulled a shirt over her breasts, only to find that it only covered half her belly, leaving her belly button exposed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could really use those maternity clothes now\" she said to herself as she waddled down the stairs to the kitchen, and saw...</span></div></div>",

It would just put Alyix's life in more danger. Not that she didn't have faith in Tawaret's powers, it was just that Tawaretwasn't at full power yet.

Taking her left hand and cradling her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I never thought it would be this heavy!\" Kat thought as she looked at her belly.

As she is waddling with a sextuplet belly at around seven months she catches a lot of stares from the other shoppers. People whispering to each other \"look at how big she is\" or \"she's so young\", each comment getting little notice from Kat as she focuses on her belly. Alyxis is however paying attention to the murmurs and the whispers of the others and starts to get a devilish idea. Since she was affected so strongly with the power of Tawaret she doesn't get her mind rewritten like others. She knows her sister is not supposed to be pregnant with six babies, she also noticed that she took another mothers baby after bumping into her earlier. So Alyxis starts to look around so that she can test her theory, and sure enough waddling towards the absentminded Kat is a woman easily pregnant. The woman is quite large and probably due soon or carrying twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they get closer Alyxis 'accidentally' bumps Kat, which inturn made Kat collide bellies with the other woman. As the woman fell her baby bump deflated, turning into a flat stomach before she fully hit the ground. As she deflated Kat inflated to larger proportions, her belly surged forward with seven maybe eight month twins. She also received extra pudge on her thighs and ass, and her bra size lurched forward a size maybe two. Kat was a sight to see she was now carrying octuplets in the seventh month, at least, and her body had changed to accommodate that reality. The woman got up and started to yell at Kat but thought better of that seeing as she had just run into a very pregnant woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was staring at her belly and slowly rubbing where the eight children were kicking not sure how to process what has happened to her. She looks up to see the now non-pregnant woman walk away shaking her head and then over at Alyxis who has a pouty look on her face. \"Sorry sis I tripped and didn't mean to pump into you how are you and the babies.\" Alyxis was pouting but in her head she was laughing maniacally because her plan worked. \"It's ok sis it was an accident after all. Just try to be more careful in the future.\" With that the set off towards the exit once more, all be it at a slower pace.</span></div></div>",

But a room full of a lot of pregnant ladies might do it.\" Kat wasn't sure what to do she could keep putting babies in her sister till Tawaret was strong enough but who knows how big that can be. Also she doesn't know how well her magic worked to help her sister with the pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey so if I'm wearing the ring doesn't it only help me have an easier pregnancy not others?\" Kat was starting to panic a bit not knowing the answer. \"Well every pregnancy that I transfer has some of my magic attached to it so it does make the receiver carry the load easier. But no where near what it would you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kat started to panic and touched Alyxis stomach to take one of the babies. Slowly she swelled to full term with the singleton baby and her sister shrunk down to quads. Feeling a baby inside of herself was a new sensation for Kat. She didn't hate the feeling but she wasn't sure she liked it either. Holding her belly she got an idea and asked Tawaret to see if it would work even if it were crazy. \"Tawaret does me being pregnant increase your power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course actually if you are the one pregnant I get more of the cosmic energy and it makes me stronger than just you being around others. I can see what your thinking and it would work but it does come with risks I don't know how much energy I would need to fix the accident with Alyxis. And to that end every time I transfered a baby to you I'd use some of the stored energy.\" Kat was not happy with that answer but she also thought it was the best idea she had with the time that she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well since I have a baby in my womb does that give you enough energy to transfer babies to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From anyone except your sister yes, in fact I could transfer up to triplets at my current energy level.\" Tawaret did like the idea of getting power faster but still was afraid of what it would take to fix her mistake and at what cost that could be for Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that settles it I'm going to go out and fill myself full of as many babies as it takes to get my sister back to normal.\" With that Kat headed out the door to find pregnant ladies to transfer from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Struggling up the stairs was funny to her for some reason, she was starting to enjoy having a belly hinder her movement. Finding a seat on the mostly empty bus Kat spots what she is looking for on her quest. Sitting a little ways down the isle from her was a woman heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tawaret do I need to be in direct contact to transfer from someone?\" Kat said as quietly thinking to the goddess hoping for a favorabl answer. \"Well if I had more power no you would just need to be close to her to take them. But as of right now physical touch is needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat slowly got up at the next stop and made her way over to the woman, sitting down accross from her she strikes up a conversation. \"Hi, my name is Kat how are you today?\" Kat plastered a cheesy smile on her face trying to befriend the other woman. \"Hello deer my names Sarah I'm doing good just having trouble with the twins. They're getting realy hard to move with after eight months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good to hear I'm actually only carrying one but I've always wondered what It'd be like to have more. Do you mind if I feel your tummy?\" Thankfully for Kat she was a young pregnant woman and other pregnant women were not to worried about letting her feel there bellies. Sarah shook her head smiling as she took Kat's hand and guided it towards her belly. As soon as she made contact Tawaret used her magic to transfer the twins to Kat. Sarah slowly shrank down to a flat stomach as Kat swelled to greater heights. As it slowed Kat noticed that not only did she take Sarah's babies but it seems that she took her extra weight and breast growth from the pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all done do you love the extra goodies you got in this transfer Kat? Since I had extra power I was able to take the whole pregnancy, breasts and weight gain included. In the future you can just tell me if you want the pregnancy or the babies only, if you don't specify I'll just take the whole thing.\" Kat was flabbergasted not only was she now looking ready to burst with triplets but her ass and thighs hand plumped up as well. Her breasts were up a cup size and she felt even heavier than she should have with just the babies. \"Actually I kind of like the whole thing but for today I think I should just take the babies since I might need to take a lot more and my shirt is basically a bra already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the bus pulled to the mall and Kat decided to slowly waddle towards the mall to grow her now massive belly.</span></div></div>",

As the wearer of my ring you can carry huge pregnancies to ten months.\" Kat was slowly making her way down the malls corridors looking for the maternity store. She figured that this all started there and it was after all an easy place to find pregnancies she hoped. She also planned on getting the biggest maternity dress she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly is the limit on the number of babies I can carry?\" Kat could here Tawaret give of a little giggle as she answered her. \"Well I don't really know the full extent of my power, the last wearer was a medicine woman that only used me to help other conceive and save babies from miscarriage. The largest I've ever made someone is six babies so your sister was on the verge of tying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm already at the halfway mark as it is. How many do I need before you can fix things?\" Kat was hoping the answer would be only a few more but deep down she was hoping to test the limits of the ring and make a new record. \"Well I'm not sure at least to the five that she was at maybe more since I'm using my power to transfer and to fix the fabric of reality. There is always a solution that might work as well.\" Tawaret stopped not knowing if it was a good idea or not. \"Well go on what is it\" Kat said with a bit of apprehension in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you were to take on a large number of pregnancies I can definitely transfer what's left in your sister to you. I do know that that would take between eight and fifteen babies to do that. To fix the mistake I've made and send the babies back I don't know if it'll be more or less than that. Since I don't know what exactly happened when I transfered them into her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is I need to cram fifteen babies in my womb to guarantee that we can get the babies out of my sister?\" Kat was a little worried she know that fifteen would be a new record for not only Tawaret but the world if she went into labor, but she did do this to her sister and she had to make it right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could shoot for eight and hope it works but to absolutely be sure you'll need the fifteen yes.\" With that bombshell of a fact Kat waddled into the maternity store to work on stealing twelve more babies in the next three hours.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat waddled into the maternity store where today's adventure had started hoping to find lots of expectant mothers to take from. Unfortunately for her there was only two women in there besides the clerk who was seated behind the counter. \"Oh darn there is no way that these ladies have twelve little ones to give to me.\" Kat was frustrated but decided to go try to find a new dress, after all she would need the room to grow. Carefully she made her way to the back of the store where the larger items are kept. She was having a hard time finding what she wanted so she made her way towards the clerk to ask for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss, can I get some help in the back\" Kat said halfway to the clerk. But what happened next surprised her. The woman slowly got to her feet, she was huge even bigger than Kat. As the clerk got closer Kat saw her name tag and it read April, she was even bigger up close. \"Sorry miss I wouldn't have had you come back knowing that you are so big.\" Kat sighed softly that had not come out right. Tawaret giggled in her head and reminded her that she would be bigger than that soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's fine ma'am I still work here. It's my choice to work as long as I can, having quadruplets will be a hand full and cost a fortune.\" That explained it for Kat the woman was definitely carrying quads and they looked close to full term as well. \"Well I know almost the pain I'm carrying triplets at eight and a half months right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled at that statement which caused Kat to look at her funny. \"Sorry it's just that I'm at eight and a half months as well and my doctor is baffled. Is yours just as surprised you made it this far?\" Kat smiled what are the odds that they are both at the same spot in their pregnancies. \"Yea he thinks it's a miracle but yours must think it's magic.\" With that the two ladies laughed a little felling each other's pain, well for Kat it has only been about fifteen minutes of pain but she can relate slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Who I was looking for the biggest dress you have my err.. aunt is pregnant and they think it might be octuplets.\" The woman gave her a shocked look and mumbled something about being twice as big and led her to the corner. \"Well here are our biggest dresses a few should fit octuplets but some are huge. The only person I've ever seen buy them was just a really fat lady who needed a lot of room.\" Kat thanked her and slowly the woman started to waddle back to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you spend so much time talking to her Kat? Now I have to use extra magic to erase that from her memory.\" Tawaret seemed a bit annoyed but she'd get over it. Kat got the biggest dress down off of the rack and made her way to the changing room. As she entered she saw a woman who looked ready to pop with one enter the other room. 'Perfect' Kat thought going to the room next to her, she slipped out of her clothes awkwardly. When she was fully nude she took time to examine herself in the mirror. What looked back was a woman overdue with twins and farther along than normal for triplets. \"Ok Tawaret take the woman in the other stalls baby.\" Slowly the woman in the other stall started to shrink as Kat ballooned even further. Turns out the woman was overdue with one, she was hoping to get a twinner but beggars can't be choosers. Now sporting a swell just as large as the clerks Kat slipped the massive dress over her head. It was way to big so big that Kat didn't know if fifteen would even fill the dress but she would find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she made her way out of the changing room and saw the newly non pregnant woman leave the other stall. She seemed confused about why she was even her after all she wasn't pregnant. Kat made her way to the counter and stopped just short as the clerk helped an older lady buy what looked to be a gift. Focusing on the clerk Kat told Tawaret to go ahead and start the transfer of the babies. Slowly the clerk started to sit easier in the chair and lost her baby bump rapidly. Kat however was gaining a very large growth spurt as she leaned against the counter to help her support the new quads. As the clerk was now with out child Kat's belly stopped at an obvious octuplet filled womb. She stuck out at least three feet in the front and was struggling to get used to her new center of gravity. As she was concentrating she noticed that the clerk looked rather fat still and her breasts still seems to be milk laden. \"Hey Tawaret why does the clerk still have milk in her breasts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kat you only took the babies not the added weight and the milky breasts from this woman. She had been eating for five after all she put on 110 pounds for her little ones.\" Kat felt bad she had taken the babies from this woman but left her with the side effects of pregnancy. \"So is there anyway to take the rest of her pregnancy even after I've taken the babies\" Kat asked hoping Tawaret had the power. \"Yes I can do that since she is the last person that you took from but at a cost. If you fix this you'll have to bump the baby total to seventeen to help your sister.\" Kat thought about it was it fair to leave this woman like this, but could she afford two more added to her list. \"Yes I owe her that much do it\" said Kat making her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the clerk started to slim down some more and her breast shrank at an alarming rate. She dropped 110 pounds and went from a FF cup down to a large B cup. Tawaret also seems to have help the woman with her wardrobe changing the clothes to fit her new frame. Kat started to swell she put on the 110 extra pounds and her breasts ballooned to HH cups full of milk. She was now sitting at 275 pounds which was as if she gained a little to much for her pregnancy but who was going to yell at the woman carrying octuplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kat got to the counter she paid for the dress and headed to the stores bathroom to pee. She found it difficult to position herself on the toilet and even harder to stand back up after she was done. She could only imagine what it would feel like if Tawaret wasn't making it a little easier for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the restroom she saw the two other lady's in the store one was definitely carrying twins and the other only had one if Kat had to guess. She told Tawaret to take their babies only this time not needing too much extra weight. The two women slimmed down quite a lot and made Kat feel better about not taking all the weight too. She was now massive cradling her womb that was filled with eleven children. It stuck out four feet infront of her and two feet accross. Every woman that was in the store pitied her not wanting to have such a burden themselves. Kat was actually close to having an orgasm as she rubbed her new tummy, she was blushing from feeling that way. \"Oh my sweet Kat I knew you were the perfect person to receive my powers. It'll only get better the bigger you get.\" Kat was over the moon and looking forward to pushing the limits on the power of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way out of the store needing six more babies and only having two and a half hours to find them and get home to try and help Alyxis.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kat was a sight to see she was positively huge now. Sitting at eleven babies in her monumental belly, weighing in at a large 275 pounds and sporting HH cup tits, she was understandably tired. She felt as if every single pound was weighing down on her now large stomach and to look at her form she would probably be right. The dress she was wearing was a flowery sundress and the sunny print was doing very little to hide her motherly form. As she waddled along, with great difficulty, she noticed that her stomach started to get shooting pains. 'Oh no I can't be going into labor can I' Kat panicked thinking the worst. \"Calm down my dear if I'm reading this right it's just the cravings and hunger from all the babies that are packed in that belly of yours.\" Kat was relieved but also really annoyed she didn't really have time to waste but she did need to take care of the babies she had inside of her, after all she was essentially babysitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was luckily close to the food court seeing as someone thought it was a great idea to put the maternity store close, they'd be right in that assumption. \"Hey Tawaret why do I feel so heavy I can barely move and it feels as if my spine will break. I can't imagine what it would feel like if I didn't have your help.\" Kat was really struggling which Tawaret found very odd she knew it wouldn't be like carrying a feather but it should be easier with her blessing. \"Oh dear me Kat!\" Tawaret practically shouted in her mind. \"Hurry and sit down NOW!\" Kat was starting to get worried she hadn't really heard Tawaret freak out yet, was something wrong she thought to herself. \"Oh my poor Kat, you will be ok I'm so sorry I didn't think to check this sooner. I'm actually surprised you haven't gone into labor, it almost proves you're in fact the perfect host for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Tawaret you're starting to scare me I don't want to give birth to eleven babies right now, let alone stick my little sister with quads.\" Kat instinctively caressed her pregnant middle trying to soothe the many kicks from with in. \"Ok dear I'm sorry about this but we will have to add one more baby to the mix but what I'm about to do should help you out.\" With that statement Kat felt a burst of energy from within her womb and she actually swelled a few more inches out. But as she swelled the pressure lessened and she felt more vibrant. \"Wow what did you do to me\" Kat asked thinking that whatever it was was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry my little dove, I didn't think about it till you seemed to be having so much trouble but the blessing that I bestow my host wasn't activated at all. You were intact feeling the full effects of this pregnancy which is surprising you handled it so well. In fact you are sitting at eight to eight and a half months pregnant with eleven. It really shouldn't be possible to get this big and not go into labor without help from magic. I had miscalculated just how low my power was. Usually my blessing is an automatic power the wearer of my ring gets, but any who it is activated now and will stay that way from now on.\" Kat was actually speechless she had filled herself with eleven babies and didn't have the blessing of a fertility God to help her, how is that even possible. \"Ok so I do feel better and now that it's in effect I won't go into labor correct.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct dear you will be fine till ten months or longer if you wish to use more of my magic. But that is for a later date.\" With this news Kat got to her feet and noticed an instant change. She didn't feel but about half as heavy as she actually was. She started to waddle, now only because of her size not her weight, towards the food court in anticipation of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the many restaurants she noticed that a group of ladies were seated at a table and all three were heavily pregnant one had to be a twinner at least. So Kat order six burgers and a large soda from the stereotypical burger joint and proceeded to sit close to the ladies to gorge. As she ate Kat started to think to herself that it'd be so much easier if she some how knew the month and number of babies each of the ladies had. \"Tawaret is there anyway your magic can help me to see how far along a woman is with the number of babies she has?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I can make that so and it seems that it won't even cost me too much energy. No extra passengers needed to make the magic happen.\" With that Kat started to notice something in her minds eye as she looked at the ladies. Jackpot two of the ladies had twins at eight months and the other was a singlet at a whopping ten months. Knowing that she needs seven more babies to fill her quota, five in one go was a big help. Seeing as the women were so tiny other than their bellies Kat opted for the baby transfer over full pregnancy again. Slowly each woman started to deflate and clothes changed to fit better, but Kat started to swell. Bigger and bigger she went she was adding five at once this time the biggest growth spurt so far. She felt like a ballon filling with water, she grew to new heights her belly started to sag further and further towards the ground as she sat in the creaking chair. Just as her growth finished she stood up fearing the chair would give way if she stayed in it any longer. She was now sitting at sixteen babies in her womb and it showed. The dress was now starting to fit her somewhat as it barely touched the ground now. She was now almost as much belly as girl. She stuck out five and a half feet in front and three feet accross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her watch she had a hour and a half to get two more babies and to make it home. But where to get those two...</span></div></div>",

She knew her neighbor was pregnant with twins so Kat had a sure fire way to meet her goal close to home. She waddles her way to the bus stop catching a lot of stairs on her journey through the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, mommy, look at that lady she is huge\" a little girl says as her mom blushes not wanting to embarrass Kat. \"Oh it's alright ma'am I am huge. In fact I'm expecting sixteen little ones anyday now.\" The mothers jaw dropped at that news that was just unheard of. She hurried away with her daughter staring at Kat as she tried to understand what was clearly in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat made it to the bus and squeezed her maternal form onboard. The bus driver who must have been a veteran didn't even bat an eye nothing seemed to faze him anymore. Kat made her way to the side sets and took up a whole section. Thankfully the bus wasn't that crowded and off she headed towards home. As she sat waiting a young woman looking to be about twenty inched closer to Kat curiosity in her eyes. \"Hello I'm sorry to intrude like this but I was wondering if you're actually pregnant?\" The young woman blushed not knowing exactly what to do or really say after such a forward question. \"Well yes I'm pregnant it's not fat or even a fake belly. In fact I'm expecting sixteen little ones.\" Kat smiled watching the wheels in the woman head spin. \"How is that even possible?\" Now this one stumped Kat she wasn't going to say 'I have a fertile God in a ring' no she had to come up with a good excuse. Seeing as how Kat is eighteen years old she had a plan. \"Well actually I'm being a surrogate for one of my relatives and turns out all of the eggs that were implanted took and mutinied.\" Kat was hoping this would be good enough to sate the woman curiosity. \"Well I've never heard of that happening before but it's pretty obvious you're that big after all. Well I'm sorry to bother you it's just that I think pregnancy is you no... Kinda sexy.\" With that the woman blushed and moved away from Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus slowed to a stop as Kat processed what the woman had said. It was her stop and to Kat's surprise the woman exited as well and went up the street to a house close to her own. She wanted to chase after her but couldn't easily for obvious reasons and decided she had better things to focus on right now. Kat waddled towards her neighbors, she had one hour left plenty of time to help Alyxis out. As she made it to the door...</span></div></div>",

She didn't really want to admit it but she was getting turned on by the thought of growing larger with more life. The door opened to a very large woman, she was overdue with twins. She was sitting at ten months and the babies seemed to be massive. \"Oh hi Kat how is the super mom to be?\" The woman asked her looking both intrigued and concerned. \"Oh I'm doing great Mrs. Donawey\" Kat said smiling at the woman who was going to finally fill her quota. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they started small talk Kat told Tawaret to take the babies only, she didn't want it to be any harder to move since the rings blessing only goes so far. Soon Mrs. Donawey started to shrink her belly becoming practically flat. But Kat on the other hand swelled to be more belly than woman at this point sitting at a massive six feet out to her front and three feet accross. She had done it she had made it to eighteen babies now she could help Alyxis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and left the now thinner woman standing in her doorway. Carefully Kat waddled to her house she was noticing that it felt as if she were carrying quads now. The power of the ring was truly amazing. She entered her house to see Alyxis still asleep on the couch, and still pregnant with four babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Tawaret what is the diagnosis, can we send the quadruplets back to the ladies they came from?\" Kat looked at her sister who by a child's standards was huge, but as she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror she realized just how relative huge is. \"Well I'd say to take one more from her so that the twins she took are back together then I'll try to send the original triplets back to the rightful mother.\" With that Kat swelled with another child as her sister shrank a little more. \"Ok now I'm sitting at nineteen babies surely that's enough to send the triplets back.\" Tawaret started to concentrate on sending the triplets home but it seemed to be useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kat I can't send them back but I know since you're more pregnant I can pull them into you. I still don't know how this happened I must have sapped a lot of energy with such a long distance transfer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is alright Tawaret I'm actually ok with taking the extra triplets into me. I'm weirdly turned on by the thought of growing more massive.\" So with out further a do the triplets finally left Alyxis and nestled into Kat's huge womb. She was now huge beyond compare, her belly was sagging lower than her knees and pushing her breast closer to her face. She looked at her sleeping sister as she heard her mother pull into the driveway. As quick as anyone with a huge belly filled with twenty two babies can move, she made her way up to her room and sat/fell into her bed. It didn't take long for her to doze off into lala land and sleep like a log. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that Kat was back to her baby free figure she decided to get ready for her day. She got out of bed ready to tackle the day, as she walked into the bathroom she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. What she saw made her feel really confused, she was free of a baby bump but somehow she just felt empty. She pushed such thoughts out of her head and proceeded to get ready to shower. As she showed Kat still felt a bit off and wanted to try to put yesterday's events behind her, so as she finished drying off she looked down at her ring. The ring that had introduced her to Tawaret, the ring that had caused this whole mess, she quickly grabbed it and tryed to yank it off. To Kat's surprise nothing happened the ring was stuck, so she pulled harder and still nothing. \"Hey sweetie I know that yesterday was tough but you don't have to try to throw me away like that.\" Kat almost forgot that the goddess living in the ring could see what she did and hear what she thought. \"Why won't you let me take the ring off Tawaret what gives\"Kat asked the goddess frantically. \"Oh that's not my doing dear there is some other force acting on the ring I'm currently shoved in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean some other force and what do you mean shoved in the ring?\" Kat wasn't liking how this was going she couldn't remove the ring and she was definitely starting to feel empty again. \"Why yes dear I have no idea how I got trapped in this ring. I'm a goddess after all, I'm not supposed to be in an object. I'm supposed to be sitting on a throne in my palace. This has to be the work of a magic user and a strong one at that, but who knows why they did this.\" Kat was now sitting on her bed naked her flat stomach still glistening with water. \"So you're telling me that you don't know how you're in the ring and for what reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not exactly I know why I'm in 'this' ring, it's the one my priestesses used to contact me but that was a long time ago. When you first got this ring I thought I was just weak, which I was and still am. But I thought I could leave with enough power, that seems to not be the case since I'm still here. The more troublesome fact is that you seem to have bonded with the ring. I don't know why or how, but something tells me we will find out.\" Tawaret had a slight edge to her voice as if she was a little worried about what was happening. \"Ok well I'll just have to see what happens in the mean time I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kat headed downstairs to see if Alyxis was up and hoped her mom had made breakfast. Walking into the kitchen Kat was met with a note 'Kat went to IHOP with your sister be back later - love mom XOXO'. \"Well that figures I guess I'll eat and then go for a jog.\" Kat poured her a bowl of cereal and ate while watching some tv. Finished with her breakfast and show Kat decides to get dressed for a jog. She grabs a pair of yoga pants and a tank top, as she's getting dressed she spots the dress she had used last night on the floor. She felt herself get a little arroused at the idea of being that big but quickly shoved the dress under her bed and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a great day for a jog the sun was out the sky had some nice clouds that would help shade her from time to time. She headed towards the park and the jogging trails. Halfway through the trail she stops to take a break and rest, sitting on a bench she leans her head back and sighs. She is startled by a woman coming up behind her and talking. \"Oh it can't be that bad dear, you're nice and thin jogging is a breeze.\" Kat looked up at the woman to see who could have made that comment and was met with a very pregnant woman. \"Oh uh yea definitely not as hard as you're having miss, you look huge.\" Kat slapped her palm to her four head that was embarrassing. \"Hahaha yeah I am quit large, but I'm due anyday with twins so I should be. I'm actually trying to walk to induce labor.\" Kat was happy the woman seemed to be very kind and the more may looked at her round belly the sexier she looked too. \"I'm sorry I'm so ditzy sometimes you look beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for saying that. I'll be off now, I am ready to get this huge load off my back for a while.\" With those words Kat couldn't take it anymore. \"Tawaret I want those babies no I need to feel them in me.\" With that the woman started to deflate and Kat ballooned through the months. Finally settling on nine months with twins. She felt so good but to her dismay the tank top she had on rode up her huge belly and the yoga pants she had started to feel overly tight. Coming down from her expansion high the reality of what she had just done started to sink in. \"What am I doing I can't de taking babies I'm only eighteen I look like a whale.\" Kat was freaking out why was she doing this she needed to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat got up and easily waddled her way home, the ring thankfully makes walking easier with Tawaret's blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we head across town to a young woman who is twenty two years old and looking at an old antique shop for some cool stuff. Her name is Lana and she is an above average beauty with a firm ass and C cup breasts. She has a toned stomach and legs. Her face is quit warm and inviting with brown hair and blue eyes she easily has a calming effect on people. She weighs in at about 120 pounds and is slim for a five foot six inch tall woman. As she is looking through the jewelry section she notices a ring it was silver and had some Greek markings on it. the ring seemed to call out to her it wanted her to try it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana walked over to the counter and rang the bell. After a few moments a woman who looked to be in her older thirties waddled out. The woman was stunning and seemed to glow. Some of this was the awe inspiring beauty she possesses and the other could be credited to a maternal glow. She was heavily pregnant had to be late in with triplets to Lana's guess. Lana looked at the woman and blushed, she had always had a fetish for pregnancy and this woman was a goddess to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you miss\"the woman asked Lana. \"Oh weell yyyou can help me sseeethis ring over her.\" Lana stumbled through her words trying to convey her interest in the ring to the woman. \"Why that won't be a problem miss.\" The clerk giggled and opened the case to get the ring. As she picked the ring up Lana noticed a feint glow in the ring. Oh well it was probably just a shimmer on the silver. Lana grabbed the ring and proceeded to place it on her right ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the ring on her finger the world around her went dark. Lana was in shock she couldn't see anything the thought she was blind but a flash of light finally calmed her. The light filled the room and Lana could make out a throne. At the top was a giant of a woman with two lions on either side. \"Come for my child let Rhea see you.\" The huge woman bellowed to Lana who was still a little frightened at her predicament. \"I'm sorry ma'am but I don't know where I am or who you are.\" Lana slowly crossed her arms and walked towards the giant. \"Why I am the Titan Rhea and I'm the mother of gods. I am all powerfully Titan of fertility and childbirth.\" Lana looked at the Titan and was still confused. \"Ok well that answers who you are but where am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you're in the ring on you're finger or more accurately your mind I'm just making you see my throne room. I've been trapped in this ring by some mortal for a purpose and it seems fate has chosen you to be my champion.\" Lana was still worried but starting to grasp what I was happening. She had gone crazy, yeah that's it she had snapped and lost her mind. As sudden as the room and Titan had appeared it was gone and Lana was back at the antique shop looking at the clerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana blushed seeing the woman again, \"is that what you desire child?\" A voice whispered in her head. Lana didn't question the voice she was to busy ogling the clerk. \"Yes I'd love to be that big\" Lana mumbled to herself eyes glazing over. \"Then it shall be done\" said Rhea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the woman infront of Lana started to deflate right before her eyes. Lana looked on in shock why wasn't the woman freaking out. As the woman stopped deflating Lana started to swell. She shot past the months then into multiple babies, till settling on seven months with triplets. Her hips widened, her breast grew to DD cups, and her body put on a layer of fat. \"Do you like my gift darling I do so love mortals with your... How you would say fantasies.\" Lana was just in shock her clothes had changed to a maternity dress that showed off her bump and she had on a new bra that fit her breasts. \"Oh I like it very much I think I'll be buying this ring.\" With that she paid the non pregnant woman and left to learn more about her new ring.</span></div></div>",

She was afraid that if she stayed to long that the clerk would notice her triplets were gone. \"So Rhea how exactly did I get pregnant with that ladies triplets?\" Lana asked her new friend while she stroked her new maternal bump. \"Well my child I am trapped in this accursed ring and as such my power seems to be limited. For the time being I only seem to be able to transfer existing babies into my host vessel.\" Lana was stroking her belly all the while walking down the side walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rounded a corner she almost walked straight into another woman that seemed to be pregnant with twins. \"Oh excuse me miss I didn't see you there\" Lana exclaimed as she nearly ran into her belly. The woman just smiled and walked past Lana as soon as she was a few feet away Lana got a mischievous idea. \"Rhea I want to have her babies as well.\" Rhea simply smile, not that Lana could see it, and transferred the other woman's pregnancy to her. She slowly started to swell as the two new passengers were added, she grew out and her belly started to sink towards the ground as she stopped at around seven months with quintuplets. She also noticed that her breasts grew a cup size and she seemed a bit heavier, not from the babies but from extra fat. \"This is amazing Rhea, but it seems I'm getting fatter as well why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well child the fact that I'm transferring pregnancies to you means that you get all of the added weight and fat from the other woman. I can only transfer pregnancies to you, you get everything including cravings and appetites.\" Lana was mulling this over in her head trying to grasp the full concept of what's happening. \"So you can take a woman's pregnancy and give it to me. Is that all you can do? And are there any other rules I should know?\" Rhea was proud of the follower that she had gained and wanted to tell her all she could since Lana was smart enough to ask about her predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off you know that I transfer the whole pregnancy. I also can transfer pregnancies from you to someone else. But for that to happen you need to be in direct contact with the woman's belly. I can alter clothes and memories of people involved in the transfer but others around you or them will not be affected unless you can get close enough to the person I need to influence. If I have to alter someone who isn't part of a transfer it will take some of my power. If my power gets used to often I'll have to rest a bit and recharge.\" Lana was starting to get a puzzled look on her face as she listened and took stock of Rhea's powers. \"So the babies that I've taken I can't just have you send them back I'd have to either go to the original moms or give them to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could give birth to them yes. I can only take without touching someone I can't give. After I get some more power I might be able to give without touch as well. I am however very weak in my current state. Another thing I should mention is, I will be able to help with some of the pain of being massively pregnant as well as make sure you get to forty weeks with any number of babies. But I can not help with the burden of the weight in my weakened state.\" Lana smiled understanding what she had the power to do now and only one thought crossed her mind. Where do I go to get more babies in my belly.</span></div></div>",

She still remembers the sensitivity of having her breasts so big and flooded with milk, her butt so big and fat, and her hips wide and sexy, and finally her belly so large and fertile.<br>\r\n\"Ooh? You miss your bigger body?\" Tawaret giggled to Kat.<br>\r\nShe immediately stops feeling herself before blushing and speaking to Tawaret.<br>\r\n\"I'll be lying if I said that I didn't like it. The feeling of being so huge and fertile was amazing.\" She said dreamily.<br>\r\n\"True, I know exactly what your talking about.\" Tawaret said feeling her own giant assets.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I been meaning to ask Tawaret, besides you being pregnant and huge for being a goddess, who are those other women?\" Kat asked as she bathed herself.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad your curious. It has been a while since I last told someone this. All these women that you see around the city and inside the palace are all my daughters and followers. Women who loved me and the gifts that I gave to them, and in return worshiped and believed in me. These women, when they died, I just could not part ways with them. So I used the power back when I was more powerful to have their spirits be reborn as my daughters to live with me. Each and everyone collected over for centuries. That is until the fall of Egypt to the Romans. I still am a little fogged by the memories, but I remember a bright light taking over the city we lived in. I quickly used my powers to form a barrier around us but the light still found its way to us. When the light stopped and my ears looked around, everything was still the same, except for me noticing that we now reside inside the ring and are on a godly plain.\" Tawaret discussed.<br>\r\n\"Wow. So that means all those girls and you are trapped in theat world?\" Kat questioned.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Before, even though not having direct contact with the mortal world, we could still intervene and come as spirits to other women in Egypt. But now that we are stuck, and my powers weakened to where I can only interact with my user when she wants to, that is all I can do.<br>\r\nAnd you could see that I also gave my daughters the same ability as me, but they cannot become as big as me.\" She answered.<br>\r\n\"Ok, but even though I know how you regain your power, just how does it work?\" Kat asked curious.<br>\r\n\"Heh. Your very curious, I like that. But not many people know it, but when a women is pregnant, they give off more energy, life energy from both themselves and their child. I feed off some of this energy and add it to my own, the more I acquire, the more powerful I become. I used to be able to create my own and store some, but after that light that bound us to this ring, that ability is not achievable as of yet.\" Tawaret expalined.<br>\r\n\"Unless I go and get pregnant?\" Kat interjected.<br>\r\n\"Correct. Oh! I should also tell you that as of now, my powers have increased to the point in which we can do more things.<br>\r\nSuch as take pregnancies that are within a feet or two around you and also extend the delay in labor of others. It would be more but we will have to keep doing what we did before to grow them.\" She told Kat.<br>\r\n\"Alright. But for now, let's go eat.\" Kat told her before turning off the water and drying off.</span></div></div>",

Looks like it will just be us today Tawaret.\" She said.<br>\r\nKat went about how her usual day would go, making eggs, bacon and waffles to have for breakfast. Only this time she made more than she usually do for some reason or another. Once finished she went over to the couch in order to watch some television. Putting on a show about celebrities and being pregnant.<br>\r\n\"Well this is interesting. I see that even now women bearing children still remain with power.\" Tawaret said inside Kat's head.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. Nowadays it is more about people who are celebrities or famous and are pregnant that get to be watched by other people who want to see them. Usually if a women was very pretty or had an important role in entertainment that suddenly became pregnant, then everyone would want to know about them. Kinda like a royal person I guess. But as soon as that women is done being pregnant they are no longer that important.\" Kat explained.<br>\r\n\"Well that is just offensive!\" Tawaret huffed from her throne.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well that's how the world works now. Not many people would believe in gods such as yourself and instead either focus on science or some all powerful deity like 'God' or Jesus.\" Kat said.<br>\r\n\"Explain.\" Tawaret said curious.<br>\r\nFor the next half hour or so, Kat explained about all the changes that occurred in the world, from ever since the Roman Empire had fallen, to the invention of the airplane, to even more recent developments such as smartphones and the internet. The goddess herself was fascinated by what had occurred right under her nose and also a little sadden then she is not as popular as before.<br>\r\n\"But hey, at least you are still remembered in history! And I can mentally brag that I am able to speak with an actual god and help her!\" Kat told her to try and cheer her up.<br>\r\n\"Thank you my child. But it is alright. Us gods are used to seeing and experiencing being forgotten and watching over mankind and what they do.\" Tawaret said, speaking with wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of the doorbell ringing. Getting up to check who it was, they don't see anyone, instead just an old book. The book it self was green in color, a warn out green that is showing to begin to fade, yet the pages look to be intact.<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\" Kat said <br>\r\nTawaret herself was quite until she said something that surprised Kat.<br>\r\n\"Kat, do be careful with that book.\" She warned her.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why?\" Kat asked curious.<br>\r\n\"That book is giving off energy similar to mine's.\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" Kat gasped.<br>\r\n\"It feels like the type of energy that I use with other women who are pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"So that makes it an artifact?\" Kat questioned.<br>\r\nThe book then began to glow a low green light. The light soon began to dimmer, but not until a picture started to form on the book. Lines began to shape and cross, until the picture of a women with her hands holding a belly that looked pregnant and had a peaceful smile appeared.<br>\r\n\"Woah! Don't see that everyday.\" Kay said after the books transformation.<br>\r\n\"Should I open it?\" Kat questioned.</span></div></div>",

Kat looked curiously at the title but still continued. On the next page, it seems a small if whoever left the book with Kat left one message. <br>\r\nIt read: \"Hello to whoever receives this book! You are now the bearer of the book about all Ferility gods known to man. Over the course of human history, these gods and goddesses have been the ones to bless women with children over their regions. But as history went on, they are forgotten. But that is where I decided to step into play. Anytime the gods were about to be destroyed and lost, I came in and sealed them away to be founded later. Which is why you currently have this book. If you are looking to restore the power of a god or gods, then you will find all that you need to know about them in here. Depending on each god, the artifact(s) that store them and their powers are separated. Yet given how you have this book, slowly but surely, the artifacts will swarm towards you. You can either choose to accept them and have fun with them, or you could give it to someone else. Your choice!<br>\r\nBut fair warning! Some gods are greedy and will find someway to instead of accepting you, use you to gain more power. Again your choice! Have fun!\" And with that the message ended.<br>\r\nKat blinked a few times at this. \"That sounded like a child who thought of this as some game. But do you really think that whoever it is who done this was the reason why your stuck in the ring Tawaret?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, while hard to believe. There were times in which gods and goddesses were sealed in objects before. Let's continue reading.\" She said.<br>\r\nAfter the message Kat found a table of contents. She saw multiple gods names but it was only one that she was looking for now. And she came across Tawaret's name.<br>\r\n\"Looks like whoever this person is have you in here.\" She said to Tawaret.<br>\r\n\"Let's hope they wrote down where my power went.\" Tawaret said.<br>\r\nOnce Kat said Tawaret name the next page immediately opened up to show what happened to her.<br>\r\nThe author of the book had splitted her powers into 4 separate artifacts.<br>\r\nOne resembling a ring, where Tawaret resides. One in the shape of a bracelet that holds her power to create pregnancies. The third in the shape of a necklace which can allow to give new life between women. And the last in the shape of an earring which allows her to alter males. <br>\r\n\"Wow! You can do all of this Tawaret?!\" Kat exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"Fufu. Indeed I can. Back when I still had all my power. Ah! I still remember the times in which as punishment I turned a man into a women and forced them bear children.\" Tawaret spoke dreamily.<br>\r\nBack to the book, the author left one more message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more you use a god's power, the closer the god's artifact(s) will come to you. Acting like a homing beacon. That's all I can say! Goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat smirked. \"Childish, but informative. Now we know what to do to get you to become stronger.\" She said speaking to Tawaret.<br>\r\n\"Yes. I can't wait to have them back.\" Tawaret said expectantly.</span></div></div>",

I knew you would go for a big start right away! And since you want a big belly, you will need the breasts, butt, and hips for it.\" Tawaret said beginning to cast a spell. Immediately Kat's body begins to change. It first started with her stomach, blowing up like a ballon and expanding bigger and bigger. It was amazing to see the rapid expansion occur in less than a minute, even more so that when it stopped at 25 full term babies she didn't have a single showing of stretch marks. Then came her breasts, they plumped out and grew bigger and more perky. Instead of sagging like a normal pair would, they seemed to just defy gravity and stay perfect on top of Kat's belly. They soon quieted expanding when they reached to the cup size of U cups. And finally came her butt and hips. Her hips became wider, enough so that it could support her new belly and make her unintentionally sway her hips anytime she walks. Her ass was treated the same way as her chest, while growing bigger and juicier, still was able to stay tight and attractive. <br>\r\nWhen everything was done, Kat looked like a fertility goddess.<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thank you Tawaret for the major upgrades! And for my clothes still being able to fit!\" Kat said feeling her new body and noticing that her clothes expanded as well.<br>\r\n\"My pleasure darling! Seeing you and your belly out in the open is truly wonderful.\" Tawaret said appreciating Kat's form. She even began rubbing it, sending shivers down Kat's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm! Your welcome then! Though I'm still not as big as you.\" Kat admitted.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that. I'm still only 575 baby filled.

They are actually close by at a community center.\" Kat said as she began walking to the center. If you were someone who happen to cross paths with Kat, then you would be surprised and wondering how does a girl like her walk around so freely and effortlessly. It was true as because instead of walking slow like you would expect, Kat had a spring in her step and a sway in her hips as she marched forward. Which was very noticeable with how much her breasts and ass jiggled all around as she went by. Some people even stopped what they were doing or bumped into others from seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appreciating the attention you are getting hmm?\" Tawaret said coily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if this is your doing or a side effect but feeling so big and fertile is amazing.

With the leader of the group being a red headed milf named Ms. Sophie. She was a women who had a figure that wasn't as big as Kat's was still sexy with her E cups and giant ass.

Her thoughts were interrupted when she felt Kat\u2019s stomach attack back from her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?!\u201d Ms.Sophie gasped as she recoiled her hand from the kicks she got. She then saw Kat\u2019s whole stomach begin to bustle with small punches and kicks as the babies inside her womb woke up. She was feeling very shocked and confused from all of this, but deep down she was also feeling jealous of Kat and her babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTawaret. Can you give them a small amount of babies to have? Maybe between 1-4 is fine as any bigger and I fear they might hurt themselves since they don\u2019t have any divine protection like me.\u201d Kat asked Tawaret to do. Tawaret simply raised her hand and snapped her fingers, the sound was only heard by Kat before she watched the magic begin to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of the women clutched her stomach before feeling the effects of Tawaret\u2019s power. They watched their stomachs grow and bloat up. As their bellies grew, they saw kicks and imprints start to form, symbolizing that they are pregnant and carrying. But that wasn\u2019t all, their breasts and butts began to grow as well. Expanding within the fabric as their tank tops soon became bras that had leak stains from milk on them. And their hips and asses causing their shorts or yoga pants to tighten around their skin. It took a full minute of growing before they stopped and finally looked at their new forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiles came onto their faces as they gently rubbed their expanded middles, especially Ms.Sophie as she was showing with quads and her clothes threatening to snap off. Kat was a little confused as to whey they weren\u2019t panicking until Tawaret explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just tested my powers of reality warping dear. For now, their minds are believing that they were all pregnant for the past 7 months together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. That makes sense.\u201d Mat understood before turning back to a smiling Ms.Sophie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that Kat. I was just shocked to see that you\u2019re still getting bigger than the last time I saw you. But what brings you here today?\u201d Ms.Sophie asked.</span></div></div>",

They grew to the size they should be about 8 months Kat noticed now her breasts were Z cups. Tawaret then felt another pulse.

The kind in which I can, or could have before getting weaker, create blessings for women to get pregnant, transfer them, create illusions, etc. But I say I was more mischievous to those that I deemed unworthy or disrespected me. Such as why that women's child was dead or when I turned a mercenary group of men into women and made them stay pregnant for 5 years. Oh yes! I one time even awarded one of my favorite worshippers by making her pregnant with 10 babies and give birth to all of them with pleasure.\" Hiyo told Kat of her deeds.<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I never knew you did that. Tawaret did you ever do anything like that?\" She asked curious.<br>\r\n\"Well while I do confess towards doing the same acts, they were never as much or extreme as Hiyo's. But speaking of powers, I must tell you Kat I throughly enjoy having mines back. My baby belly is back to its glorious shape of being as big as my whole throne room and that my smallest daughter is only looking to be pregnant with 25.

I was mostly a goddess who didn't have any sergeants or followers like Tawaret to call my own. You see while I did enjoy giving women the chance to give new life into them and see their wonderful wombs grow, I was still bored. I was bored for decades until an idea finally popped into my head. I started playing little tricks on the other woman in my region and not just those who came to me for blessing, well not all of them cause I still enjoyed seeing them huge. So I would become a mortal and walk around to different villages and at night make women swell with children. It was amusing to see them wake up in the morning and wondering how they become so pregnant in just one night, especially with multiples. I mainly stuck with doing this to nobles and see them panick!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n\"But it isn't until I found some people beginning to curse me for not giving them big enough bellies or saying that I don't exist. So doing what I naturally should have, began turning some women to be beached on top of their bellies. And having others experience the worst of back pains when standing up till they did. It wasn't until I encountered the noble who annoyed me to the point of me killing off her baby at birth that a mysterious light had came and I was put to sleep until you found me.\" Hiyo said ending the story.</span></div></div>",

Kat said, \"Just don't do anything too evil because the women here all clearly look to be late into their pregnancy.\" Hiyo said, \"We know.\" And both Kat and Anna felt their goddesses start altering the women and it seems they tripled the pregnancies of all the women here while doubling Kat and Annas in the process. Kat and Anna felt their goddesses start breathing heavily and Tawaret said, \"Ugh seems we lost a lot of stamina.\" Just then Anna sensed another Goddess inside an artifact. The artifact looked like the top of a bikini. Anna then wore it and saw in the valley alongside Ceres a woman who looked to be 10% larger than Tawaret. She said, \"I am Himiko, I am glad to be alongside another of my kin. Seeing how you and your friend have other members of my kin inside you I suspect you are going to try and find the rest of us so we can hopefully get our full potential back as well as being the hosts for us. There is a secret I should tell you that the others forgot to say. Our true bodies are in a temple of immense size. To be able to find it you need to get us back to full potential and have all of us evenly distributed between you. Is that right Tawaret?\" Tawaret confirmed that was true. She said Himiko was a very powerful goddess. However there is one fertility goddess that tops them all, Shenki. She is the most powerful fertility goddess and probably the one with the most artifacts sealing her powers away. They will probably find her after they get the rest of the goddesses and have their powers almost fully restored.

It was surprising to see that they had everything from pasta, to chicken, to even cake and ice cream and so much of it that they were able to feed everyone.<br>\r\nBut both Kat and Anna showed that they can really pack it away from how they ate nearly 20% of the food and won the contest.<br>\r\nThey received the artifacts and Kat put them on feeling energy in her womb.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Wonderful. Thank you Kat, I am fully rested and more powerful. And you seem to have eaten enough food for us goddesses to be back to power.  What would you like as a reward for all your hard work?</span></div></div>",

It seems in order for you to handle more of us the ones already inside your mind need to be more complete before you can handle more of us.

They were surprised to see how old it looked. The shrine had been designed to appear like a Shinto Shrine. Having everything from a Torii, Sando, and a hall to worship. But the biggest thing was a shrine that showed a women cradling a pregnant belly in a kimono. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Is that supposed to be you Hiyo?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. I suppose it is. Though it is drastically smaller than yours truly. And I never had my kimono to cover my whole body, I usually left my belly out in the open, but I have to admit, they kept this place in shape.\" Hiyo told them as they walked up to the shrine.<br>\r\n\"Good day.\" Everyone heard a voice say to them from behind.<br>\r\nTurning around they find it to be a women who looked to be the shrine maiden. She was a beautiful women who looked to be in her 20s, though one couldn't tell if it is because of the clothes that she is wearing that are too small, or just her body but you could see her curves through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Hello to you as well, we were just checking out the shrine.\" Kat said.<br>\r\n\"I see. It's good to see women as fertile as you both come by the shrine to pay respect to Hiyo-sama. If you wouldn't mind, can I feel your bellies?\" The women asked.<br>\r\nBoth girls put their stomachs out to let the maiden feel them. Her hands feeling warm to them.<br>\r\n\"Hehe! I never get tired of feeling such wonderful bellies. Especially ones as big as yours. But where are my manners, my name is Himiko.\" She greeted herself.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet Himiko. Do you perhaps like pregnancies?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\nHimiko blushed a little but nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yes I do. I do wish that I could carry around such big wombs like you both can, but I have neither the time or opportunity to find someone to help me with it per say. I do hope Hiyo-sama hears my prays though to grant me that wish.\" Himiko said desirably.<br>\r\nBoth Kat and Anna shared a look but they waited for Hiyo to decide.</span></div></div>",

She looked behind her to see that it was Kat having her belly rubbed by three servents of Tawaret who each had looked to be having octuplets themselves. Kat was wearing some kind of dress that only covered her breasts and back and hips, but leaving as much skin to show as possible. She was also wearing the artifact jewelry that she had collected for Tawaret to further extend her beauty. <br>\r\n\"Yes. This is all so amazing! I didn't even know that there were still fertility goddesses around us.\" Himiko admitted amazed. <br>\r\n\"Hehe! Yeah I was the same way, and so was Anna. Oh!

Do hope you enjoy your time in here, sometimes time will pass fast or slow given how powerful a goddess is. Why don't you go speak with Hiyo since you admire her so much? Me and the girls here are going over to Tawaret's bath to relax and have some fun if your interested. These girl give amazing belly rubs. Later!\" Kat began flying off to Tawaret's realm.<br>\r\nStaring at Kat while she left, Sachiyo didn't notice that someone coming from behind her till that person grabbed at her breasts. She squealed in surpas the person began kneading her breasts like dough.<br>\r\n\"My my, you certainly grew big.\" A voice Sachiyo recognized as Hiyo said from behind her.<br>\r\n\"Hiyo-sama! What are you doing?!\" Sachiyo asked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Oh you know me, just feeling your body to see how it handles being so fertile.\" Hiyo answered her, moving her hands from Sachiyo's breasts and onto her belly. She had the front of Sachiyo's shrine maiden outfit e exposed so she can feel it through skin. Sachiyo only moaned softly in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But besides that, what's this I hear about Himiko not being your real name? Are telling me that you are keeping secrets little girl?\" Hiyo teased the girl.<br>\r\nSachiyo didn't respond, just continued blushing.<br>\r\n\"You should know that I do not like it when I don't know everything. Like the fact that you secretly pleasure yourself to me when you inside your room. Or perhaps the times of when you would stare longingly and eye dress pregnant women such as Kat or Anna while they are unaware.\" She teased further.<br>\r\nSachiyo gasped from how her secrets were being exposed.<br>\r\n\"Such a naughty Miko I have as a follower.

Kat said, \"Sheesh we are all twice as large now.\" Hiyo said, \"We are halfway to where Shenki sleeps though so it was expected something would happen.\" Upon reaching the top Kat saw what looked like womens underwear  made out of some very fine materials. She then knew she had to put them on. They somehow fit her perfectly. Then as they expected Shenkis voice called out saying it thanks the trio for waking her up. Kat then said to Shenki what happened to them and Shenki said, \"Not surprised by that. Anyways Ive got a gift for the three of you. The three of you now will no longer age or become sick effectively you are biologically immortal now.\" The three were very surprised to hear that. Shenki then said, \"When the three of you are asleep you can now visit each others minds and of course we can traverse between them but when its time to wake up we will promptly return to our hosts.\" The trio found themselves outside and said, \"We found Shenki sooner than we thought.\" They decided to return to Hiyos shrine and went into the dream world.

Sachiyo just finished a race in first place. She then saw Kat and Anna looking over the prizes given to those in the finals in their booklet for this special competition. The third place winner will get a special ring and armlet. The second place gets a cloak, a necklace, and a bracelet. The grand prize though is five special pieces of clothing namely a pair of sandals, a circlet, a hairband, and a crown. They took a closer look at the prizes at the display case that just appeared and sure enough all of them were artifacts for the goddesses they were the hosts of. The artifacts that Sachiyos goddess needed were the third place ones while the second place artifacts were what Anna needed for her goddesses and finally the grand prize artifacts were for Kat's goddesses. It was obvious the crown was for Shenki that much the trio knew. Anna decided she should participate in a modeling event which was based around creating the best designed object they can with a certain amount of clay. Anna created a sculpture of a rather pregnant woman and did it in a way it looked very well detailed. The judge said, \"The victor is Anna with her sculpture.\" The crowd cheered. The opponents were good sports with the second place one saying to Anna, \"I'm impressed by how you sculpted that figure. How did you make one that well detailed?\" Anna said, \"It was nothing I sculpt a lot in my free time.\" Anna then said to Kat, \"Your turn.\" Kat then decided she should compete in...</span></div></div>",

Hecatia said, \"Oh don't worry that's just milk being produced as a result of you eating.\" Sachiyo then said she can't concentrate too well with that and Hecatia said, \"How about I drink from you?\" Just then Sanae flew and said she wanted in on that. Sachiyo knew where this was going and let the two goddesses empty her breasts. Hiyo suddenly appeared saying, \"Oh come on! You're my miko and you're having your milk be taken by other goddesses?! That should be reserved for me only!\" It was obvious she was jealous. Sachiyo then said, \"Calm down Hiyo-sama I'll let you drink from one of them alongside Hecatia next time.\" Hiyo said, \"You better.\" Before flying off fuming she was beaten to the punch.

Rarely for the goddess who had always prioritized staying inside her bath for most of the time nowadays. The reason being that she was currently in a feast with Skenki, Kat, and Istar since the goddesses wanted to taste more of the food that Kat ate during her events. <br>\r\nSachiyo could never imagining herself eating all of that food, and from what Tawret said that they had little to contribute with how much Kat ate. But what really surprised her was the fact that she maybe becoming a goddess herself, remembering what Hiyo said and what Kat did to her and Anna at the hot springs. She smiled at that, wondering what reputation she would get from being one. <br>\r\nThat was when she realized that the sloshing in her chest had returned. And this time greater than before. Looking down she found the answer being that her breasts were expanding, each one becoming more big and heavy. She liked the feeling of them growing but soon was disappointed to see them stop at being the size of twin sized wombs.<br>\r\n\"Oh goodie! It's my turn to drink!\" Sachiyo heard a voice say before her. She couldn't quiet see who it was until she felt a pair of hands grab her left breast and see that it was Hiyo herself. <br>\r\n\"Hehe. Yes Hiyo-sama. You can get your fill now.\" Sachiyo said allowing her to drink. <br>\r\n\"Please Sachiyo, no more formalities. And besides, I think we're intimate enough that you can call me Hiyo.\" Hiyo said before suckling from Sachiyo's breast. Sachiyo enjoyed the feeling of the goddess' lips over her nipple and drinking more of her milk. She was letting a low moan from it.<br>\r\nSaid moan attracted another goddess over as well, Hecatia soon dropped into the bath as well.<br>\r\n\"Swelled again I see. Then it's a good thing I'm here to even it up.\" She said before going to Sachiyo's right tit and getting her drink from it as well.<br>\r\nSachiyo put her head back and enjoyed the feeling, wondering how everyone else is doing.</span></div></div>",

Kat said, \"Thanks Shenki anyways I know Sachiyo, Anna, and myself are becoming goddesses ourselves which is due to constant exposure to your radiance.\" Tawaret said, \"Yeah that's true.

Reason being I've noticed Hiyo and Hecatia suddenly suckle at a greater pace.\" The other goddesses started grinning and Kat said, \"Oh great I know what's about to happen oh well, might as well enjoy it.\" And the other goddesses started suckling on Kat's breasts, taking turns. <br>\r\nThe soon to be goddesses basked in the pool letting their breasts be sucked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Anna was about to grow as well as she, Ceres, and Himiko were chatting.

Kat and her friends went to the source and saw a lot of artifacts apparently two of each for the goddesses as well as those of the newest residents of Sachiyo aka Cirno and Flandre that still had their powers sealed and after wearing them and having them be a part of them they heard Ishtar say, \"I feel like my mind is almost fully restored. Still a few things I can't recall but hey at least I feel quite confident now.\" Shenki then said, \"As thanks for further restoring our powers I've a gift for you three.\" The trio felt a pulse and they felt new knowledge enter them. Shenki said, \"What I just did was allow you to fly outside now. Just ensure you only use this ability when other people aren't around to see it because that could draw unwanted attention.\" The trio understood that response made sense. Now that they could fly looking for the artifacts became easier. They ensured that they only flew when no people were around. Just then Kat saw her family again.

Something weird is going on. Kat what is going on?\" Kat sighed and said to the goddesses, \"Looks like my family is about to find out our secret. At least its just them so it should be fine.\" Kat said they need to take this to a private area before she began. Kat said when they did, \"If you're wondering why I look like this as well as my friends, well we are hosts to various goddesses of fertility. Basically we are trying to find all of the goddesses of fertility and restoring their powers by locating their artifacts which look like various pieces of jewelry and clothing. It had the side effect of turning us into them as well but it isn't as bad as you think. Basically we are far stronger than we once were.\" Kat then took on a more serious tone, \"That means we are also now immortal and also it means the Kat you knew is long gone.\" Kat's mother was in surprise and normally she would laugh it off but the size of Kat, Anna, and Sachiyo proved Kat was telling the truth. Kat's mother then said, \"That might explain why some of the women have started mutating into what we call monster girls and/or becoming pregnant immediately. What's even weirder is that apparently people are actually accepting this occurring and from what I heard a new cult was formed based around the worshipping of the three hosts of the divine ones of fertility. I assume that's you three hmm?\" That surprised the trio that a cult was formed that was based around them. Kat said, \"So where is this cult?\" Kat's mother simply shrugged indicating she didn't know. Kat's mother then said, \"I hope your journey to find and restore the fertility goddesses goes well.\" And left. Kat said, \"Well seems like a cult based around us has been formed. That's a new development.\" Tawaret said, \"I agree, that's a new one. Not that we're complaining because it may mean we can find the remaining goddesses and restore their powers as well as those already with us that are still incomplete quicker assuming we can find them.\" Sachiyo said, \"Problem is we don't know where it is just and what members of it look like. We may need to do some searching.\" \"That won't be necessary.\" A voice said surprising the trio. The figure looked like a woman in a pink kimono with what looked like markings of pregnant women on it. Kat said, \"Are you a member of this cult?\" The woman nodded. She then said, \"My name is Misa. A member of the Divine Pregnant Worshippers, or DPW for short. We worship the pregnant body especially those that are as large as you. We worship the ones that will bring about the joining and restoration of the divine ones of fertility. We know that's the three of you. I am actually the head of the DPW cult. We know how you are able to now unbirth and caused some of the women to evolve into new forms. We will be able to assist you in your endeavors of gathering the artifacts of the divine ones but we need the divine one's blessing to do so.

Their were many buildings around that seemed to be different facilities, and each facility had the markings and pictures of women portrayed as goddesses with massive wombs.<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the most interesting part yet, the whole place seemed to be teeming with nothing but pregnant women and mister girls. All dressed in wither kimonos like Misa, exposing their bellies, or dressed in clothing that seemed to hug their figures as well as exposing their midsection. And inside the middle of the shrine were three statues, each looking exactly like the trio.<br>\r\n\"Woah! Did you all built all of this? For us?\" Kat asked.<br>\r\n\"While yes it is for you, no we did not built it.\" Miss answered.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n\"You see, we were all lead here by some kind of force if you will. And after walking here, we just found this place, including the status depicting of you three. We do not who built this place or why, but we do know that this is a sign for you. A sign that you are divine beings yourselves.\" Misa explained.<br>\r\n\"Do you all know anything about this?\" Sachiyo asked the goddesses.<br>\r\nThey all said no and we're also curious as to how this came to be.<br>\r\n\"I think it's the one who wrote the book Kat.\" Tawaret suggested.<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Everyone asked.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later. But basically the book that I used to find some of you, there was someone who wrote in it telling your stories. And they sounded like they were the ones behind hey you all are stuck in your current states.\" Kat explained.<br>\r\n\"Freaky.\" Anna said.<br>\r\nWhen they group arrived at the shrine, they were immediately swamped by the people around them. All the followers of the trio were asking them questions and praising them for how big they are and what they plan on doing next. It was thanks to Miss though that they did not have to deal with everyone at the same time. Though they did like belly rubs though.<br>\r\nMiss led them into a building that was just past the statues of the trio, he building was likely two stories but seemed designed for women of their gigantic portions. Inside the building, pedestals made of the finest cloth and softness had been left.<br>\r\n\"These are your thrones my goddesses.\" Misa said to them. All three of them took their seats with Kat in the middle, sinking into the chair.<br>\r\n\"You all can relax  as I prepare a banquet for you all to enjoy.\" She told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait Misa.\" Kat stopped the head cult leader.<br>\r\n\"I think I speak for everyone when we say that yes we do enjoy how we will be treated. But we would also like to know of how to treat you all the same way as well. As in know how to reward you all for all of this.\" Kat said.<br>\r\n\"As Kat said, we want to reward as we receive. And also can you explain to us about the current situation?\" Anna agreed.<br>\r\n\"That would be helpful.\" Sachiyo voiced.<br>\r\nMisa was surprised to hear this but smiled and bowed gracefully. <br>\r\n\"You are all kind and wonderful, just lien we said you were. Now to explain what DPW is for, it is like I said when we first met. This cult is made to cater and serve you three or anyone else who are large beyond possible in pregnancy. We live to serve and to help you in anyway we can. We also know that you are on a quest to retrieve more of the fallen fertility goddesses hidden inside artifacts. For those of us who are not too impaired of mobility, they will go out and search for said artifacts. Returning them to you in order to greater your powers. <br>\r\nThe monster girls that show up here are also followers and worshippers of you three. While surprised and shaken by there sudden transformations, they all love and adore their new bodies and bellies. They hope that you will all accept them, though I don't see why they feel like that. <br>\r\nWe were prepared to do this without asking for anything, but if you are willing to reward us then I will speak the main demands of everyone. The first being that everyone wants to be able to carry more young inside them while still sataying strong. If we are to symbolize divine pregnancy, we must be the ones to show how grand it is. The second is to help others transcend to other goddesses through your wombs. There are more followers now who wish to join not only you all, but also the fertility goddesses of the old. And seeing as how your wombs are the linkage between them, they would like to get unbirthed. And finally the main reward would be to feast from your breasts, they contain the most luscious and creamy milk, that we all would like to taste it. If no one wants this, then they would most likely ask to give belly rubs to you or expand a body part of them. We thank you and will worship you for doing this for us.\" Misa finally finished explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief telepath discussion between the trio before they all turned to Misa.<br>\r\n\"Then We will make sure to have all your wishes come true our lovely Misa.\" Kat said their head cult leader.<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we can do for now?\" Sachiyo asked not wanting to feel lazy.</span></div></div>",

Why can't that be reserved for us goddesses?\" Misa said, \"Because it is a good way for us to carry out the task of being able to carry out our goal of delivering the artifacts to you as well as ensuring we keep our mobility due to some of your essence inside our bodies allowing this.\" Hiyo then said, \"Alright fine but just this once for Sachiyo!\" And thus they got to work on emptying the trio's breasts of milk knowing it would refill at some point and allow them to get the divine energy and granting them bigger bellies. As a result the smallest sized one had 14 babies inside her. Then the banquet began where the trio found themselves at a dining hall. Misa and the rest of the DPW started chanting and it began affecting the goddesses in a good way as in it improved their stamina. Afterwards the trio said, \"So what is the reason why you are willing to assist us?\" Misa said, \"Well considering its the three of you and the goddesses well we have an agenda of sorts. We want this world's people to be only pregnant women and monster girls that are also pregnant. Essentially it is the goddess's wet dream.\" That got the goddesses attention and they said, \"Oh wow you understand what our greatest dream is.\" The trio were all for it and they said, \"So how are you going to do it?\" Misa said, \"When we've got all the goddesses of fertility at full power we would like you to cause all the inhabitants here to become well heavily pregnant women and monster girls that have the goal of finding the others from different lands to be taken to you three and have their full potential restored. You get the idea.\" Shenki said, \"I am all for it.\" The other goddesses agreed. Misa said, \"Wonderful! I know how it may seem weird with how you may be separate from the outside world but don't worry we altered the place to have the best internet overall and also I have this girl to show you who will be the one who carries news from us, she is named Layla.\" And out came the girl. She was a monster girl of sorts and clearly she was huge. Layla said, \"I am a Lilim at your service!\" Misa said, \"We've already got members of us looking for the remaining artifacts of the goddeses of this land as we speak.

Though heads up lady Sachiyo, there are quite a few of them.\" Layla warned as she left with Anna and Kat and let in the Kobolds. There were at least 20 of them and they were all immensely pregnant. \"She wasn't lying.\" Sachiyo said before she began unbirthing the Kobolds.<br>\r\nAt another part of the shrine, Anna and Kat were currently dwelling in some more divine arts. Layla led them to a lake and there they saw something surprising. There were non-pregnant, non-transformed girls at the lake naked. Anna and Kat looked on confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are these women Layla?\" Kat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are some new recruits that would like to join DPW. They were never changed like the other women in town but we believe that had to do with the fact that they don't possess as much energy as everyone else to respond to what occurred. It may sound weird but we believe that with the help of you two, these girls can transform to become more like us. It will also help with your first steps in creating a world filled with pregnant monster girls.\" Layla explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can we do that?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to me.\" They heard Shenki said. \"Out of everyone here, I think I'm most adept when it comes to transformation or pregnancy. I can teach you girls how to do it and also see how far along in power you come.\"<br>\r\nAnna and Kat both nodded before following Shenki's instructions. They extended their arms out towards the girl before concentrating and building up energy. Everyone can feel the atmosphere around them change and light begin to shine around the new recruits. In just a few more minutes, the light seemed to shine brighter before exploding and disappearing. Shenki told Anna and Kat that they are done and are to admire their handiwork.<br>\r\nWhat did they turn into?</span></div></div>",

A pulse went through Kat in a weird way. Layla said, \"I have a hunch that caused your power to grow tremendously. Say, can you now do a sort of special portal leading to this shrine inside you as well as having it exist in the dream world as well?\" Kat and Anna nodded and Sachiyo came in just in time and they manage to do this successfully causing  Shenki said, \"Now don't worry I've been able to make it so now you can enter your minds without having to dream. Time will stop outside your bodies when you do so. Also any new followers will arrive at the shrine. Also the members of DPW can exit through your bodies.\" Kat said, \"Okay now at least we are carrying a portal that leads to it as well as it existing in our minds as well. Also it'll feel weird having members being able to enter and exit us as they wish. Also I am glad we can transfer them as we please. Obviously our bodies are now the headquarters.\" Layla said, \"Indeed this will make things easier for us. The goddesses can at least interact with the members more easily. It does also mean they can at least have physical forms outside now but they can't leave the shrine.\" That got all of the goddesses attention and sure enough they had physical forms in the shrine. They were ecstatic they could finally feel the breeze again. Tawaret said, \"Now granted we can't stay in the real world for too long though because it drains us but that's a price to pay.\" Kat said, \"Yeah since your real bodies are still nowhere to be seen and all. Also I suspect the dream variant of the shrine can only be entered through either our bodies or if one sleeps here.\" Hiyo said, \"At least we can finally be able to interact with you all outside of your minds at last, even though we can't actually go outside the shrine.\" Just then a high ranking member shows up holding what looked like half of the artifacts that each goddess still needed plus what seemed to be parts of additional goddesses as well. They had the consciousness of them and clearly they found a lot because it would allow both Sachiyo and Anna to finally have the same amount of goddesses that Kat had in her body meaning both Anna and Sachiyo would be able to experience the same degree of chatting that Kat had inside their minds. These ones though lacked names. In fact they had no names indicating they were probably sealed before they had gotten them. Kat couldn't find anything about them in her book. At least they were also fertility goddesses. Tawaret said, \"You know, now that you have the same amount as Kat does, you should become as big as her right now but Kat still has to remain the largest.\" The trio agreed and now their assets grew to where Kat is still the largest but Sachiyo was now as large as Kat was in her previous size with Anna still being the middle sized one. Basically they were all now far larger. Layla said, \"Ah nice its a good thing this shrine is enormous. Hmm thing is our true goal hasn't been met yet but we did succeed in causing Japan to have our ideals be met. Also that was all of the goddesses here so we need to head elsewhere. Where should we be sent to first to continue our goals? It should be an island for now instead of the continents but it should be a large one where we can expand our influence.

Everyone agreed with her and decided to start getting ready for their next adventure. Nearly half of the people at the shrine wanted to tag along with the trio and goddesses and was unbirthed to join and watch the fun. The other half, the more responsible, stayed behind to make sure to keep the place clean and maintained while they await their goddesses return. They were of course rewarded for this with even more babies inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed in different clothes more suited for the area, the trio made their way outside the shrine before waving goodbye to their remaining followers. <br>\r\n\"Everybody ready?\" Anna asked. Everyone said yes before they started chanting and had energy pool in around them. A bright light covered the shrine before it disappeared and with it the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later in a native forest in Australia, a light shown within the dense forest and in it one figure appeared. It was Kat and her giant fertile body, but no one else was with her.<br>\r\n\"We're here! Huh? Where everyone else?\" She asks as she notices she was the only one around. It was then that her womb bursts in activity as she rubs it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah?! What's going inside everyone?! I don't like how you guys are squirming so roughly! Tawaret! What's going on?\" Kat asked as she tried to calm her babies down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know my dear Kat. Even my own children are squirming violently. And that's not all. I feel that Anna and Sachiyo along with the other goddesses are scattered to the south and the east. We can't speak with any of them.\" Tawaret explained. No one knew of what was going on, except for one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! I'm so glad that you could make it!\" A voice said out of no where. Kat looked all around and could not identify where the voice was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" She shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know. Just a mischievous goddess. And if you looking for your friends dear then don't worry, they are safe, just sleeping. I want to play a game with you and your followers and goddesses.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat contemplated with Tawaret before they reached to an agreement. <br>\r\n\"Alright.

The nagas showed up and Kat did as she was told by the voice. The voice then said, \"Alright part two! Let's see you do some parkour.\" The course was seen and Kat cleared it rather easily. She wound up at what looked like the entrance to a mysterious temple which had its gate apparently sealed shut. The voice said, \"For the final task you, the leader of the eventual return of the goddesses movement, must fight and defeat the creator and the destroyer to enter my realm and see your best friends again without having to look for them!\" A bright light engulfed Kat and she found herself in an unfamiliar place, rather she seemed to be on some strange platform looking the way she did before she even met Tawaret. She tried to talk to the goddesses, but heard nothing. Just then she saw what looked like two giant hands materialise and laugh. It then hit her, she had to fight Master Hand and Crazy Hand. Somehow she knew of techniques she didn't realize she knew she had in the first place. She had played the series the hands appeared in and were usually the final bosses of so she knew what to expect from them. She knew she had to fight. She saw that as she damaged the hands, they started acting more weird. It was hard for her, but eventually she prevailed and took both of them out at the same time. She then found herself back at the temple entrance the way she was supposed to look with the goddesses and her children inside her. The voice then said, \"Splendid! You've beaten my game and now you can see your friends again and enter my domain. You've proven yourself worthy Kat, Seeker of Fertility! You are worthy of using me and my powers because I am the newest of the objects to exist.\" Kat then saw Anna and Sachiyo appear next to her. She woke them up and explained what occurred. Sachiyo then said, \"I've seen a site based around mysterious objects of unspeakable power for those that wield them but they are hard to get. You Kat must have cleared one of the trials and from what I can tell this one didn't have an entry in that site.\" The trio saw the gate open right after she said that and knew they had to enter. Inside was some mysterious orb that glowed pink. Anna tried to pick it up but found her hand went through it. When Kat did so, she actually did. It then suddenly went to Kat's navel and somehow merged with it. Kat said, \"That was weird. Anyways somehow I gained a new power where I can just simply make women pregnant just by looking at them and determine how many babies they get and also I now emit an aura that somehow causes women within a certain radius to suddenly feel like they want some children growing inside them. It too can cause women to get pregnant if they are exposed to it enough. It obviously won't effect the both of you. Somehow I think eventually I will be able to even make it so women already pregnant even more pregnant with this new ability once I master it. Also I think I went through a test of sorts where I can't rely on the goddesses to assist me at all. Anyways, now that we're back together should we head to Sydney for potential candidates of joining our cause, or should we explore the Australian outback for more artifacts?\" Anna and Sachiyo looked at each other and decided they should....</span></div></div>",

Though you all may not be able to see or feel it yet. Just yourselves getting stronger. But we goddesses can. The wall that divides what can be done in dreams and that of reality is breaking down. Already by how much the power you three share, it is possible for you all to unbirth women as big as us. And even soon being able to use the same powers as us.

She unbirthed both the owner of the store and anyone else who was inside the store before getting the goddess who was trapped inside her artifact. She scoured the whole city unbirthing and  capturing any other goddess who also gained physical form as well as more human. We are sorry to have kept this a secret from you all for so long chosen ones.\" Sopora finished saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok Sopora. That just mean that we have to be more careful going around Sydney. Speaking of which, would you all like to go inside us? It maybe a better and safer course when we encounter Da Ji.\" Kat said to their new friends. The goddesses agreed and were unbirthed by the three, Valora going in Kat, Sophora and Mifusa into Anna, and Ledina into Sachiyo. That proved to be the correct thing to do because as soon as they entered into Sydney they could not hear the goddesses anymore. They could feel them inside their wombs but could not hear their voices anymore. The whole area of Sydney was also covered in a fog that prevented them from seeing too far ahead. They were completely in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you're there! Better come out or else!\" Anna threatened as they were aware of Da JI's presence. Soon they heard a giggle that got louder and louder before appearing before them was the goddess herself. She was much taller than any of them standing at 8 feet and looked like an albino kitsune with 9 tails.<br>\r\n\"So good to see you three! I heard so much about you all and how powerful you are!

It took half an hour but the trio emerged victorious in the battle. Da Ji was in a state where she couldn't fight anymore. Kat somehow knew exactly how to force Da Ji to expunge the captured goddesses from her womb as well as the humans.

The 12 said they were all for it. They figured that any male followers should be considered breeders to the females as in they have to constantly mate with the followers.

Kat decided that the first thing they should do before arrival is see what the book had about why some goddesses had gotten their physical forms early. She found what seems to be a guess, \"As much as I wanted to successfully seal as many goddesses of fertility as possible, there was going to be some that were instead knocked out and fell into a coma.

Also thanks to Tawaret's mind manipulation people would always think she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the winter season as snow began pouring in. It was the first time Tawaret had seen snow. Kat never tried to grow as big as she was before and only started taking a single pregnancy. Sometimes two but never 20+!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a snow day as it was considered a holiday. Alyix was playing with her friends in the snow. Her mother was talking with her neighbors. Kat on the other hand came home from a walk in the park. Not just to roam but to take pregnancies! She sat on the recliner sipping on hot chocolate. Looking at her large belly. She had taken 3 pregnancies. One twins while the other two single. All three she estimated at least 7 months in which she was now pregnant with four. Her breasts now F-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tawaret, I have a question.\" Kat asked while rubbed her belly.Kat wore a large light blue sweater with yoga pants and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">What is it child? Ask me anything you want.</span>\" Tawaret said happily as Kat felt invisible hands stroke her belly. This caused her to blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were to lose you while being pregnant. What would happen?\" Kat asked as she felt somewhat aroused as the unborn moved about more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Technically, you would stay like that. The babies wouldn't grow and neither would you. In a complete stasis. </span>\" Tawaret said in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind staying like this but I feel better to grow into this than to be stuck like this.\" Kat said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Likewise child! So you better not lose me! Or you'll be sorry!</span>\" Tawaret said in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't!\" Kat giggled.</span></div></div>",

Whilst none mention the name Tawaret the effects given by a ring seemed to be the same. Tawaret on the other hand had a Wikipedia page giving a brief description of the goddess.

Alyix\u2019s belly gurgled, \u201cuuughhh I don\u2019t feel so g\u2026UUUUURRRRPPPP,\u201d she gave a loud belch as her belly deflated. <br>\r\nI turned around and picked up the basketball and gave it to her, \u201chere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Alyix, \u201cI was really good apart from that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to do it again another time?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\nJust then there was a faint tinkle and Alyix blinked, \u201cDo what again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Nothing never mind,\u201d I said realizing that Tawaret must of erased her memory of it, \u201coff you go.\u201d <br>\r\nLater that day after Alyix\u2019s friend had gone, mom came back and made dinner.<br>\r\n\u201cAlyix slow down that\u2019s your second bowl, let your sister finish one before you get another. Kat are ok? You have barely touched your dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine mom,\u201d I said vaguely, my mind was swirling with all the possibilities of the ring, according to Tawaret and what I found on the internet, the ring could transfer pregnancy and prevent labour as well create an illusionary pregnancy as she had tried on Alyix. It could help a body cope with pregnancy and even make it enjoyable. One thing it couldn\u2019t do was create a real pregnancy; I suspected there were some other powers that could be unlocked somehow. But I needed to test these powers and I needed some on to test them on. I turned to look at Alyix\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here to ask me out again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat, who's this friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tawaret, meet Paul. Imaginary Paul in my head, meet Tawaret. I should also mention that Paul has a thing for pregnant women.\" That was probably a bad idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\" I didn't like her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tawaret don't you dare---\" Too late. She used her illusions to make me look pregnant in front of Paul. Paul simply stood there gaping at my newly enlarged belly. \"Godammit Tawaret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Kat, us girls just want to have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I mention he also likes me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh this could be interesting.\" By that time Paul had recovered enough to put together basic sentences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. How. Why. You pregnant?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear you should put the poor boy out of his misery and just have sex with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helpful Tawaret\" I thought with metaphorically gritted teeth.

I undressed myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so hot\".  There was a large bulge in his pants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just know this doesn't change anything between us.  We will still just be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\".  He came over to me and ran his hands over my belly. He moaned loudly.  I unbuckled his pants and he quickly shucked them off.  He started rubbing his cock all over my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feels so weird.  I thought and Tawaret giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed again.  \"Can we just get this over with please?\"  He moaned again so I laid down on my back and spread out my legs so he could enter me easily.  But instead of entering me he got down on his knees and slowly kissed his way down from my belly to my pussy.  When he got to my pussy, he placed a kiss on the inside of each leg.  Then he stuck his finger inside my pussy.  While he worked my pussy with his fingers he kept kissing my pregnant belly.  I didn't want to admit it but it felt good.  I let out a groan as I started to orgasm.  As I felt another orgasm come up he switched from finger-fucking me to eating me out.  I moaned again in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Paul! Fuck!\"  I came once more.  He stopped and stood up.  He teased my pussy by rubbing the tip of his cock on the entrance of my pussy.  He had this stupid smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Paul! Stop staring at my belly and just fuck me already!\".  In one fell swoop he penetrated me all the way to the hilt.  I grimaced a little;  He was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"  I nodded.  Slowly he slid out and then back in and out and it at a slow speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like slow torture.  \"Faster, Paul.  Faster.\"  He sped up the pace but still kept it gentle.  \"Paul.\" I whined.  \"You might be trying to be careful because it looks like I'm pregnant, but if we're going to keep this up at least make it worth my while.  I liked to be fucked hard and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure Kat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"  He nodded and suddenly he was slamming me at a faster pace.  It's a good thing he worked out a lot.  \"Oh god Paul!  Fuck! \" I came over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Kat! You're so tight.  Fuck!\"  he gritted his teeth and then pulled out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to last long tike that and I intend to take u in other ways too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  I said I'd have sex not have a sex marathon.\"</span></div></div>",

This is the alternative method of allowing me to get stronger you know? Aside from being around a lot of pregnant women or the host being actually pregnant when the host has intercourse I become more powerful.\" Realizing that I didn't have a choice but to let him continue I motioned for him to do so. It seemed he had a lot inside him because I felt my belly grow a bit I think it made my belly grow to what the illusion made me look. Tawaret said, \"Talk about a overload never seen a man backed up with that much sperm. It seems I can handle some of my more straining powers not able to use certain ones yet but the ones I can do its not much of a burden as it once was. Oh look he fell asleep.\" I saw Paul passed out. Who'd have known he had that much inside him. I could feel and hear his seed sloshing inside me. I said, \"Sheesh with that much I'm going to be pregnant for sure.\" Tawaret said, \"No doubt about that one. Anyways since he's asleep I suggest we do something to pass the time.\" I agreed and decided to..</span></div></div>",
