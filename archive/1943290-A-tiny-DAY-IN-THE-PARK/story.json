Most people were friendly, loving and helped each other out in times of crisis. The village had a population of about one hundred citizens, and each of these citizens went about a normal day. The village was antiquated, but still lived in harmony with nature, using every peace of scrap they could find. They were happy where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where exactly are they? Surrounding the village is nothing but a vast forest as far as one can see and be willing to travel. No one really had been outside of the village in a long time. Legend has it that there once were a group of pilgrims who bravely wandered off and were attacked by enormous monsters and never heard of again! ...but those are simply just legends, right? Perhaps, but perhaps not. You see this forest where the peaceful villagers live is actually just the backyard to a house lived in by four girls.To the girls, the village would simply just look like an ant colony, or just a gathering of bugs. The village was tiny, and the citizens are just about 1 millimeter in scale compared to one of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the girls and the villagers lived completely opposite and unaware to one another, that is up until now...</span></div></div>",

As the days past, the townsfolk urged their leaders to make some changes, imploring that they explore far beyond their village. A small group of individuals, Glen, Justin, Nick, and Ricko decided that they weren't going to be tolerating this any longer. They thought that waiting around and watching their village fall about due to lack of supplies was not the way they wanted this all to end. So rather then wait for their leaders to make a move, they asked themselves, \"what should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

The began their trip though the wilderness, chopping down branches and shrubbery that got in their way. Time past quickly as their journey took age, hours turned into days, and soon enough the encountered trouble. A back of gross looking alien like species emerged in front of them. They were horrid looking, with black exoskeletons and wild like pincers. They were vile, they were large....they were merely ants, but to the four adventurers, they were they enemy. The four stood their ground bravely as the hideous beast swarmed them, and like a zombie apocalypse, the four heroes banded together and slew the monsters. They cleaned off their blades and scavenged the beasts' carcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, they set up camp in a larger, more open sector. They lit a small campfire and rested for the night. Soon enough the group was woken up by loud booms that shook the very floor they were sleeping on. The sound grew louder and an enormous mountain like figure emerged out of the sunlight. Its' mass plopped right next to the group, nearly flattening their existence, and then suddenly it lifted up and vanished as quickly as it appeared. The sounds grew fainter and the shaking slowly diminished, but the most unsettling aspect was that what ever that thing is, was now headed strait to where their village is located! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four heroes now needed to make a choice, should they run back to the village, a trip that took them a full day, or should they press onward?</span></div></div>",

Well, this beast isn't so much a beast as it is a beauty. It was a lovely girl named Sammy, she was wandering around in her backyard walking toward the vegetable garden to pick some fresh strawberries. Unfortunately for the tiny village, they are located right in the vegetable garden! Sammy walked blissfully unaware of the tiny village in her path, but she slowly strolled about. She loved how the grass and the earth felt underneath her bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny village felt their earth start to rumble and they could see a large figure start to make its' dramatic appearance. They inhabitants began to gather around in awe of the impressive sight, it was definitely a beautiful sight, Sammy was something to look at. She has long brown hair that she wears in a pony tail, and a fine body. She did not disappoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers all stood together and glared up at the impressive sight, even the villagers that are supposed to be guarding their most prized possession stared up in awe, but did not leave their posts. What was their most prized possession? It was the source where they received most of their food. It was a rather large, and red object filled with nectar. It was essentially just a strawberry.... and there was about ten guards defending it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

They ran and bolted, juking out trees (blades of grass) and other things, until they got into an open patch of badlands. The two of them were running out of breath, while the bandits did not show any sign of relenting... Just as the bandits had caught up to them, and readied their weapons, everyone felt the tremors that shook the earth once more... and with in an instant, an enormous figure made it's appearance overhead. There was no trees, or foliage to obscure their view... it was a gigantic woman. It was Sammy walking back from the garden. She was unfathomably immense, and then suddenly they saw her giant barefoot block out the light above them. It came down slowly and cast a shadow that dwarfed everything they ever knew... and then the giant's foot fell flat on the surface. The sole of her foot smothered the group of attacking bandits, and smashed them into the earth, while Glen and Justin fit safely between her toes, just out of her crushing impact. They felt her weight shift as the giant girl began to lift her foot away. You could see some of the tiny bandits squished on her soft under sole of her bare foot. They needed to make a decision, should they grab onto her toes and try to find out some answers, or do they let the giant leave and look for their other two friends?</span></div></div>",

She began to lift her foot up and her two puny ride-a-longs could feel the pressure as the G forces shifted and put a strain on their tiny bodies. With each footstep, the duo could see the parts of the earth that they once called a forest flatten, and give under the enormous pressure of the giant girl. It was quite the thrill ride, but the two tine villagers could not enjoy it in the least bit, due to the fact that they needed their full attentions on staying \"un-flattened\" themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hanging on for dear life, Glen can see something mildy recognizable up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what I think it is!?\" He shouted out loud to Justin<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Justin Asked<br>\r\n\"It looks kinda of like another village! I thought we were alone out here!?\" Glen Exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin and Glen had a smile on their faces for the first time in a few days, finally some fruit of their labor, but all did not seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir smiles dropped quickly as they noticed that Sammy's foot falls were getting dangerously closer and closer to the new tiny village. They knew that if they tried to hop off from here it would be certain death, so they yelled and screamed to maybe warn the village of the impending doom. First came Sammy's right foot, it crashed into the soil next to the village, then the inevitable happened. She raised her left foot and took another casual step. She planted it down heel first, it crashed to the ground right in front of the village, casting a shadow over the whole thing. Time seemed to slow down as Glen and Justin remained as spectators, watching from in between the girl's toes. They watched as the sole of her left foot came crashing down onto the village; crushing buildings and citizens alike.All they could do is stare as the rest of Sammy's foot fell over the remainder of the village, crushing everything with one foot step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin and Glen were horrified and speechless. The only thing that crossed their minds was the thought of if their own village suffered the same fate... Glen looked up to see the look on this monster's face... She didn't even glance down, she didn't even realize that she just destroyed and entire village, generations of people gone in a single moment. She Just kept casually walking as the remnants of debris on bodies fumbled from her under sole.  </span></div></div>",

The tiny men were in a panic, and tried to get the giants attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got to the restaurant and got a table, and Sammy felt something between her toes. She went to the restroom to go and see what was moving in between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the bathroom and slid her shoe off, than took off her wet sock, and looked between her toes and saw something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy always heard stories of tiny men, but never believed in them.
