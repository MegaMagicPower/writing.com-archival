Forever, the thought of being a dog for the rest of your life is overwhelming. You had human friends that you visited whenever you could, you had stuff that you just couldn't enjoy if you were a dog. You wouldn't be able play your video games, you wouldn't be able to eat some of your favorite foods (because stuff in them didn't exactly agree with dogs). Sure dogs have toys and can get away with plenty of things no person could, but when it comes down to it, people have more advantages in life than dogs ever will. \"I'm going to the lab to see if this formula can be reversed, Suzie!(your sister) Make sure the door stays locked and don't open it for anyone!\" After that she leaves. You're sister sits there petting you trying to comfort you as best she can. \"Don't worry Nick, if you have to be a dog forever you can sleep in my room anytime you want company, I'll give you parts of my dinner if you want them.\" You appreciated her trying to comfort you but it honestly wasn't doing you much good at this point.

Since he was still going to be a dog for three more months, Suzie said she would do his homework for him. Luckily, she was in the same class. He could see that look in her eyes that told him she truly cared about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(9:30 p.m.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie: Okay, Nick! Time for bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crawled into the room and lay down in the corner. Suzie gave him a smile and turned off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Travis, your ultra annoying younger brother's, POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis came home at midnight. He was at camp for a couple of weeks and, not wanting to make noise while everyone was sleeping, he tiptoed upstairs and unpacked. When he was done, he went downstairs to grab a glass of water while he played on his Playstation 3. When he got to the kitchen, he saw a vial with a dog picture on it. He read the label. \"Drink to turn into a dog. Extremely dangerous, keep out of reach of children.\" Intresting... he could finally get revenge on the two who ruined his life! He walked up the stairs, tiptoed through the hallway, quietly creaked the door open, ran over to his sister, and saw that his older brother had been already been turned into a dog. Excellent. That saves him the trouble of sneaking into his room as well. So he poured the formula into his Suzie's mouth, she subconsciously swallowed it, and the changes started almost immediately. Quietly, he snuck out of the room, and ran down the kitchen to destroy the other vial which had the reversal formula. He silently put on some gloves to destroy the vial. His dad was a detective, and he would be able to detect fingerprints. He even turned the garage into his crime lab. Also, Travis didn't want's cut up his hand, thus crushing two birds with one stone. So, he held the vial tight in his hands, and shattered it. His plan was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Suzie's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a dreadful nightmare, which I will not describe, Suzie woke up and noticed that her hands had turned into paws, her tail had grown back, and her hair, or fur, was longer! Unless she was dreaming in a dream, she had turned into a dog! She then noticed something. Travis always left a card with a shell on it. That's how she knew Travis did this to her. Not knowing what to do, she woke up Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nick's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened up his eyes to see a dog standing in front of him, which he immediately recognized as his sister. Nick thought she had turned human again. So why was she a dog? Then he saw that look of worry in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: Suzie? Why have you turned back into a dog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie: I'm guessing Travis did it. I found his card in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: Travis? I thought he was at camp. He shouldn't be back for another week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie: I don't know why, but I... just know he's the one who did this. And if I had to take a guess, I'd say he also destroyed the reversal formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: I... I'm sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie: It's not your fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: Yes, it is. If I hadn't--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie: You did nothing wrong. I should have been more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick: I'm still sorry that this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking some more about the incident, the finally went to sleep. Only to be woken up by an alarm clock thirty minutes later.</span></div></div>",

This then makes you cry silently. \"Aren't you going to come in and sleep?\" she asks. She then hears you crying, she realizes that she was a little harsh to you and comes up to you. \"Hey, I'm sorry for the way a I acted towards you earlier. I know you must miss your folks just as much as I miss mine. But we'll have to put the past behind us. We're wolves now,\" she says trying to comfort you. \"Thanks,\" You reply. \"Hey, if the humans were after us they would have found us by now, so lets get some sleep. By the way what is your name?\" she asks. \"It's John.\" And with that the two of you go to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

For some reason she looked like a cute wolf pup, and that's when you realized something. The cave looked a whole lot bigger then the night before. It dawned on you that you were both pups now. \"Kate, Kate wake up,\" you say and she slowly gets up with a yawn. \"Wow, who are you?\" she asks, not realizing it's you. \"Kate, it's me, John,\" you say. \"What happened? You look so cute now,\" she says, blushing. \"Well thank you, you do as well, but your guess is as good as mine. First we're human, then we turn wolf and now we're pups,\" you say, trying to figure out the whole situation. \"Well, I actually know some stuff about wolves from science at school. And judging from our size, we are actually too young to be out on our own or eat meat,\" Kate says. \"Wow, I didn't know we could tell how old a pup is based on their size. You know more then me,\" You reply. Just then you hear voices outside. \"The scent is stronger now dear, we're getting close. They are definitely wolves,\" voice one (male) says. \"Yes, but their scent seems to be that of a pups dear. I can't pick up an adult's scent though,\" voice two (female) says. The footsteps and sniffing get closer and then you see one of the wolves in the entrance. Kate hides behind you and you both start to back up in fear that they may hurt you. The female wolf says as her mate walks in, \"I found them Blaze, don't be afraid little ones. We're hear to help you. You seem to have been through a lot, where are your parents?\" You hung your heads knowing you can only tell them part of the truth and you say, \"We don't have parents anymore. My name is John by the way, and this is Kate.\" \"Ah, your another pair of those humans turned into wolves by the ancestors,\" Blaze says. \"Wait, you mean you know about what happened?\" you ask in shock. \"And You say the ancestors did this to us and we would become wolves no matter what?\" Kate adds. \"Yes, so what ever happened between the two of you after you met was all coincidence,\" the female wolf says. \"Sorry for snapping at you  yesterday John,\" Kate says. \"That's okay, I probably would have reacted the same way,\" You reply. \"Well, we better get you two back to the safety of our pack. The forest can be quite dangerous for pups your age. Blaze if you could carry Kate back to our den,\" The female says as her mate walks towards Kate. \"Of course Nyla,\" Blaze says and gently picks up Kate. Nyla does the same with you and you notice your body goes completely numb, making you assume this is a wolf pup's Achilles heal. They carry you back to their den and you soon see many of the pack members sitting around or playing with each other. They soon stop and pay their respects to the two wolves carrying you, leading you to assume that the wolves carrying you are the alpha pair. Soon you are in the den and the alpha's set you and Kate down. \"I am going to talk with the pack about our new pups Nyla,\" Blaze says. Nyla nods and says as she lays down on her side, \"Well, while he talks to the pack about us adopting you, come have some breakfast little ones. You've had a long journey, and you need nourishment.\" You soon see her nipples ready for you and Kate to nurse. \"Well we aren't becoming human again. And we are too young to have meat. Looks like we're having milk sis,\" You say. Kate giggles and soon both of you latch on and begin to suckle, feeling warm nourishing milk flow down your throats. Nyla, your new mother, smiles and licks both of you, happy you have accepted her offer. She loves the feeling of being able to protect and provide for the two of you as you nurse.</span></div></div>",

Plus You don't want to trek too far from the den without them, for you could end up bumping into the humans that you had just escaped from the day before as adults. They'll easily catch you as pups. Your father soon walks in and says, \"The pack is ready to greet our pups with a good welcome.\" Your mother then nudges you and your sister in the rear after saying, \"Well lets go meet the pack then pups.\" You all head towards the den entrance and are greeted by a blinding light.

Soon enough, you see a little hiding spot in some bushes near the park.\"(pant pant) Ok... I think we lost him\" You start winding down and relax, all the while thinking of how your day's been so far.Then something catches your eye, so you gaze to your left.You notice the girl that you bit, now a wolf, looking a little shocked. Her limbs are shaking and her eyes are enlarged. You assume that it's probably because of the day she's had. Even though she's kind of big, almost like a full grown wolf, she's still a young girl... Then she starts panting hard, and occasionally looks at you, so you take the bait. \"Ok, what's wrong? You look so worried...\" \"Well...\" She starts, but pauses as though trying to find the words. \"When we were escaping, at the part when I called to my daddy, he called me a wolf!... And at that moment, I was so shocked that it shut my human mind down a bit and I could see how my new mind took hold, how it saw the world. After my daddy called me wolf, I started thinking like one. I now didn't think of him as daddy... I thought of him as a threat and that all threats need to be taken care of, and I was ready to bite, even <i>Kill</i>! \" You never really even thought of it that way and wondered if you thought of things like that when your mom was beating you with a broom. \"And...\" Oh, she wasn't done, you think to yourself. \"I tried so desperately to get back my human thoughts, but I only just got it back! And while we were running over here, I looked at everybody and tried to think of them as people, but all I could think was 'meat' !!!... \" You can see her going through the horror over again by just looking at her eyes... \"Then I looked at you!\" She then suddenly turns her head in your direction and stairs at you like you are the light in her tunnel. \" And when I look at you, I feel, I feel as though you are my friend, family, and ... leader.\" She then looked away. It seemed as though she was embarrassed, but it was nothing to be embarrassed about, because it was a normal wolf thought.<br>\r\n The young girl (wolf) then drooped her head and started sobbing. You feel really bad for her and it was because of you this happened. You try to find a way to comfort her, but your wolf mind urges you to lick her (Please don't take it wrong). Then you get closer and wait till she looks at you, and then start licking her cheek. It feels good so she starts wagging her tail, and helping her become happy made you happy which made you wag your tail! Thinking of how happy you are making her happy made you lose track of how much you were licking her. After like a minute of licking her cheek, the young wolf realized how long you were 'comforting' her and snapped out of it. \"Woah... you know I don't like you right, I mean you <i>are</i> the one that made me the way I am now!\" Saying this killed your happiness and made you droop your head. \"Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm just so upset that I can't have my old life back!\" Then you feel something wet on your cheek, and you turn to find the young wolf trying to comfort you. You try to remember what she looked like before she became a wolf, but nothing came to mind. \"Um, how old were you when I bit you?\" \"Well I  was ...13, but I was always told I looked younger...\" Hmmm, not much younger then you... \" What was your name?\" \"My name was ...\" Both of you just froze, you heard voices coming a little further away. \"Let's talk about me later, we gotta get somewhere safely!</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the road is filled with cars and pedestrians. Charging through, careful not to get hit by any moving vehicles and resisting the urge to take a bite out of everyone you pass, you hear the ASPCA in hot pursuit on motorcycles. In the side-view mirrors of a passing car, you see they are armed with tranquillizer guns, and they are aimed right at you. You stop for a split second, and their momentum sends them sailing past you, crashing one of them into a telephone pole. The other man kicked it to full throttle and went after the other wolf. Not wasting time, you sprint off in their direction.<br>\r\nYou run right past him and catch up with the young wolf, but sprinting causes you to tire and slow down. Your pursuer grabs a net and runs it just an inch or two off the ground. At this point, you are almost at the forest. He was just a few inches from scooping up the two of you.

You keep looking at the writing and with each line failing to make sense, you start whining. \"What is it boy?\" The girl says turning to face the wall. \"Ooohhh! some crazy writing!\"  As she reads the words, you notice that there is something off of how she says the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird,  I can tell what it means, but the words are misspelled badly!\" Well, at least this didn't mean you weren't loosing your ability to read... \"So here's what it says...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without much thought, she grabbed a cup from her purse and started drinking. After a while she drank close to a gallon of water. She felt refreshed, but a little uneasy. She thought she felt uneasy because she was guilty drinking foreign water, but what she didn't realize is that she was transforming from the inside. What she also didn't know was that the water she was drinking had magic properties. The other part of the secret in the cave was the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of their town was built, it was a big forest and every month the cave was visited by many couples. One day there was a woman named Helen, who fell in love with a beast. He was a very kind beast, but no one was brave enough to get to know him. To them, he was a monster and people wanted him dead. Helen grew up hearing the story and thought of him as a prince of a fairy tale, but she knew not to tell a soul of her secret, because she knew that they would laugh and tease her throughout her life. When she was older, she ventured out into the forest and stumbled upon a cave (yes the very cave you and the girl you love are in now). What she didn't know was that this cave belonged to the beast and that this was his home. She stayed in the cave thinking it was really pretty and drew pictures of the beast to entertain herself before leaving the cave. What Helen didn't know was that while she was drawing, the beast came back from his hunt. He came real slow like and began watching her draw. When he noticed that she was drawing him, he became happy, and thought that this woman maybe would be kind enough to be his friend. After she was finished, she put a crown on the top of his head. When she turned around, she finally saw that she was not alone. The beast could tell she was very frightened, so he rolled where his stomach was facing up and made small whimpers to show he was friendly. As Helen looked more deep into his eyes, she knew that he was the beast, and she hugged him. Soon she visited the beast everyday and they would spend all day together. Eventually, Helen learned his language and they would tell each other everything. She finally made the choice to live with him and everything was perfect. While living with him, she found this wall near the front of the cave and thought of her beast. She decided to write what she believed, and because she heard of other couples becoming one when they entered this cave, she wrote her thoughts.<br>\r\nWhile exploring her and the beast's cave, she found a puddle (the same one your loved one found and drank the water from). She looked at how clear it was and decided to drink, but not before saying a little something as a toast. \"Please,\" she started. \"Please let me stay in the beast's life as long as I can!\" As she drank, she felt uneasy. She thought she would die, so she said another little toast. \"I love my beast, and for the future, help all lovers who drink this drink to be together and help them stay with each other forever...\" and with that she fell asleep. When she woke up, she was shocked at two things. One, she was alive! And the other, she wasn't human! She looked just like the beast, but more feminine. Helen felt shocked and didn't know what to do, and if that wasn't enough, her beast had just came back from a successful hunt only to find another him (feminine of course). At first, he didn't  know it was Helen, but after looking into her eyes like she did with him, he realized it was her. She is still in shock of what just happened, but was more relaxed now that her beast knew who she was. He licked her tear stained cheeks and they huddled together for the rest of the day. Years later they grew old and had altered pups. They ruled the forest for years and years to come and are known as wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back from your hunt, you notice that something is wrong with the girl you love and decide to investigate. You come to the conclusion that she needs some sleep. You clamp your muzzle on the neck of her shirt collar and drag her to a comfortable spot of the cave, since she said that she was too stiff to move. You lick her cheeks and forehead trying to do everything you can to comfort her and make her feel better, but to no avail. It seem like she's burning up, and you don't know what to do. All you can think to do is to howl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on?!?!</span></div></div>",

Too afraid that if you speak all you could do is yip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour foreright leg catches on your bedsheets (which you must have kicked off in your sleep) and you suddenly find yourself wrapped in a tight cuccoon of your bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't help at all, you panic even more and you find yourself going over the side of your bed away from your door (it's closed, by the way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're finally too tired to move after another minute of flailing within the sheets, but your mind is racing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What happened to me??! HOW could this happen?!! Who did this?! I don't want to be a fox!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled voice reaches your ears, which instinctively perked up to listen for it. Your entire body was wrapped up too much to make any sense of it-- only your nose somehow found its way out through a hole you had discovered last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't let my family see me like this!!'

I might be the only one!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the voice calls, much closer this time, something was wrong. You could not understand it. Everyone only speaks English in your family, but that wasn't English. The Accent WAS though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whatever happened to me must have made Enlish sound like that!'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you wanted to, going nuts over this latest development was, you quckly decided, the worst thing you could do at the moment. If whatever's controlling your body is going to make true on its threat, then you have to get out of here. And getting out of here means first to make sense of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, this actually does make things make some sort of sense. The most logical thing is that whatever has your body has put your mind into a random red fox, which is the easy, yet cliched solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also unlikely, there were no reports of foxes living in your neighboor hood and there were things more avaliable. ...like squirrels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, which sounded oddly in your new fox body, and decided that you had to get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you tried to stand up on all fours, trying to keep the weight evenly distributed on them. After a minute, you finally prefected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd sensation. You new that you were standing like any fox would, but you couldn't help feeling that you had to get off your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement #2: Walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have a problem. Walking with two legs is rather straight foreward-- you put one foot in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with four, you weren't sure in what order to move them. You never really watched dogs walk, you just know how they run because we all can remember a dog racing to get a frisbee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that you needed to move one of your forelegs to start it off, so you took one step with your right, stopping mid stride to balance again. You moved the left forward, then carefully the back right, then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYay! You moved foreward one step and it only took you a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at yourself again. Then looked over your shoulder at the open side of the underbed. This was going to take awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement #3: the roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling would get you there much quicker than this pathetic little walk of yours. With two little hops, one for fore and one for back, you turned yourself so that you could roll out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you did rather easily, besides hitting your tail on a leg, you were a natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOooh... the tail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got up-- teetered a bit too far, fell back down, then carefully got back up-- and looked back at it. You knew why you had it-- counterbalance. But this new feeling you had with it.... it was eerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier than you thought to move it. Left, right, up, down, circle, up as far as you could, down on the floor. You wagged it, laughing softly at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy a fox? Yeah, you thought the Fennics were cute, its hard not to say they are. But you were indifferent with foxes in general. A dog would be easier to find around here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Maybe some weirdo is commanding your life with a click of a mouse and the clack of a keyboard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......that would be disturbing and just wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your odd walk to the end of the bed and peered around it. There was the rest of your room, much, much larger than you know should know it. But its not much of a hiding place-- your red, the room is green. You stick out like a Captain Kirk in Star Wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. Not so. Kirk in Star Wars would be cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to get that door open.... maybe you could pounce the doornob or build some sort of ladder... but that might take too long. But if you do get out, you can always hide out amongst in your sister's corner o' giant stuffed animals. She was a big fan of foxes and most of the pile consist them. You'll never be found in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...this transformation can't be because of that, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes looked towards your window-- your room was on the ground floor and it's never locked. With a little manuvering, you might be able to open it. But your neighbors might see you... but it might be the easist way.</span></div></div>",

Anywhere was better than this place. Outside there were trees, fences, bushes, warm buildings and other places to sleep. It was a dog eat dog world, and that he could live with. Still, he had some doubts. His mother had the eyes of a hawk and could spot trouble 100 miles away, even worse, she was allergic to cats.

It was warm and fluffy against his fur, and for a moment he nearly mistook it for his bed. He yawn's, realizing how tired he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll decide what to do tomorrow,\" he decides, and falls fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn dreamed of standing in an open field, full of flowers, and butterflies. He was still the same gray striped kitten he had turned into earlier, and in this dream; he was a cat all along. Like any old kitten, he ran around and chased the little insects, which struggled and bounced against his paws. In this world he truly felt free and blessed, happy to be an independent creature that needed no one. Or, maybe he did? He stopped in place and let the grasshopper go. There was one thing wrong in this dream. It wasn't that he was a human who had been turned into a cat through some stroke of luck. It wasn't because he was dreaming of another world. It was because he was alone. He was a house cat, not a stray. Cats were the most solitary yet human independent creatures on this Earth. He was yearning for a companion, someone to hold him and pet him and love him to all eternity. Isn't that what a cat always wanted? To re-witness the same feeling that was there when it was born? He turned around, as if to run back to his house, but it wasn't there. It was just another field that stretched on for miles. Maybe being a cat wasn\u2019t so great after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn woke up with a jowl. He was locked within a dark, cramped closet, and for a moment he thought he was alone again until his sister appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she yelled to him. \u201cCan\u2019t you see that I\u2019m asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow!\u201d he yelled back in protest. He remembered now. He wasn\u2019t dreaming anymore, he was still a human and he had a sister. Who, so happens, turns out to be the most I-Hate-Being-Woken-Up person ever. \u201cMeow!\u201d he yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you hungry or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow!\u201d he said, John meant to say, I\u2019m lonely can I please get out of this closet? But instead his stomach rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll get you something.\u201d She walked out, still mumbling. \u201cStupid cat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later John sat staring wide eyed at a huge sugar glazed doughnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all I can find since I already drank all the milk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was delighted. If everyday promises a huge doughnut, then maybe being a cat wasn\u2019t so bad after all! He took a bite, and immediately became sad. The doughnut was dry and tasteless against his mouth. Now he understood what the dream was about. His mind was becoming that of a cat! This was enough! He had to find a way to tell his sister to find a way to turn him back.

Got your text and you said you had something important\" Nicole says with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! You're not going to believe this but I have to tell you in private.

Lets go up to my room! Also, isn't your little brother's name John too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, John just seemed like a good name for a pet\" Allie says as she gives you a wink. \"Hey is Mittens around anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I think she's somewhere around the yard right now, she'll probably turn up later. Anyway, get in here and lets go! I wanna hear what's up ya dork!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie suddenly reaches down and grabs you, pulling you in tight to her low cut tank top. Hurrying up the stairs, you snuggle yourself against her, catching yourself almost beginning to purr. As you enter Nicole's room, Allie sets you down just as quickly as she picked you up. Almost instantly, you're taken with all the cool posters of bands you've never heard of before, along with seeing her guitar in the corner. You knew Nicole was into music, but this just deepens your crush. As you wander around the floor inspecting her room, both girls plop themselves down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay already! So tell me, what's up Allie. Did Kevin ask you out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha no way! So you're not going to believe this, but here goes!\" Allie points to you with excitement. \"John my cat, is actually my little brother John. My little brother turned into a cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowns. \"You're right, I don't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! Here let me prove it. Get out your laptop, John will type you out something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Allie, I think you're taking this practical joke thing a little too far but I'll play along\" Nicole says as she pulls out her laptop, opening it on the bed. \"Here boy, cmere here\" as she pats the bed calling for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leap for the bed, you miss ever so slightly and tumble back down to the floor. \"Ha, maybe this cat is your brother, he's almost as clumsy\" Nicole says as she reaches down and pulls you onto the bed, placing you in-between herself and the laptop. \"Okay Johnny, I know you have a huuuge crush on me. So why don't you go ahead and slip me a secret message on my laptop. Promise I won't tell your  sister\" as Nicole shoots Allie a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart racing at being found out, you slowly begin to move your paws to type out your message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hui noiciole yuiore niuce ajnd poretty\" you type with much difficulty.

It's actually my brother, he's really a cat\" Allie interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how did this happen... I mean... if I were to believe this was actually your brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole wraps her mind around the situation you been typing again. \"iu wioke uop liukre tyhis anhd Inm weanrt a fgreind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that's so sad, and OH MY GOD this cat is so freaking cute when he types! Allie, we should put this on the web\" Nicole says as she pulls you in tight with a hug, overwhelming you with her perfume. You can't place it but it falls somewhere between a blend of strawberries and lavender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said Nicole! Anyway I'm kind of jealous of him, he doesn't have to go to school or do work. He's free just to hang out with two awesome hotties like us all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yea I guess you're right.

I'd take such good care of you too ya nerd, nothing but tuna and snuggles.\" Allie then pounces on the two of you for a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you sit together, one of the girls says they're starting to feel something... weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is the closest you've ever been able to get with Nicole and her generously-proportioned chest which seemed all the more enormous since having become a 9 inch tall housepet. For a second, you find yourself thinking that it almost seemed like a fair trade off. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Allie yelps right into your sensitive cat ears, ending your euphoria and causing both you and Nicole to pull away on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up\u201d Nicole asks, her voiced filled with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo weird, I just felt like... a shock go through me.. it kinda hurt but... now I feel kinda good. Like... all warm and fuzzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Nicole's voice trailing off as she raises her hand, point towards Allie. \"Allie\u2026 your ears...\" From your view on the bed you can see what appears to be a pair of pointed brown ears slowly emerge from your sister's blonde hair, the realization causing your heart to jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! This is so weird. I'm feeling all itchy now, specially my ears!\" Allie's hands move to itch her ears, or at least where they should be. \"What the... oh my god! My ears, they'e like... moving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie vaults off her bed leaving you tumbling in her wake as she rushes to the nearby full length closet mirror, Nicole seemingly frozen on the bed in shock. Inspecting herself in the mirror, Allie's mouth hangs open as she sees that her ears have completely migrated to the top of her head, furrowing themselves to tips and covered in a soft blonde fur that nearly matches her hair. As she stands shocked, you notice from your prime position on the bed that her nose is ever so slowly pushing outward, the tip turning a soft pink in the process. You\u2019re actually surprised how well you can see all of what is unfolding with your new feline eys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... my nose\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d Allie whimpers as she brings her hand gently to her cheek, feeling the change as she watches her nose push further outward. Her mouth begins to form a small split on her upper lip, pushing itself upward to meet what has now formed into a small muzzle.  A twitch of her hands draws her gaze to them. Frozen, she sees that her fingers are slowly beginning to pull in on themselves. Her fingernails ever so slowly turning darker, sharper. After a mere moment, her hands have fully withdrawn on themselves into fully formed paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you, your sister has become a living catgirl sporting cat ears, muzzle, and paws!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe wish\u2026 do you think it's causing this\u201d Nicole manages to eek out, poised on the edge of her bed. \"\"That doesn't make any sense Nicole! It was your dumb wish, why would it affect me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Allie fuming with anger at her reflection, you spot a bulge beginning to build at the top of her tight jeans, knowing full well what it must be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAllie... I don't know what's happening but\u2026\u201d Nicole says meekly. \u201cYour butt\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d she trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see you and Nicole on the bed, her paws suddenly fly to her backside. \u201cOh the hell\u2026 it hurts\u2026 what\u2019s happening now\u2026\u201d Allie fumbles with her paws desperately trying to push down her jeans, her paws useless in their ability to work the buttons which now appear to be at their breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicole help me my pants! I can\u2019t do it\u201d she pleads, causing your crush to fly off the bed to assist. Kneeling down, her hands trembling, Nicole struggles to undo the jean buttons while Allie fidgets frantically. \u201cNicole please hurry I need these off now!\u201d Nicole, who is well past the verge of freaking out shouts back \u201cI\u2019m trying, stop moving around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole undoes the final button, she forcefully shoves down her best friends jeans causing a large, tabby tail to explode forth that is covered in the same soft brown fur that covers her ears. \u201cOh my god!\u201d Nicole shrieks at the sudden sight that she is greeted to, her face turning a bright red and you yourself nearly have a nosebleed. Your sister isn\u2019t wearing any underwear! \u201cOh my god that feels so good\u201d Allie says in relief as she looks down to her friend who is still kneeling and whose face is still hip high. Realizing what\u2019s happened and that she\u2019s exposed, Allie hurriedly covers her crotch with her paws. \u201cOh my god! Don\u2019t look at me!\u201d She says to you both before turning to the mirror to see that there is now a three foot tail waving in the air that is most certainly connected to her right above the creese of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a\u2026 a\u2026 tail\u2026\u201d Allie trails off before Nicole, mesmerized and seemingly over the sudden display of nudity reaches out to touch the waving appendage. \u201cWhat are you\u2026. Ooooh\u2026 that feels\u2026 like great.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so soft Allie, sorry! But I can\u2019t help myself, it\u2019s so amazing. You have a tail!\u201d It\u2019s surreal to find yourself watching your crush stroking your sister's furry tail as she stands before you with her pants almost around her knees. You can\u2019t help but let out the cat equivalent of a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to sit down, this is way too much\u201d as she shuffles to the bed, her jeans still resting at a height that leaves zero to your imagination. Nicole takes a seat next to her, doing her best to comfort her friend. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do Allie. You\u2019re like, a catgirl.\u201d \u201cWell for starters you could keep stroking my tail\u201d Allie says with a soft laugh. \"Hah, okay nerd, I can do that\u201d as she goes back to softly rubbing Allie\u2019s tail. Resting her head on Nicole\u2019s shoulder, an odd hum begins to emanate through the room. Wait a minute, you know that sound. She\u2019s purring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh, weird question. Are your boobs getting bigger Nicole?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looks to your sister and back to herself before responding. \u201cI hope not, here, stand up with me for a second.\u201d As both girls rise off the bed, you can see that Allie is now staring barely above breast level with your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you're huge! Which means I'm... shrinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole squints in disbelief as you see your sis slightly shrink before your very eyes. \u201cOh wow, I can actually see you getting smaller\u2026\u201d Nicole looks down to see that her once skin tight tank top is now hanging rather loosely on her slim frame, the straps resting past her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorbed with her shrinking situation, you see that her heels are beginning to push themselves off the floor, the balls of her feet becoming her newest set of paws! Suddenly without warning, there is an audible cracking sound as Allie\u2019s hips rearrange themselves and she is quickly sent falling forward right into your Nicole\u2019s chest. There\u2019s an audible \u201coomph\u201d as the two make contact, as if there hasn\u2019t been enough awkward contact already for your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself free from Nicole's monstrously large chest, you can see that Allie is quickly approaching 4 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me Nicole! I don\u2019t want to be a cat, I don't want your wish!\u201d Her voice becoming slightly higher as the transformation hits her vocal cords. As her jeans have long since pooled at her ankles, you can see brown fur slowly spreading from Allie\u2019s hips covering her body bit by bit. \u201cI'm still so itchy, help me get this top off!\u201d She shouts in a now elevated pitch, her shrinking continuing unabated. Nicole fumbles to remove the top and bra as she is sinking further and further. quickly approaching her navel. The straps tangle briefly on the shrinking woman paws before popping off, revealing that your sister\u2019s perfectly shaped breasts exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing it's your sister, you can\u2019t help but become aroused as her transformation continues before your very eyes. Her thin tan body continuing to vanish under a coat of fur, her legs and arms cracking and popping and shifting. Allie is little more than 3 feet tall as her breasts vanish underneath her spreading fur, several nipples appearing on her belly, quickly becoming engulfed in blonde fur as well. Nicole continues to stands over Allie, her face in shock as is left holding the discarded tops and the transforming girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA diminutive Allie suddenly grabs her stomach with her paws, still continuing to shrink past her friends hips. \u201cOh god\u2026 my insides feel like they\u2019re twisting. My crotch is\u2026\u201d A paw shoots towards her groin as her genitals shift to the back of her body, int he process causing your sister to fall to the floor. Right before she strikes the hardwood floor, Allie catches herself with her new paws, effectively locking the small woman to a life on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wa..wa.. arrr... mereow!\" Allie criew out but all that leave her moths are a further devolving set of meows. The last of her changes take place as she finishes shrinking down to less than a foot and the last of the blonde fur covering her body, nothing remains of the former high school turned cat. Nicole, still standing above her friend, is left speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a crumpled pair of jeans is Allie, now a blonde cat and looking positively exhausted. Leaping off the bed and slowly approaching your sister, you struggle for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can you understand me sis? Are you okay?\" A set of meows leaving your feline lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... yea... I just feel like... sore everywhere\" Allie meows back to you. As you both sit together on the floor, Nicole looking over you, you hear a sound. It's . . .</span></div></div>",

As the sounds of her mother's heels reverberate throughout the house as she ascends the wooden staircase, Nicole thinks fast by sweeping Allie's strewn about clothes behind the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, there is a knock on the bedroom door. \"Honey is it safe to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Nicole trails off as her mother opens the door anyway.

And with little to occupy yourself you decide you might as well follow her and make yourself at home. For as long as you had known Nicole, you had been acquainted with her mother who insisted that you call her Kathryn, although you always called her Ms Truax out of respect. Despite her perpetual upbeat and peppy demeanor, you always felt awkward in her presence due to her incredible beauty and towering height. You had no way of knowing the exact numbers but you imagined she couldn't be much older than mid 40's and stood close to six feet tall in her heels. In addition, it was clear from her physique that she knew her way around the gym and was no slouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you follow Kathryn down the hallway, you are absorbed with how enormous she has become. \"Damn, I thought Nicole and Allie were big but here! She's like a skyscraper compared to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her master bedroom, she set down the briefcase and promptly slipped a laptop from it. Plopping herself down on the California king bed without even removing her heels, she spread out amongst its pillows while cracking the laptop open. Leaping onto the gargantuan bed, you settled beside the amazonian woman, nuzzling her chest without fear of reprisal. \"Well well well, aren't you friendly mister.\" Scratching your head with a free hand, she began opening various browser tabs as she scrolled amongst what seemed to be message boards for story listings, her eyes narrowing as she searched from something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it feels like its been forever since any of my favorite authors have posted any new stories\" she says causally to no one in particular. \"In fact, there doesn't seem to be much of anything new from anyone! Guess that's what I get for being into transformation as a kink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransformation? What is she talking about? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly tired, Kathryn looks to you and says \"At this rate I think I'll have to write some stories of my own Mr. Crush. I can see it now.\" Her slender and perfectly manicured fingers dancing on your head. \"Powerful executive and single mother comes home to a mysterious pet cat that her daughter is looking after. She makes her wish that life could be simpler. The wish goes awry and slowly she becomes a common house cat. A lowly pet for her daughter and unwilling mate for her feline companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked! Is she really suggesting she would want to turn into a cat, are those the kind of stories that she was searching for? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say mister, I imagine the plot trigger could be one little cat kiss.\" Leaning down to your position next to her generous chest, Ms Truax pouts her full red lips at you, looking expectantly for her kiss. Without missing a beat, you crane your head to her, and give her a little flick of your tongue. Dang, how do cat's kiss, is that it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you're so adorable. It's a shame we have to give you back to Allie's family soon, you're so cuddly wuddly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting her attention back to her laptop, she opened her word processor and started clicking away as she went right into her writing. She had neglected dinner or even bothering to remove her heels and work clothes which consisted of stockings, paired with her usual white blouse and low cut black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, little warm in here all of a sudden\" Kathryn says as she undoes a few buttons on her blouse.

She had apparently neglected dinner or even taking a moment to remove her gloss black heels as she lay on the bed. Her work attire consisted of her usual black stockings, pristine white blouse, and charcoal pencil skirt fixated high around her waist which created the illusion of her fit physique appearing all the more curvaceous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, a cat kiss, haven't written a story around that before. And then I could... ooh, little toasty in here.\" Kathryn muttered to herself, unbuttoning her blouse to reveal her generous curves before returning to the task at hand. \"At some point, I suppose I should find a new hobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPursing her full red lips, she focused intently on the task of writing her tale on the bed beside you. You couldn't help but gaze longingly at Ms. Truax. Only in your wildest dreams would you have been able to be this close with her. And yet, in that moment you wished that you could be with a woman that was as kind, intelligent, elegant, and beautiful as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a gasp left her lips, snapping you from your trance. As she shuddered, Kathryn took a few deep breaths. \"Oh my, what was that. It felt like.. well, I don't know....\" An audible, low grumbling began to emanate from her stomach as a look of discomfort crossed her face. The statuesque woman brought one hand across her waist, her blouse and jewelry looking slightly off. Raising a hand to her face, you watch as her wrist and lower palm begin to sink slowly under the cuff of the blouse. Her mouth agape, Kathryn's eyes widen. Looking her over, you could see her once skin tight skirt now seemed to be somewhat looser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this can't be real. I can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been simply a fantasy for Kathryn was now becoming a full-fledged reality unfolding before your very eyes! Trembling, Kathryn inhaled sharply as she sat herself up. Casting the laptop aside and pushing herself to the edge of the bed, Kathryn lifted one leg and simply stared as her glossy high heel dangled from her rapidly shrinking toes. As she watched, more and more of her foot slowly vanished within the heel. Her stockings beginning to lose their once firm hold along her toned legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to her hands pressed firmly into the comforter, you both see the cuffs of her blouse slowly overtake her fingertips. As for the rest of her blouse, what had once been a form fit earlier was now growing more uneven and bulky with each passing second. Kathryn gasped softly as her chest began to pull away from the black bra that she had filled moment earlier, slowly revealing her still generous and perky breasts. Kathryn's ears, which had largely been hidden by her long raven hair, were slowly creeping through her locks to reveal their growth while simultaneously becoming more pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell, she's not just shrinking. She's turning into a cat too!\" You think to yourself, elated with the possibilities that are sure to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-his is... I h-have to...\" Kathryn yelped in surprise as the sound of something heavy hit the floor, followed by a distinctively similar one. Creeping to the edge of the bed, you could see the culprits, her heels resting on the floor before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet dangling off the edge of the bed, you watch Kathryn wiggle her toes with rapt fascination. \"O-oh, this all feels... so weird... but I need...\" Her gaze quickly shifts from her feet to her phone which sits in the brieface across the room. Kathryn had already lost a considerable amount of size by now, perhaps an entire foot by your estimation. As she attempted to slide off the bed to reach the phone, the shrinking woman found herself off balance and tripping to the floor. Nimbly landing on her hands and knees, she instantly froze at the sight that greeted her.  Peaking out of the sleeves of her blouse where her slender fingers had once been, were now a pair of what resembled stubby, feline paws. Her perfect fingernails seemingly becoming absorbed through her skin as they turned dark and claw like. Around her sat the rings and bracelets which had adorned her moments earlier, having slipped off her body effortlessly during the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... paws. I have real paws!\" As she lay mesmerized on all fours, you are completely engrossed in her changes from your perch on the bed. Her gaze was quickly broken by the movement of her pencil skirt slipping down her still generous hips to pool around her thighs and knees. Looking back at the offending garment, Kathryn's eyes locked with yours as you both stood mere inches apart your position on the bed and her's on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her deep hazel eyes, Kathryn can't help but smile warmly at you. \"Unh...I suppose you're awfully happy about this.\" Kathryn laughs softly as she begins the task of picking herself up and walking to her phone. As she slowly pushes herself to an uneasy standing position, her skirt pools around her feet in the process. Noticing that her feet now resemble paws as well through the stockings, you hear an audible pop originate from her hips as she is thrust forward to the floor again into a position that is more quadrupedal than anything. Yelping with a mixture of surprise and pain, Kathryn fails to catch herself this time as her hands reach far in front of her and her breasts are pressed hard against the soft rug that graces her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hips driven high into the air, you see a small nub working its way from the small of her back. With each pulse Kathryn whimpers, the nub growing inch by inch as it covers itself in a dark fur that matches her hair.  It wasn't until the last nub of tail pushed free from her spine that her oversized black thong slipped down her hips to rest around her knees which were rearranging themselves as they came under her body. Beads of sweat building on her brow, Kathryn looked back to her hips to see a tail connected at the small of her back covered in a fur that matched her hair, gently waving in the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I have a tail! I need to hurry.\u201d Shaking, Kathryn pushed herself up to her forepaws to quickly discover that she could no longer stand. Determined not to be confined to a life on all fours, she willed herself forward. Her trailing clothes had other plans as the undergarments bunched around her feet and pantyhose. As she kicked her legs in frustration, you hop down from your perch to assist Ms. Truax by holding the end of the pantyhose one after the other with your claws. Kicking herself free of her once skin tight leggings she turns around, meeting you with a  puzzled expression. \u201cOh no, you\u2019re looking\u2026 really big\u2026 which means I...\u201d Breaking her gaze from you, she looks to her shrinking legs which themelves sport paws now. Making matters worse, her once athletic and toned legs have migrated almost entirely under her hips with the heels of her feet having long pushed themselves free of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely exposed from the waist down, your view from square behind Ms. Truax leaves you ecstatic. It won\u2019t be much longer! In fact, she\u2019s only around three, perhaps four times your size now. At most four feet tall you estimate, although it\u2019s hard to guess when you\u2019re only 9 inches yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathryn set herself to the task of using her new paws and legs as she clumsily traveled the few feet to the black leather briefcase. Pawing at the bag with some difficulty, she managed to free the phone the bag as it fell to the floor. \u201cWow, my phone is a total brick now\u2026\u201d Pawing at the home button of her phone, frustration turns to resignation as it's clear it's impossible to unlock the device with the tiny palms of her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's that, but maybe I...\" Before she could finish the sentence, Kathryn shuddered once more. Lowering her head and groaning in defeat as the final changes overtook her body, her raven hair parted to reveal two furry, pointed cat ears dominating the corners of her head. Cringing, a visible twitch could be seen in her face and jaw as both slowly pushed outward forming her feline muzzle. In the process, her once petite and slightly upturned nose took on a rough, pink appearance as her top lip split itself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... my... it's...\" Kathryn's words were becoming increasingly labored, coming out almost as a purr. The blouse now hung loosely, dominating her shrinking frame as fur slowly began to spread from her groin and chest. Her breasts were now slowly retreating into her chest as a row of small teats emerged through the spreading fur along her stomach. Her spine arched almost instinctively as Kathryn's sex migrated and her hair shrunk into her feline scalp, now little more residual fluff atop her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing hard, the transforming mother resigned herself to her fate as her body began to regress into the folds of her blouse with alarming speed. \"Oh no-no-no! Nicrole hwelp mreow. . . \" Her voice being reduced to nothing more than growls and meows. Slowly her body pulled itself into the blouse completely, hiding what had become of Kathryn from your view. All that was left now of Ms.Truax and the transformation that had taken place were scattered work clothes about the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, through the collar of the crumpled blouse emerged a dark brown house cat. The fur matching Ms. Truax's hair color, along with her soft hazel eyes. Sitting in her bedroom among her clothes, Kathryn was no longer recognizable from the six foot mother she had been moments ago. Amusingly, her pearl earrings were still fixated within her feline ears, the only vestige of her previous life to suggest that she had once been human.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gasp and look at the other parts of your body. You now have a tail coming out of your big, blubbery self. Your ears are now on top of your head, and to top it all off, you no longer have any hands or feet. Just paws. Suddenly you shudder and find that your face is turning into a muzzle and whiskers grow from it. Suddenly you feel something like a spider crawling up your back. But instead of a spider, which at this point you wouldn't mind, you find fire orange fur creeping up your back.

This was normally the time I woke up on school days, but today we were out on break. A shut the alarm off and rolled back over. I was so tired. I covered  my forehead with my arm as a I remembered the weird dream from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It started out like normal. I was walking home with my two best friends: Devin and Lauren. We had been best friends for as long as I can remember. We all live on the same block, go to the same school, and church. This particular night we had spent too much time at the local arcade GAME ON. We had a strict curfew and we were going to be late if we didn't hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia slow down.\" Lauren huffed out while bending over to rest her hands on her knees. \"It is no use. We will never make it home even if you continue running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. She was always the dramatic one. \"I'm not running. I am just speed walking.\" She was right however. There was no way I would make it home. I did not want to be grounded this weekend. Josh, my crush, had mentioned that he was going to the bowling alley this weekend. I was going to go as well and may just happen to bump into. I had been psyching myself up for this opportunity. I could not miss it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin nonchalantly stated, \"Yep I guess we shouldn't have played that last round of Combat!\" I glared at him. He was right of course, but he was the one who dared me to play. He egged me on so much, he knew I couldn't turn him down. If I didn't know any better I would think he did that on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I know but we can make it home on time if we take a shortcut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stood straight up and stared at me. \"You are not thinking about going through the forbidden forest.! No way absolutely not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Lauren on this. We are not supposed to go into that forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so we had been told all our lives to stay out of the \"forbidden forest\" no one would really tell us why, but our parents said if we ever went in they would scan our hide. There were horror stories of children going missing, or people going in and coming out different, but I'm sure it was all just a scare tactic. I mean what is the worst that could happen? Plus I was desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I\"m serious. I can not get grounded this weekend. Y'all know I have plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked at me apologetically. \"I know you think this weekend is your chance for Josh...but there will be other times I'm sure. I can't go into the forbidden forest.\" It did not surprise me that she didn't want to come in with me. But I was surprised by Devin's wordsl. \"Whatever, I'm not going into the woods. That is madness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked. Devin always had my back. Lauren was always dragging us from one adventure to another. I love the girl, but she could be a little flighty. I didn't surprise me when she agree that she wouldn't go. But my feeling were seriously hurt when Devin sided with her and not me. \"Fine I'll go myself.\" I took off running despite them both calling out my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowed as reached the path to go into the wood. There was a sign warning the public to stay out. I'll admit. I was a little daunted, but I lifted my chin and marched. As soon as I had walked a few feet I begin to feel chills down my spine. The air seemed to grow thick and my pulse rocketed. I knew that I was just anxious, but I could swear I felt eyes on me. There seemed to be a fog so thick, I was sure I could taste it on my tongue. I was determined however, to make it through. Doubly so now. I couldn't wait to rub it in Devin's face that I had made it through. I didn't slow down even though my body started to feel a little weird. I was kind of tingly and weighted down. I pushed through until I could finally see the vegetation begin to thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief as I stepped outside of the dark cover. Automatically I felt as if I could take a deep breath and the sensations began to recede. Ok I thought to myself I as quickly put more distance between myself and the woods, I will have to admit that was kind of freaky. I don't want to do that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran all the way home and I made it a few minutes before my curfew. Only in my dream I felt a rumbling sensation in my chest. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretched and shook off the creepiness of the dream and the events of the previous day. I got out of bed to pick up my phone. I had several messages from Devin and Lauren. Both were worried. I felt a little bad because after my journey I immediately came home and crashed. I was exhaust. I still felt more tired than usual though. I part of me want to ignore my friends requests to check in. If they were really worried, they should have came with me. I decided to.....</span></div></div>",

With an agravated growl, he blinked open his eyes, suprisingly alert and on nerve. His ears cocked towards the sound, and flatened in a sudden wave of fear and confusion. His ears can't move....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a yowl of terror as he lept out of bed, his fur on end. What was happening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung around the room on four legs, his eyes wide and alert. He almost backed up into the wall as new shock coursed through his trembling body, more terrible than ever. Across the room, Catalin could see a white spotted leapard staring at him through his mirror with yellow eyes glazed in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalin screeched, and the strange sound echoed through the room and left an odd trembling feeling in the back of his throat. His tail fluffed up and lashed back and forth, and when Catalin spotted it in the corner of his now heightened sight, he jumped again, this time bumping into his guitar case and having it tumbled down and strike his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct kicked in, and before he knew what was happening he had rounded on the thing and with powerful paws he batted it and dug his claws into its leather. He gripped it for a fleeting second, his frightened and aggressive cry ringing through his room, then pushed it away with a powerful kick of his hind legs, leaping through the air towards the opened bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out of it in a quick second and running down the stairs at full speed, his tail straight and streaming behind him. Catalin was terrified -- terrified beyond belief. His entire world had changed, and he didn't understand a thing. Fear and confusion was all he felt, with only an animal instinct to guide him. He knew he still had his human intelligance, and knew that if he just stopped and tried to think maybe he would make better sense of what was happening, but he didn't. His instinct to survive wouldn't allow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a loud scream as he shot through the kitchen. He didn't look to see who it was, but could tell it was his mother. No. He had no mother now. How could he? He was a leopard and she was a human, and there was no way at making her realize the animal was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalin ran to the front door but it was closed. He panicked, and bolted for the back. Closed too. His mother was shouting and now was calling for his father. The leopard still ran in vain, trying to find an escape. He needed to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalin shot towards the front door again, but turned as he reached it, not loosing speed, and leapt up on the couch. Without a moment's thought he crashed through the window. It shattered around him and he landed in the garden below, the glass digging painfully into his pads and fur. He didn't stop though, and he bolted across the lawn and into the waiting forest.</span></div></div>",

I shall enunciate the question and suppose the average as common answers, and all you need do is to nod or sway your head whether to agree, or disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trust your waking and discovering you are now a bull animal was a bit upsetting. You need not think too hard on this question, the obvious answer would be in the affirmative. Understand this though, as you were a traveler though this countryside, and did dare to trespass on my property. You trespassed and slept in my barn, taking from the food box what you needed then for to eat, as found by chance my special brewed potion and made use of it as your drink with your diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad you did not just fill a cup with water from the yard pump, as drinking the potion virtually decides your fate and future, you being now a bull, soon the herd sire, and according to biblical promise, you might live here for the coming three score and ten years, that being seventy years being a young bull, doing what a bull does and feels an urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifestyle of being a bull is not all bad. Indeed, you might learn to like your duties here, as well the friends you shall get to know, they being other like you who for whatever the reason became as useful animals here on my farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust last week did Terrell or Terry as he is known by name to the hired men working here on the farm. Terry, had a foul mouth, cursing, swearing, calling upon hirer powers to curse others, and for his vile mouth I decided he should be then as is a Judas goat. A Judas goat is the damning beast what leads the sheep or his own kind into the truck taking them to the auction and then slaughter. He walks into the truck and leads his mates inside, as he walks out to freedom, they need remain and stay, go to their beastly death, becoming meat in a factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have goats, sheep, pigs, all once who walked uprightly, now stride about on all fours, wearing hoofs and having tails to remind them they are but beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tail shows you are feeling somewhat nervous, and why not, the immodest manner you must live here being as, and everyday your body fur is the only clothing protecting you from the elements. Bovine fur is quite thick as is your black hide, the potion your drank grants you added comfort from dense fur and a sense of delight from that brute bullish desires... ha, that tickles your mind does it not, you need learn what to do and then just to enjoy being a bull!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave a good first day here on the farm.    </span></div></div>",

Fences were to a human as lines drawn to climb and cross, struggling ever to gain more and attain more things, but being a bull there is no such owning only the reality of being owned as hemmed in by sharp barbed wire fences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating as do humans is experiencing the flavor and texture of different food, but grazing, as from that first mouthful of greenish mash, the flavor is dull, as is the endeavoring of a want to get more and more, and more, becomes a repetitive monotony.  Not just green grasses, but the bovine mentality what prevails when grazing takes all comer's as anything and everything that grows from out the ground is a part of the daily meals. What this does inside that massive gut with four stomachs is a constant growling feeling.

Thoughts as to \"All a born equal,\" does not carry through to being animals, and this human ideal is wasted here where bulk and brutality rains supreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around as see there a nervous herd of cow, heifers, and calves all watching, alert as to the movement of he the herd bull, they knowing better his scent than what he being new at the business of kingship, was looking for the hear-herd cow to do the leading of the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman ideas are lost within a herd, as being the bull comes with new virtual and virile dominating characteristics seeming granted since they did not come from an inbreeding. Names too are meaningless, as being an animal and so much a bull, the mentality imposes scents of other animals in place of names. Scents, smells, odors, and the general stench what follows along behind the herd as they graze of stand huddled in a snug group, nervous of all around their otherwise safe corral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh then there is the corral, a place where is the herd and they being stone dull ignorant of anything a human knows, does anything and wherever they be standing, as soiling fellows, family, of even the kingly bull with a dousing of vile stink. All the taught reasons for personal hygiene are as a waste of thought here being one with the herd. Mature enough to remember what was proper and or expected hygienic practice, the loss of hands and their dexterity coupled with the lack of toilet paper, shows good reasons why from creation that animals, bovine especially are gifted their having a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail serves the bovine form in varied ways, the more common idea what people think of it is to sway at flies. Be it then known that from becoming bovine and a bull, the tail might disturb the flies from landing, but to strike at and kill them is with a bony tail the wildest stroke of luck. Of it essence the tail works to offer a covering to otherwise tender portions and places of the body, what hot sunshine might toast, or winter chill might frost and freeze. The tail is as much a warning stick to the young and ignorant calves not realizing yet the difference between a cow and bull. As well the tail does something a real bull tends to ignore, as does a human born and transformed to being a bull of form finds as a nasty problem. Remembering the lack of hands, the dexterity, and no T.P. the tail swatting tends to smear what stayed stuck, wiping the remnants across the furred flanks and from this action causing the draw for more flies to come and find their delight of a good meal.   </span></div></div>",

Slavery was abolished for human kind, but not so for they who are born to being animals, and worse for those transformed into becoming animals. Odd that with becoming an animal the passions and sensuality of it were the first to consider and delight of the concern. It is different the longer a span of time that one is as is an animal that the true status of self is realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus not of being the bull to his herd, but governed quite by the plans and urging from he the farm owner, as is the owner of what is his property, of which the herds and the bull are as property, owned! The temporary retained still knowledge of what was and knowing of what is of the present tends to be a bother. Bothering most is the daily determining of where he the bull shall stay or go, as what is of an animal's wish is not the concern of the owner. In essence being an animal is a lot about acting as did a slave, even to when they as we the herd members are planned to breed as did the Bible say, \"To multiply, replenish the earth!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen human there is a meeting, communicating, as then choice to engage and marry, but not here upon the farm. As of us in the herd our wishes go ignored, if we as cattle had any such a civilized inkling. Instead, the Agriculture Agent decides from past experiences and testing as to who shall or shall not be allowed to mingle among the herd of cows. The reasoning for this new bull being here began to take shape after the previous, as elder bull died suddenly. His death left a space unaccounted for withing then herd rational, as the herd could not grow or replenish without a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength and vitality are portions of what it is to be a bovine bull. These are requirements for living of a lifestyle mostly out in the open air, in any weather, without a roof overhead or the delight of remembered air conditioning. As by the heat of the day or the cool of the night, the natural instinctive urges and drives causes nature to continue a species. Bodily beauty has absolutely nothing to do with what nature intends. Instinct and what one might call as out-stink begins a relationship that culminates from a strong bull owing to healthy vitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough said on the previous subject, as the idea of what is or is not comes from the farm owner and in no way is the wishes of the cattle a consideration by us or of us, if we could or would? </span></div></div>",

The Legion did encircle your room, each devil having his special ability, they waited until sleep took away your better senses, and allowed them to enter your mind though that personal devil, your \"ID.\" The ID is in all people, its that dark to black hole of evil what try to defame a person though vial acts and disgraceful manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine the uproarious laughter those devils fell over each the other when one of their Legion entered your ID and mind, causing a dream, your wild ambition to make the sheet and blanket covering you to gain a tented angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point, no pun intended, that the Legion knew they had a hot prospect.

They entered your head and literally copied what was the essence of your intelligence, your learned facts and figures, your history of family, everything that was you in your mental capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, everything that you learned or knew how to do was transferred, merged into the brain of Bart, my 4-H project pet Black Angus Bull. You were a gifting to Bart of some added and increased intelligence. You were gifted to me as a willing witch, wanting to accept people like you as friends in animal forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said, there is no worry about you needing to think about your parents, as come the morning after what was your human body had slipped into a comatose state. If I were you and wondering about if ever you could leave from being a bull and regain your human body, well forget it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are as you wished to become, you are a animal, a bovine, and the complete essence of a domineering, dominant herd bull. Your only reason for being alive is to work at keeping either milk flowing or calves coming to replace those who we sell and go the way that cows and cattle do that get sold. If you remain vigilant to your duties as a herd bull, then you might well live here at the farm for the next twenty years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink on that as your real worth, of what will keep you alive and not sent, sold, and need follow others in a line where only death and disfiguring is a sad future. I can understand you think my attitude is harsh, but try now to understand this, you are an animal, you are property, you have no constitutional rights under the laws, and you are a beast, a bull, with one main purpose for living a life.\" Shanna said, explaining much, calming some wonderments, and adding some horrors to an otherwise bland existence.</span></div></div>",

As you inspect your surroundings, you spot only a single door to your left, which opens as a man wearing a white gown enters the room. He must've been a scientist, as he brought a clipboard along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, it seems that you're awake now. I was wondering if the tranquilizer darts were too much and put you in a coma.

During your time of walking you felt your tail swinging, swishing, the coarse hairs making a rustling sound as they stroke across your then larger as hair-fur covered skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe senses are more alive, especially hearing and the ability to smell what when human you could not sense or just ignored. As the nose works to be a guide toward what then interests you mind, the ability to hear well, acts more as a warning system to alert you of sounds that might be a danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat or who passed through your housing plat during the night and caused this miraculous change to the real you, might well have done the same to others, as they and you might well become a herd.

Upon first seeing Barry as he had changed, he looked sleek and well formed,. He was a red roan color of body hair and mane as well his tail. He looked very healthy then, his plump body fat the transforming had used to make his body work harder and he became a strong, hefty muscular horse, some sort of draft animal as you have seen in movies hauling heavy wagons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whinnied a greetings to Barry who quickly raised his head and stood munching did stare at you.

He munching tried to whinny his friendly greeting ans prancing happily he comes to greet and want to sniff your new body scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs during the delightful minutes after first meeting Barry, the two of you snuffle, whinny, as make common horse greeting sounds. It is Barry who for some reason begins acting as if more than excited by the meeting a good friend changed into what he too became, and need then learn to change his plans for living his lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the two of you leave where he had lived for many years, as you turn to give a worried concerned look back, wondering when his mother would get out of bed and discover her son as gone, as likely he would never return again home. As you wonder too about then your family. As of dad and mom, your brother too, you know that being what you became you have no place as part of your family and must find a herd to join, making them as if a family.</span></div></div>",

Is there anything odd about dreaming yourself as an orangutan? Or that you were trapped in the zoo? Or how about being a human mine trapped in a prison of unintelligence? All three of those dreams combined with surrealist reality can create one heck of a nightmare. That nightmare was what I was experiencing, big time. I was tossing, turning, as images of kids laughing at me and zoo keepers treating me like a Neanderthal tormented me. In the dream, I reached a hairy ape arm up to the sky in an attempt to grasp back a reality that was taken from me. All to soon, I wake up with a heavy breath. There was something about that dream that was... foreboding. I walked over to the bathroom, each barefoot step across the carpet feeling like a step toward oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I reached the bathroom and looked in the mirror. What I saw instantly woke me up, it was very disturbing. My nose had melted into my face, only two nostrils now showing almost like a... Ape. I knew that wasn't a good thing, at all and what I saw next made it even worse. Looking down at my stomach, it appeared as though it was double it's own size. I was at least 50 pounds heavier than I was last night. If that wasn't bad enough my arms were nearly twice as long. I was becoming an ape, and it wasn't going to be a happy ending if I didn't figure out a way to turn back immediately. Before I figure it out I want to test some things. I open my mouth wide and clearly say \"Testing.\" I was taken aback by how different my voice. Gruff, guttural, and not fitting a 16 year old boy at all. Suddenly, as if to complete that notion, my face began to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Look in the mirror, my face became wrinkly and covered with a tad bit of mangy fur forming an ugly hair style. I could easily pass as a middle aged man rather than a teenaged boy. The transformation halted however, stopping after giving me ugly orange sideburns. I knew I had to figure this transformation out before the changes returned. I ran to a cabinet of old clothes my father used to wear, tossing on his old Dukes of Hazzard t-shirt, over my fat gut. I tossed on a ball cap that barely covered my ugly coif of red hair. I had to figure out to change back, and I had to do it now. Pulling on a pair of jeans that belonged to my dad, I quickly button it and prepare to make a mad dash. The pants fit scarily well, and at that point I looked more like a red-neck than a red-ape. Pulling a belt with a silver skull located at it's centre, I quickly toss on a pair of shoes that barely fit before running out the door. I had to figure out how to stop this transformation and reverse the changes. I decided to... </span></div></div>",

My picture ID didn't match my new persona at all and neither did my health card. No driving, no free health care and trapped in the body of a forty year old looking ape-man. I must've been the most sorry looking Canadian on the face of the planet. I decided I would have to take the bus. I decided to do a once-over of my form to make sure I didn't draw attention to myself. Luckily my arms weren't as long as I had thought moments ago. I guess the feeling of self threw me off, but there length seemed to reach slightly passed my knees. I had seen people with longer more freakish arms before, so it wasn't a big deal. However, the transformation seemed to know this and decided to make my life worse. Suddenly my back ached slightly and I found myself slouching. On top of that, my hands grew larger and thicker. \"Stop! *Grunt* Stop!\" I said to myself, my voice becoming more guttural and adding the animal noises of an orangutan to it's repertoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The transformation ceased and I realized I was looking more like a forty year old man, and soon I would become devolve further. I ran out the front door, with a handful of change. I knew I had to return myself to normal, no matter the cost. The bus came in five minutes, which was surprising as the busses never arrived on time in the city. I hopped aboard the bus as soon as those door opened. My shoes clinked across the steel floor of the bus as people took no notice of the backwards evolution cycle crossing their path. I sat beside someone on the bus, who was some blonde woman. She looked to be about twenty-eight, and she was smiling at me. \"Hey.\" She said proudly, \"Are you new to taking the bus?\" I looked at her trying my best not to give a suspicious answer, and say \"Yeah, I guess you could say that.\" She continued to smile and eventually looked out the window. \"What a ditz.\" I thought to myself. I didn't care about her though, I had bigger thoughts on mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I decided that I needed to see the vet, someone who knew things about animals. Even if I couldn't halt the transformation, I could at least make it so I don't get tranquilized and dragged away in the middle of the street like a freak. I could have the vet transfer me to the zoo respectfully. I was surprised I was still thinking about dignity, considering I looked like half of the red-neck jamboree all mixed into one. I decided that there was only one vet in the entire city who help me. Gina Collins. She was the most kind and caring person I ever met, and both her and I respected each other deeply. Since I was ten I would bring my dog into that freckle-faced goddess of an intern and she would fix the problem right up. She was the last person I wanted to see me turn into an ape, but I had no other choice. I was approaching my destination and pulled the stop rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I heaved my fat gut up, and hopped off my seat. Walking with my goofy slouch I quickly hopped off the bus and continued walking. If I didn't get to Gina right away, I would be eating bananas for life. I walked two whole blocks until finally getting there. I noticed I was out of breath, panting heavily. It was probably due to my new physique more then anything else. If I became a full ape, that wouldn't be much of a problem because it's their natural fat. However, if I became a full ape there would be a lot of new problems I stood outside the building looking at the place, hoping it wouldn't be the last time. I wouldn't want to be carted away to the zoo by animal control before I could spend my last moments of humanity with Gina. That is, however if I can't get a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What happens next?</span></div></div>",

This would prove to be difficult, but I knew I had to tough it out if I didn't want to spend each day mating in the corner of a cage. I walked up to the front desk, and luckily Gina was on duty. \"Hello, how may I help you, sir?\" She asks, which makes me feel slightly embarrassed. I'm only sixteen, or at least I was, and now I'm really referred to as \"Sir.\" I clear my throat and say \"Yes *Grunt* I have a bit of a... problem.\" I say sheepishly, with ape like grunts inserted randomly into my speech. \"What is it, sir? You don't seem to have an animal on you.\" She states directly at me, which makes me sweat a bit. Fortunately my transformation kicks in, and I feel it take route in my head. Quickly I threw off my hat, to show Gina the full extent of the transformation taking place on my head. The skeletal structure of my skull began to alter, as Gina stood awe-struck with her mouth open. My head shifted and change until it looked fully like an ape's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god!\" Exclaimed Gina, \"What happened to you!?

She leads me to the back room, and tells me to sit down in a chair as she checks her computer. \"I'll see if this has happened to other people, maybe I can find a cure. She looks through her computer in the backroom for what feels like twenty minutes. Ironically, I read through a magazine on ape biology and numerous simian facts. I was also creeped out by the fact that I found a female Orangutan printed in the magazine somewhat attractive. Eventually Gina comes back in the room and states...</span></div></div>",

What if you can't find a cure at all?\" She looks at me and flat-out yells \"Look, there's no cure at this time! If I could cure you, I would! I would have to run various ape DNAs and human DNAs, plus I would be to get back into gene research which I haven't done in four years! Trying to treat you now, could radically alter your entire DNA structure to the point of being irreparable! You have two choices: You become an ape now, and I'll have someone take you to a zoo. Or, you could spend the next few days transforming while everybody wonders why a giant man-ape is wandering around the back of my store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I try to calm myself down and breath in deeply, with garbled excited grunts in between each breath. \"So, I have no other options then? I guess it would take a while to find the cure. I also don't feel well about just giving up, either.\" She looks at me with a rather serious looking expression, \"Either option you can choose. Though, I would suggest letting me viral you out.\" She continues to stare me down, \"However, whatever choice makes you feel more comfortable. Please believe when I say I'm on your side, I'm the only person that can help you right now.\" I look at her, and then down at my fat gut. I knew I had to make one choice or the other and I think about how painful it would be if I were just sitting around waiting for each change to happen. \"Ok I made up my mind, I want to...\"</span></div></div>",

She takes out a different needle, with a green liquid inside. \"This will temporarily weaken your immune system. This room has been sterilized and thoroughly cleaned, so there should be no chance of catching a serious disease. On top of that, apes have different immune systems than humans. Even if you caught something, your new biology would negate it.\" I take a large gulp and say, \"Is there anything I should do to ready myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah take off your clothes.\" She says bluntly, \"I don't think it would be easy to explain shredded pieces of human clothing in my garbage can.\" I let out a half-hearted laugh, that was just short of breaking into tears. This was the last time I'd get to laugh, possibly the last moment of human happiness I would ever have. She knew this and made the process quick. As soon as I threw off my clothes she readied the needle. When she turned to me, she was crying. She was weeping for the sixteen year old boy. who was about to become a dumb ape. At first she was so saddened, that she kept pulling the needle away before injecting me. Eventually she worked up the nerve and plunged it into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The ape part of your DNA *Sob*, should take control very soon. I can't watch this, so I'll be back when your transformation is complete.\" She said, while turning away and walking out of the room. She closed the door quickly, as I sat there for the new few minutes waiting for it to kick in. Immediately, I feel a strange sensation of my body growing hairs out of every pore. Red strands of fur erupted from every part of my legs, as the strange, thick hair began to engulf me. More and more these hairs began to take route, blanketing my body. My arms and legs were now covered in the orange-reddish fur. The fur became shaggy, long and thick, hanging off my skin like hippy-hair. My skin began to alter as well, turning a strange shade of blue. Becoming rougher, and feeling much more different than I was used to. My skin changing felt like someone was rubbing sand-paper against my body' skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of my skeleton, the next thing to change was my body structure. I could feel the bones in my arms, elongating even further. It felt as though someone had grabbed my palms and was pulling my arms off. My arms grew longer, until those bones stopped elongating. The transformation temporarily halted and looked at my shaggy, hairy and long arms. I flexed my new arms, they felt so very strange and alien to me. Before I could experiment further, my toes began to be pulled apart by the transformation. I flinched and cringed, as my toes were taken and reformed into strange finger like appendages. Like a foot massage from the underworld, my feet were being mangled into hands. My heel became a palm, as my toes shrunk along with the bones making it up. My spine made cracking sounds, and I found it forcing my posture into a four legged stature. I struggled to continue to stand, yet the hand of god kept pushing me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I flexed the new muscles in my hands for a few moments, until the transformation continued in my head. Rough strange pad like formations began forming on my face. My face gained flat strange pads on it's cheeks, as the hair on my eyebrows faded away. My brows merged into a uni-brow, as my large fat cheeks finished forming. The next change occurred to my vocal cords. I felt like someone was jamming on them, like a guitar player rocking out during a solo. Strange sacks began to form inside my throat and I could feel them already taking over the way I speak. \"Oh g--- *Grunt* Ple-please d-don't do *Screech* this!\" I shouted as my speech was taken over by my new ape-like grunts and screeches. I continued to try to talk, but everything sounded garbled. Eventually, my voice got caught in my throat, only to be followed by bellowing grunts and screeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally my body began to gain an insane amount of excess body wait, as my size increased somewhat. I became fatter and larger, gaining the size and stature of a true ape. I continued to grunt and screech as the transformation completed. The pains caused by my new change in form, was way too much for me, and I passed out. I belly flopped my fat gut onto the floor and twitched a little, before passing out with a large amount of spit falling from my new ape-like muzzle. I was now nothing but a Neanderthal ape, a zoo attraction. My life was over, and now a strange, new and more insulting life was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What happened next?</span></div></div>",

However, I'll unfasten the straps if you can prove you still have your mind. Grunt three times, pause briefly and grunt again.\" She said, flat out in a serious tone. I could her the shakiness in her voice, she was nervous. I did as asked, grunting in the way she specified. \"I guess that's *Sob* one good thing...\" She said, as she turned around, I saw her fastening a white glove onto her hand. \"However, I'm still going to have to keep the harnesses on you. This will make you flinch a lot, I have to make sure your unmentionables are in healthy condition. It's good thing I used to be a zoo vet.\" She did unspeakable things with that white rubber glove.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are a boy around the age of 12. Your name is Mart, which is short for Marty. And you've always had an interest in kangaroos ever since you were old enough to know what they are. An old friend of your mother's owns a nature reserve which specializes in taking care of wild animals, including kangaroos themselves. Some of them tend to keep to themselves, whereas others are rather curious and often like to come up to people visiting, giving out cute looks in a hope for food. You love going to this nature reserve and spending time feeding the kangaroos by hand. You often bring a few nice treats for them to try out, so it's no wonder that these animals have taken a liking to you whenever you're around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then one day, while you were feeding one of the baby joeys, you suddenly noticed a big female kangaroo quite close to you, having hopped up so quietly that you didn't even hear her coming. But the moment you looked up, the roo bent its head down and pushed its muzzle against your lips. Like a kiss. You were so startled that you fell back in surprise and the kangaroos immediately hopped away. That was a strange thing for an animal like that to do. You couldn't get over why it would do that, but you just dismiss it and go on with the day like nothing has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during the end of the day, when you prepare to leave the reserve, you notice the kangaroo that kissed you is at the fence and gazing at you like it wants to be with you so much. You begin to feel uneasy, as something about that roo is making you think something is wrong. Could there be a reason why it kissed you, or is it just a strange reaction to the way you've been treating these animals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't figure out what it is...until later that night, it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're lying in your bed you begin to feel very strange. Your knees are beginning to feel stiff. And your hips feel a bit rounder than usual. Then suddenly, you notice two lumps growing under your duvet on the bed. You try to reach to pull it off, but your arms feel strange too; it feels like they're shrinking! Looking down, you gasp as you realize <i>they are shrinking</i>! And your fingers are melding together to become a strange set of black, curved claws. Then you notice a layer of fur growing out of the base of your hands and spreading down the length of your shrinking arms. You finally manage to take hold of the duvet and yank it off the bed. You discover to your shock that the lumps growing in your bed are actually your feet, expanding in size! They are now growing to three times their original size, with another set of black claws where your toes used to be. Then you feel your ears moving and your nose and mouth stretching. You jump out of bed, and fall flat on your face as you suddenly lose balance with your big feet. As you struggle to pull yourself up, you feel something stretching out of your butt. Then there is a ripping sound, and your pajama pants are suddenly ripped off your legs. You manage to get up and stumble across to your bedside mirror. You look through it and gasp as you see that your ears are now looming over your head, and have become huge and floppy. Your mouth and nose have expanded about a few inches from your face and begin to look more like a muzzle. The layer of fur has now covered your entire body, and your knees have become stiff, forcing you to balance unnaturally on your strange, grown feet. You turn around slowly and see that a tail has grown out as well. What remains of your pajama pants are hanging from the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, the strange feeling completely stops, and you are left there staring in instant shock at yourself in the mirror. You are completely speechless at first, then after a moment, you finally say silently to yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm......I'm......a kangaroo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to bend your knees, and you find your body bouncing unsteadily on your feet. You almost fall back, but you feel your tail pressed against the floor, holding you up. You blink a couple of times, expecting this to be some sort of dream. But when your new body refuses to disappear, you become convinced that this has really happened to you! And the first thing that enters your mind is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>!!!WOW!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have turned into a real, live, young kangaroo! You're not sure how it happened, but you begin to think that your change must be connected with the nature reserve somehow. Perhaps you should get over there and find out what happened. But you've never gone out during the night. Perhaps it might be better to stay at the house until sunrise, and try to find out what happened then. But what would your family think if they saw you like this? It's a tricky decision...</span></div></div>",

So, you move carefully through the house, which is not easy since your new legs are making it hard to walk. Then you reach the front door and carefully open it with your strange new hands. Then, after closing the door behind you, you practice bouncing on your legs to get used to your new form. When you get the hang of it, you start to hop in the direction of the nature preserve. You're surprised at how fast you can go by hopping. You feel like you're going faster than a bicycle. This is incredible; you're actually starting to enjoy yourself. Perhaps being a kangaroo isn't so bad after all, if only you knew what made you turn into one in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about 20 minutes of hopping, you make it to the nature preserve. You're overwhelmed by your speed as you realize this has taken about a third of the time it takes to ride your bike over here. You hop up to the fence surrounding the perimeter, and then by pumping your legs, you manage to spring even higher with each bounce you make. After a few bounces, you quickly move forward and bounce straight over the fence. You barely make it over the barbed wire with inches to spare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you feel the familiar feel of grass under your feet. You gently bend down and sniff at it. It smells even sweeter than you remember it when you were human. You open your mouth and take a bite. To your surprise, it tastes quite nice. It seems that your new form has given you proper instincts and tastebuds as well. You start to graze calmly at the grass, letting instinct take you over as you blend in with nature. You feel at peace here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your big ears prick up at the sound of something nearby. You look up immediately. Something is coming towards you. You can't quite see what it is, as it's still quite dark to see, but you can make out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turn back and look over at the kangaroo that is approaching you. It seems very happy to see you. You watch as it stops right in front of you, obviously being a full-grown kangaroo it's almost twice as big as you are. Then as you look at the roo through the darkness, you suddenly recognize her as the same kangaroo that \"<i>kissed</i>\" you when you were here last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo bends down and sniffs you tenderly. Then she cocks her head to one side, and suddenly...she says, \"Hello, Mart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you realize that you just heard the kangaroo speak. \"You - you can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can,\" the kangaroo speaks again. \"Since you're now a kangaroo yourself, you're now able to understand our kind. How are you coping with your new body? Isn't it incredible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" you admit. \"It is rather cool. But - but how did I get like this to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo chuckles kindly. \"Because I chose you,\" she says. \"I have always admired your kind, Mart. It's true they say some humans are cruel and unkind in this world, but then there are also some humans who want to make the world a better place. Like you, Mart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her in a strange way. \"You chose for me to become a kangaroo? But why - why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we want for a better future,\" the kangaroo tells you. \"We want to be able to understand humans better and make it easier for them to understand us better. We kangaroos want to make this world a better place as well, but to do that we need to understand their needs in life - \" she pauses for a moment before finishing, \" - and to make them understand our needs in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you say as you see some sense in those words. \"But...what does this have to do in making me into a kangaroo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo gently strokes you on the head. \"Because I want to help you to understand, Mart. You have always shown kindness to animals here in the preserve - even us kangaroos. We are your friends. That's why I chose you. I want to teach you about what it's like to be one of us - and at the same time, I can have a real joey to take care of - my own child - of course, if that's alright with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment as you look at yourself. Since you have become a young kangaroo, and the animals here look up to you as a friend, it might be worth trying to learn what it's like to be one of them. Perhaps it will turn out to become another step closer into making the world a better place. Since you don't know how to turn back, you decide it might as well be worth a try.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you agree. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo jumps up and down, clapping her hands in happiness, then she wraps you in a loving hug. Her embrace makes you feel attached to her; it seems to be a natural instinct for your new form. Then the kangaroo gently picks you up and places you gently in her warm pouch. Until now, you didn't realize that it's cold outside. You feel so warm and cosy in the pouch that you don't feel like getting out anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" the kangaroo says. \"My name is Cari. But you can call me Mommy if you want to. This is your home now. You are welcome here.\" She bends down and gently licks you on your cheek. You blush. \"Okay, Mommy,\" you say, and snuggle deep within her pouch, closing your eyes to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you nod off, you bring it within yourself to ask, \"How did I become a kangaroo anyway?\" You hear Cari chuckle. \"Well, let's just say I gave you a little kiss to make you change.\" Then you drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">The next morning...</span></span></div></div>",

Your sense of perspective is totally skewed, being so low to the ground. You see yourself in a mirror.<br>\r\n   Holy crap, I'm a badger! No, this can't be real.<br>\r\n  You look again and see your reflection. You walk up to it and touch the glass with your paw. It's you. You gotta get out of here.<br>\r\n Finally you find the door, which is cracked open. You squeeze your body through and you see the upstairs of your house from that same low perspective. It's a bit disorienting, but, the odor you smell (more intensely than you ever have before) isn't . Breakfast is cooking downstairs. <br>\r\n  Wait, I can't go downstairs like this. My parents will freak. If I stay up here, they'll look for me. I could try to sneak out, but then what?</span></div></div>",

Todd!,  are you up??\"<br>\r\n  No reply.  She starts up the stairs, yelling again. You realize you have no choice. You have to leave now, before your Mom finds you missing.

It was of strange shadows and felt as if your bones had been twisting and scrunching up. And everything was wrong but right at the same time. You opened your eyes, only to be greeted by a mass of material in front of you. You try to push it away with your hands but it't too heavy and your hands don't seem to be working properly. You groan but it comes out in a whistle. You smile at this but your lips don't seem to move so your eyes are doing the smiling for them, sparkling. <br>\r\nYou're fed up of just lay in bed feeling strange. You have to do something about it, get up and get out! You crawl out of your covers, thinking how similar it would be to your every day morning, only you're not forced to do it like this morning. You get to the edge of your bed (it seems further away then normal) and jump back in surprise. Had there been some prank in the middle of the night?! You wouldn't put it past your two twin younger brothers. They were only a year younger, both sixteen, but they had the mischief of twelve year olds. The edge was miles from the floor. You look around. This is one extravagant prank, you think to yourself. Around you you can see you normal furniture: your dressing table, cluttered with odd moisturizers, scattered make-up you hardly ever wore, clips and hairbands littering across the top and hanging on the handles of the drawers, big wardrobe belittling the chest of drawers next to it, your posters of your favourite bands and desk with scattered papers on top (you weren't the neatest person in the household). The only difference to it all was that it was all enlarged. How the hell did Jake and Todd do this? It was imperssive, you must say. You were expecting them to crash through the door laughing and singing at the top of their lungs \"We got you, Evie! You should see your face!\" they never could stay away for long and let the prank get it's full impact. They had to show <i>they'd</i> done it and take the credit.<br>\r\nYou waited. No one was bursting through the door. You couldn't hear any muffled giggling or anything. You frown. What was going on? You look down at the floor, it didn't look that far a distance... So you jump down. In the air, falling fast you panic. You flap your arms instinctively and shoot upwards. Your mind boggles. This isn't right! You should be going down, not up. That was the basic bloody law of gravity! And yet you were nearly to the ceiling now, flying. You can see everything from above. Maddly you are spurred at how much dust is on top of your wardrobe. What the hell was going on?! This was't right! Not right at all. Out of your mouth, involuntary, came chirps and whistles like a panicked bird. Wait a minute, you think, I'm a bird?!<br>\r\nYou flutter down to your dressing table mirror, surprised at how naturally flying came to you. You look in the mirror. Brown feathers, all shades in a messy striped pattern like the bark on trees, your underbelly a light grey-beige and pink feet and beady black eyes. An in the middle of your face a yellow-brown beak. You looked at yourself, head moving side to side, skipping about the mirror. How did this happen? It explained a lot of things from when you woke up, but now their were floods more questions. You hear other birds outside and look to the window.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, to get the the attic door in my room. I hope I can get it open.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on a board and jump along it until you reach the door. You look down at it and realize just how big it is compared to you now. There was no way you were going to lift that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, there goes that plan. Damn, there has to be another way in.</i> As your thoughts race, a gust of cold air shoots from a hole in nearby. <i>Wait, cold air in the middle of summer? That means that that vent must be the air conditioning system. Maybe I can get to my room through that.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump towards the vent and look at it. Unlike older houses, your house had these plate vents that went right over the hole, which meant they could be removed. With the little bit of strength you had, you prayed the vent open. You could feel the air rushing toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, time to take a leap of faith then.</i> You jump into it and start decending down the small shaft. In the dim shaft, you see a glimmer of light shining through. <i>That must be the vent</i> you think to yourself. You spread your wings, which only just fit in the vent, allowing you to hover in front of the vent. You look through  and sure enough it\u2019s your room, completely untouched. <i>Ok, guess I\u2019ll have to ram it. 3, 2, 1...</i> With all of your strength, you bang against the metal grate, but it did not pop out. Dust begins flying all around you, blinding you. Frantically, you flapped your wings and twirled through the air, hitting the vent again. This time, you break through into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of your daze you stand back up and use your wings to push the dust from your eyes. <i>Ugh, now I know why mom asked me to dust the vents in here. Too late now I guess. Now, I need to get my hair tie. If they see me with it around my neck maybe they will recognize me.</i> You fly up to your dresser and find you red hair tie. When you were human, you always wore it no matter where you went. You push your head at it and get it around, almost like a necklace. You look at the mirror to inspect yourself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a bird. How is this going to work though? The second mom sees me she\u2019s going to freak out. Maybe dad might be my only option. He does like birds, do maybe he might recognize me.</i> Your thoughts go on for a minute or so, and then, reluctantly, you hop off the dresser and start to fly to your door. Luckily, your mom had left it open. Downstairs, you could hear everyone eating breakfast, completely unaware you were missing. That was about to change, however, as you flew downstairs and towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwooping down from the ceiling, you landed right in front of your dad. You begin calling up to him, chirps and cheeps coming from your beak. Everyone looks at you, your mother horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, the birds back! Charlie, get it! Get it!\u201d Your mother almost fell out of her chair out of complete shock. Your brothers looked at you intriguingly. You just stood there, looking at your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down honey, it\u2019s only a bird. It is chirping weirdly though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out to your dad \u201cDad, it\u2019s me, Jessica. Please, recognize me,\u201d but only chirps came from your beak. He cupped his hands around you and examined you curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, never seen a bird act like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care! Get rid of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad continued to look. You turned your beak slightly and nuzzled his hand, your red band showing under the feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you have here? Something stuck around your neck?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently pintched your head with two fingers and pulled your hair tie off of your neck. He looked at it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, isn\u2019t this Jessica\u2019s hair tie?\u201d You jumped up and down, estaticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said get rid of that bird Charlie! Their nothing but trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get nervous, your mothers words ringing trough you ears. Then, another idea came to mind. You looked up to your dad and over to the fridge. You then hopped up and flew over to a photo of you, pecking at it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAHHHH!!! It\u2019s flying! Catch it!\u201d Charlie, however, followed you to the fridge, looking at what your were pecking at. You looked at him, his eyes full of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, why is it pecking at Jessica\u2019s photo? Something is up. Honey, where\u2019s Jessica?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you need to get rid of that bird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, calm down. Jessica! Jessica! Come out here please!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked around, but of course you didn\u2019t come. He called for you again, but again you didn\u2019t come. Then, your father looked at you. He opened his hands flat. You landed on them and looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica...is that you?\u201d He asked. You tried to nod your head, but instead your whole body went up and down. In shock, your father almost opened his hands, but stopped. He looked at you again. \u201cDid you just...nod at me.\u201d You \u201cnodded\u201d again. \u201cHoney, Jessica\u2019s...right here...in my hands.\u201d Your mother looked at him, complete frustration on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly Charlie!! That thing is just a bird! Our daughter could not possibly be it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, listen to me it is. Jessica, go over to your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to your father. You jumped from his hands and flew over, perching on the table near her. She looked down at you, confusion filling her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut but but...it\u2019s just a bird. This can\u2019t be Jessica! Jessica is my sweet darling, not a stupid bird! Your not my daughter, are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to her, jumping up and down for good measure. Her eyes tightened, squinting at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...are my daughter? But...but. How can this be? Only yesterday you were my daughter and now...you, you, your a...bird!\u201d She fainted on the spot, falling back in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew over to the counter and looked at her, chirping. Your father ran over to her with a damp cloth and held it to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids, go to your room. We need to talk with Jessica...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour two brothers looked at each other and then headed up to their room, closing the door.</span></div></div>",

A bird flew into the table and it turned out to be our daughter. Crazy, right?\u201d Then your mother looked at the table, seeing the bird again. \u2018Oh god, that wasn\u2019t a dream, w...was it?\u201d Both you and your father shook your heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finally calmed down again, the three of you went into the living room. You\u2019re parents looked at you in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so to be sure. You are our daughter Jessica, correct?\u201d You nodded. \u201cOk, so we got that covered. Hmm, so how did you get like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d but only chirps came from your beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, your a bird. You can\u2019t speak. Why couldn\u2019t you have been a parrot?\u201d You roll your eyes at them. They were almost taken aback. \u201cWell, I guess yes and no questions will have to do. Do you know how you got like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t then. Well...that complicates things. Amber, do you have any ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdeas?! I still can\u2019t believe my daughter is a bird! A. Bird! Besides, what do I look like, a magician?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knelt down a little, saddened by your moms frustration. She saw this and brought her hand to you, petting your delicate feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...honey. It\u2019ll be ok.\u201d You nuzzle your moms hand, showing you understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you two have reconciled. Now, what to do with your new...body? If anyone finds out about this I don\u2019t even know what would happen. Then again, no one could tell you were a bird, so I don\u2019t think that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Still, we will have to be careful. I guess let\u2019s just try to live with it till we can figure this out. Ok Jess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly nodded again at both of your parents, then flew upstairs to your room to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is unbelievable. One day I\u2019m a regular, everyday teen and the next I\u2019m a bird! A bird! Well, it could be worse. At least my family understands, although mom still seems reluctant to believe it.

Then, a thought comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dad\u2019s right, anyone looking at me would think I was just any another bird. I should really do something about that. Hmm, what though?</i> You fly up to your vanity and jump from one end to the other, looking for something. Then, you notice a small yellow flower that blew in from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, that would be fitting, now wouldn\u2019t it?</i> You hop over to the it and try to pick it up, only to realize you don\u2019t have your hands. <i>Oh yeah, don\u2019t have my hands anymore. Um, ok, plan B. Let\u2019s see if dad is any help.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly out of your room and back down to the living room, where your dad is looking at a magazine, on birds of all things. You fly around him and hover around his book to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a sparrow, what are you doing down here little one. Wait, no. Sorry Jessica. Kind of hard to recognize you. What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly fly upstairs, your dad following, much slower than you. You fly in your room and land by the flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, you sure are quick. Now, what did you want to show me?\u201d You nod your head to the flower next to you, as if you were trying to put it on. \u2018Oh, what a nice flower.

He brings it to your head and wraps it among the feathers. You look at yourself in the mirror, looking much different from any other sparrow you saw. You dad looked at you, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow honey. That is brilliant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped around, excited that your father was so supporting of this. Then, you noticed that your dad was looking at you curiously. He then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...Jessie. I know this is weird of me to ask but could I...look at you more closely.

As she turns it off, she suggests calling some friends from school and tells you how popular you are, being the only dinosaur in your school. You're a bit confused about that last part. Does that mean reality changed so you were really born as a dinosaur and lived your life like this ever since? You just go along with it and look for your list of friends' phone numbers in your room.

It's so much better to be in the ocean, but for now the pelt would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, sitting up slowly and staring down at the pelt in your arms. It was big enough to cover you from head to toe, and you scurried to stand. You couldn't bear to let go of it as you rushed to the mirror, seeing a female. Not that you weren't a woman before, of course. She just looked... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was a grey-green color, and she had short, chocolate brown hair that reminded you of mud. But, like, really good looking mud. It was thickly clumped into strands, looking grossly oily and wet. She had light, pale yellow eyes, as well, with slit pupils. The irises almost filled up her entire sclera. Once you opened your mouth, your reflection shown sharp teeth, reminding you of a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly moved your pelt - ah, no, <i>the</i> pelt - around your front to look it over in your reflection as well. It was a soft brown, lighter than her - <i>your</i> hair, with white-grey spots littering it. Even with how thick it was as you held it against you, you could see the curves of your body. Or lack thereof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a lithe form with small breasts and slim thighs, but you had a swimmer's muscles. You couldn't complain, really. It just felt so <i>natural</i> to be so optimized for water. You also noticed your chest protruding out even more than usual. Not in the form of breasts, but your ribcage was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you knew your lungs were bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The first plan of action, though, was to get something in your parched body, for sure,</i> you thought as you opened your bedroom door. You felt lucky that your parents were rarely ever home, especially now considering they were on a vacation out of town for their anniversary. This left you home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night you grew anxious, closing all the blinds and curtains, so currently you didn't really need to worry about your neighbors seeing you as you poured some water from the pitcher in the fridge, never once letting go of your-<i>THE</i> pelt. The cold it spread through your body as you drank it made you feel like you were back in the sea and comforted once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... what? Shoot, this thing might be messing with your head. Either way, you had another choice of what to do.</span></div></div>",

As if suddenly called by the wind that blew it's chilly breath through the rickety bare branches of the hibernating trees, a snowstorm began to fall, covering the world with the soft, icy, white cushion of silence. Utter peace in the night. Unbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine a town. An ordinary town covered in a blanket of snow and quiet. Not a single breath of air to be heard from its sleeping residents. Imagine a window, frost climbing up at its glass as the temperature crawls down. Inside is an ordinary bedroom and on the bed is an ordinary looking girl. The room is warm and cosy from a job well done by the central heating but a cold aura surrounds the girl. Wisps of condensation, cold air meets hot, curled from the girl's mouth as she breathed in and out. Her skin seemed to grow paler to match the untouched whiteness of the newly fallen snow and her platinum blond hair turn white. Her eyes snapped open from her slumber and revealed blue eyes of chipped ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer felt different. It was too hot, too warm. It felt wrong. She pulled the covers from her bed and wrapped her baby blue dressing gown around her as she got out of bed. She felt bright and new and powerful. The very tips of her fingers and the ends of her hairs felt charged. She had never felt so alive... and confused. What on earth had been in her food? What was wrong, what was different?<br>\r\nShe walked over to her window and looked out onto the newly settled snow. Excitement bubbled in her chest as she watched it dance and twirl in front of her eyes like will-o'-the-wisps, mesmerising. She had to get out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went downstairs and stepped out barefooted into the crisp snow. She felt the cold but it wasn't as extreme to her as it should have been, and it didn't bother her anyway. It felt normal. It felt right. As though she had finally taken her first step into the world in her truest form. The blizzard twisted around her like tiny fireflies engulfing her in a swirling swarm of ice. It was deep in the night, the time where there is no-one around, everyone lost in the world of dreams. No-one to see her disappear when a gust of wind dispersed the swarm into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one with winter. She could feel the tickling of frost growing up the surfaces of trees, windows, walls. She could feel the slowed heartbeats of hibernating animals. Part of her was panicking, what the hell was going on?! Why was she so calm? <br>\r\nShe felt an energy source in the snow, in the middle of town, in a dark alleyway. Jennifer instinctively moved towards it and took her physical form again. Curled up in snow and newspaper was a boy, blue lipped and shivering violently. He was obviously homeless. She could feel his life-force clinging on by a thread. The other, colder part of her was hungry. All it would take was a little tug at that string and it would be hers. It scared her...</span></div></div>",

And yet the boy still did not move other than his helpless, violent shaking. She knelt beside him, white hair brushing over her face. He looked the same age as her and yet they were in totally different worlds. She\u2019d had a normal life with everything she needed given to her. No tragedies, no hardships. Who knows what this boy had to go through on a daily basis, let alone what had brought or driven him to live and freeze on the streets. Pity for the boy overwhelmed the hating hunger of the colder part of her. She knew she couldn\u2019t just leave him\u2026 not now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t understand what all these strange things were and why they were happening but she knew that she had some sort of control over them. She had felt winter itself, after all. She stroked his face oh so tenderly, willing for the cold to let go, willing for every chill that needled into his body to reverse, come back and repair its damage. She was not going to let him be cold tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\t*\t*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always knew he was hanging on by the tips of his fingers. Just surviving. From the time he ran he knew. Charlie had never had it easy. He felt the dread that night when he heard it was going to be a very cold night, like feeling his fingertips slipping slowly. He felt it when it was getting late and he couldn\u2019t find anywhere to shelter from the cold. There were no warm doorways, no abandoned houses, no bus shelters. So he did what he could. He huddled up in an alley; never the best place to go, but there was nowhere else. He wrapped himself up with the heat-conserving newspaper and hoped for the best. It was all he could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the stabbing cold like daggers even as he slept. They seemed to claw down his flesh and suck away his will and energy. Not even the newspaper could shield him. He felt himself slipping\u2026<br>\r\nAnd then it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daggers were pulling back, leaving blessed warmth which spread through him with a feathery touch. He could feel life and strength gently re-entering his body. He opened his eyes in slow motion and saw an angel. Purest white in the falling snowflakes as she disappeared like snow on the breath of the wind. He sat up and looked around. There were no footsteps, no sign but a mere memory that she was there. The only certainty was that she was gone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What can someone so young afford when attending an estate sale, the answer to this is old books. Old decrepit looking books, the kind someone would set up high on a shelf to keep it from becoming dust laden. Books of broken spines, deteriorated covers, as such one book I saw dealt with devils, magic, and... curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bid five dollars for the book and was surprised when I quickly won the bid for it, as I clutched it to my chest and headed home with the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at home the book and I went to the reading room, the bathroom where there I opened to me a realm of such devilment, it made me begin laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first few pages were names and titles of known devils, and what they held as powers available, as well their favorite method of demeaning mankind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a glossary of magical spells, many of what I read but the titles were used to change men or women into animalistic forms. I noted that just some of the magical spells specified the change was not permanent, but most were of the permanence of a terrible finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the nine final pages dealt with curses, and from scanning them and their titles told me this was one section I was best to stay away from lest the curses do an about face and chase after the caster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the glossary of magical spells, I came upon one that if read aloud, it would settle down around me to enhance it said my outlook on life and grant me a future of ever-changing luck. It sounded to a young mind as fun and rather harmless, a foolish assumption to be sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as prescribed, and using some sidewalk chalk borrowed from my sister, I drew a pentagram design on the hardwood floor in my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with the book laid over my crisscrossed legs setting Indian style, I began then reading the spell, inserting my full name, my origin of birth, and did an unbelievable mistake, I wished I were a dog, a large breed, large enough for me to retain my human memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine then my disgust for wasting five bucks on a worthless book when nothing immediately happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was evening supper time I ate three helpings of everything set on the table. So ravenous my manner of eating food, mom compared me to the Rottweiler dog owned by her father at his farm. Her mention of that breed of dog was to me and my spellbinding a providential directing of the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper and feeling full I went for a walk, but the walk soon became a running experience, exhausting me, to my returning home that mom noted my tongue was lolling out my mouth but I was not stinking of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening television viewing seemed to bore me until early in the evening before sundown I decided and said I was going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the bed covers, a warm summer night, my room being on the second floor to the house meant the air conditioning cool air never reached up to my room, so I opened the windows and laid on my bed. My mind was busy thinking, remembering all the details I ever knew about Rocky, that the name of the Rottweiler stud mutt dog owned and kept as a guard dog to the farm. Rocky doubled as a male puppy maker when the spirit moved him. I knew little of his activities other than barking when someone arrived at the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocky was a dog of all muscle, he was huge, almost as large as was Tommy, the Shetland pony grandpa kept for his grandchildren to come there and ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay there day-dreaming, wishing that I were like Rocky, free from school, no responsibilities, able to get up and go where I wished, his lifestyle seemed so easy and so much fun. Then it began as the sun dropped beyond the western horizon. As the night stars appeared, so did patches of dark skin and short fur. I failed to take notice of my spreading Rottweiler pelt until I felt the need to use the bathroom and doing like dad and not like sis, I stood and watched in horror as the wall behind the toilet trickled with sprayed moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sight to see and giving to my realization, I looking down saw not what was me coming out the shower that morning, but the new me, me becoming a large dog, a duplicate to Rocky!    </span></div></div>",

Father got up from the table and answered the phone, he became very excited, slamming the receiver down hard on its cradle, as he pointed at me and told me to come with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rush to get outside and running along down the driveway to the country road what was out front our house, father told me that Bernard had broken loose and farmer John called, asking us to try and catch as hold the aged Belgium draft horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were each to one side of the narrow gravel topped road when there came Bernard, he having slowed to a easy trotting, was closer then to my side of the road. Bernard knew me, as I was there when he was born and helped to feed him after his mare died due to complications from the birthing. Bernard and I became good friends, and I got to ride him bareback, something he would not allow anyone else to get away with doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard saw me he slowed and halted before me, we greeting each the other, me talking to him and he sniffing my scents, my breath, and nuzzling his head at my chest. Grabbing his reins I grabbed a handful of mane and swung myself up as onto his broad back. Father smiled at me with a sense of admiration of his son, as I turned Bernard around and with a nudge to his flanks I urged him to trot toward where he had his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we arrived there stood a smiling farmer John and in his hand was a twenty dollar bill, my reward for the capture of his prize winning draft horse stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next became a personal feud as to the reality of what happened to me. As I trotted Bernard up the grassy driveway to the farmhouse and my reward, Mister John came up to stand and take hold the head halter on Bernard, as he looking up at me said, <i>\"If by the powers that be there was a way that Bernard and his abilities could own the commonsense of you his friend!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner said than as I sat there leaning forward and giving Bernard a love hug about his broad as strong neck my view of the world began to fade. As did my ability to see the world in colors Ii knew, as changed to dimmer hues, as an increased sense of smell did more to suggest what was or was not worthy a choice for food or a friendship. My spell and the fond wish said by farmer John merged, and merged me with Bernard, we being on body and mind then as one and alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout similar realizations, the feeling of merging, becoming then as is a strong horse and quite matured is to a young person something of a wild ride at a circus of sensations. Suddenly I felt the ground from hoofs set hard in place. I felt his tail, it dubbed short, whisking, tickling. Ears twitched as he too realized he had gained an increased awareness of all around him as inside of him. We were as one animal, alive and each knowing of the presence of the other and being as friends, we remained as friends, as each gained and learned to enjoy feelings differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy clothing was returned home and the twenty dollar bill still inside my shirt pocket. I stayed at the farm, Bernard entering a corral, we walked and communicated through mutual thoughts blending and enlightening. The excitement and a couple miles of trotting as the returning home to the farm had rise to various bodily needs, we then took a long drink from a watering trough as Bernard raised his head and whinnied a sense of our delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while of us trotting about the corral, raising a cloud of dust, Misses John appeared and clipping a rein to our head halter, she led us inside the barn and into the large box stall where Bernard thought of it as his home. We stood there as he watching and me inside him attesting to feelings I would not admit to thinking or finding enjoyable, we waited for the inevitable visit by father to find his lost son. </span></div></div>",

Every move Bernard made was echoed back to me and my mentality. His very basic thought patterns were along the lines of what he either smelled, tasted, or as touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct is just what it implies, as a smell enters the nostrils and is passed through the sinus Bernard reacts to varied stinking smells. Unlike a dog or cat that from their bodies being extremely agile, what they often tend to sniff or lick is not what my pal Bernard goes after. As of what Bernard would lowering his head and mouth to taste what smelled in a robust manner, the flavor of it striking my mentality communicated my displeasure causing a short lived argument.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur being touched came from many origins, the windy breezes were often using the mane hair or tail hairs to tickling, making Bernard to shake his neck or flick his tail. It was a warm day when first I became in part a second entity merged with Bernard. The occasional dust devil of rotating dirt and wind did sandblast what was non-fur covered skin, tending to dry what was warm and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough one that first day and afternoon we, Bernard and I stood alone in a corral while waiting on my dad to return with whatever he could do or would allow about me being in part as a mature horse. Bernard had memories of both fond and spiteful times when mares touched his body. His mind reacted to how he was touched, causing various reactions, as other than his tail swishing the reactions were along the same lines as how humans might feel when touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon became a long waiting for Dad to return, as dusk came and then nightfall and no dad coming, we saw Farmer John come toward us and he snapping a rein to our head halter, we were led to a barn stall for our first night being as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard seemed quite thrilled with his being put, placed into the stall holding his scent. Although he was more than thrilled and showing it to Farmer John, his new partner in life was smelling what to a human, no matter if young or old, the stall, stank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the usual as expected evening ration of mixed grains poured into a steel bucket snugly bound by a rope to the inner side of the stall door. Bernard was quick to licking, lap up the hard kernels of raw grains, a mix of rye, oats, and barley.  Bernard and then myself, we knew that to him the grain was part of his welcomed evening meal. A thick square of hay placed into a crib made for hay fodder offered bernard something for him to munch, eating at it until a later hour or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was very dark and we could see only because of the dim golden light beaming to illuminate the rear yard area behind the farmhouse and the front of the barn. I was a bit surprised as how well at night Bernard could see what was in the barn. He might see some movement or a sound heard, a scent sniffed, causing him to turn as stand and stare, he being very scared of the dark and from our thoughts I learned of his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarmer John owned four mares he entered into the state fair for load pulling, and judged as to their pedigree breed, how they stand and look being an asset to their kind. Even in the dark, Bernard knew his stablemates were close and via whinnies they communicated, reassuring one and another that they were safe from harm or attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we felt each our own sense of being weary, Bernard folded down his forelegs and then tucked under his barrel-body those strong hind legs, did we lie down and slowly let sleep take us to dreaming what a horse and stallion has to dream, dreams.</span></div></div>",

It was a new awakening for me, as totally unlike my usual manner of rising in the morning I was taught to tend to do thingings, as an example of brushing my teeth, comb my hair, wash my face and put on clean underwear in case for some reason I needed to go to the hospital my underwear would look presentable; or so mom said that clean undies was very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing then as a horse, Bernard was an animal and to him my thoughts about taught human hygiene almost got him to give me a horse laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\"Really Bernard, my friend, if you were me and not as you a horse, if by being human there are many requirements, nurturing like mares do for their foals that being human one does to be accepted by other people as of good breeding.\"</span></b> I said, as Bernard seemed to understand more of about my thoughts, as if my mentality and his was still. merging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard did not reply with use of words as he by then and even with me aboard inside him we had not merged our memories to such an extent that he knew how to speak his mind. He would do things as to mark his responses for me to then understand him and his limited abilities to express his ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\"Ah ha,\"</span></b> we both had the say thought when hearing first as then seeing farmer John walking toward, as entering the barn, he there to feed and give water to his horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning would be the first of many future mornings as my time being joined, merged into Bernard was to last a while longer than even I expected. Farmer John noticed something about Bernard as he looked different, and the farmer stood gawking at us for several minutes of weird suspense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"I can't believe it, its impossible, Bernard you look like your old as much younger self this morning, as to how I can only imagine the merging of Steve has caused a revitalization!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and a good morning to you Steve, as your parents know as do I that you are inside with Bernard as part of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad called me late last night, he found in your room the chalk drawn pentagram you had drawn on your bedroom floor, and there to was a book. The book being a dictionary of magical spells, curses, and the like. I requested of him, your father as not to destroy the book but being it to me, as my late aunt was big into magic and taught me to respect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might from the book discover a method to returning you to be your human self, would you like that?\"</b></i> Farmer John said as asked, he talking at Bernard but directing his spoken words to me and with a hope I understood what he had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whinnied my response as being there and Farmer John then smiled, he satisfied that his words had got to me and I was still alive being me but in with Bernard. As Mister John the farm owner began his morning rituals of feeding and serving up clean fresh water for our morning drinking, I was to learn that instincts of personal hygiene meant nothing to being a horse. As what made and had its own scenting was to Bernard as something what made him pleased and feel contentment, such that people think of as more vile and quickly discard as make it go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarmer John led the mares out the barn and put each into the front pasture, it being very green and the grasses there were a foot tall. Bernard thought it odd that he, we were not given the opportunity to join the mares, as he had dark masculine ideas floating around in his primal mind as what he wished to do that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarmer John  then came back into the barn and he standing outside the wood and iron bar door to the stall, he said, <i><b>\"This morning I plan to have the veterinarian come and check on you, you being Bernard my horse and with you Steven, as something has happened during the night. Bernard, his body has rejuvenated muscle wise, he, as your body looks similar to what he did several years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure, but maybe due to your use of magic and merging with Bernard that you brought upon him the biblically stated expected life expectancy of three score and ten years. That is my logic about what happened as of how sleek and healthy he looks this morning. If so, and you Steve being a teenager and a healthy and athletic young person, what was you must have done this... rejuvenating of Bernard. That said and if what I think happened is true, then you by being merged with my prize winning stud stallion, you both could live a life together for some sixty years!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to what Farmer John said did nothing to give Bernard a thrill, but to me, I understood what Mister John said, and the realization of me remaining for all my lifetime as being a horse, an animal seemed undesirable, as if a curse.</span></div></div>",
