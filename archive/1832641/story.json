She pretended to be mad at Milly, but in truth she really likes Mark. She steps out in her back yard and looks up at the sky. \"Hmm, the sun looks weird today\", she says. Then she notices that there are two suns. One of them seems to be getting closer. \"What the hell\", she begins to say before being slapped in the head by the glowing orb she mistook for another sun. It knocks her right to the ground. The world is a spinning mass of colors for a short time and then blackness. She wakes up a short time later on her back staring up at the sky. She manages to get up and stumbles towards the house. \"What was that\", she mumbles? She has heard that sometimes brain tumors can cause visually hallucinations. \"Oh my god, it's a tumor\", she thinks to herself. As soon as she says it she hears a voice that says, \"It's not a tumor. You've been chosen to be Earth's new guardian god. Use your powers wisely\". \"What, what do you mean guardian god\", she screams out loud, but receives no answer? She shakes her head. \"What the fuck ever. Now I'm going crazy.

She remembered about reading a article about a different kind of zombie that was unique. 'What was it called again? Oh yeah! A Jiang Shi!', Eve thought to her self. After thinking about turning into one, she noticed that her hands, although flexible, stiffened a little bit before turning into claw-like hands. 'Am-Am I-?', before she could finish her thought, Eve noticed a slip of paper that was on her face. Eve quickly ripped it out before drawing the word, \"Myself\" in Chinese. \"Wait, how could I- Did the transformation do this?\", She wondered to herself. Eve cringed in slight discomfort as her clothes changed from her normal attire to that of something a(Much to her amazement,) modern-looking Jiang Shi would wear. \"I gotta say, I'm a little jealous!\", Eve said out loud after her transformation ended as she got a good look at herself in the mirror. She looked like a normal person except with many differences: Her hands alone made her look like a monster. Her once human hands turned into clawed hands that would make Freddy Krueger jealous.(They looked a little metallic, but she could sheath them similar to a cat's, making her hands look human again.) Her body looked a little pale.  Eve saw that she was wearing a hoodie that had the kanji \"Demon\" on her back, pants that made her legs(Which she noticed, had grown a little about 3 inches or so.) look like she was a ghost. Eve saw that her her now yellow eyes looked a little scary, but not by much. 'I wonder what Milly(her best friend) will think of me? Well, only one way to find out!', Eve thought to herself before walking to the phone....or rather, hopping to it. \"What am I-?! Oh yeah.\", she said to herself as she remembered that Jiang Shi's love to hop. After altering some of her instincts, she ran to the phone and dialed his number. \"Yeah?\", Milly answered, a kind tone in her voice. \"Hey ! I was wondering if you wanted to hang out with me. I've got something to show you.\", asked Eve. \"Sure! How about 8:00PM?\"(It's about 7:45) \"Fine by me! See ya soon!\", Eve responded with happiness before hanging up the phone. \"Is she going to be in for a shock when she gets here!\", Eve chuckled to herself.                                                                                                                                                                 </span></div></div>",

However, she had a very traumatic life thanks to her babysitter screwing up both her body and her mind.<br>\r\nHer dad did give her some therapy, so she is not as bonkers as she was back then. Growing up was hard on her. People bullied her on a daily basis. As such, she was very lonely at ages 5- 11. At age 12 however, Eve made a friend by the name Milly Erson. They became close friends. She has shown but rarely an ability to copy attacks and did not use it for a long time. Eve's body in her early years was considered \"childish\" by many. At age 18 however, puberty hit her with a sledgehammer. Example: she got MANY boys asking her if she had a boyfriend. Everyone was shocked to know that was the girl they bullied in the past. Eve has been seen using her new power willingly. She is still friends<br>\r\nwith Milly to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is very mischievous to most people and her new ability basically makes her God.
