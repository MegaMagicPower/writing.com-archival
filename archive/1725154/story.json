The reason why he's laying his bed is because he put on a massive weight of 500lbs after he recently been from the fat camp for weight gain which he started doing it 3 months ago. 2 months ago, Cody the other half didn't thought of Zack's idea at first until he logged in on facebook when Zack added his fat photos of himself for his diary while he was there and that's where Cody started to get interested &amp; starts going to the fat camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why Zack was in his room for himself as he just finished his weight gain course last week when the leader of the fat camp gave out for those who finish the course which was a special potion. Although he didn't got told about the potion, he didn't know what it is. So Zack gets up from his bed, wearing his speedos because his clothes are no longer fit with him &amp; takes the potion with him to the bowling alley which is just outside the tipton hotel to test it to find what's for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, Zack arrived at the bowling alley where nobody was around so he'll have to use the special potion quickly before anyone spots him &amp; knew what he's doing. So Zack didn't have time to waste as he drinks the potion full &amp; find out what it was. He waited for few seconds later until he had a pain from his fat stomach which was getting worse until he then noticed that he's bigger than the ground floor window which he thought it was the steps that he was on but it wasn't when he finally discovered that he's getting taller as it's starts to grow quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was in shock as the growth keeps coming until few minutes later, his growth stops at the height of 200ft tall. Zack then looked down with his black speedos which grew with him as he's got a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: *lol* Whoa! That was some kind of unexpected surprise wasn't it? *lol*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked amazed with his new fat giant size as he looked down at the tipton hotel roof which came up to his man-boobs as he saw the tiny guests at the outdoor swimming pool when they stand there in horror looking up at the giant's big fat face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Aww! look at them! There's so tiny and already they're too scared of me? Really? So let's see how scared you really are as I'm gonna eat you up alive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed loudly as he started to grab two huge handfuls of the tiny guesst which they knew that there's no way out when he brought them to his face with his tongue sticking out &amp; then he eats them all in once as he swallowed them alive with a loud burp and then started to rub his fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Yummy! that was so tasty it's taste like human burger. But now I'm at the city already so for whose tiny insects don't know who I am, let me introduce to myself. I AM ZACK MARTIN &amp; I AM ZACKZILLA. *laughs*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack says his name when he sticks his fat ginormous butt out &amp; destroyed the tipton hotel which he then starts laughing in a evil way. Then he turned around and saw the hotel got knocked down as he gave himself a pat on his butt which he then started to move off with a massive booms as the tiny citizens screams wildly as they run one side to the other. Zack looked down again with a grin on his fat face as the 500 pounder starts to... </span></div></div>",

And that's when he starts walking by stomping the tiny citizens, the vehicles, the small buildings &amp; etc. He then move on the main buildings as Zack shoves it over which made the building capsized on the middle of the main streets &amp; did the same to the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then approach to the small but big wide shape building which came up to to his fat thighs as he tuants them with a suitable idea which came from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Oh yes! Just the building that I was needed &amp; just in time to use my favourite giant crush move. Looks like you insects are gonna be trapped in there as I Zackzilla am gonna sit on you by my famous fat gigantic butt. And once I done that, I'll will takeover this city forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zack marked his words carefully, he then turned around with the building behind as he shake his butt before he was on the sitting position &amp; then *SMASH* as Zack finally squash the building by being sat on with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Hey! Did you know that you been butt squashed? *laughs*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laughter of joy as Zack celebrates as he now runs the city &amp; will last a very long time. Just as he's about to stand up in full height, his right buttcheek got hit lightly which there no effect on Zack because of his size. He then turns around and looks down at the army just as they newly arrived on the scene. He then stands up with his hand rubbing his sore buttcheek as the army sergeant comes out from the tank mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSgt: Alright fat mamouth! Playtime is over! I want you to deport the city or else.<br>\r\nZack: Or else what? Trying to shoot me like? In fact you shouldn't shoot me behind my back you know or I'll crush you to death if you don't careful what you doing.<br>\r\nSgt: Oh Really? Well let tell you something Santa wannabe, You don't disobey my orders from the sergeant pal. And you know what? You had your warming mamouth. Boys! Shoot this monster down NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanks fires at Zack as he cover himself in danger but he already noticed that the bullets can't hurt him. So he stands up straight as he's walk towards the army tanks in a foul mood while the army keeps shooting towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: You know what? Since you shoot me purposely, I'll gonna teach you &amp; your little toy soldiers a lesson by taking you out at each and everyone of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then turns around once more as the army sergeant knew what he's doing as he gets in the tank &amp; retreats himself as the army keeps doing the shooting. Zack then looked at the bus as he puts his left foot in &amp; then he slips purposely and sat on the tanks by his massive butt. He then looked at a feared sergeant as he made it clear from his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Hey Sergeant! Looks like your little toy soldiers have been flattened like a pancake *lol*<br>\r\nSgt: Oh yeah! But you missed one and you're never gonna stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant then tries to retreat but got caught as Zack lifts up the tank and picks up the sergeant from the vehicle and then drops the tank on the middle of the street and stomps it to finish it off. But he's not dine with the sergeant yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Now I'll ordering you to kiss my sore right buttcheek or i'll crush you. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<br>\r\nSgt: Fine! I'll do it whatever you wanted.<br>\r\nZack: Then do it NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack lowered his hands with the sergeant to his buttcheek &amp; forces him to kiss his sore mark which he did what Zack ordered by avoid getting crushed by his hands. He then lifts up the sergeant once more as Zack made his decision what to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: That's better! Looks like you'll not gonna get crushed after all don't you? But instead I'll just eat you anyway. Bye bye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sergeant is shocked &amp; pleading  to let go as Zack opened up his mouth &amp; then swallows the sergeant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Well! that's the end of the fallen sergeant. Now time back to business of destruction then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zack looked down at the carnage he smashed &amp; was proud of what he's doing as he now concentrate on by...</span></div></div>",

He waddles again stomping the streets as he passing by until he made it to the city hall as he started to crawl and takes a peak from the window of the mayor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Well look who's in the office right now? The mayor himself and he doesn't notice me. So I thought i'll give him a wake up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then gets up on his feet when he runs to the distance &amp; runs back to the city as he jumps up in the air &amp; backed down using a bellyflop on top of the city hall which then crushed into pieces. He then rolls sideways back and forth with a big laughter of joy as Zack enjoys being a fat giant &amp; wants to stay like this forever. Zack stopped rolling when he saw the mayor crawls out with few injuries and decided to grabbed the mayor right in front of Zack's face while he sits up still on top of the demolished city hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Oh I'm sorry! I didn't know you was there. Oh Well! Looks like you need a new home don't you? Well don't worry! I already found something you're be more comfortable for you to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then shows the mayor without warming as he stands up in full height &amp; puts him in Zack's speedos on his left buttcheek &amp; pats it to make sure he stays there. Zack then lift up his belly as he starts playing with until there was a boom on the sight. It wasn't Zack who made a noise as boom starts to get closer as he then turns around &amp; saw his twin brother Cody who now weighs in at 500lbs. And most of all, he is also a fat giant as he stands at 200ft tall. The same weight &amp; height as Zack is right now and Cody must've dranked the potion like Zack did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was so please to see his twin brother being so brave to become a fat giant and Cody...</span></div></div>",

And that's when he saw a ice cream van drove past between his massive feet as Zack turns around &amp; began to chase the van. The driver tried his best to get away from Zackzilla but got caught when Zack lifts it up in the air with two hands as is went towards his fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy wasting no time, Zack sticks his tongue out in a hungry kind of way as he rips off the back door &amp; starts to eat it over his mouth as he shakes the ice cream van trying to getting out not only the ice creams but the van driver too. When he finally ate all of them out, he then crush the van by his two hands together &amp; then ate the scrap van as his fat gut started to rumble loudly few seconds later when he place his hands on his fat gut &amp; was getting hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Ooooohhhh! Man I'm feel hungry already. But oh well! I can eat whatever I want because I certainly can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked around the city when he thought he would try &amp; eat the building first to start with. He waddles towards the building which came up to his man-boobs as he rips half of it off &amp; turned it upside down from them getting out of here. He then lift's up high above Zack's head as he again turned it back the way, but this time the tiny employees &amp; the rest of the funitures went straight through Zack's wide mouth &amp; began to swallow the all as they all let by. After Zack ate whole lot of them when he made a loud burp, he then dropped the half building &amp; began to smash it by using his his foot to finish it off at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then waddles off once again &amp; this time he stops there when he looked down &amp; saw his favourite fast food resaurant that he ever had, McDonalds! And he's lovin it indeed. He then puts down on his knees as he began to smash the windows &amp; pinches 25 french fries, 25 big macs, 25 McFlurries &amp; 25 drinks of soda which he then gathered them up together as he sits up with his fat legs spread out &amp; was begin to eat. But all this he gets was too small to eat. So Zack thought he would took out the bottle he grew &amp; began to pour the meals as it grew larger right up to the correct size from his point of view. As the spillage of the potion wears off quickly, he then finally began to eat as he starts off with the french fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Zack finally finish his meal when drank the last of the sodas as he then rubs his fat gut with a loud burp &amp; was getting exhausted after having a nice long meal from McDonalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: *yawns* Boy that was a nice meal &amp; I think I like to stay bigger for a very long time. But now I like to have a long nice sleep at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack began yawning again as he laid down on his back &amp; was sleeping when he starts snoring which was heard around the city from the far side. Few hours later, Zack finally woke up when he was tied all around his body. He thought he was like Gulliver when it got tied around the ropes which Zack only see's a small string from his point of view. Zack tried to pull himself roughly but the ropes were too strong so he give up &amp; just laying there trapped in the middle of the city. So he then looked around to see who's responsible for tie up Zack in the first place which he then found out that he saw...</span></div></div>",

Don't know why he wanted the warehouse place though, even his twin brother Zack wasn't sure the same reason.  One time though when you would see Zack standing against the wall and he was kinda burst to giggle for any reason, that is until the turned now towards Cody.  Not just Cody what we always saw on the telly, but Cody is so fat when Zack can only see his big butt of his way as he was trying to build his lastest machine to work and you maybe wondering why Cody gained so much weight?  well, I'll tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody kept all his stuff in his warehouse so you know how much he's got everthing he made on.  Moments ago Cody was gonna build this machine he's currently using right now when Zack had a look at the nventions his twin brother made.  Despite he was told not to do anything, Zack picked this big ray gun and he asked Cody what is was for by accidently pulling the trigger and it shot towards Cody and without nowhere, Cody was beginning to grow fatter and that's was he is right now weighing at 500lbs from his mind.  His clothes were too tight on him which he now has plan B, getting his clothes up to Cody's weight size, but he was embarrissed as Zack burst into giggled yet again and Cody turned his head to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: \"Zack, I know I'm now fat but would you please stop laughing at me while I'll do this.\"<br>\r\nZack: \"Sorry, but it's funny when you look like a sumo wrestler.  Maybe you should join that one.\"<br>\r\nCody: \"I'm not joining a sumo wrestling thing and I'm not in a mood after you deliberately pulled the trigger on me to make me this big.\"<br>\r\nZack: \"Come on, it was an accident.  I was only touching this ray thing and it shot right ya.\"<br>\r\nCody: \"Like I told you not to do anything I made?\"<br>\r\nZack: \"Well you didn't told me not to touch anything so I just did.  Anything what are you trying to do with this thing?\"<br>\r\nCody: \"I'm making 'The Enlargenator 2000' and what this does that when you shoot anything you aim for gets bigger and I don't mean fat ok.\"<br>\r\nZack: \"Ok, just chill for a bit.\"<br>\r\nCody: \"Alright, I'll try and concentrate with this machine and ths time I don't want you to touch anything.  You hear me?

Then right about 15 minutes later, Cody had finally finished the machine and it is all ready in use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: \"There!  That's shall do it!\"<br>\r\nZack: \"Wow!  Your machine looks amazing!\"<br>\r\nCody: \"Thanks!  I want to make it this way you know.\"<br>\r\nZack: \"So that's you all done then what would you do to this machine?  I mean I kinda imangined if you were bigger that me or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody had a long though what he'll do, but he would try and stick with his idea and getting his clothes bigger, but that puts his mind from Zack's just to imanging himself getting bigger but he has a wise dicision to say until he has one and what was Cody going for?</span></div></div>",

Meet me at the warehouse building quick. Because I got some surprise for you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fat twin Cody<br>\r\nP.S. Once you out there, would you mind get a triple cheeseburger for me? Thanks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zack read a text from his cellphone, he then quickly get changed as he struggle to fit on &amp; heading off to see Cody. After a few minute walk with one stop which a fast food takeaway, Zack finally arrived at the warehouse building when he see's Cody who is (like it says) also fat as well, the same weight as Zack as he approach to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: Hey Zack! Did you get a triple cheeseburger for me yet?<br>\r\nZack: Yeah! I got them for you &amp; myself in fact, I'm starving!<br>\r\nCody: Me too!<br>\r\nZack: Yeah about a surprise, What is it you want me anyway?<br>\r\nCody: Well remember you watched Attack of the 50ft Woman that you said you can be like her?<br>\r\nZack: Yeah?<br>\r\nCody Well how about if the two of us you &amp; me can become fat giants by using a growth ray gun?<br>\r\nZack: Yeah that's totally awesome! How did you know I was going to say that!<br>\r\nCody: You told me after the film.<br>\r\nZack: Oh yeah I remember! And you as well?<br>\r\nCody: Yeah I love to since you teach me how to be fat like you.<br>\r\nZack: Fair enough! Let's do this thing!<br>\r\nCody: Yeah but before that, I want you to put on your speedos it's because you don't want your clothes getting ripped apart.<br>\r\nZack: I gotcha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust few minutes later when the fat twins one at the time got changed into their speedos which they feeling good with their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: Man this looks like we're in sumo wrestling together.<br>\r\nZack: Yeah! Me too! But can we get on with a growth thing?<br>\r\nCody: Okay! we're ready to go then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they did as the twins standing side by side when Cody shoots the ray gun towards them and then they started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Cody! I think it's working! <br>\r\nCody: Yeah! We're growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were excited as they looked at each other until Cody knew somethings goes wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody Zack! Do you remember that we still inside the building?<br>\r\nZack: Oh my god! Your right! We're gonna fill up the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey feel shocked about this as Zack quickly got an idea as they start crawl on their knees &amp; fit through that door. But they're too late because they're too big to fit through there which they have to sit on the floor getting filled up the building. Until their heads finally burst through the ceiling when the growth stops at the mark of 100ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: WOW! This is awesome! But how do we get out of this?<br>\r\nZack: Easy! Just stand up as this building is going down.<br>\r\nCody: Oh! Okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the twin begin to stand up as the building became knocking down into bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Ah that's better! It feels like we been trapped in there.<br>\r\nCody: Yeah me too! Hey! look at the view above them.<br>\r\nZack: Yeah! this city's beautiful until we're destroying this city once and for all.<br>\r\nCody:You said it Zack! Let's kick some tiny people's butts!<br>\r\nZack: Or maybe they can kiss our big butts don't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Zack as he showed Cody by rubbing his big butt &amp; Cody did the same too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: Yeah they sure are.

After they drank it which they still have chocolate on their mouths, Cody then put his chubby hads through the window at the other side of the building &amp; took out four small cocolate cakes which they shared with two cakes. But Zack dosen't get use to get small food since he &amp; Cody became fat giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Cody! This cake you gave me is too small for us to eat.<br>\r\nCody: Or maybe using the ray gun remember?<br>\r\nZack: Oh yeah!
