Up on the side walk your cab goes. More passengers, but you evade them too. Seems like that 6 week training course for taxi driving paid off. Of course, your instructor's name was Borimir Valenkov, so the two stunt driving lessons probably were a given, considering his Russian heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all these memories have flashed through your head while you drove through the narrow streets of New Rochelle, you finally reach the taxi station, right next to the train station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop the car, fumble for the door handle and violently slam it open, as you yell out into the empty air in front of the train station: \"LADY! Ehhh... I GOT YOUR BABY IN MY CAB!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople look shocked, but nobody responds to claim the baby as their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you have to try again, louder this time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLLLLO! LADY! IF YOU PAID ME 100 DOLLARS FOR A CAB RIDE A FEW MINUTES AGO, YOU FORGOT YOUR BABY! ... FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when you are about to lose all hope, you notice a woman inside one of the trains on the opposite side of the train station, which is about to leave. IT IS HER! She is waving and moving her lips, as if she is screaming at you to notify you, but the windows of the train drown out the sound completely. You see her storming through the train car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than you can even think, you grab the baby from the back seat, hold it in your arms and start running in a straight line towards the moving train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour run turns into a sprint!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the train car, the woman is in, you start to gasp for air. The train is now already several times faster than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you have to stop to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing, you see of the train, is the woman who is standing speechless in front of the train doors, as if she was glued to them. Despair fills her eyes instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reek in the cold November air, you do eventually glance some letters on the electronic display above the train doors: TRAIN 404 STAMFORD CONNECTICUT TRAIN CAR 07</span></div></div>",

Am I glad to see you!\" you say. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looks you up and down for a moment and then heads back to the front of the cab, hand on his holster. The baby in the cab has begun to wail loudly, and its screams filter out to you in the hot Texas sun.  You watch anxiously as the trooper orders the young woman out of the cab. Suddenly the baby is being forced out the driver side window into the arms of the trooper, who can do nothing but accept it, or see the baby dropped on the hot asphalt. His arms momentarily full of baby, the young woman makes a grab for his weapon and they struggle together briefly. The trooper has the baby in a football carrying position under one arm and the woman has both hands on his gun which he is trying to wrestle from her. She tumbles out of the car as he attempts to back away from her. Meanwhile the old man is gunning the engine of your cab and threatening to leave. Finally, miraculously, the woman ends up with the gun and the trooper ends up with the baby. She orders you to take the baby and get in the cab as she holds the trooper at gunpoint. You do as your told and soon the three of you are back in the cab heading down the road. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs you ride off down the highway you look back at the trooper lying in the grass and litter at the side of the highway. Lying beside him is the tire iron the old man used to bash his skull in.</span></div></div>",

When you come out of the stall the boy with the Priest shirt is waiting. He's leaning against the sinks with his headphones on, nodding his head to the trebly beat sneaking out of the headphones. \" God. That must be deafening.\" you think. When he sees you emerge he takes the headphones off, \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Mr. Sheeter?\" he says. \" The guy at the Bluestar Motel said you could fly me to Baton Rouge...? I really need to get there, like really bad.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou look at him and frown. \" How old are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Old enough to pay your price.\" he says.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou turn away from him to run cold water on your face. It feels good and for a minute you picture yourself with your face in a sink of cold water for the rest of the day. Ahh, that would be blissful, you think. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"  What're you doin'? Running away? \" you ask, grabbing a paper towel out of the dispenser. \" Where's you parents?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe kid looked at the floor and dug in his pants pocket, pulling out three crisply folded hundred dollar bills and thrust them at you. \" Com'n Mr. Sheeter. I got enough don't I? Just take me to Baton Rouge, no questions asked. OK? Like, I gotta get there today.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou stare at him, rinse your mouth in the sink and then say. \" How do you know I'm even Sheeter? I could just be some drunk for all you know,.... take your money and walk out of here.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe kid looks defeated and starts to leave, but you suddenly decide to take him to Baton Rouge. You're not sure why, maybe you just decide the kid looks like he needs a break.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Come on. \" you say as you brush past him on the way out. \" I'll take you.\"</span></div></div>",
