            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was yet again, another beautiful day in New York, New York. Chun Li went all over the world, basically her version of a vacation. A relaxing get away from her usual everyday life of fighting criminals, day in and day out. She loved what she did, the lives she's saved and the people she'd helped but even she needed some time to breathe. Everyday Chun Li would take a stroll in the afternoon, it didn't matter where she was currently and this day was no different. She would wear her cop uniform but would make sure it didn't yell \"On duty\", it was very casual and not to be confused as a NYPD officer. It was 12:45 and she was taking her daily walk, taking in the hustle and bustle of New York City. People being loud on the streets was common but what Chun Li heard somewhere in the distance wasn't the typical young man yelling at traffic. It was a woman, a woman dressed up in what easily separated her from anyone else that was around her. It was her old rival... Juri Han.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, didn't your mommy ever tell you sharing is caring?\" Juri asked the child. The child being about 12, maybe 13 years of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But that's is my lunch! My Mom gave me a $5 to pick out something!\" The little boy pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat it kid, until I turn you outside down by your foot and take the change too.\" Juri said holding a hotdog in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juri!\" Chun Li interrupted Juri's bullying, getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lookie, it's... umm\" Juri played dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Why're you in New York of all places?\" Chun Li asked stone faced, not playing Juri's games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready to eat lunch, until you rudely interrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of rude...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li approached the child and took a knee \"Did that woman take your hot dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm\" The child replied on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you ruthlessly attack the dolls as well as countless other crimes... and now you've resorted to taking food from children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a girls gotta eat. Does this sexy fit look like it can fit a wallet?\" Juri slid her hand seductively down her hip to her thigh. Years ago she wore a type of Taekwondo outfit but has now sported a skintight biker kind of outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juri... give that little boy his food back.\" Chun Li demanded, still stonefaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? This hotdog?\" Juri took a big bite consuming half of the frank. Chun Li's open palm forming a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh, $2.50 for this crap. Good thing I didn't pay.\" Juri said as she tossed the other half onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the little boy was really crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li again confronting him \"Shhh, don't cry. Don't worry I'll get you another one later, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing that bothered Chun Li it was children being hurt, whether it was physical or through childish bullying, she wouldn't allow it. Juri knew she wouldn't allow it as well. She always the type to push people's buttons. But on vacation, a get away from this sort of action, a kid crying in front of her. Chun Li wasn't going to indulge Juri's behavior with a simple bout this time. Doing what she did to that kid was the ultimate slap in the face and right now... Chun Li wasn't in the mood for a smack of any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li stuck a fighting pose in the direction of Juri \"Awww, are you going to cry next, thunder thighs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li quickly went forward with her signature Hyakuretsukyaku. Juri dodged backwards avoiding her kicks...</span></div></div>",

If she were to let Juri get away scot free yet again not only would the rest of her vacation be utterly ruined but she wouldn't let it go for quite some time. She was an amazing fighter she knew that, and she knew she was better than Juri...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri and Chun Li aggressively traded blow for blow in the street causing civilians to back up and run away. Neither woman landing the strikes they were looking for but Chun Li's strikes came at a much quicker pace. Juri as skilled as she was, couldn't keep up that kind of speed. For the most part Juri stayed on the defense, dodging and jumping away from her kicks. Slowly but surely Juri was getting losing steam. Chun Li with the same no nonsense look kept up her pace for about 5 minutes, waiting for Juri to let her guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fight continued Juri started to resort to using her forearms to block some of the blows instead of just dodging and jumping away... she was getting tired and Chun Li knew it...</span></div></div>",

Go ahead... and be careful!\" The little boy left running in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm smile left Chun Li's face as she turned around, her attention now again on Juri who was still down with legs wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Now what to do with... this?\" Chun Li mumbled to herself.</span></div></div>",

You wanted my attention... I think I'll give it to you. You're too dangerous to run these streets.\" Chun Li pulled out a pair of handcuffs which she always kept one of. You never know when you might need them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li turned and lifted Juri to her feet, turned her around and put her wrists together cuffing her. \"I'm not going to be your doctor, let's play cops.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuri walked his way to school. It was a normal day, same old same old. Wake up, got to school, ...get ignored, go home, study, and relax. It was boring but also expected. Reaching the school he saw three girls walking wearing their, blue and white, school uniforms. Girl's that were quite cute and always ready to completely ignore him. Yuri exhaled heavily, he wouldn't mind a little attention every now and then but at least he didn't attract the attention of the loud rowdy boys that he went to school with either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the window, in the back, homeroom, Yuri held up his head with his palm looking out the window. He groaned as class went on. Highly intelligent relatively, he could certainly afford to daydream a little here and there. Time passed and eventually the last class came and went, slowly like every other day prior. Yuri grabbed his books filled with notes, waited for everyone else to leave, and then he got up and made his way out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri groaned out loud again and walked towards the entrance to go home... Same old same old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until he felt... a forearm under his chin and a palm against his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Yuri gasped. About 3 seconds later he would be gasping for air. In a snap, the muscular but slim forearm turned his lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He doesn't have anything better to do. That I can assure you, guys!\" Yuri's eyes fluttered as he heard a feminine voice mid-sentence. Still out of it, he couldn't keep his eyes open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him back until, you get us all in trouble, idiot!\" A different voice, not quite as feminine voice, woke up Yuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wha--- Where?\" Yuri asked confused. Yuri's eyes blinking, shaking the webs out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hands on her hips. \"Good job, Makoto. You waked him up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's eyes now focused, knew Makoto.. or at least heard of her. A long yellow headband with slighty ruffled up hair and clothes, she was a tomboy troublemaking delinquent of the school. Her first day, knocking two fellow students out cold. She was the talk of the school for a month. Next to her... Yuri didn't know but she had hair that would definitely make her stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Where Am I!?\" Yuri yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, quiet down, will you?\" The long haired girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I won't quiet down!? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're in school, what's it look like?\" Yuri looked around.... Maybe it was a kind of dumb question. He was in an empty classroom... but that wasn't the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... Why though!? You chocked me out and dragged me here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything, that was this idiot.\" Her leg crossed along her lap, pointed to the other girl in the room. The other girl gave him the 'V sign'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to need to calm down though. You're not getting me into trouble. Ibuki, you better start explaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I was getting to it.\" ...Her name was Ibuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see... Well first off, sorry for knocking you unconscious... but it should've been painless right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, right.\" Ibuki continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been watching you for a couple of weeks now and you don't seem to have all that much going on but I'm sure you're aware of that... So... Me and Makoto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you.\" Makoto cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sure. Thought we'd sit and... have a talk with you today, after school was finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You choked me out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure it was painless.\" Ibuki awkwardly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this was just a sit and chat then why didn't you just ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not my style? Look maybe I did go about it the wrong way but the past is the past.\" Ibuki twiddled her thumbs as Makoto stared at Yuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That story clearly didn't add up. Ibuki wasn't here to talk to him about studying. He wasn't stupid, Makoto is here for a reason. \"...What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well, we know you don't have any after school activities so you are free for the rest of the day... so... we were wondering if you could help the two of us relieve a little... stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...This wasn't the kind of attention, Yuri wanted from the ladies.</span></div></div>",

Take a seat.\" Makoto pointed to the chair behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing her history, Yuri sat back down. \"What... What are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know. Convince you?\" Ibuki also grabbed a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't help out a couple cuties like us?\" Ibuki said with puppy dog eyes... Yuri knew very well how cute the two were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... or won't. Again, I've had my eyes on you. You don't have anywhere to be.\" Ibuki said frankly. It was true but Yuri didn't like hearing it out loud like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\" Yuri answered with attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaargh, this was a waste of time, Ibuki. Let's make sure he doesn't say anything about what happened and we can go train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri gulped. \"M-Make sure, I d-don't say anything!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not stupid. Why wouldn't you report us after everything that happened?\" Makoto asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you weren't... but after walking out the door you might have forgotten to keep quiet.\" Makoto punched into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wawawait! ...Yuri are you sure you don't want to help us out? You'd really rather be alone all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked really... lonely. I thought we'd kinda be helping you out. You rub our backs you have something to actually do after school's out. There's a lot of other guys who wouldn't mind being in your position but they all seemed very... well, annoying. We just wanted somebody who looked quiet and... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki worked her magic. \"Makoto and I would really appreciate it, Yuri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri looked over towards Makoto who still looked menacing blocking the door with her arms folded.</span></div></div>",

Makoto scared him and Ibuki was... cute but she likely was a story too. He didn't mind helping someone with their homework exactly but he had never given anyone a massage before... or have touched a woman in general. Despite all of these thoughts and worries, he slept very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new day. So far, everything was the same. His new schedule will come into play after this last class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri made sure to arrive early to room 204.

Yuri!\" Ibuki with high energy greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you told me you would be here right after school was finished...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I told you, you'd better be here in the first 10 minutes. You're fine, should've grabbed a book or something to pass the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got you there.\" Ibuki added. \"So... ready to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Ibuki. Why don't you actually try doing it yourself. The guy owes me a massage from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I'll wait.\" Ibuki took a seat relaxing... not opening a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I've never given anybody a massage before so---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know ya haven't. No offense, but anyone would guess that by looking at you.\" Makoto insulted as Ibuki covered her mouth, hiding her smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll guide you through it, just don't test my patience or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri couldn't promise that... \"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First my shoulders.\" Makoto pointed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright.\" His hands were clearly shaking as he rested his palms onto her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use a lot of force.\" Yuri did as told. He could feel pure muscle. He knew Makoto was built but he had to wonder what she had to do to actually build this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm. Not so bad for a first timer with a frame of a string bean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" Yuri took the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more pressure and then go lower.\" Yuri rubbed a tad harder and progressively made his way lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaalright.\" Makoto stretched her arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My plan's not seeming so dumb now is it?\" Ibuki watched from her chair at Makoto's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... just the first part really.\" Makoto uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo are you done now, Makoto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\" Makoto thought...</span></div></div>",

Umm... smelling like that?\" Ibuki didn't know any other way to put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri felt a sweat on his forehead start to form. Ibuki asking what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?

The look of annoyance replaced with a look of expectancy. \"Move you chair closer and get started.\" Makoto ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Yuri did as told. Makoto lifted her left foot and placed it between Yuri's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same as you handled the shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Yuri hated the tone of Makoto but he knew he couldn't... or wouldn't do anything about it. After all... this wasn't about getting a head start in a new career in foot massaging, it was about getting friendly with this very aggressive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike instructed, Yuri handled Makoto's foot as he did her shoulders. Like her shoulders, you could feel muscle. Her foot a little dusty from being on the school ground and the size and weight behind it felt like her foot could turn a brick into powder. When she knocked out those guys on her first day, it was no fluke or miracle. This girl was fit, he didn't see how powerful she was up close but now... he could feel it. Speaking of powerful... the scent traveled upwards. Truth be told, it wasn't horrible but it was very much present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri grabbed hold of Makoto's other foot and dropped the other to the ground softly, as she paid very little attention to him. \"...I guess that means I'm doing good.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri looked over at Ibuki who was still relaxing on the teachers desk doing \"The pose\" while on her phone... not even getting started with her homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri continued to rub as he every now and then looked up to see Makoto's face. Every time he looked up her face was the same. Bored and ready for her massage to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that good Makoto?\" Yuri asked getting Makoto's attention as he stopped rubbing but kept hold of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto retracted her foot from Yuri's hands. \"Yeah... you're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough.\" Ibuki got up and dangled her legs off the front of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri toss me your work!\" Yuri began to open his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait , wait, wait... Makoto, toss me his book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki looked at Yuri. \"Do you want your stuff smelling like feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ibuki... he didn't complain once. My feet smell fine... just sweat and hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto... c'mon, we're friends... honestly, your feet smell strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Makoto. The book she's looking for is the blue textbook.\" The conversation was on the friendly side but Yuri still felt he should interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hmph\" Makoto looked into Yuri's backpack and grabbed the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she threw it carelessly to Ibuki across the room. Ibuki caught it with ease but... Yuri always keep his things neat and collected and Makoto threw his book like a Frisbee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good stuff, I'll be done in like a sec, Makoto.\" Ibuki went to grab her textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here, Yuri. I might have a question or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri got up and took his chair with him... she didn't have any questions, just wrote down his notes. When she was done she got up, walked over, and dropped his textbook back into his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Makoto. We're ready to go. Thanks again, Yuri. I know Makoto's thanking you too but I'm sure you can tell the type of girl she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I'm right here.\" Makoto got up, still barefoot, her socks tucked into her shoes as she carried them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're going to get us in trouble, if you get caught, Makoto.\" Ibuki awkwardly smiled seeing that Makoto wasn't putting her shoes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you could just poof away.\" Makoto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... heh heh heeeh.\" Ibuki awkwardly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Poof?\" Yuri asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah. We'll see you again tomorrow right, Yuri?\" Ibuki ignored Yuri's confusion and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sure, I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Thanks, Yuri.\" Ibuki got up and held the classroom door open for Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then...\" Ibuki waved as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad massage, Yuri. Later.\" Makoto raised her left hand, her way of saying bye. Yuri's eyes catching her long toned legs walk out, bare feet naturally lifting off the ground. Yuri didn't dare look at her legs in the classroom but they were nice... very nice. They, like the rest of her body, were toned but somehow not reducing their femininity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking everything in for a second, Yuri finally got up. He was going to go home... but before that he went to the bathroom to rinse his hands. He didn't want anyone asking any questions. Yuri wrapped up the day by gaming for a while, until he got sleepy and then got ready for bed...</span></div></div>",

A sincere apology.\" Ibuki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena opened the classroom door and Ibuki and Makoto followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri... They have something to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki went first. \"I'm sorry for what happened, I obviously shouldn't have hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I'm sorry for threatening you, I wasn't actually going to kill you or anything.\" Makoto said with her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Yuri replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else girls?\" Elena wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... You don't have to hand over your homework anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you don't need to massage me back anymore either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled. \"You can leave if you want, Yuri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can?\" Yuri questioned what was going on. At this point he didn't have any reason to not trust Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena still with her warm and welcoming smile on her face said. \"The winds tell me you don't want to... but no one will stop you.\"</span></div></div>",

Makoto, can you give us a second alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, sure thing. Let's go, Makoto.\" Ibuki left first and Makoto shut the door behind her. Ibuki wasn't worried at all, she read the mood and she was sure Makoto saw what she saw in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall white-haired beauty brought her long legs to her chest, her feet on the edge of her chair. \"Thank you for being honest, and now, I'll be honest. I think you have all the early signs of being a good servant. Maybe the tongue bath was too soon, but I don't think you'd hate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena lifting her left foot and placed it directly in front of Yuri, her toes lining up with his eyes. \"They aren't too dirty, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri looked into Elena's sole. So delicate, the contrast of her dark skin. She had beautiful feet no doubt. Servant or not, anybody would agree... but licking it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're no too bad th---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena put her foot back onto her chair. \"Okay... I just thought I'd try it. Please, let's put this behind us then, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave for today, we'll see you tomorrow, it really was nice meeting you. There's so many interesting people in this school.\" Elena smiled and left while Yuri sat still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the classroom, Ibuki and Makoto smiled at Elena and she gave a knowing smile back.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know if he should open the door or just go home. The girls made him feel... award, at times but... he didn't hate them, especially Elena. He waited outside the room for about 5 minutes before opening the door and entering with his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yuri.\" Elena was the first to greet him. Yuri just gave a little wave. Ibuki and Makoto paid him no attention as he took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri looked around, Makoto and Elena were talking about something and were barefoot. This would likely be a common sight, Ibuki was just relaxing, laying across the teacher's desk as usual, dangling her shoe while tapping on her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while. \"Yuri, may I borrow your notes... to uh... copy?\" Ibuki asked nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Um, sure.\" and handed her this week's homework papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri continued to awkwardly sit alone whilst, Ibuki copied his notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's eyes continued to drift, he noticed Makoto acting fidgety. She brought her foot upon her lap and started to rub it, while she kept eye contact with Elena. A small part of him, felt for her. The macho man, side of him wanted to offer a foot massage... but this was Makoto. He didn't say anything but Makoto did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Yuri. I-If you d-don't mind, could you give me a foot massage before we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto!\" Elena gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been through this, Yuri isn't comfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah... alright.\" Makoto brought her other foot onto the chair and crossed them Indian style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't mind giving her a massage, just nothing... too much.\" Yuri spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena gave a caring smile. \"Are you sure, Yuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Elena... thanks.\" Yuri smiled back. He couldn't help it; Elena's smile could kill any rainy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena got up \"I'll get out of your way then. Ibuki. let's talk about Japanese fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm learning, over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what you're doing, would be 'learning'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, I'm taking the information in... some of it will stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri got up and sat in Elena's chair in front of Makoto. Makoto mumbled \"Th-Thanks.\" and lifted her right foot onto Yuri's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri began to knead her sole. He had forgotten how tough her feet were, somehow, soft and delicate, but you could tell she could use it to crush a brick... and probably has. Seems like a challenge that's right up her alley. Yuri took his time massaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Process recovered.\" Ibuki told Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, getting back to where you where is the easy part though, Ibuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I imagine. Foot massages are somewhat normal. Do you actually have a plan, Elena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ibuki. The plan is to let nature run its course.\" Elena gleefully smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the massage progressed in the background, Elena pulled out a magazine. \"Now... About these skirts, do you where spats underneath?\"</span></div></div>",

He kneaded a little while longer before asking Makoto. \"Am I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDry out of 'thank you's' Makoto nodded and removed her foot from his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stretched her legs out. \"I got what I came for.

I will never understand it. A little sweat and a slight smell and they lose there charm... and manners.\" Elena frowned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri looked up at Elena again. \"And I'm different from them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Of course, Yuri.\" Elena smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like feet.\" Yuri said, offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying you are, Yuri... but no one here would care if you did.\" Yuri stopped rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't be like that. If you don't like them... I get it, I don't think they're unattractive but... as long as you rub them...\" Elena looked towards the ground beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try that, I never said you weren't attractive... it's just not a kink of mine.\" Yuri started to rub again, and Elena crossed her foot over her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty much objective... Her feet were pretty. Yuri liked her legs... and everything else about Elena but he felt uncomfortable with Elena's assumptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri finished her upper and lower thigh and moved into her foot. \"Th-They're not too sweaty or smelly Elena... they kinda smell like cocoa butter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it came Ibuki recommended. She said I'd like it, and I did!\" Ibuki gave Elena a thumbs up whilst on her cellphone. She could hear from all the way over there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri continued until he was done, and Elena lifted her other foot until her toes were below his nostrils. He stared through her toes to see Elena with an expecting look on her face. He took her foot and began yet again with the scent of cocoa butter through his nose.</span></div></div>",

He took his time, if he were to do something it wouldn't be half-assed... even if it were a foot massage. Elena had a look of complete relaxation; he could tell she was enjoying the work he was putting in and it honestly did make him feel a little bit better. The tall white-haired beauty taking it easy, made it easier to do the task. About 5 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Yuri. That really was wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Elena.\" Yuri smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ibuki, is there a reason you don't take advantage of our friends' generosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to be the nice one here? You know I train wearing these shoes before coming here. My toes won't smell like cocoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite weird of you to do, now that you mention it. Your ninja suit doesn't have shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That suits for business only. My school uniform is staying on during school days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena giggled. \"Your washing machine must hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A necessary evil, anyways Yuri might be kind enough to deal with Makoto's funk but not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a gentleman, Ibuki. A nice one.\" Elena smiled at Yuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Umm, if you're hurting after practice, Ibuki... it wouldn't kill me to give you a massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki sighed. \"Are you sure about this, Yuri? ...I really am sorry for what happened between us before, I don't wanna pressure you or anything, I survived without a massage for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was now standing up, he nodded, and sat back down in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki took the seat in front of him just as Makoto and Elena had. Ibuki pulled her right shoe off and you could instantly smell her feet. Yuri hadn't seen Ibuki train but this smell... gave him a good idea of how hard and long she did. Next Ibuki slid her sock off, revealing her pale moist foot. Like Makoto's foot, there was no polish and it was quite muscular but not as much as Makoto's. It was more petite looking. All three women had attractive feet... mysterious considering how often they trained and went barefoot. Maybe not 'mysterious' exactly but it made Yuri wonder... how. Quickly regaining his attention has the smell. Ibuki wasn't kidding... but he meant what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki frowned, grabbing her shoes and socks. \"See... I told you. Thanks anyway, Yuri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Where are you going?\" Yuri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri... My feet are rank... and this room is going to be too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The room is fine, Ibuki.\" Elena smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine too, Ibuki.\" Yuri said still sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine!\" Ibuki sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... toes are what's hurtin, I see how you handle Makoto... please don't be too rough.\" With that, Yuri picked up Ibuki's left foot and pulled at her toes as he made his way down. As time went on, he noticed the smell less and less. It was tolerable. Yuri softly rubbed the sides of her arch and then paid more attention to her toes again and did the same to her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... felt amazing. Thank you, Yuri.\" Ibuki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome... A-Anytime.\" Yuri instantly regretted that last part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Elena you're right. He is a gentleman.\" Yuri blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well. I'm out for today.\" Ibuki announced as she stood up with her shoes in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena stood up too. \"I'll join you; we can walk together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki waved with a smile. \"We'll see ya later, Yuri.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri returned her smile with one of his own and waved back...</span></div></div>",

He was about to leave until... \"...Cherry blossoms?\" Yuri sniffed his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and cocoa butter.\" The scents smelled amazing together. Expecting his palms to smell like feet, it was surprising. Yuri continued to sniff, always being a lover of the smell of cherry blossoms. The scent of cocoa butter was new to him, but it was pleasant as well. The sniffs turned into straight up smelling; Yuri's mind was somewhere else. He looked like a guy in a fabric softener advertisement. It would be a bit embarrassing but the next time they met he just had to ask her what lotion she used. Just as he was about finished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri heard footsteps. \"Hey, Yuri... forgot my backpack full of stuff.\" Before she talked, Yuri awkwardly got himself together. It was Ibuki... if she saw, then there would be no mistaking what she would have seen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why're you still in here alone?\" Ibuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, I don't know... was just about to leave. Was... relaxing, I-I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did look pretty relaxed...\" Ibuki said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was slack jawed. She saw... \"...It wasn't what you thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just... the smell of the lotion you were using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah?\" Ibuki wasn't having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it isn't what you think it was. I told you, I don't like feet! How did you get in here without a sound anyway? Did you use a ninja technique or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ninja technique? I didn't force you to sniff up my lotion, Yuri... Why are you mad at me? Sorry for forgetting my backpack, I can be forgetful... which is why I suck at homework.\" Ibuki frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri exhaled. \"...I'm... sorry. You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the brightest in a class... but I'm also not the dumbest.\" Ibuki said with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Yuri knew what that meant. He knew she wouldn't believe him and he also knew she wasn't dumb enough to believe him but what else was he going to say to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki looked down on Yuri reading his thoughts, enjoying his mental freakout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Ibuki did use a 'ninja technique' a ninja technique called 'stealth'. She quietly opened up the door, lots of practice sneaking into classrooms a bit late, and made sure her feet made just enough noise for Yuri to hear upon entering. She trusted Elena's insight and was planning on quietly peeking on Yuri every day. She didn't expect it to be this soon. Elena's insight strikes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki grabbed her backpack but before leaving she placed her hand on his shoulder. \"Hey Yuri...\"</span></div></div>",

Cherry Blossoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki giggled. \"The lotion isn't cheap, my shoes better smell like flowers.\" Ibuki brought her shoe back to his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a sock in the toe, that can't smell all that great... but then again, you never whined about Makoto's feet maybe you got used to it... or maaaaybe.\" She was going in that direction yet again. This time Yuri, didn't care enough to argue with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Ibuki completely let go of her neckhold. \"If you like this then maybe you'd also enjoy tonguing Elena's soles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they taste as good as cherry blossoms smell?\" Yuri tried to shut down Ibuki's attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they do to you.\" Ibuki tickled his ear as you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Yuri tried to ignore her as he kept sniffing Ibuki's insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to come here tomorrow and I'm going to tell Elena you're willing to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again... sometimes we just need a little push.\" Ibuki said removing her shoe. She removed her shoe and the sock within it and took a tiny sample whiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki squinted her nose. \"Cherry blossoms, huh? Definitely not the only thing I'm picking up... I'll see you tomorrow, Yuri.\"  She picked her backpack back up off of the ground and made her exit, while Yuri quickly realized the embarrassing moment they just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono!\" Yuri internally screamed.</span></div></div>",

He hated that he didn't mind being in that position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was being in the arms of a... very cute girl. Her touching me... Alone.\" Yuri thought to himself as he walked to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived and went to his usual classes... it was a little harder to concentrate than usual. The smell of cherry blossoms still on his nose which triggered the very fresh memory of yesterday. These classes dragged on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bell of the day rang as Yuri quickly got out of his seat and to the bathroom. Yuri splashed some cold water onto his face before exiting and slowly making his way to the clubroom. The door was unlocked but he was the first to arrive, Yuri's heart started pounding just a tad faster as he patiently waited for anyone else to join him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about three to five minutes the clubroom's doorknob turned. In came, Makoto. \"Where are the other two?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, they're not here yet.\" Yuri answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a little annoyed. \"I keep forgetting that you're supposed to be smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know why they're late, Makoto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto began to take her shoes and socks off as Yuri's eyes looked on. \"Whelp, I guess they aren't really needed, are they?\" Makoto walked toward Yuri and onto a chair. She then placed a mat down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto crossed her right ankle on her left knee. \"You know the deal... I even got you a soft little mat for your knees from another club. I don't think they'll miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri got down in front of her bared foot. No idea how her feet constantly smelled and he absolutely wasn't going to bring it up anytime soon... it still didn't bother him too much... It certainly didn't make him feel the same as Ibuki's feet. That means he didn't have a kink... right? Yuri thought to himself before taking hold of Makoto's foot. He started rubbing her sole as he has done so before and then... Yuri remember the intensity, what Ibuki did to him. He had to be certain, he had to try and emulate what happened yesterday. Whilst rubbing her foot, Yuri very quietly opened up his nostrils taking in the smell of Makoto's foot. The smell of pure sweat. Her feet smelled similar to what Yuri imagined an athlete would smell like after a game, before the shower. After minutes of rubbing her sweaty feet, Yuri convincingly got his answer... He didn't like feet. It was the lotion after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after he finished the massage, Ibuki and Elena walked in. \"Sorry, we're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto got up out of her chair. \"Well, seems like you have someone else to look after you. I think I'll go home a bit early today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki gasped. \"We just got here, and you want to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll see you tomorrow, Ibuki. I guess... I'll give you a call later or something.\" Ibuki smiled. She loved seeing the cute side of her ruff rounded friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto made her way to the door, ready to leave but stopped. \"Oh, and by the way our new friend was sniffing my feet the entire time he rubbed them... Later girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's mouth could have hit the floor and Elena giggled. His chances of convincing these two that he didn't have a kink closed with the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like feet huh, Yuri?\" Ibuki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was still kneeling on the mat; Makoto had given him. How could he be so stupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... just... had to know.\" Yuri muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto has the rankest feet in the school. I couldn't believe you'd rub her feet let alone go in for a whiff...\" Ibuki said with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead talk your way out of this one, please.\" Ibuki asked gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri couldn't stand to look at Elena or Ibuki, once again he choose to look towards the ground. \"I had to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they smelled like? Know, what?\" Ibuki interrupted him and laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Yuri... Did they not... smell like cherry blossoms?\" Ibuki teased and continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough please. Look at him, this isn't what we wanted.\" Elena finally stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto is a dear friend but our commonsense tells us that if he still isn't convinced of who he is then nothing will convince him... because her feet are indeed very smelly.\" The last line caused Yuri to further blush with his head in his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri, look at me.\" Elena asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena got into the chair in front of Yuri and begun to remove her socks and shoes, airing out her long, smooth, looking feet. \"They're yours for today. Do whatever you want.\" Yuri finally looked up to see both her legs crossed and a perfect smile across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena rubbed her legs together. \"I think you might prefer cocoa butter over aged cheese, Yuri.\"</span></div></div>",

Both Elena and Ibuki stayed quiet and just watched on while he did his thing. Yuri paid close attention to her beautiful brown soles for the majority of the massage and every time Elena would wiggle her toes a bit he would notice. The warm feeling he had with Ibuki the day before came back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri...\" Elena called out but Yuri didn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri.\" Elena called out a bit louder the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you like my feet or not but... look down.\" Elena's toes pointed downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...There was an obvious tent. In front of these two girls, the shame hit him like a truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri quickly got up and was going to run away... but Elena grabbed his wrist before he could dart to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't here to embarrass you, Yuri. Do you still not trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do--- I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend might be giggling but that's because like you... she's also confused. You have two beautiful schoolmates with you and you have an erection. You want to run away? Why, Yuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, Yuri. C'mon.\" Ibuki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Yuri sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it isn't feet, Yuri.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki continued. \"Maybe you like the two cuties in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena added. \"Serving us, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki leaned over Elena's shoulder. \"The teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena extended her foot in front of Yuri's face and gave him a cute and innocent smile that he could barely see. \"Just give it a try. If you don't like it, we'll stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri stared into the sole of Elena's foot for a couple of seconds... In a rush of lust, Yuri started lapping at her foot sloppily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time.\" Ibuki exhaled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena signaled to Ibuki. \"Shh, quiet friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri still focused on the sole of her foot. Elena wiggled her toes, Yuri noticed and blushed. Elena brought up her other foot and Yuri's tongue gave it attention too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's tongue made its way all over both of Elena's tan soles but avoided her toes. Elena wouldn't dare complain, there was always later. After 10 minutes of service Elena dropped her feet to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki ruffled Yuri's hair. \"Not so disgusting, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri didn't reply. \"The shyness will go away soon, Yuri. You were clearly indulging yourself.\" Ibuki told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Yuri.\" Elena smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're welcome, Elena.\" Yuri uttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me? Did you like it, Yuri? My feet?\" Elena asked whilst putting on her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did you like it?\" Yuri answered with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena gave him a genuine smile. He had some puppy dog eyes. \"I loved it, Yuri.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed. \"Then... it was fine, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a big man to admit that, Yuri. We'll see you tomorrow.\" Elena slipped her shoes on and met Ibuki at the door to the clubroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki opened the door and Elena followed her out. \"Thanks for the help, Elena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to mention it, I feel energized after a foot bath. He'll only get better over time.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our very own, foot boy. I can't believe it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was gonna be a blast, she couldn't wait to see Makoto's reaction.</span></div></div>",

You're up to no good.\" Makoto began to walk along side Ibuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaa... nah.\" Was Ibuki's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept walking until they got to their clubroom. \"Hey... Makoto, before I open this door. Elena asked me to not freak out... kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto just stared at her friend, deadpan.

Makoto mumbled, \"...Loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri didn't react, he wasn't listening... He was licking up the soles of Elena's feet. Elena waved towards her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean, I can stop being nice to him?\" Makoto asked Ibuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ruin it for the rest of us, Makoto.

Her face was unlike the one she had during their spars. Both expressed enjoyment but still very much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Elena and Ibuki was right about you the entire time, huh? This entire time---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri cut Makoto off, still holding Elena foot in his hands. \"Makoto before you continue... yeah. I know. I know what you want to tell me. I could say... I'm sorry but... I don't know if I am. I don't know what is... happening but still... I know. I don't blame you for thinking less of me. I would in your position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stared blankly at Yuri. His honesty confusing the young fighter a bit. She then crossed in arms in an act of defiance. \"Pfft, whatever... As long as you get that liking a girls smelly feet is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Makoto. I... don't like the smell of your feet.\" Yuri confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Makoto asked, even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri will sniff up <i>our</i> feet. Your feet reek girl, I offered you some scented oils and lotions. A trip to the mall but, yooou ignooored meeee.\" Ibuki added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ask you, Ibuki?\" Makoto was legit angry... but even she didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto... I don't mind the smell of your feet, but I don't <i>like</i> the smell. Take off your shoes and socks and I'll rub your feet like always after I'm... done with Elena.\" Elena gave him a smile but Makoto, still peeved, did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like her feet but not mine?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri attempted to calm down Makoto. \"I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smell of pretty flowers, girly stuff but not what a girl actually smells like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Why are you this a-angry?\" Yuri stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain... she didn't know either. Again... she was confused. \"...Hurry up and keep licking the girls feet... I want my massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki knew when she was like this it would be unwise to laugh... and she really wanted to. Makoto was a hard as steel tomboy but some times she was just... so unbelievably cute... in Ibuki's eyes anyways, Yuri looked like a scolded puppy.</span></div></div>",

Though not one to ever underestimate any challenger that came his way... he never would\u2019ve thought he would find himself in a situation like this one. Ryu was hunched over on one knee trying to catch his breath... this challenger he has never met before until now was good... very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryu was trying to regain the strength in his legs he quickly looked up toward the sky to see an incoming dive kick... but not just any dive kick, her foot encompassed with what looked to be some kind of purple energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Craaack</b></i> Quickly scurrying out of harm's way, Ryu evaded the attack which easily destroyed the street pavement beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaa!\u201d The woman came out of the shadows and into the streetlights laughing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was up in a way that made both of her bangs look like black horns. She was wearing baggy, white colored pants and purple tights, with long, fingerless gloves complete with a dudou that formed a spider like look. Fingers and toes look to have a fresh coat of pink paint... she didn\u2019t look like a traditional fighter but judging from her kicks, attire, and the way she moved, Ryu guessed she had to be some form of a student of Taekwondo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on... You're not done already, are you? Aren't you supposed to be... powerful? You are Ryu, right?\u201d Juri asked, looking at the exhausted Ryu. Ryu was still struggling to stand; he was hurt and the threat in front of him knew it as well as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho... are you?\u201d Ryu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walked over closer to Ryu and slowly raised her leg high above her head. An evil smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Name\u2019s Juri.\u201d Just as she gave her name, a lightening quick kick struck Ryu right in the middle of his skull. The second time within the short span of 10 minutes Ryu was in complete shock. He knew her strike was coming... but he still couldn\u2019t block it. Has he unknowingly grown weaker or was this woman just too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn was this disappointing, I\u2019ve heard so much about you. Man... If only you were as half as powerful...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri sniffed the air \u201cas that scent you got going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu grunted and attempted to shake out the stars in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut believe me... for wasting my time, you will make up for it...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryu tried to gather himself again, stumbling onto both feet \u201c...Until I break you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Whap</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu\u2019s lights were out as Juri hit him with a roundhouse kick to the gut.

Juri removed her right foot from Ryu\u2019s broken hand and raised her left to move the foot wrap around her arch out of the way and did the same for the right foot. She then placed her now completely bared foot in front of Ryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked up towards Juri in another attempt to read her, what he saw was no smirk, no blinking, just a look of pure and utter dominance.

Eno--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see these toes of mine?\u201d Juri interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ignoring them on purpose?\u201d Juri questioned, enjoying the turmoil of the once proud fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...N-No.\u201d Ryu answered with his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d Ryu looked up into Juri\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss each and every one of my toes, if I don\u2019t feel your lips on every one of them... for every toe I don\u2019t feel the right amount of enthusiasm, that\u2019s one finger you\u2019re going to be missing.\u201d Juri threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you understand, right? Don\u2019t answer, get to it.\u201d And he did as told not wasting any time. Ryu gave a soft peck to each toe and held each kiss for about 3 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But did Ryu do a good enough job?</span></div></div>",

Only a matter of time you broke until I tracked down your buddies and only a matter of time until you gave in to hours of my torture. If it makes you feel better, I would of found them and got them where I wanted and you lasted longer than a lot of others in your position have.\" This didn't make Ryu feel better. What he was about to do, is irremediable. It didn't matter the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But before you give me all the intel I need, I need you to show me you're willing to work with me without violence being involved. Can't go crushing your face for every new detail can I? I mean I can... but I'm willing to give you a 2nd chance to corporate with me.\" Ryu didn't like where this was going... has he not suffered enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri flopped on Ryu's midsection, making herself comfortable. His midsection still weak from Juri's constant abuse, her simple flop caused shocks down to his abs down to his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri teased Ryu's chin with her purple toes \"Now comes the really fun part...\"</span></div></div>",

You being a naughty stubborn boy convinced me that you should keep my shoes for a while, which caused me to walk barefoot in this weirdly dirty ass lab.

Ryu has learned this lady loves to hear herself talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing how it was your fault... clean my feet.

Immediately he withdrew his tongue in reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've run down my patience, get that tongue moving or else.\" Juri threatened Ryu. Knowing she would Ryu tried to get back at it slowly dragging his tongue across the middle of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry the Hell up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu dragged his tongue against the sole of her foot even faster, putting his ego aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the heel dumbass... you still have another foot to go. If you're not done within 15 minutes then I'm going to leave again... but not before stomping the shit out of you.\" Again Ryu picked up the pace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The taste of dirt in general ran throughout Ryu's mouth but of course it was so much of the taste that hurt... it was the act. How low he has fallen in such a short time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes of footlicking Juri inspected his work \"Hmmm decent enough, I wouldn't expect anything more from someone as pathetic as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up wide.\" Ryu was quicker to follow this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to do my toes next, you have about 5 minutes left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri stuffed her left toes into the open mouth of Ryu \"Start sucking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the dirt and sweat here made it seem like licking the rest of her foot seem easy. Ryu sucked as ordered, for the next 5 minutes he made sure to cover every toe. The embarrassment was crippling but why would he put himself doing it again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a popping sound Juri removed her toes from Ryu's mouth \"Not bad for a first timer. Not bad at all, I was going to stomp your lights out anyway but you've convinced me otherwise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Juri stood up \"You see how easy that was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" A silent defeated Ryu had nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was easy right?\" Juri asked again expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Juri.\" Ryu droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done with all that macho facade shit now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Juri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, gooood.\" At this moment Juri knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri smiled down towards Ryu \"Hey Ryu... kiss my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu placed a soft kiss on both shiny, slick, wet soles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri's eye lit up as she returned her feet into her heels \"Peeerfect.\"</span></div></div>",

A huge weird looking dome. She had no idea where this woman had taken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" Juri gestured to the giant doors. Chun Li was curious, now she had to know what it looked like inside. It was dark, it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're with SIN!?\" Chun Li entered her fight stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ms. Officer. I said we are having a conversation. Follow me.\" Juri walked and Chun Li followed. Chun followed until Juri opened a door to what looked like a science lab... evil science lab. Ryu was sitting quietly by himself at a table, a rectangular metallic table with two long benches for seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me!\" Chun Li asked as Juri took a seat by Ryu at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryu, beat it while me and your former friend talk it out.\" Ryu robotically got up a walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li couldn't help but pity the sight... even after he betrayed her. \"What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri dangled her foot. \"Stepped on his pride. Helped him realize all he was good for was losing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, just like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now. Don't be stupid. You're not like him and you know it.

I'm nothing like you. I would never work for SIN; I am an Interpol officer!\" Chun Li got up out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri also got up from her seat to stand behind the angry Chun Li. \"I'm not particularly with SIN... This is just a place with a bed and a man to entertain. I've read your files... the one's Ryu gave me. I know who you are...\" Juri placed her hands on Chun's shoulders easing her back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're a badass.\" Juri didn't remove her hands. She started to give her a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri whispered into the ear of Chun Li. \"All that rescue work must be tiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, a badass like you would never get physically tired, oh no... You must get tired of the same old shit. Today's fight... I could see it in you. That Ryu... held back and paid dearly for it. I know damn well he was capable of more and yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri stopped the massage and joined Chun on the bench. Juri laid her right foot across the lap of Chun Li. \"You actually gave me your all... and you enjoyed it, having someone of my level to fight. You want to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri continued to whisper in her ear. \"You know I'm right. You can fight Ryu... You can fight me again... I can even get you someone blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Chun Li's attention. \"Blue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri smugly smiled. The reaction told her that Chun knew who she was referring to. \"He's nothing but my prey, he just doesn't know it... He can be our prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li stayed quiet in thought processing all that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like our conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I didn't and I don't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri laughed. \"That was my best impression of being a good host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where is Ryu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dragonboy, get your ass in here!\" Juri yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting just outside the room, Ryu opened the door. Chun Li got up and attempted to look him in the eye but Ryu kept his head towards the ground. Out of nowhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Whap</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li jacked Ryu hard in the jaw bringing him to his knees, palms over his mouth. \"You better not be lying, Juri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri pleased, leaned on her shoulder looking down at Ryu...</span></div></div>",

Hooome.\" He whined out loud to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man continued his groaning. \"Still a while to go. I should've checked the weather app before heading out in this dry sweaty Hell... At least no flying rat's are shitting on me this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to walk, he became more and more sweaty and sticky. The rays of sunlight draining his already low stamina. He continued to walk until he felt a very pleasant breeze come from a small shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ms. M's Fortunes, huh? ...Alright, if I'm going to sit down it's going to at least be a place that can afford some air conditioning.\" He thought to himself as he walked toward the building with a cute sign featuring a black kitty and a blue orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long hallway with lights that lead to a dark circular room. \"...Hello? Is anyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! A... customer?\" A cute voice could be heard in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the right side of the room the black curtain blending into the room slid open revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful young dark skinned woman wearing very... unique clothing. Unique and expensive looking, a lot of dark purple &amp; gold, head to toe, complete with a beautiful purple sash that both, laid across her shoulders and made for a very short skirt. Clearly Egyptian styled. Walking around wearing in attire like that must of been... comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck by this beauty, he stuttered. \"Ummm, H-Hello there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to get your fortune told? That'll be $50, please.\" Ms. M took a seat in front of a blue orb on a table in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft... $50.\" The young man couldn't help but smirk a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, trust me. You won't be disappointed.\" Ms. M ignored the rude gesture and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ms... M. I didn't come here to get some... $50 fortune. I just wanted to look around a bit.\" The young man forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. M is just a shop name, please, my name is Menat.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Menat. You have a beautiful shop here... and nice cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it's quite nice actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn attempt not to make things awkward as he used her shop to relax. \"...How's business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, to be honest... quite poor here in America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... why's that?\" The young man knew why but decided to ask anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeant smile was replaced with a frown. \"People over here... think this is some kind of fraud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... actually blame them? Wait... you think what you do is real?\" David stifled a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat made a cute, but serious, pouty face. \"Seeing how my master has been doing this her whole life among other reasons, yeah. I'd say I do. It's easy to not believe in something you haven't tried because you're too cheap.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Have you tried maybe... lowering the price?\" David suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cheap if anything. It's one fortune.\" Menat was getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not trying to offend, it's just that... it's not possible and is fake.\" David grabbed the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat stood up. \"You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... very.\" The young man kept sitting in the cushioned chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're sure... Davie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100% sure... Wait... How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat rubbed the orb in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think I'll be leaving now.\" David said flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize!\" Menat raised her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you!\" Menat yelled as David continued to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat pressed both of her palms to the mystical orb. \"If you thought me finding out your name was creepy then you're going to really be surprised, very soon...\"</span></div></div>",

So many thoughts entered his head about what he was going to do tomorrow. His panic soon drifted away as he passed out, his table's place mat substituting as a bedroom pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn David's dream was the sound of crackling thunder, the same thunder from his first visit. David would mindlessly wonder the streets, he was so cold... and out of nowhere, there she was. The cute dark skinned girl who was soaked just like he was. While David was moody and walked through the storm with a slightly hunched over back... she walked as if it was completely normal to her. David stood still in awe as the young lady made walked closer and closer to him, her mostly bared feet making ripples in the puddles beneath her. She stopped when she was directly in front of him and placed both her hands onto her hips, looking up at David as David looked down at her. Menat had a look as if she was waiting for something... before David knew it, similar to real life, he couldn't stop himself from taking a knee. When one knee touched the ground, soon the other proceeded. Menat smiled and as she did... the thunderstorm stopped roaring and was replaced, unrealistically quick, with a bright sun. Still very much wet, water slowly dripped off of her purple bangs as she slowly slid her thumbs into her skirt and sensually let it drop to her ankles, as she began to turn around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Beep Beep Beep</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly punched his alarm clock so hard it stopped working. He was sweaty... more so than usual that is. \"The dream... was so freaking real.\" He thought to himself as he got up from his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid proceeded to get dressed... but had nowhere to go. He didn't have a job...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You will beg your friends, family, anyone you know. You will lie and say you need gas\"</i> ...He didn't have anyone to lie to. No friends or family to beg. His only family passed away years ago and that's how he was getting along in life... the money he left him. They didn't ever get along but just enough to get into his will. Slowly, he was running dry, trying to avoid buying anything unnecessary. The little amount of money he made on the internet wasn't going to be enough. Nowhere near enough... He pissed off some girl, yet another mistake to add to the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You will find a job and use that to give me the $50\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... just find a job!\" David kicked the remains of his already broken alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime would pass and David would do nothing but worry... He picked up $40 from the ground and decided to get some Chinese food for dinner before making his visit to Ms. M's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David arrived Menat was sitting and ready with a smug smile. \"Did you pick me up an eggroll, Davie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... no?\" David answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat got out of her seat and pulled down her skirt just a bit to tease David. \"Not much of a gentleman, are you? Let's hope this humbles you.\" Menat pulled her skirt down a bit more and bent over. You could still see her annoying smirk past her beautiful ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless, David walked over to Menat and planted a soft kiss on her left cheek. \"Keep your lips on my butt as you hand me what's mine.\" David did as told, his arm reaching out, handing her $40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fortune telling was never wrong... in her hands were 2 $20 bills. \"Davie... I even had you repeat.\" Menat acted surprised but she already knew this was coming. Now for his excuse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Menat...\" David mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat crumbled the bills in her palm and cutely stomped her foot to the ground. \"Goddess Menat!\" She corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess... Menat... I can't give you $50 a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you get home, you will send out some applicat---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been sending out applications for months now.\" David interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat cleared her throat. \"Do not, interrupt your goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held his face in his palms. He legitimately looked troubled... Menat wasn't evil. Menat rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really pathetic Davie, you know that right?\" Menat said standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\" He replied honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with you?\" Menat asked herself.</span></div></div>",

David got out of his chair and lifted the red velvet covers on the table off of the ground as he slid under. It was pitch black, it was already dark in the room but being under the table, as the cloth behind him touched the ground he was enveloped by the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... follow my voice, Davie.\" Menats voice came from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table seemed to have much more room than he'd thought it had.

Menat giggled. \"So warm, move foreword just a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as told again and bumped into the object but this time didn't flinch... it wasn't until he felt something tap against his temple that he had released what he collided with. It was the bared foot of the fortune teller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat giggled again. \"Your little nose is tickling my foot, are you shivering down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid did not care for the position he found himself in, his face resting against the sole of his new nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I think I know a way to cool yourself down. Go ahead and kiss my foot a little bit.\" Menat laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid backed himself up. \"No way in Hell, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Now, now. Don't be like that, Davie. You know there are worse things you could be doing than kissing a cuties feet. This isn't up for some kind of discussion. You'll need to earn my pity. My feet aren't stinky or sweaty, get your face back there and give them a nice little smooch and you'll get out of paying what you owe me.\" In the darkness, Menat propped her right foot upwards using her left foot's toes as she waited...</span></div></div>",

Dans training. Do you actually think I have just been sitting down sipping the finest teas as you trained?\" Karin looked slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, actually. That palm thrust was lazily thrown, if you don't be more careful you might really hurt the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr...\" Karin wasn't the type to take such an insult lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin arms eased to her side. \"You think you're a better fighter than me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do. We're buddies Karin but... let's be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... You seem so very sure. How about a bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever you want Karin. What's the bet?\" Sakura answered quickly, in her zone and ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin smirked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I win...\"</span></div></div>",

How?!\" Sakura thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin waiting directly below her, spreading her legs slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hou... Shoooou!\" As Sakura came down, Karins palm went up into her abdomen. A crushing blow that took any and all air out of her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph! After all this time as rivals... You didn't learn to take me seriously at all times <b>and</b> never question my fighting ability.\" Sakura's forehead was on the Japanese street as she held onto her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

Absorbing the puddle into the rag and wringing it out into the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she cleaned up, Sakura eyes often looked forward. What she saw were the soles of Karin's most likely absurdly expensive heeled shoes. Sakura's mind wondered off... wearing shoe's like those. They must be comfortable, wearing them in her battles it only makes sense. The way Karin moves in heels... she moves with a certain grace, with ease.

I've got them covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned. Did Karin think all of this through? \"I guess staying here won't be... too bad though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura went inside what looked better than any hotel on the planet as she waited for further directions...</span></div></div>",

White accents with a redish wallpaper. The room looked to almost match up with Karin's usual attire in a way. Sakura never would have imagined a maid's room would be this spacious. Spacious enough to have a king sized bed, end-table, a glass coffee table, and some chairs. Everything within the room was nicely put together, showing off everything without looking too crowded or too spacious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stretched her arms into the sky and kicked off her shoes.

Karin sat crosslegged as she tapped away on her phone. A phone that very likely wasn't available in stores yet. It wasn't any model she's ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura waited for Karin to look up before... \"Umm, Mistress Karin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time, maid. Are you ready for today's duties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab my chair and follow me.\" Sakura grabbed her chair, making sure it didn't drag against the ground and follow Karin to a new part of the estate she hasn't yet seen. As they walked, Sakura noticed they scenery change. They kept walking until they both reached the pool. As anyone would expect it was very large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, you're on pool cleaning. Set up my chair in front of the pool.\" Sakura did as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More to the left, Sakura.\" Sakura picked up the chair but her first instinct was to just push it over to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hmm. Never mind, move it back where it was\" Sakura wanted to give a stink eye but kept her head down and moved the not so light chair where it originally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that good?\" Sakura started to sweat. The walk carrying a chair in this weather was a tiny workout in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You'll find everything you need in the shed.\" Karin sat on her chair and crossed her legs and pulled out her phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do a good enough job and maybe I'll let you have a dip after your shift.\" Sakura did have the desire to do a cannonball into a pool of this magnitude. Sakura walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? I offered you a swim in <i>my</i> pool and you... walk off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mistress Karin.

She wondered if the pay for the usual staff was well. She didn't see Karin not paying the people around her handsomely for everything they do. After those thoughts tired out her eyes drifted towards Karin who was still lounging. A beautiful and simple dress that wonderfully complimented her. Sakura wasn't used to seeing Karin dress this formally. Her long legs bare. No long spats... no socks. All that lean muscle being shown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she always this...\" Sakura spent about an hour making sure the pool in front of her was clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we finished?\" Karin asked snapping Sakura out of her daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I did a good enough job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took a little too long but it's clean enough for now.

She had no idea why this was so difficult for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura undid the buckle and slowly lifted the shoe off of her bare foot. Her foot was... perfect, which made sense. Her wardrobe, her hair, her estate, everything was to her standard. It all seemed to come so easily to her but Sakura knew better. Karin was constantly busy juggling various tasks just like her maids. One of those tasks must include taking very good care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gazed at Karin's barefoot, this is the first time seeing it, or at the very least, this up close. \"...Other... shoe... Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Sakura quickly took Karin's other shoe off and placed the pair off to the side of the lounge chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at Robert and how he caresses my shoulders whilst adding pressure. Use Bob as your teacher for now.\" Karin could tell Sakura needed a bit of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll try Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took Karin's fair skinned foot and slowly rubbed it with both her thumbs. Her foot was as soft as it looked. Sakura couldn't help but wonder how much effort she put into making them this way. Sakura trained very hard, so hard her entire body would be drained and blistered... Karin had to of trained a similar amount. Her foot was slightly moist but didn't smell despite the heat coming down on her. It wasn't too hot out, it felt nice but being trapped inside those shoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apply more pressure to the sole, right above my heel.\" Karin ordered with her eyes closed enjoying her massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" Sakura carefully applied more pressure. Not knowing how much pressure would be perfect scared Sakura a tad bit but she trusted Karin would steer her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\" Karin let out a soft moan. The moan could've been from Bobby's work but Sakura smiled at the thought of it being her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin lifted her left foot over her right, floating in front of Sakura's face. Taking the hint Sakura delicately dropped her right foot onto the lounge chair and grasped her left repeating what she has done prior. Karin's silence most likely meaning the amount of pressure she had applied to her right foot was at the very least acceptable. Sakura gave her full attention, most of her rub focusing on her sole but she also made sure to softly squeeze her toes and softly knead her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later... \"Shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin just uttered a single word as she took her foot out of Sakura's palms and lifted her foot directly in front of Sakura's face. Sakura looked up; the sole of Karin's foot took up most of her view but she had noticed Bob was gone. He must have finished earlier before her. Sakura grabbed Karin's right shoe slid her foot in and buckled it up and then did the same with her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin didn't say anything; she just crossed her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did I do a good job, ...Mistress?\" Sakura shyly asked avoiding Karin's eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, kneel for me right here\" Karin pointed directly to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took a knee, positioning her face to face with Karin. Karin grasped Sakura's chin lightly in her palm. No surprise... her palm had the texture of a baby's bottom too. Sakura needed to ask her what lotion she buys later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin had a slight smile. \"Hmm, Sakura...\"</span></div></div>",

It exposed more skins than she was comfortable with but everyone else would likely be wearing similar clothes. Sakura wondered who else would be accompanying them, Karin wouldn't go to a home away from home without helping hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done dressing she walked, barefoot to the door. There was a bag with lotion, sunscreen, flip-flops, and other items needed for a hot spot just like Karin said. Sakura dropped the flip-flops in front of her and placed her feet in them and made her way out. At 8:25 Sakura made her way over to Karin's usual seat in the middle of the state, she was sitting and casually dangled her left heel while waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ready? Good, grab my bags and let's head out.\" Karin began to walk off. Sakura picked up both, not so light, bags of luggage along with her own bag as she caught up behind Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp north of the estate was the jumbo jet. Metallic white with a bit of gold, not as big as most jet's Sakura has seen. Behind Sakura were about 12 maids, both male and female, all wearing some variation of swimwear. Some of the suits were black and white like hers while some others were not. They must've bought their own, Sakura wasn't sure how many times they've taken this trip. Sakura continued to walk until she got inside and took a seat across from Karin by a window. Alternating between glances at Karin and the beautiful up high views from the plane, everyone arrived in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin got out of her seat. \"When we drop, make sure to grab my bags out from the Jet's storage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do you come here often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just whenever I feel like it. We'll be landing in about 5 or so minutes.\" Karin lowered her sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the jet landed, Sakura got in line as she made her way out. She followed the other maids to find the storage compartment, letting everyone else get their bags leaving Karin and hers left. Sakura picked them up over her shoulders as she continued to follow the other maids to a wooden lounge. Sakura put her bags with the other maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura leaned over the balcony. There were living animals here. Some turtles, some fish, enjoying this luxurious beach. \"I'm getting tired of being this impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mistress Karin?\" Sakura said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?

Today there was no knocks at her door. Sakura opened up the door and walked over the where the other maids usually worked this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura walked up to a maid she wasn't very familiar with yet. \"Umm, is there anything I can do? I haven't been assigned anything today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you're Sakura, right? We usually do the same duties very week unless we're told otherwise by the mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where mistress Karin is right now? ...ummm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Jessica, or Jess for short and the mistress is working near the pool. I can give you directions if you need them.\" Jessica gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jess. I know where the pool is but thank you so much.\" Sakura smiled back and waved as she made her way to Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was, on her lounge chair cross legged with her laptop on her thighs. A blue variant of the white dress she wore a few days ago, working this early in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mistress?\" Sakura quietly tried to gain Karin's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\" Karin continued to type away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyth---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove my shoes.\" Karin interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\" Sakura slid Karin's red shoes off her feet and placed them near her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin lifted her left foot high enough for Sakura to get the point. She got onto her knees and began to rub her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good.\" Karin said under her breath, not taking too much attention from whatever she was currently doing on her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin's feet again without sweat or smell, well not a bad smell. Her feet smelled... good. Karin likely lotioning up her feet before coming out here. The fragrance of the lotion was almost mesmerizing, like the best flower in the world being used by the best... lotion maker people. Sakura rubbed Karin's foot identical to way she handled it the first time but applying more pressure this time around. Karin lowered her left foot and lifted her right. Sakura got to work on her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the silence. \"Sakura... I've treated you well? Have I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Umm... I'd say so mistress Karin.\" Sakura answered confused, looking into Karin's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me Sakura.\" Karin demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura slyly tilted her head up. It was still embarrassing to look at Karin while doing something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only the fourth day, you have a while to go... You shouldn't accept anyone's bets. It's foolish.\" Karin advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know... mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're extremely talented, Sakura. You know that as well as I, but talent will never beat hard work... That's why you're my maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What're you trying to say, Mistress?\" Sakura could sense a <i>point</i> forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura... think about being my maid after the bet's finished.\" Karin said with a stern face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura scoffed. \"And why would I want to ever do that mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin retracted her foot out of Sakura's hands and placed each foot to the side of her chair. Karin leaned forward, inches from Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't you?\" Karin's eyes drilling into Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm a fighter, Karin...\" Sakura couldn't keep eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin grabbed Sakura's chin with her left hand forcing eye contact. \"It's mistress Karin. Do not make me tell you again, maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, fine. Sorry, mistress!\" Sakura tried calming her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still be a fighter and be my maid. I'll ask again... Why not be my maid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mistress please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin kept her grip tight. \"Answer me, maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin released Sakura's face \"I can give you a home here, top notch training, and a vacation spot to die for and you turn it down... why?

You have so much untapped potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The rest of my life living... being under you mistress Karin. I mean... you're right, it probably is pride but...\" Sakura mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maid... whether continue being my maid after this month or not... you'll be under me because...\" Karin raised her right foot directly in front of Sakura's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grasped her foot ready to rub again. \"...I'm Karin Kanzuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura quietly finished up the massage while thinking...</span></div></div>",

The maids she talked to over the past few days were happy... and they had every reason to be. Sakura walked around the estate looking to help out other maids for the rest of the day.

To be that abrasive... I'm a classy woman and I should always act like it.

You had every right to be upset...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess we'll agree to disagree\" Karin said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what's on today's schedule?\" Sakura broke up the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to train, want to come along?\" Karin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Sakura never got to see what Karin's workout looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the kitchen, grab two waters and find two towels.

The dojo looked small in comparison to everywhere else here. The outside looked very Japanese styled complete with sliding doors. Sakura slid the door open and walked in, the inside was also very Japanese. Wooden floors and lots of doors to let in air with maroon and gold accents to make it look beautiful as well as traditional and down to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight ahead was Karin. \"Beautiful dojo Mistress Karin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes and stockings off before you walk any further!\" Karin voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura slipped her shoes off and placed her black silk stockings inside of them by the door she entered before walking towards Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin cut through the air with her palms. \"Mistress Karin, what're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Karin striked again. \"I figured I'd walk you through my daily training, show you what you're missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could also learn more, what should I do?\" Questioned Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel over there and pay close attention, this won't last too long and hand me my towel and water when I say.\" Karin pointed toward the section of the dojo where there where pads along the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all? Got it...\" Sakura sat, somewhat disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat and paid close attention like Karin told her. There was a lot of the usual, her signature moves, jabs, kicks, and very fluid dash's. Her barefeet sliding across the dojo's floor as if the floor was coated with a layer of ice. Of course she wasn't sliding all over the place, just sliding when she needed the momentum. Sakura had to admit... she didn't think she's be able to pull this off. While watching she realized... she relied a lot on ending a fight quick using her power. If Karin would just dodge over and over, she would have no strategy but to... try and hit her again. Such an obvious flaw in her approach to fighting... and Dan never called her out on it. She had fought Karin more times than she could count, Karin knew her moveset and what she was capable of. If Karin concentrated then she would beat her every time. She's already learned this much, simply from watching Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sat, silent for about an hour as she took in the knowledge Karin was providing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Towel!\" With that Sakura got up with a towel and a bottle of water and handed each to Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin opened up the bottle and drank it all in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was kind of amazing mistress Karin.\" Sakura took Karin emptied bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you drinking yours?\" Karin, soaked in sweat, asked eyeing Sakura's bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need it more than me after all that.\" Sakura handed her other bottle over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin opened it up and took a few sips. \"Did you pay attention like I told you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... about that.\" Karin looked over at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet another thing you were right about... watching you, I now know why I lost that bet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin, accomplishing her goal, smirked. \"Do you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way your fee--- the way you move, is so much more advance than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohoho! Go on...\" Karin untucked her top and wiped her underarms, whilst asking for more praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're every move has meaning, no wasted movements. I wish I could be that fluid in my movements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin now wiping her legs and feet of sweat. \"Sakura, look at me and listen well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin placed her used towel over Sakura's shoulder and grabbed the towel Sakura had around her neck to place on her own. The smell very strong but Sakura did as ordered. \"Fixing me tea, doing some dishes, cleaning an already spotless estate, giving me massages every now and then... Is that really too much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura said nothing but looked softly at Karin. \"You can have an amazing place to stay, not work too much, get paid handsomely, and learn with me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin like a predator slowly walked over to Sakura, the sound of her wet barefeet  lifting off the wooden ground echoing off the walls. Karin was inches away... \"So, I'll ask again... why not stay employed to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not even a good maid...\" Sakura mumbled as she looked down toward Karin's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin raised her head softly and brushed a few strands of hair out of the way. \"It's nothing to worry about, you're doing just fine for a newcomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...May I think about it mistress Karin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course you can. I just wanted you to use your head and make the right decision for yourself. Let's go, I need a cool shower. 25 days to go, Sakura... I'm not forcing your hand.\" Karin made her way over to the entrance that Sakura used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want you're stockings and shoes, mistress?\" Sakura noticed she left them behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, be a dear and fetch them can you?\" Karin gave an order disguised as a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin pointed to the left of the dojo and Sakura saw her stockings and shoes tucked away off to the side and picked them up and returned to where Karin was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying silent Karin lifted her left foot off the ground. Sakura knelt without hesitation and slipped on her black stocking and then her shoe to match. Karin then lifted her right barefoot with a warm smile... Sakura returned the it with an awkward smile of her own and put on her other stocking and shoe.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't hard to find; the estate was beyond huge but there were spots she would frequent. This time, Karin was in her patio which was between her room which Sakura has never seen and the kitchen which Sakura has seen plenty of. Karin was without her laptop, looking out at the distance, perhaps the sun. It was still early so she was probably still waking up but she was still properly dressed in her white dress with pinkish shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mistress Karin? You busy?\" Sakura asked standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. What do you need Sakura?\" Karin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...

I j-just...\" Sakura mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin dramatically exhaled. \"No offense, Sakura but... you don't know what's best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura raised an eyebrow, taking some offense. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking was never you're strong suit. We're friends, Sakura. I'm going to be brutally honest with you... what do you gain leaving her today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be your very best here. You won't watch me train anymore; I'll personally teach you. Guide your hand. Imagine... your potential. That potential being halted by... pride. My maids are healthy, my maids are happy, and you think you're above them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura would of considered some of the maids she's hanged out with over the past month to be friends... \"I do not think I'm above them Karin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch!\" Karin angry at Sakura dropping her title. She was still on the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... tell me why.\" Karin got up out of her chair, getting into Sakura face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Sakura yelled, fed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know you don't, because you don't think.\" Karin sat back down disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What do you want from me?\" Sakura said, defeated, confused, and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to suppress your inner stubbornness and do what you know is right.\" Karin said not bothering to look at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-There's a lot I need to think about here, Karin.\" Sakura pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your last day... I'm going to make this easy for you. Either walk out that door and kneel beneath me and kiss my hand... no... give my foot.\" Karin crossed her left heel over her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How does that make things easier! That's beyond embarrassing!\" Sakura said frantic, almost in a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to stop yelling, Sakura. Either toss away your pride and lay a single kiss on my shoe or get your stuff ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura really did think it over, over the tenure of the bet. Before the bet she was doing a lot of various things. She would train with Dan and others, have fun, and be free to train or goof around as she pleased. Here at the estate, she would constantly have something to do, of course there was a chance of returning to that gorgeous tropical island but most of the time it was maid work. There were pros and cons... but the more she thought about it. The cons were maybe... on the lazy side. Sakura didn't like the idea of working everyday(even if the maid work was easy to handle).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That is ...lazy isn't it.' Sakura thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ryu would never complain about something like that... but he would also never be a maid.' Sakura gripped her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, you have about 5 seconds.\" Karin rhythmically tapped the air with her left foot waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood over Karin working up a cold sweat...</span></div></div>",

Bye Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's lip quivered as Karin's foot stopped dangling and rested along her other foot at the end of her chair. \"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pack up your stuff. I want you out by the time I leave the patio.\" Karin said still not looking at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited for you to come to your senses long enough. I'm done being patient. Leave on your own before I get someone to force you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kar---... Mistress...\" Sakura looked like she was on the urge of crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave now!\" Karin uncharacteristically yelling with a look of pure anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body shaking, Sakura got on her hands and knees. Slowly, she crawled toward Karin until she was at her feet. Sakura looked up at Karin with teary eyes and grabbed hold on her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Mistress Karin.\" With that, Sakura placed a kiss right in the middle of the top of Karin's foot. After the kiss, she looked up at an unimpressed Karin... she then laid many more soft kisses. Staying silent, Karin placed her left foot in front of her right. Sakura quickly placed her lips on her left foot as well. After Karin got her fill, she rose from her seat. Sakura looked up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her watery eyes, Karin laid her soft palm on Sakura cheek. Sakura began to blush. \"Two more kisses, one on each foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura bent over again and did as told. Sakura laid a delicate long kiss upon her left foot and did the same for the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin again palmed Sakura's cheek. With a finger with caught a forming tear... \"My... are we really crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura couldn't hold it in anymore... this was hard for her to do. \"You did the right thing, Sakura... I'll take good care of you and you'll take good care of me in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on all fours, Karin handed her a napkin. Part of Sakura was worried. Karin's words were scary... but the way they came out felt... loving and true. Not some lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin walked toward the door, and held out her hand. \"...Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grabbed her hand, getting off of her hands and knees as they both made their way out of the patio.</span></div></div>",

The top looked the same but with gold accent instead of pink, her skirt was more frilly, she kept the maid footwear that Karin had given her and Karin let her keep her hand pads and headband but were both black. Of course she had to take off her hand pads off for certain tasks but often they were left on. Sakura wasn't just a <i>maid</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything mistress Karin?\" Sakura brightly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin smiled back, and raised her glass of lemonade. \"No, Sakura I'm quite fine at the moment. Grab your notebook later at about... 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, mistress... I'll be around.\" Sakura ran off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe notebook included notes whenever Karin would take time to spar or train with her. All of those thoughts in her head, everything she'd learned there would be later studied. Every session with Karin would be an amazing learning experience. 10 minutes before 6, Sakura awaited in the Kanzuki dojo, stuffing her socks into her shoes before heading further in. Sakura took a seat onto her knees until Karin made her arrival. Sakura hearing the doors slide open snapped her head up. It was indeed Karin, wearing her usual fighting (If you can really call it that) attire. Her beautiful red dress. Sakura's gaze lowered as Karin, slid off her shoes and her pantyhose. Sakura wasn't a lesbian but even she had to admit... Karin had legs. Muscular and at the same time incredibly womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin barefeet made that sound Sakura loved to here as she made her way to her. \"You know, Sakura... You could be a tad more subtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean... exactly?\" Sakura gasped dramatically, never being able to hide her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin crossed her right foot over the left. \"...Right. Are we ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood up \"Yeah! Ready when you are, mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin got into fighting stance. \"You first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura threw a straight towards Karin as she crouched and dodged it...<br>\r\n<u><br>\r\n<i><b>1 hour later...</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Huff Huff</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... good stuff, mistress. Thank you yet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very much welcome. I'm learning quite a bit as well. You're a good sparring partner... you've always have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's grin grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still far below my level.\" Karin returned Sakura's smile with her own devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... but one of these days mistress you might regret helping me out.\" Sakura tightened her hand pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho, I look forward to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But for now, let's head over to the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Sakura loved the pool but nothing beat jumping in it after working up a sweat training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're giving me some well-earned attention before taking a dip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still putting up this act, Sakura?\" Karin asked, putting on her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... act. Fine... Here.\" Karin draped her pantyhose neatly on Sakura's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put those away for me before meeting me at the pool. The smell is unpleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sure.\" Sakura really struggling, left the dojo quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, cute.\" Karin muttered to herself, opening to dojo's doors...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't rare for Sakura to massage Karin's feet whenever they would visit the pool. It was a weekly routine, sometimes more than once a week even... What wasn't routine was giving her a massage straight after her training. The smell was a mixture of her fancy lotion and soap, sweat, and whatever the inside of her shoe was made of... they wasn't as smelly as they appeared. The sweat making Sakura's hands glisten like the pool beside her as she pressed her fingers into her arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing amazing, maid but... open up.\" Karin said looking directly into Sakura's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned... this wasn't the first time; she knew what was coming. However, this was the first time doing so, right after training. Sakura opened her mouth slightly. Karin dipped her toes against her wet tongue as Sakura continued rubbing her other foot. Karin's shoulders relaxed further into her lounge chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam Karin...\" Showing up quietly like some kind of ninja, it was Stephen with a large clipboard. Sakura quickly slipped Karin's toes out of her mouth, hoping he didn't see too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you're done yet Sakura...\" Karin looked down past her knee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mistress... c'mon...\" Sakura looked off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i><b>Maid</b></i>.\" Getting Sakura to look at her. Whenever Karin called her maid that usually meant she didn't want any opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... now.\" Karin said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked over at Stephen who had a look of someone who couldn't care less. Slowly Sakura leaned over a continued to suck Karin's toes and then rub the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting until Sakura got over Stephen's presence, she turned toward Stephen. \"...What is it, Stephen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tournament you had me look into... I have an important update regarding its time and place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin smiled. \"Very nice news... it has been a while. Sakura... switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin presented her dry(aside from a little sweat, that didn't stick to Sakura's palms) right foot directly in front of Sakura, cutely wiggling her toes causing Sakura to blush. Sakura took Karin's toe into her mouth as she grabbed hold of her wet left foot and repeated the same. The lack of hesitation this time made Karin smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to go into detail now, madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... There's plenty of time, just make sure my name... and Sakura Kusanagi's get onto that list for me.\" Sakura ignoring her name being dropped, too focused on her massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done, madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, I'll see you soon.\" Stephen walked away in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin again looked down beneath her knee's at Sakura slowly rubbing and sucking her toes with her eyes closed. She didn't need to tell her where she missed or what needed more attention... she was a natural and Karin knew why. Karin wasn't one to tease, nor would she blame her. Karin continued to look down placing her chin in her palm for several more minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura.\" Sakura stopped sucking and looked up into Karin's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, no hesitation. None of my maids will judge you, I assure you. Other than that... good job as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura made a cute popping sound as she took Karin's toe out of her mouth. \"...Thanks, I won't. I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Sakura... Give each foot a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura placed a soft kiss onto each big toe and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gave Karin a puppy-dog look. \"...You can swim now.\" Karin waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaa! Thanks, mistress!\" Sakura ran a did a cannonball splashing water onto Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Karin would normally be upset... but not today. Today it's fine. Maybe, she'd join her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tournament Stephen spoke of was coming up soon in Japan and it was a tag team bracket of various fighters from around the world... sadly no noticeable names of been confirmed but Karin always sought out new faces and new talents. Regardless it was an easy win, Sakura and her synergy would be too much for anyone to handle. Even if they didn't work well together, with Karin's training Sakura was at her best and improving every day. Karin and Sakura were amazing apart but would be unstoppable together.</span></div></div>",

Loudly announcing she had arrived as if Sean couldn't hear her close the door shut. She loved to be heard. Her energy seemed to be endless... no doubt that helped her be the fighter she was. She walked into the living room where Sean was, dripping with seat... not bothering to wipe herself down first. Today she was wearing her sleeveless green gi with matching green pants, both with a bit yellow added.  Black belt, Black footguards protecting her feet, one side of her hair braided and the other long, some of it sticking to her forehead. All together, she looked like her country's flag... a flag that doesn't like to wear much clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not going to welcome me home, little bro?\" Laura peeked over Sean's CPSP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean just tried to ignore her. He tried not to give her the attention she sought... she got plenty of attention from anyone that laid eyes on her. Laura walked away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean put the game down... surprised that actually worked. He hoped she would go straight to the bathroom. But only a few seconds later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could stiffen his lower body his sister quickly jumping, behind first, onto it. Forcing the air out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeeaaaaan! Did you forget to greet your big sis?\" Laura bounced up and down. Even if he wanted to, right now, he couldn't give her the greeting she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out all day sweating my butt off while you play games and I can't even get a 'Welcome back, Laura?' Hmm?\" Laura asked rubbing her rear into Sean's lower ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... off... me! You're sweaty!\" Sean tried to move her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grabbed hold of Sean's head and put him in a headlock. \"That didn't sound like a warm and brotherly greeting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat from under her arms was getting into Sean's hair. He was going to need to take a shower as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't let go of his head as he continued to struggle. \"Alright, alright! Welcome home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squeezed harder \"Welcome home who? Did someone else come home, I couldn't hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home big sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to be home, little bro!\" and with that she released him and walked away but not before ruffling his hair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always like this... she always treated him like this, and she was, for the most part, oblivious to her own teasing. At home, in front of people... in front of his friends. This was the daily life of Sean Matsuda... but it wouldn't always be like this. He was going to embarrass her... for her own good of course. Beating her in a fight!</span></div></div>",

She had enough sense to take a shower... after rubbing her stink into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean picked his CPSP back up as he waited for his sister to get out of the shower. Waited for his turn but also to confront her on her way out. When he heard the water stop Sean put down the game onto the end-table to his left and sat up. He got up from the couch as he heard the bathroom door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDramatically stomping he made his way towards the bathroom before bumping into Laura. Sean stared... She was more naked than usual, not bothering to get properly dressed after her cool shower. She had lounge pants that looked very much like her normal fighting attire... and just a towel draped across her shoulders barely... barely covering her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taking a shower, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can you not put on a shirt!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm relaxing in my home, move outta the way, I needa drink.\" Laura walked past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" Sean grabbed her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I challenge you to a fight!\" It was difficult issuing his challenge like this, but he tried to ignore his dumb sister's exhibitionist tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, sure. Why not? Can't play with you today, still got things to take care of. I'm a busy woman. A busy woman that needs to spread the word of the Matsuda Jiu-Jitsu.\" Laura dismissed him but her reaction was still a win. She walked to the fridge and drank straight out the orange juice carton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Laura didn't know was, Sean hadn't just been playing Megaman... He was looking up techniques. He was a fan of many fighters from around the world, he was studying. Not only studying but also trained when he knew his sister wouldn't be back for a while in secret. She thought he was too young... she probably thought the challenge was a joke. He had to prove himself. Sean sniffed the air around him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more headlocks, under her rank pits!\" Sean thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put the carton of juice back into the fridge. Sean asked. \"So... Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, yeah, kiddo. Tomorrow.\" Laura smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be smirking tomorrow when I---\" Sean's inner monologue was interrupted as Laura opened the front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! Put on some clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura groaned. \"I was just drying off, Sean. I wasn't staying outside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean blushed and facepalmed...</span></div></div>",

The school where she landed her job wasn't her first choice but that didn't really matter, she was doing what she loved. She had heard this school was diverse and... different but that was about it. At the end of the day, school is school and she was lucky to have landed the job as early as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie wore a nice professional outfit, mimicking her favorite school teachers' apparel. A white blouse, her hair in a bun, a dark brown skirt, and dark stockings to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie took a deep breathe, grabbed her coat and satchel filled with everything she'd need and drove to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie parked her car and made her way to the front gate. \"Wow!\" The school was much larger in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room 605... 8 A.M.\" The rest of the school could come later, right now she needed to find her room. So she quickly asked for directions and found her classroom, making sure she was there early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill setting things up, someone opened the door. It was a pretty young lady with twin braided hair, stylish glasses, and wearing a variation of the school's uniform. The uniform was a lot brighter and overall more expensive looking than the other students she had seen today. Christie thought she dressed up a little too 'professional' but this young lady looked like she owned the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Hello!\" Christie greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello... Ms....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie extended her hand to greet her. \"Please, it's Ms. Christie. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady took her hand and shook it. Her hand reflecting her disposition, soft and warm. \"Welcome to the school, Ms. Christie. My name is Chun Li, I'm the school council president. Sorry if I'm bothering you by coming early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, although I'm surprised to see someone come in so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First in, last out.\" Chun Li smiled, laying her textbooks and some pencils onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie continued to setup her desk, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile time passed more and more students came in... including a boy who looked rough around the edges, wearing a long black jacket with no shirt underneath, matching black pants, and a red headband... Not up to the school's uniform code. He sat in the back next to the window. He seemed nice enough, Ms. Christie wasn't going to write someone up on her first day. As long as her students didn't cause trouble she would preferably leave them alone. The class was about filled so she decided to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, all. I am Ms. Christie, very nice to meet you all... Is this everybody?\" Ms. Christie asked the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...There's one missing.\" Chun Li said with little enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 7: 57 a.m. \"We'll wait for 5 more minutes. Please bring out your english textbooks... and we'll start on page 213.\"</span></div></div>",

A new teach? Heeey, why didn't anyone tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she stood... waiting for an answer, wearing a collar around her neck, studded bracelets around her wrists, two-toned hair, a black blazer, plaid skirt, ripped black stocking, complete with combat boots that somehow didn't kick a hole in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink and blue haired girl, left the door open, as she took her seat in the class. \"What happened to Mr. Smith?\" Juri asked as she kicked her heavy shoes up onto her desk... The dirty scratched up desk was hers. This girl completely distracting Christie, the loud bang of the door being blown open still shocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the room shared their reaction with the teacher but Chun Li didn't, she kept her composure around the late student. \"You know full well, what happened. Quiet down, Juri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to assume, Ms. Prez.\" ...Ms. Christie didn't know anything about a 'Mr. Smith'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to regain the class's attention. \"...So you're the last student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what of it?

Rude but... at least she was quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie continued her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the class, Christie asked. \"Are there any questions over any of the material we have went over?\"</span></div></div>",

It's in quite the spectacular condition for a decade old school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li giggled with her hand over her mouth. \"You could find some dirt I'm sure.

No one, told me anything about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just the teacher before you, teaching English. I guess he couldn't handle the new environment. Some of the students can be a little intimidating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like the boy with the headband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... maybe. He's actually quite harmless. His name is Ryu, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... Juri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li rolled her eyes. \"She's not as bad as she looks. If I can be brutally honest with you, she got to Mr. Smith but I can tell you're stronger and brighter. She'll stare at you trying to intimidate you but just ignore her. She won't do anything more than that while I'm around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie thought to herself... <i>'While I'm around?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... as of right now, that was all the questions I had. Thank you so much for showing me around.

This removed some of the new day jitters, now she felt like this was her school.

There's one thing, but I don't know how to say it without coming across crass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm open ears.\" Christie smiled at her student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... May you please refer to me as Ms. Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie's eyes shot wide open. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how it sounds but I am the student council president... among other things and I take it very seriously.

I know it's awkward but in my belief we should show each other respect where it's needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Where it's needed.</i>' Christie felt like cringing. This young lady was very intelligent... but she was still that, a young lady... but then again, some people would refer to her being a young lady as well being only 26 years old and in a teacher position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chun Li left the classroom, she turned around to look at Ms. Christie. \"Again, thank you... I knew you'd understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie couldn't help but feel a little insulted... but if everyone else refers to her as 'Ms.' It would indeed be weird not to follow.

Did you decide to change my grade?\" Chun Li asked, not making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Ms. Christie replied sternly. She wouldn't let her student trample over her. She was the teacher; she was the boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li giggled. \"My... Ms. Christie, I'm going to tell you a story... When I arrived here this academy was beyond a mess. It was violent, dirty, an overall train wreck. What you see today, is mostly my product. I fixed this place... I had help but without me you would've been robbed 4 times before the end of your first week. I stopped fights, the robberies, the delinquents, your class is my class. They are behaved because I'm watching. They wouldn't dare slip up to their bad habits within my presence. I also have club that is trusted to report to me. Do you understand why I'm telling you this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To respect you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nicer way of putting it but yes. All I'm asking is for you to give me what I deserve. What I work so hard for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Li... it was just a 'B' I'll remove any tricky questions in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li shook her head. \"How did you become a teacher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie offended, stood up out of her chair. \"Excuse me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, Christie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li stood up, eye to eye with Ms. Christie. \"Don't make me repeat myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie did as told... intimated. \"You were so... nice to me when I arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was when I was a A+ student... why are you being so stubborn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regrading a paper for the reasons you have is not what teachers do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you're above the other faculty here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!? ...no, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have brought up the mistakes of theirs a few times in the past and they all did what they needed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't 'need' to do anything. You are a bright student but you're also an arrogant bully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li sighed. \"Not arrogant, confident. You're the one who is arrogant... hope the rest of your day is pleasant, Christie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she got up and left.  Little did Ms. Christie know, tomorrow she was going to see some SFA 'classic'.</span></div></div>",

They were a bit late, but they didn't need to be in class early like she was, there was still time.

She began to pack up her things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turned as someone came in. \"Sorry, I'm late... Did you cancel?\" It was Chun Li carrying her books.

I did not go through---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raise your voice one more time, and I will turn you into a whimpering child!\" Chun Li's voice overpowered hers. Not because it was louder, it had... more behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie cringed in her seat, as Chun's threat sent a harsh shiver down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a younger teacher so I am showing you an astounding amount of leeway but if you continue to show me disrespect, you won't only be out of classmates, but you'll be out of a class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What do you, mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school is wrapped around my finger.

She laid her drink onto coaster on her desk and laid out her materials. After a while students joined her, including Chun Li. Still acting as if nothing happened between them... maybe she should've done the same, but that road is closed because of her erratic actions.

I will not repeat myself...  Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You touch me, Danny boy, and not only will your forearm be snapped but you also won't 'restrain' me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan started to panic as Juri gave him an order of her own. \"Instead, you and the class can arrange the desks in a circle.

Ms. Christie's face during class and right now gave it away. \"I see...\" Chun Li said out loud, not taking he eyes off her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... Her girls are gonna kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her girls are going to busy cleaning the prez's broken face.\" Juri said walking towards the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine.

This wasn't some honorable fight; nothing like it, this was just a street fight in a classroom. Even Chun Li's regal disposition was missing, her hair a mess and some of her clothes ripped. Chun Li forced Juri's body to the ground, putting her on her knee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*Slap*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li laid a strong stinging slap to the cheek of Juri.

Both her and Chun were panting, all the dodging earlier catching up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you gone and pissed me off!\" Juri ran towards Chun Li with a lightening quick fierce roundhouse kick which lifting her feet off of the ground.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Christie silently watched on, her hand covering her mouth, as her two students fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies being slammed against the desk that were being held in place by whatever students they were near. Every student... looked like they have seen this before. The amount of time it took them to arrange the desk... the looks on their faces as the fight went on. Some were making noise and others looked on in awe. Sure, some seemed scared but... they just didn't have the proper reaction to... this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne kick whiffed and nearly knocked the head off the shoulders of a boy, instead the kick just crushed the pair of glasses he was wearing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri locked up with Chun Li and few short punches towards her mid-section. This wasn't some honorable fight; nothing like it, this was just a street fight in a classroom. Even Chun Li's regal disposition was missing, her hair a mess and some of her clothes ripped. Chun Li forced Juri's body to the ground, putting her on her knee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*Slap*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li laid a strong stinging slap to the cheek of Juri. At this point, Ms. Christie wanted to speak up, to stop this... but she didn't want it enough because she just continued to watch like the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright.\" Juri spat on the ground and got back up on her feet. Both her and Chun were panting, all the dodging earlier catching up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you gone and pissed me off!\" Juri ran towards Chun Li with a lightening quick roundhouse kick. She put everything behind it, this simple attack had downed many of her classmates that were stupid enough to oppose her... and sometimes she'd just kick them for the Hell of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li had seen it before, this kick wasn't anything fancy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and she dodged it just like any other kick. Her slap worked as intended, it worked up the savage delinquent. She never could control herself and that would hurt her in midst of a fight like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li quickly spun and delivered another slap, this one a much stronger backhand, stunning Juri. It could have been over there but to make sure, Chun Li threw out one final devastating kick, the bottom of her shoe harshly meeting the bottom of Juri's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li looked down at Juri. \"Hmph... Hoyokusen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was over, the attitude of the classroom returned to normal. \"This entire class is going to be punished, excluding Ryu, the days of the past are over as are the days of fights in classrooms while the ignorant masses cheer in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li continued. \"Dan... grab two other classmates and remove Juri from the classroom and into the infirmary. Tell nurse Kolin, to tell me when she awakens. She'll be spending some time with council in my office.\" The classroom cringed, making Ms. Christie wonder what happens in there, judging the class's reaction... nothing good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed in you all... but there's one person that I am the most disappointed in.\" Before Chun Li even gave a glare to her, she knew what she was talking about... She knew. Damn it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning her attention to the class. \"Well... let's call it a day, shall we? ...After of course, moving these desk to where they should be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrogance of Chun Li to announce such a thing didn't even register to Ms. Christie... she was scared like never before. The class started to move the desk back into an orderly fashion, like they were prior to the fight and then left the class... leaving only two people in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun Li walked up to her teacher and didn't have a look of anger like she expected. She told her. \"Actions and consequences.\" before leaving, Ms. Christie's knees gave out as she heard the door close...</span></div></div>",

A lesson, you will not forget. Not this time.\" Ms. Christie's throat dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was nice enough to try and handle our issue in private... but it seems that wasn't the way to go about it.\" The class stayed quiet as Chun Li's eyes were locked to her teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chun...

She then slowly slid off her pantyhose to reveal her soft milky thighs and put her shoes back on. Finally, she walked in front of Ms. Christie's desk. \"This class is over when you, again, kiss my butt.\" Chun Li then slid her skirt down presenting her white panty clad behind to Ms. Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...N-No, don't to this.\" Ms. Christie again pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you're not talking; you lost that right. Talk again and you will get a backhand. You wanted to play rough, well... here's the consequence right in front of you. Try running, and I'll gladly smack you down as many times as need be. Go ahead, keep your class waiting. We are going to stay here until you show them what happens in my school when you're disobedient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie's stomach started to churn. All of the student's eyes were on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did things turn out like this so quickly?\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore today, she would have never believed something could be more embarrassing than the moment this girl forced her to kiss her behind... It was like she was living a nightmare, but she knew it wasn't one. She knew this was very real... and there was no escaping the result. Checkmate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie arms were shaking as she got up out of her chair and stood in front of her classroom.</span></div></div>",

This change looked similar to her... but not her bank account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that embarrassing day, Chun Li had left her alone for the most part. The new clothes were worth it.

You may watch and take notes.\" Rose grabbed a hand full of the teacher's hair and pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you master.\" Menat took a seat to the side of the table. Rose's way of going about this was a little different than hers. She was scary when she was like this. Rose would often get upset when she would screw up but would never reach the high's she got when she got behind the crystal ball. She wouldn't say anything though of course... she was still her teacher and her way of doing things most definitely worked... every single time. Menat hoped, the teacher would take her advice seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your eyes open girl, or I'll get a little more tape.\" Rose warned still gripping Ms. Christie's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose finally released her handful of hair as she sat in her seat across her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose pulled the crystal ball close to her and started rubbing. Her palm delicately caressing it, as she did the ball would gleam. Ms. Christie watched as this mysterious orb continued to light up in front of her. She had no idea what to think as she watched on, she had never seen anything like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blink.\" Rose told her as she slid the crystal ball in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb was now bright as if it was full of some kind of energy. Ms. Christie didn't blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the colors in, let me in. Don't you dare blink!\" Rose commanded. Ms. Christie's eyes were starting to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room around her was starting to twirl, the colors mixing. Everything was mixing. Everything besides the woman in front of her. Rose with her right leg crossed over her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose slowly got up from her seat. \"All you had to do was join us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't fret, after all... You will still be joining us... After I've had my fun.\" Rose held a palm to Ms. Christie's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few seconds I'm going to remove that tape, we can restart our conversation. Understood?\" Ms. Christie nodded in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose ripped off the tape from her mouth and despite the pain, Ms. Christie didn't react... She couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will of yours that Ms. Li saw in you is nothing in my world, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose continued. \"Why didn't you sign the paper? ...You may answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to be a teacher.\" Christie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Slap!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose gripped her sharp nails into the cheek of Ms. Christie. \"You could've been a teacher with more influence and help more people by simply joining Ms. Li's club. Your goody two shoe's approach is flawed, there are no lies in my world. Try again... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'm still embarrassed after what Ms. Li did to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose let go of Christie's cheek and sat back down. \"...Now we are talking. You see... I understand. I prefer to keep things private and I believe the results are less... complex. But you see, you' are here because she likes you. I've seen teachers and faculty come and go in such a sort time yet, she brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear dropped from Ms. Christie's eye. \"Are you aware of the mistake you have made young one? Tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie mumbled. \"M-Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are new here so you don't understand how foolish you are. Ms. Li can open so many different doors. Tell me... why did you want to become a teacher in the first place, surely, it couldn't have been the pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help this school by making it better, what Ms. Li did was perhaps wrong but she had her reasons and that is in the past. Think about your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into my eyes, Ms. Christie.\" and she did, her beautiful violet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me do the thinking for you. <i><b>You are wrong.</b></i>\" Ms. Christie started to break down even more. Both eyes were watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Christie don't cry, you ruin that pretty face of yours. You don't know what's best for you... but do you know who does?\" Ms. Christie's head was thumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Ms. Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" Ms. Christie broke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, this is still a library... I know you're sorry but it's not too late.\" Rose snapped her finger and poof. A piece of paper appeared on the table in front of them. In the real world... Menat, ready, just slid it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign the paper, my dear, and let us help you.\" Rose triumphantly got out of her seat, placed her palm on Ms. Christie's shoulder, showed her a ballpoint pen and clicked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little hesitation, Ms. Christie took the pen and signed her name down on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. I'm no liar, you will not regret this.\" Rose cooed into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now cloooose yoooour eyyeeees foooor meeeeee.\" Rose commanded as Ms. Christie dozed off into a slumber.</span></div></div>",

Do not disappoint her and I'm sure we can have tea again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Madam Rose.\" In a daze Ms. Christie walked out of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the hypnosis trigger necessary Master? It seemed like you won her over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pupil, always have an ace in the hole. Always be certain. Always... have yourself a little fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rose took a seat and explained further. \"The trigger works best when she's with me, her true feelings will slowly release when she's away from me but like you said, it wasn't necessary. She just needed a gentle push but if she tries to be cute again then I know what button of hers to press.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I do the next one, Master?\" Menat asked Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next one?\" Rose asked. \"Feel left out my little apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat blushed. \"Maybe a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take my attention off of you for a little while and you get bored wanting to do your dance.

Ms. Christie held her application close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... not too late.\" Ms. Christie thought to herself. First impressions were very important, and she had disappointed Chun Li so many times already. If not for Rose saying otherwise, she would have thought Chun Li would have given up on her. Her anxiousness only increased, and she got closer to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the office and she slowly opened up the door. There were a couple computers, but no one was currently using them. Instead what caught Ms. Christie's eye was a lone woman who was sitting comfortably in a soft looking chair with her dark stocking feet laid upon a foot stool wearing the school's outfit like most of the girl's that went to school, except that hers was dark green with gold trim. The girl was stunning, she had muscular thighs and an amazing athletic build but most notably golden blonde long ponytail with just a single bang that hovered over her right eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie nervously walked up to the very fit girl. \"Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady looked up. \"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... looking for Ms. Chun Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you now?\" She replied in a deep British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had told me you might come here, have a seat. By the way, I am the vice president Cammy White. Pleasure to meet you.\" Cammy held out her hand and Ms. Christie shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had to... drop something off... I mean, I guess I don't have to drop it off to her specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The application papers?\" Cammy 'guessed' correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're a busy lady being a teacher and all. I shall take it off your hands and make sure she gets it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was still nervous, part of Christie wanted to see Chun Li. \"Thank you very much, Cammy... Ms. White?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy smirked. \"You may refer to me however you like, Ms. Christie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie just then, had remembered what Ms. Li had told her... <b><i>\"We should show each other respect where it's needed.\"</i></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the help, Ms. White.\" Ms. Christie handed over her application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see each other very soon, enjoy the rest of your evening Ms. Christie.\" Cammy smiled as she shifted her legs and put away the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie left Cammy be and went home to relax.</span></div></div>",

As long as the end result stays the same, she wouldn't tell Menat anything otherwise. Although... Rose's way was typically far quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat removed her shoes and socks as Ms. Christie watched. Menat placed her bared feet onto the glass table in front of her. Next, she removed her white blazer revealing a little bit more skin. \"Excuse me for a second as I get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be paying for that table if you ever break it, little missy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. I know, Master.\" Menat said with a cute pouty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat sat with her legs crossed and put the crystal ball in her lap. \"The ball will soon turn into a rainbow of colors. Capture the sight, let the colors in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that the orb started to glow brighter and brighter. It was a sight to see. Never had Ms. Christie seen something this... beautiful. Not in person, or anywhere else. The colors slowly got brighter and brighter, Ms. Christie's eyes began to strain. She shut her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, nooo. Open those eyes. You wouldn't forgive yourself if you missed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss... what?\" Ms. Christie thought to herself as she curiously opened her eyes. The blinding colors were gone... and replaced with the beautiful aide's legs. Everything else in the room was gone and the table was replaced with a tiny red velvet stage. No Rose watching over her, no... room, just a cool blueish aura, Menat and her stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ms. Christie asked, the tape from her mouth was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky... I'll show you what's going on. Please... watch me.\" Menat started to slowly move her hips side to side like a snake. Her bare feet slithering across the velvet floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you'll forgive me for what I am wearing though. Too lazy to change and plus, I figured you wouldn't mind. A teacher like yourself must enjoy her school's uniform after all.\" She continued her dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me teacher, do you like my dance.\" Menat asked whilst rolling her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Ms. Christie attempted to stop Menat's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph, everyone's a critic... but I know better. I may look young but I have enough experience to see what you really feel. I feel it too. All that humiliation... I understand but what I don't understand is why would you turn down Masters offer. Do you not trust her?\" Menat's dance slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you not trust me?\" Menat frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put me in this spi... spirit realm!\" Ms. Christie turned her sight away from Menat's thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this as a punishment...  I telling you, it's not. If you were to be punished, Master Rose would be in front of you... We just want to be friends. We wanted to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Ms. Christie looked back up but not at the young lady's thighs but her face. She had a cute smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad girls and boys don't deserve my dance.\" Menat got onto her knees and got up closer to the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were hurt by what Ms. Li did... let my dance ease the pain. Make it go away.\" Ms. Christie looked at Menat's hips gyrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch... and listen.\" Menat's soles gently pushed against the floor beneath her. Her belly so mesmerizing and her gaze... Her happy smile and green eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the future, the children's future, you had a chance to be more and turned it down... Ask yourself why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Christie knew why... but was it a good reason? Watching Menat dance, her mind was clear... No. It really wasn't... she could talk to Ms. Li, perhaps stop her from doing it to anyone else. She could make a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later... \"Menat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat knelt as Ms. Christie said. \"I... understand. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenat smiled and got onto the teacher's lap. \"Did you really like my dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was something special, Menat.\" Ms. Christie's smile and answer removed the dramatic frown on the cute Egyptians face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A special dance, for a special teacher.\" Menat clapped her hands together, all of a sudden all the mist was sucked into her crystal ball. Then a big flash of light... they were back into the library. Menat was still lounging on Ms. Christie's lap with something in her hand... the application. Rose came up behind with a ballpoint pen, resting her hand on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little hesitation, Ms. Christie took the pen and signed her name down on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the club, Ms. Christie.\" Menat giggled.</span></div></div>",

Lucia took the blunt of the strike with her forearm. She audibly groaned in pain. Pressing the advantage Juri kicked out Lucia's legs from under her, aggressively taking her off her feet. Her head nearly clunking against the hard ground, Lucia quickly looked up. Juri had mounted her at the hips, her wrists still bound by her handcuffs. Lucia threw a punch that Juri simply dodged and another jab that just grazed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri then returned a jab but hers did not miss, hitting Lucia in the cheek. \"Are you going to give me that key or should I continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Lucia was silent and slid her left hand into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the answer, I was looking for.\" Juri raised her fist in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough...\" The door to the room was wide open, Juri's selective hearing triggered she knew she would hear the sweet cries of a wannabe copper underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like the gangs all here.\" Juri hopped off Lucia and walked up to the three blondes that interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kolin, Falke, and Cammy. All wearing a variation of their school's uniform... all blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been a while Cam... and whatever your two names are. You properly have told me but I have forgot somehow.\" Cammy stood still, not humored with both Kolin and Falke behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving me the cold shoulder but we have such the wonderful history.\" Juri continued to taunt and Cammy continued to ignore her prompts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaa! Sure fine, seriously business. Let's Fig--- Ahhhhhhhrgh!\" Juri was on her knee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucia walked closer to Juri... \"Arrrrrrrgh!\" and again tazed her with a stun gun sending her body to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not fighting you anymore, Juri. That is not our job, not what we are here for. Lucia stun her once more and report your failure to Chun Li.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes ma'am, Sorry ma'am.\" Lucia apologized as she stuck her stun gun into the back of Juri for the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrrrrrrgh!\" Juri screamed out in pain as the volts of electricity turned her lights shut off.</span></div></div>",

Not only was her rear colored like a tomato and on the verge of bleeding but her spine and head were pounding as well. She tried her damnedest to hold it in... but finally lost.

Of course, Kolin had noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we're being too rough on her.\" Kolin smiled upwards at Falke as she then slid her panties down until they reached her skirt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Eric's second month on guard patrol for a somewhat large prison. You probably wouldn't get lost but there was plenty of walking. It was easy money... boring as all Hell, but the pay more than made up for it. Eric didn't know much about the prison. Truth be told, everyone including higher management, kept tight lips. He had asked a couple of times when he started for more details but the response was typically the same. \"Nothing to worry about\" \"Don't worry about it\" \"Just do your rounds and stay awake.\" This prison was quite suspect... but he got paid when he was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eric!\" A co-worker called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, hey.\" Eric called back... He didn't know the fella's name. There were plenty of other guards, the only name he had memorized was the one he reported to. His anti-social behavior didn't affect him too much in this field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the night was more of the same. Boring, monotonous, and a bit cold. Eric, with his flashlight, made his rounds as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Beep Beep Beep</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud alarms shook Eric out of his auto-piloted walk. Those alarms couldn't be good... maybe some idiot elbowed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric continued along, the alarm working on giving him a migraine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>5 minutes later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Beep Beep Beep</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarms had to stop... Eric was getting worried. Eric started to make his way towards the main security room. The lights in the room where on... and the door was open. Not normal... the door was always closed, the guy who handled monitors likely kept a porno mag as he \"watched\" over the screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked into the room. \"...Hey, what the Hell's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a man out cold on the ground... maybe dead. Eric panicked, walked backwards out where he came, eyes not leaving the downed coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's walk turned into a fast paced jog as he exited. He had to find someone... and he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another body laid out onto the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\" Eric gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jog turned into a run...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ran down the corridor looking for anyone. He turned a corner... before he knew it... he was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo arms had him in a choke. Just like that, he was fading quick. He never stood a chance, nor did any other poor sap that worked here. Never got to see what had even happened. What had gone wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms, of course, didn't let up. Eric knew what was coming and started to panic, clawing at the arms... to no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometime later Eric's eyes lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard footsteps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering his vision wasn't a co-worker but instead... A beautiful blonde woman wearing some kind of skintight purple outfit with matching leggings, complete with a bright yellow slash around her waist. She looked into his eyes as she stood in the dark doorway. As she stood there, Eric noticed the black collar around her neck, risk, and a large tracker around her ankle... she was the one who cleared out the prison? How!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina walked into the room, silent, until she stood in front of Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down to one knee and grabbed Eric's throat. Not a tight grip but still threatening. Her hand around his throat, she forced him to his feet. Her cold eyes, scaring Eric into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand still in place, spoke one word. \"Name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Eric!\" He struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes seem to stare into his soul, past his eye's. \"What's your job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't help but look into her eyes as he answered. \"A guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of the guards are in a room... They won't be getting out of anytime soon. Do you want to join them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, honestly, felt like he was going to piss his pants. Did this woman kill those other men? Was he the only one left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts distracting him from answering the lady's question. Her grip got tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released her choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" The woman lifted her foot off of the ground. Eric looked at the bare, red pedicured foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is this tracking device online?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could sense more trouble coming his way... He didn't know shit about his damn place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike lightening, her grip was again around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gasped. \"P-P-Pleeeease! I'm not lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting the woman kept her grip and started to pull his hair with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Eric was fading... He started to tear up. He couldn't help but wonder... If this was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric began to tear up... as he would put it but in reality... He was starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman eased up... \"Pathetic... Your friends didn't cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think before answering me... Where are your weapons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wiped the tears from his cheek... He knew the answer to this question... but she wasn't going to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric coughed before answering. \"There... There are no weapons here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the truth. The only thing this prison gave the employees were garbage night sticks which probably couldn't break glass. They were given to the staff for looks and perhaps intimidation. A lot of the guards left them at home, and no one told them to bring them... no one cared. Fake guns, where undoubtedly, out of this places budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman got off of her knees and placed her feet beside both of Eric's legs. She menacingly towered over Eric, looking for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This prison is a shithole... They couldn't afford weapons. None of us are trained... You might have ran into some guards with cheap ass plastic sticks... that was all we were given.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't reply. Eric did all he could. He wasn't going to lie and get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Get up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric struggled to his feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew where this was headed. \"...Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to ride me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Eric was out of his league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde stepped up to Eric. \"Look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked into her blue eyes. \"I don't need a weapon to kill you. If I sense anything wrong, I will not stutter... not even for a second. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes.\" Eric felt as if he was staring into the grim reaper... He knew this woman wasn't bullshiting. This job wasn't worth dying over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slowly; get up and start moving.\" She commanded and he did as told...</span></div></div>",

There was a very sum of money to whoever could best in a one on one fight in the finals... but this was no concern to Nina. It wouldn't be something to be broadcasted for the old man's entertainment, she will be there and defeat him... not only defeat him but end him. Mishima could be buried with his millions, Nina would get paid after the dead had been done. The embarrassment of getting cooped up in some small jail had been covered up and it was time to move on. Nina drove to her next location; her sources supplied a lot of valuable information but there was more she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find someone with information regarding this tournament and how it worked. Nina knew the rules but honestly... she didn't quite know how to begin. She knew her intentions as a competent had to be shown but going into the street and picking fights would gather far too much attention. She had to be smart about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina continued her drive across town as she found a mob of people in a street in front of a pub. She parked the car and got out to see what had gathered the crowd, it was fight between two fairly strong looking men. One with large shoulder pad getup with blue denim jeans and cowboy boots was currently beating down the other wearing a dirty wife-beater. The crowd cheering him on as he kicked at the downed loser. There were fights like this happening all over the world because of the tournament, men trying to show off their machismo was typical in America trying to get attention, perhaps to get attention from a sort of scout of Heihachi. Nina didn't know the details... but she had a feeling that would some change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina patiently waited for the crowd to disperse; it didn't take long as she caught the end of the fight. A cocky smug was on the face of the man with cowboy boots, still wet from the blood of his laid out opponent. Before he could head back into the pub... Nina pulled him into a nearby alley off to the side, quickly placing him in a choke hold whilst dragging him even further into the darkness. Due to the fight only about a minute ago, he couldn't resist much. In the alley, Nina added pressure until the man went to his knees and Nina followed. They both sat with their spread legs on the ground. The man could see Nina's painted toe's through his blurred vision... He was so sure some jealous guy got the sneak on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina released the hold and used her right hand to light grip the man's throat. \"You were fighting for the Iron Fist Tourney, wee you not? You're going to explain to me, everything I want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha? I...\" Nina's hand got tighter across his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, okay...\" Nina eased up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are countless scouts across the world, so people are fighting 'nd shit, ya know? To get paid... That's all I know...\" Nina stared into the man's eyes, her hand still unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Th-There's a dude, super popular right now in 'Merica. B-Badass, he's supposed tah be. His name's Paul, stupid ass hairdo, can't miss em... That's really, all I know!\" The man was practically pleading to just get away from this crazy blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina, finally content, eased up on her grip on his throat and asked. \"...Where?\" </span></div></div>",

Frost gave him a quick but painful kick to the ribs before freezing his wrists and ankles to the ground with her chest beam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been away from each other for quite some time, let's do some catching up.

Scorpion teleported behind her quickly with his sword about to secure the final blow. But... again Frost's upper torso began to spin, Scorpion dashed back but before he could think of what to do next the still spinning Frost quickly walked forward making him crouch low avoiding her deadly limbs. Scorpion gave her a strong uppercut knocking sending her head rolling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did seem to have potential but not the experience, young one.\" As soon as he finished his backhanded compliment he looked down. Her head glowed white, before he could dodge her head exploded freezing his entire body. He cursed himself. He knew it only took one second and any fight could be over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's head somehow formed back unto it's body \"Urrgh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost groaned in pain but looked back to see if her plan panned out as intended... and it did. She couldn't help but smile under her mask. She knew she could do it but... even she didn't think it'd work out this well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost walked over to the frozen ninja, twisted her torso and gave him a spinning elbow that would kill most people but surely not Scorpion. After the blow, she froze Scorpion in place like she did her former mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Shirai Ryu were always weak and you are no exception.\" Frost dismissed Scorpion as she walked over him making her way to Sub-Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you proud of me now, Sub?

A better Lin Kuei, me as the master and you as the obedient pupil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over Sub-Zero, Frost looked directly into his eyes. \"I will be a better leader than you ever was, you will respect me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you will fear me.\"</span></div></div>",

Some of my chapters might be in progress, being able to edit chapters mean I can kind of take my time with things so if you see something weird or just incomplete then it probably is. If you love these characters as much as I do, please feel free to contribute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso everyone in this story is either 18 years or older even if you think that'd be weird or the game say's otherwise. They're 18 or older, believe me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tNo M/M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tOnly fictional women from any <i><b>fighting game</b></i>. No games that come from another media's source material (Smash, Marvel, DBZ, DC, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tNo pointless short chapters <i>without intent</i> and please try to use proper spelling and grammar.<br>\r\n</td>",
