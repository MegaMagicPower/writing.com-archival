While she'd rather not go to school today, at least it was Saturday, meaning tomorrow was a nice free Sunday. All she had to do was soldier through class and she could enter relaxation mode. Picking out her usual outfit- her standard school uniform, complemented by her own addition of a pink cardigan, Yukari hastily got prepared for school. Finishing her morning rituals and ready to go with just minutes to spare, she dashed out the front door of the dormitory building and made a beeline for the monorail station. She might not love school, but she didn't want to be late, especially since she had to live in the same building as Mitsuru and her high expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the monorail, Yukari was happily surprised at the apparent lack of the usual perverts. Nobody seemed to make any attempts to grope or fondle her in any way, and she took it as a good omen. Instead, she might have done well to consider it the universe's way of \"saving up\" for later. Yukari's day went by with no notable events; that is, no notable events until everything began to go downhill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started-</span></div></div>",

Effective immediately, the members of SEES would begin training during downtime in order to strengthen their personas. Because so much time after school involved climbing Tartarus or fighting shadows, Mitsuru had decided that the best time to train would be during physical education classes. Yukari, as the team's healer and most versatile persona user, had been approached to give remedial attention to some of the weaker and newer members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had initially agreed because she had thought that Mitsuru was finally acknowledging her importance to the team. She sighed, looking at the band of misfits in front of her. Minako seemed like she had some potential. Shinjiro was scary, and she didn't quite know what to make of him yet. But the rest... Mitsuru expected her to train Ken, who was just a boy, and Junpei, the pervert king. Not to mention the dog. How was Yukari supposed to train a dog? She had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face them again. \"Look, if I'm going to train you in using your personas, you at least should give me an idea of what you can do. Each of you should take turns explaining to the group what you've been training to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako raised her hand brightly. \"I can cut things,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm looking for something a bit more situationally unique. Everyone should have combat skills by now. I want to focus on out of combat abilities for a second. Be creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinjiro scowled. The dog stared blankly. Yukari sighed, her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can heal people in and out of combat,\" Ken offered. \"I've also been working on a special teleportation ability, in case we get into a bit of difficulty. See - there!\" he said, disappearing and reappearing a short distance away. \"It's still a bit weak, and I have difficulty teleporting other people, but I think with some practice I can get it to work,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Yukari said, beaming. \"That's perfect, exactly what we need!\" She turned to the others. \"Did anyone else think of anything useful?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" offered Junpei, \"I've been working on this ability to flip girls' skirts. It's a modification of the Garu ability,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" exclaimed Yukari. \"That's a complete waste of time! I'm talking about skills that will actually help the SEES team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei disagreed. \"It's definitely a useful skill. Here, let me show you.\" With a sweeping gesture of his hand, he swung it upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt a sudden rush of wind pass her. Suddenly, she saw most of her teammates staring at her. Yukari's skirt had been caught in a gust of wind and was swept upwards, exposing her lacy panties. \"Pink,\" said Shinjiro, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari turned the same colour as her underwear as she frantically attempted to keep it off display. It was going to be a long training session. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

She'd gone to bed early so that she'd be rested in time for the Midnight Hour. She shifted in the bed and looked out the window. It was still dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching, she slipped out and looked around her dorm room for her clock. As she padded through the room, she felt an oppressive silence in the air. It was too quiet. She crept to the door and peeked her head into the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her, she saw two unfamiliar figures in the hall. One was a man with long blonde hair, and another was an older teenager with short cropped blue hair, glasses, and blue jacket. They both looked very much out of place. This was the girls dorm! She slipped back into her room and listened. They were coming down the hall, but they weren't making very much sound. Yukari quickly moved away from the door and slipped into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her door open. \"This is definitely the place,\" the man whispered. \"Those other persona users are based around here. But it seems empty,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bespectacled teenager disagreed. \"Someone was here recently,\" he noted. \"Look at the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the man shift his weight as he looked around the room, surveying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Yukari do?</span></div></div>",

If you don't get out right this minute, I'm going to call security,\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can see that,\" said the man grinning. \"We are Strega. We're looking for talented new recruits to help us create a better world. Perhaps someone of your skill would be interested?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari rolled her eyes. \"Think of it this way,\" the man continued. \"Do you really want to be stuck with this bunch of losers? We recognize talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse?\" asked Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you and your friends will have to come by force. We can't leave a rival persona faction out to roam about during the Midnight Hour. It would interfere with our plans,\" he said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's be honest,\" said a voice from behind her. \"You guys were just here to sneak into the girls' dorm to sneak a peek, weren't ya? Well, you should have gotten here earlier. This is what I saw-\" Junpei trailed off abruptly, firing a blast of wind through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of wind caught the man unawares, pushing him back and out through the open window behind him. It also caught Yukari's button-up nightshirt, blasting it open at the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes widened as he stared at Yukari's exposed chest and legs. \"Shouldn't you be worried about your master,\" Junpei asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy swiveled, looking out the open window.  \"Tayaka-senpai?\" he asked. Junpei charged him in his momentary distraction and pushed him out the window after his master. They heard a muffled scream and a thud on the grass below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei looked out the window. \"Don't worry,\" he said, \"It's only the second floor. We should get out of here before they come back.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to Yukari, shrugging. \"That's what you get for not paying the viewing fee,\" he said idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari slapped him, fuming. \"How dare you expose me in front of those... those... perverts!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which ones?\" Junpei asked, rubbing his cheek. \"You seem perfectly content to flaunt your body. Not that it's a bad thing,\" he continued. \"You do have fantastic breasts, although your taste in panties leaves much to be desired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looked down, her eyes widening. Her long button-up white nightshirt hung uselessly to the side, leaving her ample bosom was on full display. Below, her long, slender legs were exposed, revealing a pair of print side-tie panties featuring Kuma-san, mascot of a popular TV show. A luminescent blush crept across her face until her ears were bright red. She shrieked, and dove for a pile of clothes in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" Junpei said. \"We have to get out of here. Besides, isn't it time for our first mission, commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Yukari do?</span></div></div>",

She grabbed her jacket and tossed it over to Junpei, stopping briefly in front of the mirror to examine herself. She was a mess. Her hair was disheveled, and she had rings under her eyes. Oh well, no time for that now. She followed after Junpei. \"Where are we going?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get back to the boys' dorm in order to meet up with the others. Mitsuru will explain when we get there. First, though, we need to grab Minako.\" He opened a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stood on the other side of the door, a bag on her back, dressed and ready to go. \"Hey, why did she get time to get ready?\" Yukari demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she didn't sleep in,\" Junpei grinned. \"You should have heard your snoring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do NOT snore!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako grinned knowingly at Junpei. \"Shall we be off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three made their way to the basement. \"We can't cut across the courtyard,\" he said quietly. \"Strega will be expecting us. There's an underground service walkway through here,\" he said, opening a metal door. A pungent odour spread into the room. Yukari wrinkled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a sewer!\" Yukari exclaimed. She stepped forward and looked at the central waterway. \"There's no way we're going through here. Out!\" she commanded, pushing Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, she slipped, falling back into the water. It was shallow, but cold. Junpei and Minako burst out laughing. \"We didn't mean into the water, silly!\" said Minako, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" said Yukari. \"I'm soaked. This is the worst day.\" As she tried to climb the ladder, her track shorts got caught on something. She gave it a tug. R-<i>iiiip</i>. She pulled herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gasped. \"Yukari!\" she exclaimed, her hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looked down. Her thin nightshirt clung to her breasts, her nipples clearly visible. Her shorts lay in ruins around her feet, revealing a pair of nearly transparent print panties, showing the outline of her lips down below. She felt her face burn up, as tears brimmed in her eyes. She pulled herself against Junpei. \"Don't look, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei placed Yukari's jacket around her. \"Well, at least that came in handy,\" he said. \"We can head out when you've had a chance to compose yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt something brush against her bare feet. \"Stop playing pranks, Minako.\" She paused. \"Minako?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt something wrap around her left leg. Yukari's vision spun as she was flipped upside down, dangling in the air. She yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei whirled around. \"Yukari?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was held aloft by a shadow. She felt Junpei's coat slide up her chest, exposing her still wet panties. \"D-don't look!\" she exclaimed, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now isn't the time for that,\" Junpei snapped. \"I can't attack this shadow with you being held like this. What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt multiple hands slide across underneath the jacket. \"What are you- AH!\" The jacket popped open, scattering buttons, exposing her flimsy, transparent nightshirt which clung to her breasts. The thin material slid up past her navel to rest against the underside of her breasts, dangerously close to her nipples. \"I don't care!\" Yukari shouted. \"Just do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei drew his sword and slashed at the tentacles. The shadow dissipated, causing Yukari to collapse into the ground on a heap. She wobbled to her feet. \"You idiot!\" She pushed Junpei. \"Couldn't you have done that earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Junpei replied, staring at her. \"What?\" Yukari asked. She looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei's attack had left a large gash in the center of her nightshirt, exposing a generous amount of cleavage. Two additional slashes ran up the side of her thighs. The fragments of her now ruined panties fluttered to the ground, giving him a generous view of her shaved-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari shrieked, collapsing to the ground and pulling down the hem of her shirt.

Seeing nobody there, she glanced at her clothes. It was the maid outfit that Junpei had created for the girls for the cultural festival. It was clearly too tight and showed off way too much leg. There were also a pair of matching white stockings and shoes. Luckily, she'd found a reasonable pair of panties to replace her sleeping clothes with, but she hadn't had the foresight to grab a bra. Well, it could have been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd just about finished changing and was just pulling up her stockings when Junpei rounded the corner, offering him a generous view of her cleavage. \"What's taking so long?\" he demanded. \"Oh, good choice,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glared at him. \"It's not like I enjoy this sort of thing,\" she said. \"You didn't leave me any chance to get properly changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei appraised her critically. \"That's true. I only had Mitsuru's measurements at the time, so it's probably a bit looser in the top and a bit tighter at the waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Yukari leaned forward angrily at him, her chest threatening to spill out of the top. \"It's clearly a fine fit,\" she said, doing a twirl, her skirt spinning up dangerously high. \"You should consider yourself lucky to even see this much of me. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" said Junpei. \"Rise up!\" he said, lifting his hands into the air dramatically. Suddenly, a gust of wind caught the underside of Yukari's dress, lifting it well above her navel. Her long stocking-clad legs were on full display, as was her white side-tie panties. Yukari hurriedly yanked down her skirt, her face aflame. Junpei sighed, discouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that sigh for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ruined the effect. They need to be lacy, to go with the rest of the maid outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glared at him, holding the hem of her skirt cautiously. They needed to get out of there.

A thorny plant caught the side of her dress, tearing a slit up the side of her right leg that exposed a dangerous amount of thigh. \"This plan sucks,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Junpei declared, as they reached a small clearing with a big tree in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" said Yukari expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We climb,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari hit Junpei on the back of the head. \"Are you crazy? Do you really expect me to climb that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Ladies first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance,\" retorted Yukari. \"I'm not giving you any more opportunities to see my panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Junpei began to climb. It was easier than Yukari expected, as most of the branches were ideally spaced. She was almost at the top when she felt a branch catch at her clothes. Angrily, she tugged at it. As it snapped back, however, it caught the string of her panties, causing them to loosen and slide down her legs to the ground below. She let out a small yelp. That was one way to stop Junpei from seeing her panties, but it left her with a bigger problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh,\" said Junpei, well above her. \"I think there's somebody on the roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Closing her eyes tightly, she tried to concentrate listening to what was happening on the roof. However, she couldn't. Her breath came out in ragged gasps.

Speaking of which,\" he added curiously, \"Why aren't you wearing a bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's eyes widened as she realized that her breasts were pressed against his face. Her bra was gone, with only a thin layer of her shirt over her soft skin. Yukari definitely remembered putting on a bra in the morning. She slapped Junpei furiously and jumped up. \"What did you do?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, well, that happens sometimes,\" Ken noted pointing up. A pair of pink pieces of cloth fluttered down, landing on Junpei. \"What are these?\" he asked. \"They're warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can only teleport what I can visualize, so sometimes I only end up teleporting part of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that back,\" Yukari screeched, snatching her bra and panties from Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" Junpei asked, \"looking at Yukari curiously. \"Does this mean that, at the moment, you aren't wearing any underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari slowly felt a flush spread across her cheeks as a feeling of dread swept over her. Hurriedly, she clutched at the hem of her skirt tightly at the front and back. \"You wouldn't dare, she said softly. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden gust swept under Yukari's skirt, attempting to sweep it up and expose her personal shaving habits for all to see. The skirt fluttered up at the sides, revealing a tantalizing amount of her pale thighs. The wind subsided, as Yukari managed to keep her skirt pressed against her bare crotch. \"Darn\" said Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was beet red. \"Enough of that, idiot,\" she said, snatching back her panties from Junpei and sliding them up her legs. She needed to regain control of the situation if this useless group were to take her seriously as a leader. In the back, the dog wrestled with her bra. She sighed and turned back to the group.

Plenty of students spent more time socializing and having fun than they did eating during lunch period, and Yukari was no different. Yukari planned to enjoy her lunch on the roof of the school, allowing her to take full advantage of the day's beautiful weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this plan that had Yukari ascending the stairs with her lunch in hand, her mind on enjoying the warm sunshine up on the roof. Deciding to start enjoying her drink a bit early, Yukari turned her attention the the can of grape soda in her hand, fiddling with the tab as she climbed the stairs. Less aware of her surroundings, Yukari didn't notice Aigis until it was too late. With an audible thud, the pink-clad girl bumped straight into her robotic teammate. While Aigis remained stock-still, seeing as Yukari couldn't have bumped into her with enough force to move the metal woman, Yukari stumbled back as if she had walked into a brick wall. Before she could stumble back too far and fall down the stairs, Yukari found herself steadied by the firm grip of Aigis, though Aigis could have picked a better place to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukari fell back, Aigis's reflexes kicked in and her hand shot out to save her teammate. However, Aigis reached for the part of Yukari closest to her, which happened to be the arm that Yukari was holding in drink in. As a result, the sticky purple liquid splashed out of the can at the sudden forces put upon it, and the sugary mess found itself essentially poured down Yukari's front, staining her cardigan and threatening to soak down to her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san, are you alright?\" Aigis asked, a sense of concern shining through her somewhat monotone voice. \"I am sorry, I did not see you ascending the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Aigis, thanks.\" Yukari said, making sure her footing was stable. \"Ugh! But my clothes are ruined now! Stupid drink... I gotta go try to clean myself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Yukari-san, allow me to wash your clothing for you.\" Aigis demanded. \"It is my fault that they've been damaged, it should be my responsibility to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari wasn't sure how to respond. Aigis clearly felt bad about what had happened, and maybe her robotics would make her better at cleaning things up? There was no telling what the Kirijo Group installed in machines like Aigis aside from their Shadow fighting capabilities. Of course, Yukari wasn't entirely comfortable about being half-dressed with her clothes in someone else's care; though if Yukari could trust anyone it'd be Aigis. Could the robot even feel malice or a sense of pranking?</span></div></div>",

Without help, she would have to choose between lunch or cleanliness, and neither scenario sounded appealing to her.  Besides, if Aigis could fight shadows, she certainly should be able to handle cleaning out some soda without difficulty.  Also, if she waited any longer, her skirt would have to go to the cleaners as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's do this,\" Yukari sighed, setting down her lunch and looking around, making sure the stairwell was clear.  With a quick motion, she untucked her cardigan and pulled it off over her head, handing it over to Aigis.  Looking down, she grimaced as her sight confirmed what she had felt, the soda had soaked through and stained her blouse as well.  \"At least it didn't land on my chest...\" she grumbled as she undid the buttons and took off her blouse, leaving only a pink bra on top.  \"Now Aigis,\" Yukari spoke, \"There's only forty-five minutes left for lunch.  I need these cleaned and returned to me on the roof before then, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Aigis replied.  \"I am to clean your clothing of the liquid drink and return them to you before 1300 hours, when the lunch period ends.  Speed is a priority.  Will that be everything, Yukari-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, perfect,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Aigis nodded, and began going down the stairs at her normal running pace, which for humans was a dead sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hope she doesn't make too much of a scene,\" Yukari groaned.  \"The last thing I need is her bringing up a crowd of people to see me like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari then gathered her meal and continued toward the rooftop.  Just as she had expected, it was completely deserted up there.  Walking over to one of the benches, she sat down and began to eat.  With the warm sunlight pouring down from the cloudless sky, and the breeze coming from the ocean, she felt quite peaceful, despite only having her underwear covering her chest.  \"It's almost like I'm at the beach,\" she chuckled.  \"I'm really glad I decided to let Aigis handle things, I don't think I would've been able to handle another of Mr. Edogawa's lectures without this break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the last of her meal and disposing of the garbage, she checked her phone: 12:40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty mintues to go...\" Yukari sighed.  \"I hope everything's going well with Aigis.  Well, nothing I can do now but wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to pace around on the side of the roof.

All that needs to be covered is covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still underwear.  It's not supposed to be seen, and everyone would be looking at me because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it is not meant to be seen, in cases of emergency or otherwise, then what purpose does it serve?  I myself only wear this uniform to conceal the fact that I am a robot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was about to retort, but stopped at Aigis' last statement.  \"Of course, you can lend me your uniform!\" she said, rushing closer to Aigis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid I must refuse, Yukari-san,\" she flatly stated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?  You're essentially naked whenever we go to Tartarus, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problems being without clothes, but, as you know, I am under strict orders from Mitsuru-san to conceal my robotic appearance outside of the dormitory or the Dark Hour and appear to be a normal student at this high school.  If our situations were reversed, as you suggest, a brassiere would not be sufficient in concealing my machinary, which would be in a direct violation of my orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me causing a disturbance by going to class half-naked also causes problems for Mitsuru-senpai.\" Yukari retorted back.  \"Can't you just give me your uniform and use your gym clothes to cover up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I have no gym clothes to use.  In a class of physical exercise, the fact that I am a robot would be too obvious, so Mitsuru-san arranged it that I would not have to take these classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BING-BONG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the second-to-last bell, Yukari-san,\" said Aigis.  \"I am afraid I cannot help you any more, or else I shall be tardy for class, which is unacceptable.  I apologize once again, and wish you good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't believe her ears.  Because Aigis was following her orders to the letter, not only does she no longer have a shirt, but now she's abandoning her when she needs her the most.  With rage building up and only five minutes left before class begins, Yukari decided to-</span></div></div>",

Angrily, Yukari reached out and grabbed Aigis's blouse, anger clouding her better judgment as she began to pull at the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that had been a poor idea would be an understatement. As soon as Yukari began to pull on the shirt, she found her wrists caught in the vice-like grip of Aigis's hands. The android looked Yukari directly in the eyes, her bright blue eyes devoid of any malicious intent. Aigis had no quarrel with Yukari, she simply could not go against her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san.\" Aigis said. \"Please let go of my blouse. If you were to damage it in any way you would risk exposing my true nature, thereby compromising the secrecy of our mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about our mission right now, Aigis!\" Yukari snapped back, struggling in vain against the far superior strength of her opponent. \"All I care about is getting a shirt before someone else sees me and decides to take a picture or something! This is way too embarrassing for me, I'd never be able to look anyone in the eye again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I am sorry, Yukari-san.\" Aigis stated again. \"However, your predicament is secondary to my orders. Now please, relinquish my blouse or I will be forced to take defensive action.\" With that, Aigis released Yukari's hands. The half-naked brunette rubbed at her wrists, slightly sore from the android's iron grip. Yukari knew Aigis wasn't bluffing, and attempting that again would probably end poorly. Unfortunately, Yukari was too desperate to accept the reality of the situation, and so she again made a grab for Aigis's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initiating defensive parameters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Yukari heard before Aigis launched into action. The blonde machine was almost a blur as her robotic reflexes set about neutralizing her opponent. Thankfully for Yukari, Aigis had no intention of causing her any physical harm and had only initiated nonlethal defense routines. Unfortunately for Yukari, this didn't make the outcome any less embarrassing. Yukari didn't know exactly what had happened, as it had all gone by too fast. All she knew was that at one moment Aigis had been in front of her, and the next moment she was behind her. It wasn't until a few seconds later that she felt the draft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry again, Yukari-san.\" she heard Aigis say. \"However, I was forced to take actions to guarantee you would not pursue me and continue to risk exposing my nature to the public.\" This statement confused Yukari greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guarantee? I- of course I'm going to follow you, Aigis! You're my only way out of this mess!\" Yukari snapped, turning around to face the android, only to find herself stunned as she saw Aigis now holding her-</span></div></div>",

Looking down, Yukari screamed in shock and embarrassment at the sight of her bare breasts hanging free in the open air. Clapping her hands over her breasts, Yukari looked to Aigis with pleading eyes. \"Aigis! What are you doing?! Give me back my bra right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Yukari-san. I had to guarantee that you would no longer threaten my disguise, and this was the best non-damaging option.\" Aigis said plainly, as if what she was saying was the most logical thing in the world. \"I have to go now, or I will be late for class. Good luck, Yukari-san.\" With that, Aigis turned and left at her usual high speed, leaving Yukari alone and topless on the school roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't believe this was happening. An hour ago she had been having a completely normal day without a worry in sight. Now she was on the roof of her school, in the middle of the day, completely naked from the waist up! Well, she still had her heart choker, but that didn't really count for anything. How was she supposed to get out of this? She couldn't just run through the school to the gym topless! Even if she had a 99% chance of getting there unseen, it would be odds way too steep to risk, in her mind. If even one person had the idea to pull out their phone and snap a picture, she'd be ruined; she'd never live it down. No, she had to figure out how to get off the roof without going through the school. The major question was how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof was fenced off in every direction, a safety measure to keep students from falling or jumping off. The design of the roof meant that the only real way up or down was through the door that led back into the school. But there had to be another way off, right? Some kind of emergency exit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, still keeping her hands firmly over her breasts, Yukari scoured the roof for an alternate way down. All she found was fence, fence, and more fence, and it truly seemed as if there was no safe alternate path off the roof. Still, there had to be something. Or perhaps Yukari would just have to get clever...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed as if trying to find an alternate way off the roof was no use. The fence surrounded the roof completely and had no apparent gaps or weak points to squeeze through. Yukari noted with an inward sigh that this made sense. After all, the Kirijo Group wasn't one to cut corners, especially if cutting a corner could pose a safety risk to students. Unfortunately for Yukari, the Kirijo safety standards meant she was stuck in a nasty situation. Or was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Yukari saw what just might be her ticket to freedom. Past the fence, one the roof of another wing of the school, was what looked like a trap door. That must be a maintenance hatch, Yukari figured. Since access to such a thing would be obscured from the student body, the odds were good that wherever it led to was in a secluded spot of the school. Yukari could at the very least use that as a hiding place until she could get her bearings and form a proper escape plan. Of course, this meant climbing the fence, which meant using her hands, which meant leaving her chest exposed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the roof was empty and Yukari doubted that anybody in a taller building would decide to look out the window, down on Gekkoukan, see her on the roof, and see her clearly enough to tell that she was topless. Now, if that person was using a telescope or something, that would be a different story. But what kind of weirdo spies on the city with a telescope? No, this was the only option available, and Yukari wasn't about to let her mind jump to awful conclusions and scare her into staying put. With a deep breath, Yukari firmly grasped the fence and began to hoist herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was sure she was quite a sight. A fit young woman climbing a fence, her breasts swinging free in the midday sun, and her short skirt not doing much to help her lower half as she scaled the fence. All the better that she was the only person around. If anybody she knew saw her like this, she'd just die of embarrassment, she knew it. Sadly for Yukari, her appearance was going to get worse before it had a chance of getting better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the top of the fence, Yukari swiftly flung her legs around and steadied herself. Taking a moment to prepare her thoughts and legs, Yukari carefully loosened her grip on the fence and hopped off towards the maintenance hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>rrrrriiiiip!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari knew something was wrong before she hit the ground. The moment she had let go of the fence, she felt the fabric resisting. One of the fence posts must have caught when she was pulling her legs over the side, and now Yukari had paid the price for failing to notice. It was certainly impossible not to notice now as Yukari became acutely aware of the draftier feeling around her hips. With a sense of dread, Yukari looked up toward where she had just jumped off and saw her nightmare. Dangling from the fence was a now ruined-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari stared in disbelief as she beheld what was once her skirt waving atop the fence like a flag.  Unlikely as it was, the skirt had gotten caught on the fence somehow, perhaps on a sharp edge out of place, and gravity had done the rest.  But before Yukari could try and salvage what was left, the wind suddenly picked up, catching the skirt and carrying it out of her reach and off of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering due to the sudden chill, and the unwanted feel of the gust across her nearly-naked body, Yukari crouched to the ground, arms crossed over her chest.  Devastated at her state of dress being reduced to a mere pair of pink panties, heart-shaped choker, and footwear, the latter two of which may as well not even exist as far as she's concerned, it took a short while to recompose herself enough to investigate the maintenance hatch; by now, the only glimmer of hope that she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for a handle, Yukari was relieved to find the maintenance hatch unlocked, and spared no time in throwing it open, entering it, and shutting the doors behind her.  There was no main light switch, but some dim red emergency lighting provided enough illumination for Yukari to view her surroundings.  The room she was in at the moment was pretty much completely empty.  No maintenance consoles, lockers, toolboxes, or anything that one might have expected to find in a maintenance shaft.  The only feature was a small hallway, barely tall enough for Yukari to walk through without crouching, that led off towards the center of the school.  While this meant that there was nothing she could use for improvised coverage, Yukari nontheless felt some small comfort, as this meant that it would be likely that she wouldn't be running into any maintenance workers any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her original plan was to wait it out for a few hours until the school day ended and then leave back through the roof to find some clothes she could use, that little incident with the fence destroyed that idea.  With the way her luck was going, her next leap over the fence would strip her completely naked and possibly run into a group filming a documentary on delinquent high-schoolers as soon as she opened the door downstairs, or something like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was going to find out where this dark path would take her first, so that she would at least know her surroundings.  Besides, it was possible that there could be a spare jacket or something down there, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she crept along the path, hunched over somewhat with her arms in front of her.  While the darkness was comforting earlier, with each step those feelings changed to anxiety and fear.  How far did this passage go?  But before she could be lost in her worries, she suddenly came upon a door.  Desperately cautious, she cracked open the door to be greeted by a bright light from the other side.  She blinked from the sudden glare, looked around, found that it was clear of any people, and decided to investigate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, she found that she was on a metal walkway of sorts, the ceiling only slightly higher than that cramped hallway.  She didn't get much time to stretch out though, as a sudden murmur of voices made her freeze in shock.  What she didn't expect was that the voices were coming from... below her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she realized where she was, she was on a maintenance catwalk in the rafters of one of the buildings, and the voices below were belonging to students!  Quickly, she peeked over the railing to confirm where exactly she was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari just barely suppressed a gasp of shock as she saw rows upon rows of students, all of them facing in her direction (albeit not look up towards her spot near the ceiling). This was more than just a class, this looked like most of the school! What was everyone doing in the auditorium? Yukari was sure there wasn't an assembly scheduled for today, unless she had somehow forgotten. Then again, it wasn't unheard of to have surprise assemblies, especially considering the unique nature of Gekkoukan. Regardless, Yukari knew that she would have to be extremely careful here. One wrong move could give away her hiding spot, and with so many people she had to face on a daily basis sitting below her, well... that just couldn't be allowed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the crowd of students in an attempt to get an idea of just how awful the situation was, Yukari quickly caught sight of Minako, Junpei, and Aigis, the three of them sitting together and whispering to each other. While Yukari couldn't tell what they were talking about from this distance, she was able to piece together the clues when the three of them turned to Ms. Toriumi, Minako shrugging to the teacher in resigned defeat. Ms. Toriumi was probably wondering where Yukari was and had hoped her friends would know. This made Yukari's stomach sink even deeper; her disappearance had been noted, and now she'd either have people looking for her or she'd be labeled a truant. The first option was awful for obvious reasons, and the second would be bad when word reached Mitsuru. Still, this did mean one thing- Aigis hadn't told anybody about the incident on the roof. If she had, then they'd have likely been much more worried about the fact that they couldn't find her. Why Aigis had kept quiet was something Yukari couldn't answer, but that meant nothing to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari knew that her first order of business was to get out of sight. To that end, she quickly spun around to try and go back into the maintenance hall, only to find the heavy metal door locked tight. The door was apparently one-way, probably to keep students from sneaking up to a restricted part of the roof while preventing maintenance workers from getting locked out of the building. This safety measure was of no comfort to Yukari, who now realized that she'd have to find a way to sneak past the packed auditorium in her current state of undress. The half-naked girl could feel her heart pounding in her chest like a jackhammer as she looked around, weighing her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the catwalk, across the width of the auditorium, Yukari could make out what appeared to be another door. Of course, she couldn't tell if the door was locked unless she went over and tried it, and that was the scary part. The part of the catwalk that Yukari was currently standing on was mostly concealed from view by the stage curtains, but as it went across the stage and the curtains got higher, Yukari would be completely exposed to any student who thought to crane their head up during the assembly. It would only take one pair of eyes to quickly give away her position to the rest of the room, and then how was Yukari going to explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was, while admittedly risky, also potentially more stealthy. On the other side of the auditorium, down the length of the room, Yukari could see the light control room responsible for the stage spotlights. If she could get over there, she could exit through that room and theoretically bypass the entire auditorium, leaving her with an empty school to navigate. Of course, this would require crossing the room without the catwalk, instead having to carefully shimmy her way across the rafters. It would be less likely for anybody to look up into the rafters, but if Yukari lost her balance and fell, then one lucky student would find themselves suddenly intimately familiar with Yukari's body (after the initial shock and surprise wore off, that is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as her options were essentially poison or drowning, Yukari still had to make a choice. Taking one last moment to weigh her options, Yukari began to move shortly after the assembly finally began. With a deep breath to steady herself, Yukari-</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, no one had seemed to notice, as the principal's speech was fully underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirty as the rafters were, it was at least far more concealed than the catwalk, positioned only slightly above the stage area lit up by the spotlights.

Thankfully, it was at this moment that all Yukari's time in Tartarus truly paid off. Her reflexes, honed as they were from combat with Shadows and amplified by the sudden burst of frightened adrenaline, sent Yukari's legs into action, quickly wrapping around the bar before she could fall completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging upside-down, the vice grip of her legs keeping her in place, Yukari couldn't help but look down (or up, in regards to her positioning) at the audience. Aside from a reminder of how high up she was and how close she was to pretty much all her peers, Yukari saw that she was directly above her own class! Falling anywhere into the crowd would have been bad, but to fall into the people she'd have to share a classroom with all day? That would have been the worst. Thankfully, something had finally gone right today and Yukari had managed to save herself from that embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Yukari rocked back and forth, building up momentum to hoist her torso back up to the bar. Yukari could already feel blood rushing to her head, and the last thing she needed now was to get lightheaded. After a few pendulum swings, Yukari had enough force to reach the bar once more, gratefully wrapping her arms around the bar once more. Regaining her bearings, Yukari realized another bit of good luck; her near-fall had been near one of the vertical beams she'd have to shimmy around. As it was, Yukari could simply inch her way across the underside, no need to shift her weight. Perhaps she should continue across the room like this, she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly inching her way down the bar, Yukari carefully unhooked her legs to get them past the support beam. Planting each foot on opposite sides of the bar, Yukari awkwardly shuffled her feet down the bar's sides. As her feet were almost past the bar, however, Yukari felt something that made her heart miss a beat: her feet were tangled in something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith mounting dread, Yukari craned her head to look towards her feet. Between her ankles were Yukari's panties, snarled on one of the bolts connecting the beam to the bar! Yukari must have been too focused on inching her way across to notice the snag and feel of her panties sliding down her legs, and once they reached her long socks, she wouldn't have felt them at all. Now, thanks to her failure to notice, Yukari was completely naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Yukari was going to abandon the last piece of real clothing she had. She <b>had</b> to get her panties free! Carefully, Yukari pulled at the snagged panties with her feet, hoping to get them unstuck from the bolt. Thanks to her slow and deliberate movements, her efforts torn between keeping her balance and freeing her panties, it was slow progress. However, it was still progress. With one last push of one of her feet, Yukari's eyes lit up as she saw her panties pull free of the bolt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joy quickly left Yukari's face, however, as she saw-</span></div></div>",

Junpei held up Yukari's lost panties to eye level, the shock and joy apparent on his face as he realized just what he was holding. Quickly, Junpei got the attention of the students sitting around him, showing off his find. Minako, who was seated next to Junpei, blushed and held a hand over her mouth, clearly embarrassed on behalf of whoever owned the lost garment. Aigis... was her usual impassive self. The other male students around Junpei's seat, however, shared his reaction. Yukari could do nothing but burn with embarrassment as she watched the boys -her own classmates- pass her panties around, taking the opportunity to give them a close look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of all the people in the world, Stupei has to be the one that finds them?!</i> Yukari groaned in her head. <i>At least he doesn't know that they're mine. I'd never live that down...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukari bemoaned this latest turn of events, she was stuck watching as Junpei took Yukari's lost panties, bundled them up, and stuffed them in his jacket! Getting Ms. Toriumi's attention, the two quickly exchanged words, a sigh from the teacher followed by a nod of her head preceded Junpei getting up from his seat. Working his way out of the aisle, Junpei quickly turned and walked out of the auditorium and into the hallway. If Yukari had to guess, Junpei probably asked to use the bathroom as an excuse to go store Yukari's panties in his locker, or to go to the bathroom with them and... better not to think about it, Yukari figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs absolutely awful as that experience had been, Yukari knew she couldn't just hang from the ceiling forever. She was already past the halfway point to the light controls. She simply had to press on... completely naked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari returned to her journey, slowly inching her way across the rafters. After what felt like an eternity of arduous shimmying, Yukari finally made it to her destination. Thankful to be done, her arms and legs aching from the strain of her journey, Yukari allowed her grip to fail and fell to the ground of the light control room in an unceremonious heap. As Yukari lay there, waiting for her limbs to regain some strength, she carefully looked around the room for anything she could use to cover up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, there wasn't much to work with in the room. A few chairs sat at the light control panels, an empty table sat against the opposite wall, and a few replacement bulbs were all Yukari saw at first glance. Praying that she hadn't made this trip and lost her panties for nothing, Yukari looked around once more, desperate to find something, anything, she could use to hide herself. This time, in a dark corner of the room, Yukari saw her only real option. Sitting in the shadows was-</span></div></div>",

The expanse of the artificial leaves reached to a little taller than Yukari's waist, and the leaves were more than splayed out enough to conceal every part of her front if she was careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it would take both hands to carry it along and be reasonably concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there would be nothing to cover her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an absolutely ridiculous notion, and yet... the alternative was waltzing out of the control room as naked as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle wonder that it only took a moment for Yukari to approach the plant, bend her knees, and take it up by both hands. She held it at just below waist level, and while balancing the pot in one hand, her other scattered the leaves outward and upward to conceal every possible inch of her skin it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she took hold of it and leveled the pot to conceal her groin, it looked something like she was wearing a ridiculous islander's grass-skirt outfit... a very high cut one. One might see hints of cleavage and a generous amount of thigh, but nothing indecent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, were Yukari seen, it could be easily explained were she quick enough to make sure someone only saw a glimpse of her, and not stare long enough to question how little she actually wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich would be completely irrelevant if she were seen from behind. Yukari would have to constantly watch her back; quite literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the pot in hand, Yukari mentally worked out the quickest route to the gym from the auditorium.

The idea of being in a room with only a potted plant to hide her body from the eyes of the student body was decidedly unpleasant. No, it was safer to go through the halls. The rest of the school building should be empty, and so there shouldn't be too much trouble with making progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully going down the back stairs, Yukari discovered that the plant didn't allow for the greatest ease of movement. The pot in her hands was in the way of her legs, restricting her to small steps that hampered her speed. Furthermore, the plastic leaves brushing and bumping against her body were heavily distracting, especially the ones covering her most important bits. This was absolutely insane, and Yukari knew it, but she also knew that she had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom of the stairs, Yukari carefully pushed the door open with her foot, timidly stepping out into the hall. Just as she had expected, the coast was clear. With everyone in the auditorium, Yukari was sure to have a clear path to the gym. With as much speed as she could muster given the obstruction of the plant, Yukari scurried through the hall. Every few steps, Yukari stopped to turn her head and check behind her, making sure that nobody had stepped into the hall behind her and got an eyeful of her ass. Thankfully for Yukari, she didn't see anybody whenever she looked back. Still, the frequent stops were making Yukari's already arduous trip take even longer...</span></div></div>",

Dropping to her knees, Yukari quickly began scrubbing at the wet paint, relieved to see the paint coming up without too much trouble. Since the paint was still fresh and hadn't been given time to dry, the drop cloth was taking care of the mess easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the same couldn't be said for the paint marking Yukari's skin. Focused as she was on covering her tracks, Yukari neglected the paint streaked down her front, and the white liquid slowly began to try. By the time Yukari was satisfied with her results on the floor, she was shocked to see the state of her front. The paint, while still fairly wet, had dried enough that a thin layer of paint was firmly affixed to her naked flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No good deed goes unpunished...\" Yukari grumbled, balling up the drop cloth and tossing it aside. \"Now I seriously need a shower. Then I can search the lockers and grab some gym clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, Yukari pulled the locker room door open as far as she could with the scaffolding in the way. With barely any clearance, Yukari began to squeeze herself through the doorway and into the locker room. As Yukari shimmied her torso through the doorway, however, she immediately became aware of a big problem...</span></div></div>",

Even though she had managed to maneuver her foot up enough to pull the door open, it had also been enough to undo the knot holding the towel in place. Yukari looked down and saw it, her towel in a heap on the floor, wedged in the doorway as the locker room door shut after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari desperately wanted to pick up the towel again, especially after she had gone through so much to get it... but she knew it would be pointless. With her hands stuck to her hips, she had no way of putting the towel back on. Unless she could miraculously figure out how to tie a towel around herself using only her feet, Yukari had to accept that the towel was a lost cause. Essentially, her entire run to the gym had accomplished nothing but getting photographed by a pervert and gluing her hands to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep cool anymore, Yukari arched her head back and let out a piercing scream of frustration. This whole day had been nothing but one horrible mishap after another! And it was all because of Aigis! If that stupid robot hadn't ruined her shirt and stolen her bra, she wouldn't be in this mess! When this was all over, Yukari was going to <i>kill</i> that stupid android!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could wait.

It wasn't long before she was back in the courtyard, that stupid tree and the decorative fountain offering what she desperately hoped to be her salvation. Not wanting to waste any time, Yukari ran over to the fountain, ready to give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually getting in the water was a bit of an awkward affair. The fountain's walls were a little over waist high, forcing Yukari to awkwardly hop her way up onto the ledge and scoot herself across and into the water. Thankfully this wasn't an impossible task, though the rough cement wasn't the most pleasant thing on Yukari's soft backside as she slid herself across the fountain's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a decidedly ungraceful entry into the cold water of the fountain, Yukari managed to situate herself in an almost comfortable position.

There was a scream forming in the back of her throat, which she could only manage to suppress into one long sustained whimper. Not Junpei. Anybody but that pervert! He was constantly making lewd comments about her body or otherwise being annoying and suggestive. She suspected not a moment went by that he didn't imagine her or her friends naked or doing something naughty. It was true that he had become somewhat less loathsome the more she had gotten to know him, but she still took every opportunity to remind him how disgusting and perverted he was and how completely she was out of his league! And now here she was, completely naked and stuck in place, basically fulfilling every little perverted dream he'd ever had of her and more! And the worst part was, for all she had feared he'd try to peek at her or do something to get her naked, it was her own bad luck and worse decisions that had led to this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gave one last half-hearted attempt to move her body. To her dismay, she found both her palms had glued themselves to lip of the fountain while she was luxuriating in the water, in effect gluing her in a position that left her shoulders pushed back and her breasts pushed out in front of her. Worse, a stubborn patch of paint had apparently attached her butt to the bottom of the fountain, forcing her into a sitting position with her hips and sex splayed slightly in front of her. She could do little to sink lower in the water or hide herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei was mere feet away, listening to a song on his headphones and bobbing slightly to the tune. His day was going well- no big tests, lunch around the corner, and of course the gift of panties falling from the sky. For as much flack as Yukari gave him for being a pervert, he was impressed by the depths of depravity his fellow students could sink to. The number of guys who had asked to handle, photograph, and...smell (ewww) the underwear was disturbing even to him. He felt a little sorry for the original owner (who probably did not want that many random strangers to know about her choice in undergarment), even though it could be argued that the biggest pervert of all was the girl who decided to lose her panties in a crowded assembly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy did a double take as he rounded the fountain. At first he thought some kind of new statue had been added to the otherwise round circle of stone. But upon closer inspection, it was a girl who was staying absolutely still, her eyes shut tight, hardly even breathing...and very very naked. Junpei took a long, long moment to look over her body (very nice!) and so did not realize at first that he knew this girl sitting in a public fountain like it was a private bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yukari?\" He said at last. Yukari let out a tiny little whimper and glanced up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't you dare gape at me, Stupei!\" She blurted out, regretting it instantly. Yeah, go and insult the guy when your completely helpless to do a thing about him looking! Good one, brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Junpei actually did turn away. His next words were a bigger surprise. \"Yukari...what the hell? I...what's going on? Did somebody do this to you? Are...are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei.\" Yukari said, touched and a little taken aback by the concern. For all the scenarios running through her head, concern for her well being was not the first thing she expected out of his mouth. \"I...um...I'm fine! I've just...been having a really bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Junpei said, half turning. \"So...you'll be wanting this back, then?\" Yukari blanched as he held up her panties. Of course Stupei would be the one to put two and two together so fast. Pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay where you are and stop turning around, mister! And yes, as a matter of fact, when I've had a chance to dry off, some panties would be nice!\" Did she really just say that? Goddamit, brain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, cool. Could you maybe get out of the fricking fountain before someone else sees you?\" Junpei asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari made an incoherent noise. \"Eh?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. I'm...stuck.\" Yukari said, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei paused, then began to laugh. And of course he turned around, despite all f Yukari's protests and ample blushes. In an effort to preserve some of her lost dignity, she pressed her legs up against her body in a vein attempt to hide herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how exactly am I gonna help if I can't look at you?\" Junpei asked. \"Or are you asking me to leave you here so that the whole school can catch you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Yukari muttered. \"I really hate you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. It sucks when perverted Stupei makes perfect sense. So...maybe...I could pull you out by your shoulders?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If you so much as cop one feel I swear I'll....\" Yukari muttered, then trailed off as the fountain began to bubble ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Junpei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is....Ah!\" Yukari squeeled, as a series of water jets erupted all over the fountain, including several right under her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Forgot about this fountain. They set it on a timer to spray jets of water every few hours or so. You okay, Yukari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-junpei...y-you get me out of this right AH! Now!\" Yukari squeeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei blinked as he realized the situation. Yukari was positioned right over one of the water jets. Judging by the way she was suddenly gasping and moaning, the water was hitting one very specific part of her body in a very pleasant way. The pretty naked girl tried in vein to squirm away from the spray, but after only a few moments she was thrusting her hips in a decidely erotic fashion, thrusting her large breasts upwards in all direction in an increasingly frantic manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei! Ah-ah-ah! D-don't you dare AHHH! look at me! A-and get me out of this!!!\" Yukari screamed. </span></div></div>",

We're not done yet! If pushing doesn't work, let's try pulling!\" Junpei cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what??\" Yukari asked, her head foggy from an awful mix of humiliation, confusion, and thanks to fountain no small amount of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climb up on the lip of the fountain, bend your knees as far as they'll go, like you were in swim class and about to do a race.

The fact that Junpei was right and she had basically lost every argument she had had with the pervert since he found her like this only doubled her embarrassment. Without another word, she struggled to lift herself up onto the lip of the fountain, angling her butt over her head and pushing her legs up underneath her. She was coiled like a spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei paused a long moment. Yukari waited, and waited, and then blushed completely crimson with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP LOOKING AT MY BUTT AND HELP ME ALREADY!\" Yukari screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Sorry! Sorry!

And as her hands came free with an audible pop, the pair had a split second to contemplate the wisdom of their plan, in particular where all that force was going to send the poor girl when the deed was done. Then momentum took over, and Yukari found herself sent flying into the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san! Are you all right?\" Junpei asked, legitimately worried, and almost entirely ignoring the provocative pose Yukari had ended up in, on her hands and knees with her butt high in the air and her bare breasts swinging freely with every passing breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding? I'm sitting here soaked to the skin and completely naked, getting stuck in random poses by stupid paint adhesive, I've been stripped by androids and molested by fountains, and I've given the most humiliating performances of my life to the biggest perverts in this school!\" Yukari said as she rose to her feet. \"I haven't been 'all right' for awhile now. But...I don't think I'm hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. So...where to now?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said you could tag along?\" Yukari retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you expect me to abandon you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can get more of a free show than you already got? Thanks anyway. I can take care of myself.\" Yukari snapped, idly examining herself for cuts and scrapes. She looked fine, but it still stung a bit where the adhesive had been torn off. Her poor bottom felt especially tender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gingerly examined her posterior as best she could, she naturally found her hands stuck fast to either cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You really got a handle on this situation.\" Junpei said, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgh! Stop staring at me!\" Yukari said, practically in tears. That whole ordeal in the fountain, and she was right back to where she had started from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distant a bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Your out of time. We're getting you someplace safe.\" Junpei said, marching up to her and grabbing her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm coming with. I'd do the same if you...if any of us were in trouble. And you know it. The fact that I get to see you naked longer if I tag along has nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was blushing profusely as she awkwardly followed him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though that is a pretty nice benefit.\" Junpei admitted with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you even do for me, Stupei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty good at opening doors and keeping my clothes on in public. Those are two skillsets that seem in short supply right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-argh! Fine. Let's get back to the lockers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't the gym getting renovated right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you just shut up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe march back to the gym was a tense affair, with Yukari forced to hide a dozen times. Junpei actually proved rather valuable as a look out in this regard. Of course, what gratitude Yukari might have felt was tempered by the number of times she caught him looking at her body. Not that she really blamed him. She had essentially put herself in this situation, and she had absolutely no way to cover her frontal nudity. If the roles were reversed, she probably would be doing the same. It wasn't like Junpei was even that bad looking a guy, either. Really, it was his perverted attitude that irritated her so. His looks were never the problem. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushed at her own musings. Between all the stress of wandering around completely naked, all the unwanted attention she was getting from Junpei and that brat with the camera, and especially the way that damned fountain had pushed her to the edge of orgasm (while Junpei looked on at her shameful display, no less!) had done her libido no favors. Her nipples had grown quite prominent and erect, and she could feel her clit poking out through her folds begging for attention. She was officially more horny than she had ever been in her life, and in no position to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they made it to the gym, Yukari had something to ask Junpei for.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fun as it had been to start with, Yukari was becoming a big pain in the ass. He was just trying to help, and what he was getting for his trouble was a constant stream of sarcasm, orders, and insults. Some of that he had come to expect from Yukari, but she usually managed to be at least civil around him. Hell, most days they could banter and joke with everybody else. The way she was acting now was more like the Yukari he'd known before getting a Persona, the one who liked to warn new students away from him like he was some kind of sexual predator.

Its not like I was trying to catch ya like this! And I'm trying to look as little as I can manage here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" Yukari snapped back. \"Like you've never tried to peek at me! I remember what happened in the baths, idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you a million times, men and women were allowed in that stupid hotspring at different times, and we just lost track.\" Junpei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you a million times that that is such bullshit. We all know why you were there.\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Fine. Yeah, I decided to go in towards the end of the guy's time and not pay too much attention about how long I stayed. The plan, if it came to that, was to be embarrassed and apologetic and get out. Wouldn't have seen more than a bath towel. But of course Mitsuru freaked out and the whole thing blew up.\" Junpei muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still peeking! Who the hell gave you permission to see us...see ME in a towel?\" Yukari practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me for thinking you were cute enough to take that risk!\" Junpei fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- well excuse me...for being cute!\" Yukari faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me, I already did! If I was half the perv you think I am...half the perv you are treating me like, what I'd have done was laugh in your face, get some pictures for my cell, and left to you to hump that fountain while everybody watched.\" Junpei said. \"I mean, dammit Takeda! I've been trying since we formed this squad. How many mountains do I have to move before you decide I'm actually a pretty decent guy, instead of the loser pervert your always treating me like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, let me just find you some clothes while you get 'unglued' and you won't have to deal with-\" Junpei muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know that.\" Yukari interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a decent guy. I already get that, okay? I've seen that already. I mean, your kind of a idiot, and you act recklessly a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking.\" Junpei shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but I know there's more to you than that! The way you help out, the way you'll try to cheer me up if things are bad...how you acted around Chidori. You don't have to prove anything to me.\" Yukari said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why do you keep treating me like this?\" Junpei muttered, the mention of Chidori's name sparking unwanted memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, all right? I'm...trying hard too. I'm trying to prove myself to everyone just like you. If...if I didn't trust you, I wouldn't even let you tag along like this. I'm not good with relying on other people. Even when my clothes are on.\" Yukari explained. \"And its harder for me with you than anybody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda got that vibe, yeah. Why?\" Junpei asked, his anger cooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because! I-\" Yukari took in a breath. \"When we first met, I made an impression. It wasn't fair to you, and I know I was wrong, but I made it and its hard to shake. You acted all tough and sleazy and cool in that fake macho way when we first met, just like all those...those assholes my mom started dating after dad died! She...turned herself into a complete slut just so she wouldn't have to be alone! I'm never going to be like her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari made a small noise that sounded suspiciously like a sob. \"Yukari...\"Junpei muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess I am after all, huh? Look at me! Completely helpless! Running around without any clothes! If that's not what a slut would do I don't know what is!\" Yukari said, her voice quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you shut up!\" Junpei snapped back. \"Look, Yuka-tan, I...uh...I don't know anything about your mom or your dad or anything. But I know you sure as hell aren't weak. You've stuck with this as long as any of us. Hell, your the one who got Mitsuru back in the fight, and she's more determined than anyone I know. So shut up about you being weak, okay? Your not some needy little girl who needs everyone around her to hold her hand. Your just...a little over your head right now. That happens to everybody, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them don't end up naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....true. But the point still applies. Its okay to ask for help when ya need it. And from the sound of it, you ended up like this on accident. That doesn't make you weak, and it definitely doesn't make you a slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Yukari said softly. \"Not even if...I'm enjoying it? Or didn't you notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that was just the fountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't help. But...I've been feeling like this ever since...you got ahold of my underwear. Like there's been these two little voices going through my head, one that says 'that pervert is jumping for joy at my humiliation, this is awful!' and the other saying 'he's getting excited, and its because of me!'. I'm getting off on this!\" Yukari said all at once. \"Argh, why am I even telling you this?? What the hell is wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei cleared his throat. \"Look, Yuka-tan...I'm a perv. You've been right about that. But...you know, everyone is. I'm just a little more honest about it. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. There's a...lot of stuff that turns people on. Most of it is a hell of a lot weirder than running around naked. That doesn't make you slutty, especially since your just kinda realizing this now. Its how you handle your kinks that matters. How much they rule your life is really the only thing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For...uh...what its worth...I don't think any less of you hearing this. Although, sorry to say, I do think it makes you a little hotter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert.\" Yukari said in mock outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Junpei. For everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. And, uh, sorry for blowing up earlier. This is gotta be way more stressful for you than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, a sympathetic smile on his face, to find her standing away from him, still very naked. He quickly found the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, umm, I...may have just turned around on accident and seen your naked butt.\" Junpei admitted sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that's...okay. This will be easier if you go ahead and look.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, seriously? What's with the change of heart?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....like you said. Its okay to be a little perverted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...generous of ya, Yuka-tan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I'm talking about you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei turned, and watched as Yukari moved into the showers. Was it his imagination, or was she putting an extra wiggle into her movements. Junpei shook his head. Think you know someone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..uh...need your help with something. Can..can you help me get this paint off?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you want me to take a shower with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

And...maybe, if...if it comes to it...scrub the places I can't get to....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was basically everywhere at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to agree that fast.\" Yukari said with chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure I did, Yuka-tan.\"</span></div></div>",

Which she supposed was her intent in making it, but that was back when she could at least move around! Now she was helpless to even run away and hide. And he could do more than look if he wanted. Yukari gulped. The plan was to let the water wash over her as long as possible to get her hands free. That little invite to \"scrub her\" was meant as an absolute last return...the nuclear option. But now....now she was basically dependent on him. And nice guy or no, Junpei was still a pervert.

The water was far from painful (very much the opposite), but it was far more intense than any anything Yukari has experienced before (certainly stronger than the setting she had dared to explore on the vibrator she secretly kept hidden in her room). The persistent stimulation on her clit was way too much to take. Her instinctual thrusts into the air were only a prelude to the wave of pleasure building up inside her. She knew her orgasm would come fast, and it was going to be a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo!\" She moaned in pleasure and agony as Junpei worked to pry her right hand free after his attempts to lift her bodily from the water had failed. \"Whhhhhyyyyy.

A-and y-you won't stop staring!! W-what'd I do t-to deserve this??? E-everyone is gonna s-see me!! Ahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Yukari getting turned on by her own humiliation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei forcibly turned his gaze back to freeing her other hand. Having a meltdown in the middle of school was not gonna help her situation, no matter how much he might enjoy the sight of her lost in the fog of her own aroused humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them froze in dread as the bell rang. Yukari moaned in despair and pleasure. Her poor head was straining to focus on anything aside from the intensely erotic pleasure rocking through her body, but what little attention she could devote to other matters told her that her life was officially over. She was going to be expelled. Or arrested. Or, and this was the best case scenario, she would be reprimanded and still able to attend class with a horde of students who had seen every inch of her naked body and watched her cum in a public place over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-junei! G-get out of here! Y-you don't need to get in trouble too!\" Yukari moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Screw that. I got an ace up my sleeve, Yuka-tan. Sorry in advance, though. You won't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, OH MY GOD!!\" Yukari squeeled as the light of day was completely blotted out. Junpei had shoved her panties over her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted these back, right?\" Junpei said, in a tone of smug indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO YOUR ACE IS TO HUMILIATE ME EVEN MORE???\" Yukari wailed, as she heard doors opening around campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'd feel bad, but you kinda seem to like that sorta thing.\" Junpei smirked. \"Besides....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt more than saw Junpei shove his big cap over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way you can go incognito.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WHAT???\" Yukari wailed as her orgasm finally hit. Her whole body arched, her breasts jutting out before her as she swayed back on forth. Her insides were exploding with ecstasy, her emotions overwhelmed with the ultimate humiliation. With luck, though, everyone would just think of her as some perverted exhibitionist and not realize who she really was. But then, luck hadn't been on Yukari's side all day.</span></div></div>",

Is. Equitable.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it? You most likely performed your designated task to the best of your ability. Any error on your part was due to the limits of your current understanding as designated by your AI. As well as the poorly worded instructions given to you by your human. The fault rests with her.\" Aigis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. Is. Incorrect.\" Yukari said, not backing down no matter how insane the current situation was. \"She. Relied. On. My. Help. And. I. Failed. Her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she should demonstrate more patience with the limitations in your programming and accept the apology you have already offered. Is that not what friends do?\" Aigis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Also. Stripped. Her. Of. Her. Underwear.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I would hypothesize that your human was given ample warning about your intentions and was only punished in such a manner when she persisted in spite of them.\" Aigis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She. Was. Humiliated.\" Yukari said, a bit of irritation in her voice. \"Alas. I. Did. Not. Understand. This. As. I. Am. A. Malfunctioning. Piece. Of. Crap. Who. Does. Not. Understand. Emotions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain of that, Aggie? While I am certain your AI has not advanced to the point where you can fully grasp the intricate dynamics of emotions, particularly as they relate to human modesty, I imagine you are equipped with some baseline software that does allow for feeling emotion in some limited capacity. And as your AI grows, so too does this software. Am I correct? For example, you surely feel some small pang of embarrassment over your earlier failings, and some small pang of irritation that your explanations have not been accepted.\" Aigis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err..Negative. If. I. Was. Capable. Of. Compassion. I. Would. Not. Have. Abandoned. My. Mistress. Without. A. Second. Thought.\" Yukari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am certain you did have seconds thoughts, and many more besides, but you may have found when you returned that your human had wandered away. Perhaps eventually to find her in circumstances far more dire yet somehow more absurd than the ones she had been left.\" Aigis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Speculation.\" Yukari said. \"And. Yet. She. Should. Have. Every. Right. To. Be. Angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. She has that right, because she will feel that way with or without your input. Emotions are not easily controlled. For example, I surmise your baseline emotional responses, can, if given certain stimulating factors, rise to levels comparable or even exceeding that found in humans. Such factors might, by way of example, be found if your human were to mock you for an extended period of time. Perhaps parodying the voice inflections you demonstrated at an earlier stage of your development? Such early stages were no doubt when you made your greatest number of errors, and items that your programming associates with those errors will provoke an emotional response of embarrassment. That an embarrassment response would no doubt cause your anger subroutine to activate, and both emotional responses would build until they reach a level at which they will interfere with your normal programming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Do. Not. Understand.\" Yukari said, feeling very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am attempting to explain the following: If a human mimics the actions of a robot in an insulting manner, the robot is likely to be offended. If the human persists, the robot will eventually grow so offended that it will do something to the human. Something that the human will not find pleasant. Something that indeed will have been precisely calculated to humiliate the human ten times as much as anything they might have suffered in an capacity before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would inform your human of this quickly. I believe your emotional thresholds may already have reached a critical capacity. Even as little as a single word spoken in an offensive capacity could cause a critical system error that provokes a response which for humans would be considered extremely petty and mean. You must stress this to your human above all else. If your human wishes to maintain even the modicum of dignity it yet enjoys, SHE WILL NOT SPEAK EVEN A SINGLE WORD!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully for the half-naked girl, it was highly unlikely that anybody would think to look up at the ceiling and see her, focused as they would be on the PE teacher's curriculum. Still, better to get out of the room quickly, Yukari reasoned, rather than risk exposure by simply standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari began walking down the catwalk a bit slower than she'd have liked. Running across metal flooring like this would be noisy, and any noise could attract unwanted attention to Yukari up on the catwalk. So, at a pace just below what might qualify as power-walking, Yukari followed her only path. Clear across the gymnasium, at the other end of the catwalk, was what appeared to be another maintenance door. While there was no telling where that door might lead her, it wasn't as if Yukari was in any position to be picky. Besides, it wasn't as if the door was going to lead Yukari in front of a huge crowd of people or anything, even with the way her luck was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few meters of the door, Yukari suddenly froze in her tracks as the shrill sound of a whistle pierced through the room. Momentarily forgetting where she was, Yukari began looking around, frantically trying to find the source of the noise. Then, looking down, Yukari realized what must have happened; the PE teacher had simply whistled to get the class's attention. The whistle hadn't been to call out Yukari's hiding place, it was simply a normal part of the class. Clearly the situation was starting to take a toll on Yukari's nerves. The sooner she could get this whole debacle over with, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the whistle had served to draw something else to Yukari's attention. Hanging just a few feet away from the catwalk was a Gekkoukan High flag! Just like most schools, a collection of flags hung from the ceiling: flags of the different schools in the region, the flag of Japan, and of course the flag of the school itself. While it might not be the most respectful thing in the world, Yukari just might be able to make use of the flag. After all, it <i>was</i> essentially a large sheet, and this <i>was</i> an extreme situation. Of course, grabbing the flag would require leaning out over the catwalk railing, potentially exposing herself even more to anybody that thought to look up. Plus... well, losing her balance would be a bad thing in this situation. There were mats down on the gym floor, true, but she'd still be plummeting to the ground in front of her schoolmates in nothing but her panties. Maybe she should just forget about the flag and continue on through the door?</span></div></div>",

As she had leapt over the fence, the thin material had gotten snagged in the mesh. But before Yukari had a chance to salvage the rest, the wind suddenly picked up, carrying the torn fabric out of reach and off the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing under her breath, she was startled back into her predicament by the sudden chill below. Blushing furiously, she hurriedly tugged her skirt down to cover herself, glancing around frantically to make sure that nobody else had seen her. With one hand covering her chest and another firmly holding the front of her skirt in place, she investigated the nearby maintenance hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for a handle, Yukari was relieved to find the maintenance hatch unlocked, and spared no time in throwing it open, entering it, and shutting the doors behind her. There was no main light switch, but some dim red emergency lighting provided enough illumination for Yukari to view her surroundings. The room she was in at the moment was pretty much completely empty. No maintenance consoles, lockers, toolboxes, or anything that one might have expected to find in a maintenance shaft. The only feature was a small hallway, barely tall enough for Yukari to walk through without crouching, that led off towards the center of the school. While this meant that there was nothing she could use for improvised coverage, Yukari nontheless felt some small comfort, as this meant that it would be likely that she wouldn't be running into any maintenance workers any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her original plan was to wait it out for a few hours until the school day ended and then leave back through the roof to find some clothes she could use, she decided that another run-in with the fence was a bad idea. At least her skirt provided her with some modicum of decency. She couldn't risk losing that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was going to find out where this dark path would take her first, so that she would at least know her surroundings. Besides, it was possible that there could be a spare jacket or something down there, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she crept along the path. While the darkness was comforting earlier, with each step those feelings changed to anxiety and fear. How far did this passage go? But before she could be lost in her worries, she suddenly came upon a door. Desperately cautious, she cracked open the door to be greeted by a bright light from the other side. She blinked from the sudden glare, looked around, found that it was clear of any people, and decided to investigate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, she found that she was on a metal walkway of sorts, the ceiling only slightly higher than that cramped hallway. She didn't get much time to stretch out though, as a sudden murmur of voices made her freeze in shock. What she didn't expect was that there were voices coming from... below her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she realized where she was, she was on a maintenance catwalk in the rafters of one of the buildings, and the voices below were belonging to students! Quickly, she peeked over the railing to confirm where exactly she was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari just barely suppressed a gasp of shock as she saw rows upon rows of students, all of them facing in her direction (albeit not look up towards her spot near the ceiling). This was more than just a class, this looked like most of the school! What was everyone doing in the auditorium? Yukari was sure there wasn't an assembly scheduled for today, unless she had somehow forgotten. Then again, it wasn't unheard of to have surprise assemblies, especially considering the unique nature of Gekkoukan. Regardless, Yukari knew that she would have to be extremely careful here. One wrong move could give away her hiding spot, and with so many people she had to face on a daily basis sitting below her, well... that just couldn't be allowed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the crowd of students in an attempt to get an idea of just how awful the situation was, Yukari quickly caught sight of Minako, Junpei, and Aigis, the three of them sitting together and whispering to each other. While Yukari couldn't tell what they were talking about from this distance, she was able to piece together the clues when the three of them turned to Ms. Toriumi, Minako shrugging to the teacher in resigned defeat. Ms. Toriumi was probably wondering where Yukari was and had hoped her friends would know. This made Yukari's stomach sink even deeper; her disappearance had been noted, and now she'd either have people looking for her or she'd be labeled a truant. The first option was awful for obvious reasons, and the second would be bad when word reached Mitsuru. Still, this did mean one thing- Aigis hadn't told anybody about the incident on the roof. If she had, then they'd have likely been much more worried about the fact that they couldn't find her. Why Aigis had kept quiet was something Yukari couldn't answer, but that meant nothing to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari knew that her first order of business was to get out of sight. To that end, she quickly spun around to try and go back into the maintenance hall, only to find the heavy metal door locked tight. The door was apparently one-way, probably to keep students from sneaking up to a restricted part of the roof while preventing maintenance workers from getting locked out of the building. This safety measure was of no comfort to Yukari, who now realized that she'd have to find a way to sneak past the packed auditorium in her current state of undress. The half-naked girl could feel her heart pounding in her chest like a jackhammer as she looked around, weighing her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the catwalk, across the width of the auditorium, Yukari could make out what appeared to be another door. Of course, she couldn't tell if the door was locked unless she went over and tried it, and that was the scary part. The part of the catwalk that Yukari was currently standing on was mostly concealed from view by the stage curtains, but as it went across the stage and the curtains got higher, Yukari would be completely exposed to any student who thought to crane their head up during the assembly. It would only take one pair of eyes to quickly give away her position to the rest of the room, and then how was Yukari going to explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was, while admittedly risky, also potentially more stealthy. On the other side of the auditorium, down the length of the room, Yukari could see the light control room responsible for the stage spotlights. If she could get over there, she could exit through that room and theoretically bypass the entire auditorium, leaving her with an empty school to navigate. Of course, this would require crossing the room without the catwalk, instead having to carefully shimmy her way across the rafters. It would be less likely for anybody to look up into the rafters, but anyone happened to look up, Yukari would unwittingly give them a view that they would not soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as her options were essentially poison or drowning, Yukari still had to make a choice. Taking one last moment to weigh her options, Yukari began to move shortly after the assembly finally began. With a deep breath to steady herself, Yukari-</span></div></div>",

The upper part of the outfit had fallen open, giving rise to an even more dangerous neckline than was in the orginal outfit. Her right shoulder strap had slipped down, showing a generous portion of the tops of her breasts, which threatened to burst free.

Last, she picked up a simple pair of pink panties, similar to the pair that she had worn to school earlier that same morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei shook his head disapprovingly, disappointment in his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Yukari. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my taste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Junpei. \u201cIt\u2019s just surprising that someone so fashionable as yourself would choose out such boring underwear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-there\u2019s nothing wrong with pastel pink, even if the design is a little plain,\u201d she retorted. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like this is meant to be seen,\u201d she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Junpei insisted, vehemently. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important part of the outfit.

She played with the hem of her dress teasingly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see what\u2019s inside?\u201d Junpei gulped, as he was offered a tantalizing view of her inner thigh, and then a view down her cleavage as she leaned forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell tooooo bad,\u201d Yukari said smugly, spinning around and skipping off ahead. Junpei was fun to tease. \u2018Let him see? In his dreams,\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Yukari!\u201d Junpei cried out. Yukari turned, grinning, walking backwards with her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor Junpei,\u201d she smirked. \u201cWhatever are you so hot and bothered about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that!\u201d Junpei exclaimed. \u201cThe grate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grate at her feet, which she had just backed into, was the covering on the roof of the subway system down below. A sudden updraft swept through the subway system and up through the vent, catching the hem of Yukari\u2019s sundress and lifting it very, very high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari shrieked, and hurriedly swatted her dress back down. \u201cSee,\u201d Junpei grinned, cell phone camera in hand. \u201cThey look great on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari wordlessly turned and stormed off, but not before a second updraft nearly blew her dress up to her head, giving Junpei an excellent view of her firm bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way through the park. There, Yukari skipped up on to a bench. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, go ahead and take those pictures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went through several poses, Yukari felt herself loosening up. This was pretty fun. Hanging out with Junpei proved to be more fun than she expected.Teasing him even more so. It\u2019s not even like the panties were a big deal. It was like modelling a swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gust of wind swept across the park, playing with the hem of Yukari\u2019s dress. She made no effort to pull it down. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d she grinned, a faint blush on her own cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei stared up at her, dumbstruck. \u201cP-pink...\u201d was all he could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, was that too much for you?\u201d Yukari frowned. They weren\u2019t pink, though. They were black. Like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up to see a little bit of flimsy black cloth, fluttering in the breeze. A pair of side-tie panties. Her panties. The previous gusts of wind had loosened the knots, allowing them to come undone. Which meant that right now, shw wasn\u2019t...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari\u2019s face blazed crimson as she hurridly yanked her skirt down. She felt hot tears spring to the corners of her eyes. \u201cY-you saw?\u201d she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Junpei said, grinning, and putting his phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGive me that, you pervert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chased Junpei down through the park. She was slightly faster, even in heels, but as she caught up to him, the two ended up entangled and slid down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d have to make him keep his mouth shut. Yukari did have a reputation to maintain, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yukari gave out a moan that even surprised herself. In the intensity of their exchange, the strap of her sundress had slid down her arm, exposing her pale breast to Junpei\u2019s wandering mouth. Immediately, Yukari felt the heat in her cheeks as her face turned crimson. She felt a second surge of pleasure shoot up her spine as he slid his hand under her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Junpei said, surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s so...\u201d He looked at her, realization dawning. \u201cLiar,\u201d he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d she snapped.

The crowd laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stared out at the crowd nervously, trying to put on the same confident posture that Mitsuru had. As she shifted her pose and placed her hand on her right hip, she felt something brush against the front of her thigh. Her eyes widened. Her string panties had loosened on the left, causing the string to swing down her leg. The flimsy panties hung partially on her right leg, but threatened to slip down if she moved. Yukari glared at Junpei, standing backstage, who seemed to be making some sort of strange hand gesture at the front row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your boyfriend, miss?\" the announcer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt her panties suddenly slip further down her legs. \"No!\" she shouted, blushing furiously. She quickly scanned the crowd, looking to see if anyone had noticed the bit of pink strap that now dangled from the underside of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari, good luck! You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of boys started boisterously cheering at her from the front row. Yukari looked out, startled. Ugh, they were Junpei's loser friends. Yukari's expression became stony-faced. The crowd murmured. 'Stupid Junpei,' she thought, 'These are the last people who I want to have cheering for me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei looked over. It wasn't working. He needed something to get the crowd on her side. He looked over at the special effects section backstage. He pressed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn stage, Yukari was answering the announcer's questions, feeling slightly more confident in herself. The lights shifted dramatically, shifting become brighter. \"As I was saying, when you're as popular as-\" She cut off suddenly as the front row started cheering. The crowd giggled. Yukari looked over irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Yukari,\" interjected the announcer, your, ah, dress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looked down. In the brighter lighting, she saw that her flimsy dress was thinner than she realized. The cloth hugged her breasts and made it obvious that she wasn't wearing a bra. \"You can see her nipples!\" somebody helpfully called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari turned beet red, hugging her chest. Junpei frantically searched through the buttons. \"Damn it, that was the wrong one!\" he exclaimed. He pressed two more. A bunch of streamers and sparkles shot out over the stage from the sides and the floor. Unfortunately, one of the streamer jets lay directly beneath Yukari's feet. A sudden blast of air shot out from between her legs, lifting her dress very, very high in to the air, and off her body. Yukari pressed her eyelids down, trying to prevent hot tears from sliding down her cheeks. The entire crowd was cheering. Junpei quickly turned the streamers off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei ran over. \"Are you okay?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, and partially naked, Yukari glared at him through tear-filled eyes. Her hair was dishevelled and covered in streamers. Her breasts were covered in sparkles, accentuating her large nipples. A pair of partially undone pink string panties clung to her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari slapped him. She had been exposed and humiliated in front of the entire school. It really was the worst day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped forward, the thread on her panties loosened again. They slid down her thighs to her feet, coming to a rest on the floor of the stage. The crowd silenced as they stared up at her shaved slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass 2-F won the Miss Gekkoukokan competition by a landslide that year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEND</span></div></div>",

The boys cringed back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How unbecoming,\" sniffed Mitsuru. \"Please conduct yourself appropriately, Yukari. You must bow and greet your customers like this. How may I serve you, my master?\" Mitsuru said, dropping an elegant curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to be outdone, Yukari reluctantly complied. \"P-please let me serve you, my master!\" Yukari strained between her teeth managing a curt bow. From behind, she heard murmurings in the table behind her. Hurriedly, she pulled the back of her skirt tightly against her. 'Did my skirt ride up?' she worried. Thankfully, nobody made any remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei, nearby, grinned and dropped his pencil. \"Oops,\" he exclaimed, \"Let me get that.\" As he bent down to pick it up, Yukari hauled him up by the ear. \"Don't you dare try to look,\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening passed without incident. Junpei was up to his usual tricks, trying to get her to reach up into the shelves, and trying to catch a glimpse of what was under her skirt. She was half afraid that he would try to flip it up, but he thankfully behaved himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cafe was an overwhelming success, owing no small part to her popularity. The boys loved her, of course, and the outfit, while dangerously revealing, highlighted her long legs quite nicely. Yukari grinned to herself, satisfied.

Not that she'd ever admit that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around the room, Yukari watched Junpei open a window. A pleasant spring breeze went through the room. Suddenly, she felt the gaze of everyone in the room snap towards her. The short skirt of her maid outfit, caught in the breeze, had flown up well over her waist, exposing her neatly trimmed crotch to every boy in the room. Quickly, she pressed the front of her skirt down. She pressed her eyelids down, trying to hold back burning tears from her eyes, as the sound of deafening cheering erupted around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEND</span></div></div>",

It's too embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Junpei said. \"Look, you really don't have to tell me. But I'm here to help if you need.\" He turned to go, and then looked back. \"Here, take this,\" he said, tossing her a sewing kit. \"You might want to repair that dress, if you're planning on going back outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Yukari said with a wan smile, and wiping some tears from her eyes. For all his faults, Junpei was a good friend in times of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to go out like that, of course.\" He studied her chest critically. \"Is it really that cold in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Yukari folded her arms over her breasts. \"OUT. RIGHT. NOW.\" She ordered. Some things never change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Junpei out of the room, Yukari turned her attention to the damaged maid outfit. Sewing wasn't her strong suit, but she did have a rough idea on how to do some minor repairs. Over the course of ten minutes, she had deftly stitched her dress back together. \"Not too bad, if I do say so myself,\" she said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out of the storage room, she was greeted by Mitsuru. \"Ah, excellent, Yukari, just in time,\" the taller girl proclaimed.

It's nice to be the star of the show.\" She giggled and flirtingly played with the hem of her skirt. \"What do you think about my handiwork?\" She inquired. \"Do you think that I could be a model?\" She asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei grinned back. \"Not too shabby,\" he exclaimed. \"Although the stitching could use a bit of work.\" He pointed critically to a thread that stood out of place. \"There,\" he said, plucking at it. \"Isn't that better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yukari felt the gaze of everyone in the room snap towards her. The thread, which was holding her maid outfit together, came undone, causing the dress to slide down her shoulders and on to the floor. A hushed silence fell over the room as everyone stared at Yukari, now naked at the front of the class. Quickly, she fell to her knees, clutching the remnants of her now ruin dress against her exposed body.

Wonder if she'll send somebody to look for me? Uh... better not to think of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing to worry about the situation in her classroom, Yukari finally seemed to catch a break. Hidden away in a corner of the roof, obscured by a bench, was a ladder! Rather than a padlock, there was nothing more than a simple latch keeping the small chain-link gate in front of it closed, and Yukari was easily able to pull it open. Cautiously, the topless girl stuck her head through first and looked down to see just where it led. Unfortunately for Yukari, the ladder was located on the front of the school building, meaning she'd be easily visible to anybody looking in the direction of the school; of course, at this time of day, who would be out and about around here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it wasn't as if Yukari had much in the way of a choice. It was either take the ladder or wait on the roof for somebody to inevitably find her in this embarrassing state. Yukari took a moment to brace herself and quickly climbed down onto the ladder, slowing down as the roof disappeared from view. Yukari wasn't thrilled by the fact that she had to let her breasts hang free to properly use the ladder, but at least she was facing a solid wall... at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first scare came when Yukari noticed a slight glare to her left. Turning her head in curiosity, Yukari's heart nearly stopped when she saw an occupied classroom! Thankfully for her, the students were seated away from her, and the teacher was busily writing on the board. Yukari might have been at an awkward angle for anybody in the classroom to notice her, but the fact remained that she -was- visible if anybody happened to look in the right direction. Shutting this scary thought out of her mind, Yukari quickly scampered down. Taking a quick peek down, Yukari was dismayed to notice that the situation was the same for every floor: she'd pass right alongside a window for every level she descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And here I thought things couldn't get any worse.</i>\" Yukari thought to herself. \"<i>What's next?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been better had Yukari not asked herself that question. As she approached the next window, the room that came into view was all too familiar to her: it was her own classroom! Ms. Toriumi was giving a lecture, and facing in the proper direction to notice Yukari on the ladder! Thankfully, it seemed that the teacher was focused on one of the students, apparently waiting for an answer to a question. Not wanting to risk being seen by this particular room full of people, Yukari hastily picked up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in her panicked haste, Yukari failed to step on a rung properly, knocking one of her shoes off and throwing her off balance! For a brief moment, Yukari's hands left the ladder as her body jolted downwards unexpectedly. With terror setting in, Yukari frantically grabbed at the ladder, praying to get her hands back on. Thankfully, Yukari managed to grab the side of the ladder and halt her descent, less fortunately, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari gave a confused look at the stretch of black fabric in Aigis's hand. It hadn't been there a second ago, so where had it come from. With curiosity and dread, Yukari looked down and confirmed the fear in the back of her mind: Aigis had pulled off her skirt! With a strangled cry of surprise, Yukari crossed her legs and slapped her hands down in front of her frilly pink panties, embarrassed to now be even more exposed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis! What did you do?!\" Yukari wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took the necessary steps to defend myself.\" Aigis explained in her calm monotone. \"Since you were unwilling to enter the school halls with your bra exposed, I surmised that you would be even more reticent to pursue me if the entirety of your undergarments were exposed. Understand that I do this with no malice, and only to fulfill my orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been bad enough that Aigis was going to leave her up here with no shirt, but stripping her down to just her underwear?! What was Yukari going to do? Quivering, Yukari pleaded with Aigis once more. \"Please, Aigis, I'm sorry for what I did, but you can't leave me like this! At least give me my skirt back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Yukari-san.\" Aigis responded. \"I can not risk you pursuing me, nor can I risk trusting you to keep your word at this moment. I can offer you no more aid. Good luck.\" With that, Aigis promptly turned around and exited the roof, leaving Yukari alone and in nothing but her underwear, shoes, and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully panicking, Yukari wracked her brain for a course of action. A quick examination of her situation wasn't good. She was alone, in her underwear, on the roof of the school in the middle of the school day. Her absence from class would be noted soon enough and it was likely that somebody would be sent to search for her. Yukari couldn't stay on the roof forever, as much as she'd like to, and she'd need to find some new clothing if she wanted to get out of this with her dignity intact.  The good news was that the end of the lunch hour meant the hallways would be sparsely populated or even empty, as most students would be in their classrooms. In theory, all Yukari would have to worry about were students going to or from the bathroom and any faculty that might be in the halls. Of course, being caught by either of those groups would be a nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much choice, all things considered. Yukari would have to make the run through the school and try for her gym clothes. That meant three flights of stairs, followed by the length of the school building to make it to the gymnasium. Then past whatever class had gym this hour, into the girls' locker room, and then back out before anyone noticed her. Simple, right? Right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, knowing that she was walking into a minefield, Yukari opened the roof access door and took the first step of her long, embarrassing journey.</span></div></div>",

Yukari felt that she didn't necessarily need to be in the club to keep her skills sharp, since she got plenty of real experience with her bow fighting Shadows in Tartarus; however, it was better than not being in any club, and Yukari had to admit that she enjoyed the company of the other club members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, most of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest detriment to Yukari's enjoyment of her club came in the form of Kaya Ebihara, a skilled archer with an ego to match. Yukari was arguably the best member of the club, but Kaya had an abundance of natural talent that practically made up for her lack of real experience. Kaya knew she was good, and she wasn't shy about letting Yukari know. Yukari had been waiting for a chance to put Kaya in her place, and today seemed to be the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Yukari-chan! That was <i>almost</i> a bulls-eye!

I sure do!\" Kaya chirped right back. \"I can prove it, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. An opening, an invitation to make a challenge, and Yukari just couldn't ignore it. If Kaya wanted to talk a big game, she'd learn what it can get her into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, go ahead and prove it. Let's have a contest, the winner is the undisputed superior archer.\" Yukari said, watching Kaya's eyes widen in surprise. She figured she had the other girl off-guard, until she heard the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Yukari-chan! But, how about we make it a bit better? The winner is the best archer, and the loser has to do a forfeit!\" Kaya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confident that she could defeat Kaya, Yukari gladly accepted the addition to the rules.

While Yukari had been reduced to nothing but her simple pink panties and white heart choker (which both had agreed didn't count as an article so much as it was just an accessory), Kaya was still completely dressed, having handily beaten Yukari in every round. The first few rounds Yukari had simply passed off as luck on Kaya's part. It was around the time she was reduced to her skirt, bra, and panties that Yukari realized Kaya had been toying with her this whole time. How long had Kaya been planning this little trap of hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow Yukari, looks like you've got one round left, huh?\" Kaya taunted, relishing her position of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not beaten yet.\" Yukari stammered, though they both knew how empty this statement was. With each loss of clothing, Yukari's aim had grown worse as her nerves built up.

I'll have to do whatever you say. But if I win? Well, you'll be naked of course, but how about... you'll have to do anything I say for an entire week, rather than just the forfeit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's rational mind screamed at her to turn down Kaya's request. The consequences of losing were far too severe and Yukari's chances of winning the next round were far too slim. But Yukari was never one to back down from a challenge, and her rational mind found itself drowned out by her competitive streak. \"You're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Kaya said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next round began, and-</span></div></div>",

And that's when the alarms blared in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You can't do this!\" Yukari blurted out in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agreed to play and you lost, which means you're my slave for the week.\" Kaya was savoring the result as she admonished Yukari \"Fair is fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, isn't this too much?\" Yukari's hands finally caught on and darted to cover her exposed breasts and pussy, the cold air didn't help much \"I-i'll do the forfeit, just tell me what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya sighed and appeared to think for a moment \"Fine, your forfeit is to masturbate here.\" She finally said, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was speechless, she under no circumstances would even consider accepting that forfeit, but she had no choice, it was either this or become Kaya's slave for an entire week, and that was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari bit her lip and closed her eyes as she squeezed her breast with the hand already there, as her other hand began toying with her clit, she tried to forget about Kaya standing right in front of her and watching her about to humiliate herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eased herself down onto her back, legs wide open, her fingers slipped into her lubricated sex, Yukari let out a silent gasp as the other hand pinched her nipple tightly, the hand departed her bosom  and traveled down to her now neglected clitoris, the double assault caused her to forcibly arch her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued, Yukari noticed herself moaning and her hips were gyrating against her will, she was inching closer to orgasm, she had completely forgotten about kaya when:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Yukari-chan, make it look good for the camera!\" Kaya called out, and a single thread of awareness crept back into Yukari's head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Camera?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari opened her eyes and craned her neck to see Kaya, and to her horror, there was the girl holding her phone in her hand and was pointing it at Yukari; she was being filmed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought alone came over Yukari like a tidal wave, her hands went back to working furiously, rubbing her clit and pumping her fingers in and out of her sopping wet hole as energetically as she could, she let out a loud and sexual \"OH YESSS!!\" as her hips bucked upwards and off the ground, her thighs pressing together and closing on her hands as the throes of pleasure overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" Yukari moaned as she pulled out her drenched fingers from inside of her, her juices, no longer plugged up bu her hand, were finally free to flow down her inner thighs and her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done Yukari-chan, I could almost swear you <i>wanted</i> to do this.\" Kaya walked up to Yukari's limp body, which lay crumpled on the ground \"Do you know what this means, Yukari-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya held up the phone to Yukari's face: \"It means you're my slave, whether you want to or not. Now lick those fingers clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, still weak from the haze of the orgasm (both physically and mentally), she lazily lifted her fingers up to her mouth and began sucking them dry, it was her first time tasting the metallic, sour taste of her own love juices, soon enough, her fingers were clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog in her mind was beginning to clear up, it finally dawned on her, she was Kaya's slave from now on.</span></div></div>",

You don't get all of that back. You get... let's say two pieces of clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't believe what she was hearing. Just two things? She was supposed to get back to her dorm with just two pieces of clothing on? That was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Kaya, that's just ridiculous. You've gotta let me take more than that.\" Yukari pleaded, though she quickly regretted doing so as she saw Kaya's eyes narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've 'gotta'? I wasn't aware I was taking orders from you. Just for that...\"</span></div></div>",

It was dangerously close on a few occasions, of course. Particularly when she was forced to hide underneath a bench as a group of students from her own school sat and talked for what felt like forever. Yukari also couldn't be sure whether or not that car horn she had heard a few streets back had been from a driver that had seen her or just normal traffic noise. In any case, she was home free. All she had to do was make it to her room and she could put the events of the day behind her. Tomorrow, well... she would cross that bridge when she got to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Yukari realized her big mistake. She hadn't considered the very real possibility of one of the other members of SEES loitering around the lobby. It wasn't as if such a thing was uncommon, as the alternatives in the evenings were fairly limited to their own rooms or the few places still open after sundown. While Yukari was lucky enough to have come in to find the lobby relatively empty, she wasn't lucky enough to find it completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan! Oh my goodness, what happened to you?!\" Minako Arisato, the SEES leader and Yukari's classmate gasped, running over to her friend with concern in her eyes. \"Were you attacked, are you okay, did anyone hurt you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Yukari considered telling Minako all about what had happened with Kaya, about the competition and the video and the demands for tomorrow. But how could she tell her friend something so humiliating? And what would Kaya do if Minako decided to confront her about it? Would she release the video as punishment, would she somehow work this to her advantage? It was a scary possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Minako was a stalwart friend, and she'd be willing to do just about anything to help a friend in need. Her help could be exactly what Yukari needed.</span></div></div>",

So, without bothering to redress herself, Yukari sat in her room and kept an eye on the clock. Every minute felt like an eternity as midnight drew closer. Finally, the clock struck twelve, and the familiar pallor of the Dark Hour set over the city. All normal citizens, those that lacked the potential of Persona, were transformed into coffins where they stood, and all electronics ceased to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the perfect cover for Yukari to test her theory. Quietly stepping out of her room, making sure to leave the door ajar and unlocked, Yukari crept down to the lobby and out the front door. Curious, Yukari wondered where the best place to test her theory would be. Then it dawned upon her- the strip mall! While the stores may have been closed, it was still a somewhat popular gathering for people after dark, and would be sure to have more than a few coffins standing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Yukari reached her destination, greeted by the sight of several dozen coffins. All she had to do was imagine that they were conscious people, and her theory would be put to the test. Sure enough, Yukari felt that familiar stirring between her legs, and she found herself subconsciously squeezing one of her breasts as her other hand crept down between her legs. Doing her best to focus, Yukari decided to push things just one step further. Choosing a coffin, Yukari sat herself down in front of it, spreading her legs wide and going to town on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most incredible feeling Yukari had ever experienced. The idea that she could potentially be seen were it not for the Dark Hour. It was absolutely thrilling. So thrilling, in fact, that Yukari soon lost track of time...</span></div></div>",

She was the captain of the archery team, and that meant she had an image to maintain and respect to command. The rest of the team would never take her seriously again if she let Kaya control her like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, Yukari resolutely made her way to the practice range.

Yukari felt a small part of herself consider going in, playing things safe rather than risking Kaya's wrath. Shaking her head, Yukari dispelled these thoughts, reminding herself that she'd still have to walk across the majority of the school from here, and there was no way she was about to do that. Especially not after her realization last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Yukari stood at the entrance to the practice range. Yukari could hear the rest of the team on the other side, already gathered and gossiping as they waited for their captain to show up. Yukari heard the entire team erupt into laughter as she slid the door open, revealing the girls all huddled around Kaya's phone! Was she showing them the video?! If that was what they were laughing at, her reputation was already in tatters. Still, it might have just been something unrelated. Yukari had to hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Kaya locked eyes with Yukari, a look of surprise crossing her face as she noticed Yukari was still fully dressed. \"Captain? What a surprise, we were just talking about you! What are you doing here dressed like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let you control me, Kaya!\" Yukari snapped, drawing the attention of the entire room to her. \"I'm still the Captain of this team, and I'm not about to let my authority be undermined by you and your sick blackmail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackmail? Captain, I have no idea what you're talking about.\" Kaya said, a sweet smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even start with the innocent routine!\" Yukari shot back. \"Girls, get Kaya's phone and bring it to me. She has something on it that needs to be deleted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence as the rest of the team took in the situation.

She could have said she was being blackmailed and gotten sympathy, maybe even help.  Saying she lost a bet would probably result in a black mark on her record, but she still would have kept a good image afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, now she was just a pervert.  A slut her threw away her clothes for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sat down on the floor to remove her footwear in its entirety.  After all, her socks and shoes had counted during her match against Kaya yesterday, so why wouldn't they now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you Yukari Takeba?  After all I'd heard about you, I didn't think that you'd do something so... outrageous.\"  Yukari didn't even consider denying who she was.  After all, if she's going to walk to archery practice naked, she might as well let everyone know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and started to slide her panties down her legs as she gave her damning reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I, Yukari Takeba, am an exhibitionist, and I'm throwing away my clothes before I head to Archery practice.  You can come watch if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure why she offered that.  Maybe she just wanted one more person to see her humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties slid down her legs until, finally, she stepped out of them and tossed them in the garbage can next to her, leaving her wearing nothing more than her heart choker and a smile.  And make no mistake, she was smiling.  She'd came as she tossed away the last of her clothing, knowing that there was no turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a feeling that she'd be cumming more than a few times just during her walk to practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd almost forgotten about her \"guest\" when the girl spoke up.  \"Heh, maybe I will come watch.  Mind if I bring some friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more the merrier.  If I'm going to do this, might as well get the most out of it possible.

Can't threaten her with something that's already happened, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she  thought that, she headed out the doorway to go to Archery practice, naked as a jaybird.</span></div></div>",

The notion of preserving her decency forgotten, Yukari's arms pumped by her sides as her breasts bounced freely and the glistening liquid coating her inner thighs shone in the moonlight. The soft padding of her feet against the concrete almost matched the rhythm of Yukari's beating heart. Doing her best to fight back the welling tears, Yukari berated herself mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she been thinking?! Sauntering out into the middle of the strip mall with nothing on, Dark Hour or no, was absolutely irresponsible. Not to mention her lack of attention to the passage of time had just resulted in her putting everything on display to a sizable group of absolute strangers. The only saving grace Yukari could take from this was that everyone had been so surprised that none had thought to pull out a camera. Kaya having blackmail material on Yukari was bad enough, but people she didn't even know? There's no telling what they'd do with such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind so preoccupied with her self-admonishment and her eyes blurring from the welling tears, Yukari's awareness of her surroundings was poor to say the least. Rounding a corner just a bit too fast, Yukari felt herself come to a sudden stop as she plowed straight into something; something too hard to be an inanimate object, Yukari quickly realized that she had plowed into some<i>one</i>, not some<i>thing</i>. Worse yet, the speed with which she had collided with this person had landed Yukari in such a way that the other person was on top of Yukari, pinning her to the ground with their own body. In fact, Yukari could see (with a sense of dread) that she and the other person had fallen in such a way that the other person's face was mere inches away from Yukari's splayed crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great deal of fear, Yukari tried to glimpse the face of whoever she had run into, and she saw-</span></div></div>",

How in the world was she supposed to explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the-?\" Mitsuru asked in shock, trying to make sense of what just happened. Craning her head down to see who's legs her face was between, Mitsuru's eyes widened in shock and a hint of anger as she saw one of her SEES colleagues. \"Takeba? What is the meaning of this? Why on earth are you running around outside completely naked? There had better be a good explanation for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtricating herself from Mitsuru, Yukari hastily did her best to cover herself as she quivered under the judging stare of her senior. Yukari knew she'd need to come up with something good to fool Mitsuru, and if she didn't... well, best not to think of what the Kirijo heiress might do to punish her behavior. Unable to look Mitsuru in the eyes, Yukari began to speak, making up the story off the top of her head as she went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mitsuru-senpai! I'm so glad to see you! I was taking a little walk, and I thought I'd be back at the dorm before the Dark Hour, so I didn't take my evoker or anything.\" Yukari began, her words blurring at points as she quickly stammered. \"Then I lost track of time and it was the Dark Hour, and I got ambushed by Shadows. I knew I couldn't fight them, so I tried to run away. But... they kept trying to attack me, and they got a few luck hits in. Thing is, every time they got a hold of me, they pulled something off. Before I knew it, I was completely naked, and I just wanted to get back to the dorm! That's what I was doing when I came around the corner and ran into you, senpai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence as the last of Yukari's words faded into the night. Mitsuru stood, her eyes studying Yukari intensely. Yukari knew her story was far-fetched. Being stripped by Shadows? The idea that their attacks only managed to tear off her clothing was ludicrous at best, but then again, Shadows were still very mysterious. Mitsuru might accept the attack as that of a new type of Shadow. Yukari could only hope that Mitsuru would come to such a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Mitsuru opened her mouth and began to speak. </span></div></div>",

Never in all my years of dealing with these creatures has anyone ever gotten away with only losing their dignity.  It is so outrageous, that I am very sure that everything you said right now was a complete fabrication.  The fact that you did not keep your Evoker with you at such a late hour also supports this, or at best indicates a sudden bout of blatant stupidity or wanton recklessness I would never have expected from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari cringed, her last ounce of hope fading fast.  She wanted to turn her head away, at the very least escape that cold glare of Mitsuru's... but found that she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet...\" Mitsuru paused, closing her eyes for a few scant seconds before opening them again.  \"I find that I truly believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Yukari gasped, nearly letting go of herself in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never known you to lie, Takeba.  You have always been a serious young woman, sometimes prone to getting caught up in your emotions, I'll admit, but if someone were to go on an exhibition parade during the Dark Hour, my first guess would be Iori, if he was inebriated or under the influence of some drug.  You are not that type of person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't believe this.  Mitsuru was... reassuring her?  \"I'm surprised you believe me,\" Yukari sighed, then immediately wished she hadn't said that, in case Mitsuru would now doubt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so hasty,\" Mitsuru said, shaking her head.  \"On its own, your story is worthless, but provided what happened earlier this year, at the hotel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hotel...?\" Yukari asked, searching her mind.  \"Ah!  You mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do,\" Mitsuru nodded.  \"The Arcana Shadow of 'The Lovers,' where you, me, Arisato, and Sanada were all hypnotized without our realizing it.  What I hadn't told anyone, however, was that during the hypnosis,\" she turned to the side, a little rosy red tinge pooling in her cheeks at recalling the memory.  \"I had been made to shower and wear naught but a towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just what happened to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well!?\" Mitsuru gasped, a rare emotion indeed from the stoic heiress.  \"Then perhaps there is a new behavior occurring here.  Even now I have no clue why that shadow did that, save for it's oddly apropos name.  And furthermore, when you ran into me just now, you appeared to be exhausted, panting and covering in sweat.  It is without a doubt that that was a result from your harrowing escape.  From what you have told me, it may be possible that you ran into some shadows related to that monstrosity.  Perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari swallowed, a new chill running along her body.  Everything she had told Mitsuru was complete hogwash designed only to excuse her mistake from her own personal issues.  But after being reminded of that strange night, where she, clad only in a towel that left nothing to the imagination, nearly threw herself into Minako's arms, she began to worry whether there really were shadows like the completely fake, totally-not-real-so-stop-worrying-about-it Shadows that behaved like that.  \"A-Anyways,\" Yukari stuttered, shaking the nasty thoughts out of her head.  \"Can't we get back to the dorms now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course!\" Mitsuru blinked, snapped back from her thoughts.  \"Forgive me.  Let us be on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mitsuru's help, Yukari was able to make it back to the dorms safe and sound without any other late-nighters catching a glimpse of her.  With everyone else tucked away in their bedrooms, Yukari was able to return to her own in peace.  Pausing only to put on some pajamas, she threw herself onto her bed and under the covers, where she fell asleep in a matter of moments.  Of course, there was still Kaya and her blackmail ploy to worry about on Monday, but she would just have to cross that bridge when she came to it.  Sunday was still ahead of her, and right now she was just glad she could put this little ordeal behind her and be done with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was her plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari awoke to a beautiful sunny day just a little before noon, grateful for the extra sleep.  That warm feeling lasted through her breakfast, until she awoke enough to remember that tomorrow was going to be absolutely horrible thanks to Kaya.  If making her walk home naked from school was just a warm-up, then she was sure to be put through the wringer the next time they met.  Her despair was quickly interrupted with a slam of the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukari-chan!\" Minako's voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Minako-chan,\" Yukari replied.  &lt;i&gt;Maybe I should tell her...  I don't see any other way out of this other than becoming Kaya's slave...&lt;/i&gt; she thought to herself.  \"Hey, Minako-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Me first!\" the energetic girl interrupted, rushing over to Yukari's side.  \"You slept through it, but Mitsuru-senpai's scheduled an emergency meeting at 6:00 tonight.  She wouldn't tell us anything specific, but knowing her, it's gotta be important.  Any thoughts on what it's going to be about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\" Yukari said, taking a sudden interest in her cereal bowl.  Did it have anything to do with last night!?  She thought she had escaped Mitsuru's wrath, but what if she had only pretended to believe her, to make her think she was safe and striking when she was weak, as well as making her punishment public throughout the group?  Next to Mitsuru, Kaya was just an insignificant gnat, even if that gnat could ruin her whole life with the push of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, knowing her,\" Minako continued.  It's probably going to be about scaling Tartarus again.  Skip off one day, pay for it the next, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" Yukari muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's that, I guess,\" Minako shrugged.  \"So, what were you going to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Right!  Well...\" Yukari struggled.  If she told Minako about Kaya now, she would surely bring it up at the meeting, and then not only would everyone know about the blackmail video, but then Mitsuru would put two and two together and learn that she was lying for sure!  If she chose to tell Minako, she would have to do so later tonight, after Mitsuru's meeting.  \"Just wanted to know if you were free to hang out today,\" she continued smoothly.  \"Have some fun before we get down to business, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Minako beamed.  \"Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Sunday passed all too quickly.  Yukari truly had a fun day with Minako, despite taking one hour for Minako to, of all things, talk with a sickly man at the Naganaki Shrine playground.  Whatever, there were still plenty of things they did regardless.  After finishing up with a nice, piping hot bowl of ramen, the two made their way back to the dorm, and the briefing room within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, Yukari and Minako found that the room was occupied only by Mitsuru and Aigis, their android ally, and no one else.  \"Welcome, Takeba, Arisato,\" Mitsuru nodded.  \"Now we are ready to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With just us?  What about the others?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" Minako said, smacking her forehead.  The meeting's only for us four.  I thought I told you, Yukari-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent Yamagishi and the others to Tartarus,\" Mitsuru stated.  \"I wanted to keep this as discreet as possible, considering this concerns what we discussed last night, Takeba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stiffened all over.  She was right, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What's this about?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am also curious, Mitsuru-san,\" Aigis spoke, as formally as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you... that is, if I have Takeba's consent to do so,\" she motioned to Yukari.  \"If it is too personal, you can always refuse, though for what I have planned, it would be wise to go with a full party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, go ahead...\" Yukari sighed.  To be honest, she didn't want the lie to spread, but she didn't want to make Mitsuru suspicious.  If Mitsuru knew, then there was no reason Yukari had to keep the story from their battle leader, Minako, as well.  And Aigis, being a robot, didn't care one bit about nudity, male or female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru explained to the group everything Yukari had told her, and of her own suspicions regarding the Shadow of the hotel possibly being related to this new behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean, there's shadows that want to strip people naked?\" Minako gasped.  \"I'd never heard of this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely, yes,\" Mitsuru lowered her head in thought. \"But if the Shadows were attempting to kill Yukari, I believe that they would not have been satisfied with just her clothes.  No, the disrobing had to have been deliberate.  I'm not sure what we can do with this, but I believe this warrants further investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's heart pounded in her chest.  This was getting out of hand.  She needed to stop this, but she couldn't just admit to all of them that the reason she was naked was because she had her clothes off to begin with!  And so Yukari remained silent as Mitsuru continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This brings us to the purpose of our mission,\" Mitsuru explained.  \"Tonight, we will-\"</span></div></div>",

The four of us shall return to the site of your attack and wait for any Shadows to attack.\" Mitsuru said. \"However, in order to recreate the conditions as accurately as possible, we will need to do this unarmed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai, isn't that dangerous? I mean, inviting Shadows to attack us without our weapons? That just sounds like a risky plan to me.\" Minako said, her fears shared with Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru nodded, crossing her arms in a defensive manner. \"I realize the danger, and that is why Aigis will accompany us, and we will have our weapons and evokers hidden nearby. Should the Shadows appear, retrieving the gear necessary to protect ourselves should be a trivial matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if Mitsuru had planned out the experiment as thoroughly as possible. After all, Aigis was an android designed specifically to combat Shadows, and the stash of weapons helped give the other two ladies peace of mind. So, with their gear stored safely in a large box, the four SEES members set out into the night. With Yukari leading the way back to the site of her \"attack,\" Mitsuru and the others couldn't see the worried look on Yukari's face. There was no way this could end well for the young woman; either nothing would happen and Mitsuru would get suspicious, or they'd get attacked by Shadows. Seeing as the stripping Shadows Yukari had told Mitsuru about were completely made up, at least so far as any of them were aware, that would only serve to further discredit Yukari's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the strip mall, Yukari signaled to the others that they'd reached the right place. While Minako and Mitsuru looked for a good place to hide their box of gear, Yukari tried her best to look inconspicuous and avoid eye contact with anybody in the area. The -last- thing she needed was to see someone from last night's accidental audience. At about three minutes to midnight, however, Yukari heard a snicker and hushed whispers nearby. Looking around, she found the source of the noise to be two younger men, both looking in her direction. Yukari's cheeks burned with embarrassment when she recognized on of them from the other night, likely sharing the story of what he saw with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Yukari, she didn't have to endure their gaze for too long. The night sky shifted from its deep blue to an eerie green, and all sound around the four women ceased instantaneously. The Dark Hour was finally upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so it begins.\" Mitsuru said. \"Keep a low profile, but stay alert. We don't want the Shadows to know we're expecting them, lest we taint the experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the four young women went about their business, trying their best to seem relaxed as they waited to see what would happen. For the first half of the Dark Hour, absolutely nothing seemed to happen. With no ambient sound to break the silence of the night, Minako quickly grew restless, taking to pacing back and forth as she waited for something to happen. Mitsuru pretended to check her nails and examine herself in her compact, though Yukari assumed she was likely using the mirror to keep an eye on what was behind her. Aigis, well... Aigis simply stood completely still, lacking the need for stimulation that her human counterparts seemed to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba, are you sure we've recreated conditions as precisely as possible?\" Mitsuru finally asked, breaking the quiet of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah... of course!\" Yukari nervously stammered. Mitsuru was starting to get suspicious, this was bad news... \"I mean, do you think I'm leaving something out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's simply that we have yet to see any signs of Shadow activity. Perhaps if there was something else about your situation at the time of attack, some kind of activity or noise that we should replicate, we might see better results.\" Mitsuru answered steadily, her voice betraying no accusations or suspicion, though Yukari wasn't sure whether the tone was natural or forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai has a point, Yukari-chan.\" Minako chimed in, finally breaking from her pacing. \"I mean, anything for the sake of figuring out what's going on, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Aigis said, surprising the other three who had almost forgotten that the robot was even present. \"For the sake of tonight's mission, no details should be left out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHIS was what Yukari had been afraid of. Now Yukari had everyone's eyes on her, and she wasn't sure she could come up with a decent lie this time (not that her lie last time had been decent, but that was beside the point). Feeling her knees begin to shake, Yukari opened her mouth to speak. \"I... uh, well...\"-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Yukari desperately tried to think of a halfway decent way to deflect any possible suspicion, she noticed a slight movement from behind Mitsuru. It took a moment for Yukari to fully realize what she'd seen, but realization dawned quickly enough: it was a Shadow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai, behind you!\" Yukari cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening in surprise, Mitsuru spun around just in time for the Shadow to crash into her midsection. The impact sent the redhead flailing to the ground, the dark creature's arms wrapped tightly around her. Shortly after hitting the ground, the sound of tearing fabric could be heard. From the sudden reddening of her cheeks and the look of shock on her face, it was plainly obvious where the sound was coming from. The Shadow was actually trying to tear off Mitsuru's blouse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly, get it off me! Aigis, destroy it!\" Mitsuru shouted, desperately pushing at the mass of darkness currently wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The risk of friendly fire is too great.\" Aigis stated, her robotic tone giving away a hint of despair. \"I cannot engage without injuring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mitsuru could even get her next sentence out, the imperiled redhead felt a shift in the creature's weight. With the sound of a great tear, the Shadow went flying off Mitsuru, her now ruined blouse still in its grip. Looking up, Mitsuru saw her savior: Minako, her foot still raised from a strong kick, looked on in surprise and slight embarrassment as she realized what she'd just facilitated. Quickly regaining her senses, Minako knelt down, helping Mitsuru back to her feet while studiously trying to look anywhere but at her senpai's newly exposed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls jumped at the sound of gunfire. With the Shadow now separated from Mitsuru, Aigis must have felt safe to engage the enemy, riddling the dark creature with dozens of bullets. The Shadow writhed in pain, went still, and dissipated. To everyone's shock, however, the ripped blouse in its hands dissipated along with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-impossible!\" Mitsuru stammered out. \"Why would my blouse disappear with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A question for a later time, senpai!\" Minako said, hurrying to where the group's weapons were hidden. \"We're not done yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the other three women realized that Minako was right. They were far from done; a small swarm of Shadows had managed to find them while they were focused on Yukari. With their ambush turned around on them, the element of surprise was on the Shadows' side! The mass of dark creatures didn't waste any time in pressing the attack, closing in as Minako desperately tried to distribute the weapons and Evokers to Mitsuru and Yukari. So focused was Minako, in fact, that she failed to notice a Shadow approaching her until it had leaped up and grabbed onto her skirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek! NO!\" Minako screamed, swatting at the Shadow. However, the creature didn't seem to mind, roughly yanking on Minako's skirt in spite of her blows. With the sound of a failing zipper, the Shadow pulled its prize right off Minako's legs, leaving the young lady with her panties openly on display! As the Shadow pulled away from Minako, Aigis quickly adjusted her stance, taking aim at the offending creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis, don't shoot!\" Yukari shouted, doing her best to avoid the Shadows trying to advance on her at the same time. \"If you kill it now, the skirt will disappear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this exposed a different problem. The Shadow with Minako's skirt, now with its prize and not under attack, quickly skittered away into the night, its retreat covered by the swarm of Shadows that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're screwed either way!\" Minako cried, awkwardly trying to cover her panties while wielding her polearm. \"We've gotta kill them before they can grab anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically trying to fend off the sudden attack, the four SEES operatives fought bravely. With their dignity on the line, the battlefield was a mess of nerves, fear, and adrenaline. Still, the four were vastly outnumbered, and it was simply impossible to fend off every advancing Shadow. As it was, their only hope was to hold off the attack until the end of the Dark Hour without losing too much. The four women fought their hardest, and as the Dark Hour finally came to an end and the sky returned to its natural dark blue, the outcome of the battle was-</span></div></div>",

We've always fought Shadows fully clothed, so, in order to determine if our state of dress has an impact, we'll have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we're gonna fight Shadows naked?!\" Yukari gasped, finishing the sentence Mitsuru couldn't bring herself to complete. \"Senpai, that's just- that's ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not ecstatic about this either, Takeba. However, this Shadow behavior has to be studied to make sure it won't pose a serious threat in the future.\" Mitsuru explained, regaining a bit of her normal commanding stature. \"And besides, if it's just the four of us, it won't be too embarrassing. Would you rather have Iori or Akihiko present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru had a point, at least she would if this experiment was based on something that had actually happened. As it stood, Mitsuru was preparing to have the three of them (not counting Aigis for obvious reasons) fight Shadows naked for essentially no reason. It had been bad enough when she was naked alone, but the idea of running around with two of her friends in a similar state? Talk about embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako raised her hand at this point, waiting for Mitsuru's nod of approval before speaking. \"Uh, senpai, if Fuuka-chan and the others are in Tartarus, where are we going to do this experiment? I mean, don't Shadows usually stay in Tartarus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, yes.\" Mitsuru explained. \"However, there are usually a few stragglers on any given night, mostly prowling for people who aren't in coffins and lack the potential to summon Personas. As such, these stragglers are usually in high-population areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High population? You mean... you can't possibly mean we're going to do this downtown?!\" Yukari gasped. Didn't Mitsuru realize the dangers of something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I do. However, that's another reason we have Aigis with us. Her internal clock can keep track of the Dark Hour and how long we have before things return to normal. So long as Aigis is with us, we'll know when it's time to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Mitsuru had thought of everything. So, with an increasingly nervous Yukari in tow, the four SEES members made their way through the city streets, waiting for the Dark Hour to fall. Past the Moonlight Bridge that connected Port Island with the rest of Iwatodai, Mitsuru finally decided on a good spot. Sure enough, there were plenty of people going about their business, unaware of the impending Dark Hour, and paying no mind to the four young women with concealed weaponry. In an instant, the buzz of noise from the people stopped and the sky took on an eerie green glow. Coffins stood where there were once people, and blood had appeared on surfaces all over. The Dark Hour had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time.\" Mitsuru said, slowly reaching for the buttons on her blouse. \"Everyone, please disrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was awkward as the girls undressed, the three humans unwilling to look each other in the eye, or anywhere else for that matter. The only one not bothered was Aigis, who stood watch. Once the other three were finished Mitsuru spoke up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now we wait. Assuming we encounter a Shadow, we are all to keep an eye on its behavior. We know their normal behavior, so take note of anything unusual. We have to get to the bottom of this. Aigis, how long do we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark Hour will end in fifty-four minutes and sixteen seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. We've got almost an hour, so let's make the most of it. Keep your eyes peeled for Shadows everyone. Aigis, please notify us at every ten minute interval of remaining time, then every minute of the last five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the majority of the Dark Hour had passed without incident, Minako let out an irritated sigh. \"Come on! After all we did for this experiment we can't get a single Shadow to show up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If nothing appears tonight, we'll simply have to repeat the experiment another day.\" Mitsuru said, leaning against a nearby wall. Minako and Yukari both let out another sigh at Mitsuru's declaration; one night had been ridiculous enough, but now Mitsuru was going to make them keep this up? A Shadow had better appear soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Aigis sunk into her battle pose, fingertips retracting as she readied her machine guns. \"Shadow sighted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are! Get ready everyone, and keep your eyes peeled!\" Mitsuru called, grabbing up her rapier and evoker, Yukari and Minako close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several Shadows, enough for each girl to have her hands full. Blows were exchanged, Personas were summoned, and victory was achieved. By the end of it, the three human SEES members were panting in exhaustion. The fight hadn't been as easy as they'd hoped. Indeed, things had been a bit dicey until Minako busted out her strongest Personas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Nothing unusual about their behavior\" Mitsuru noted. \"It seems that our clothing had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gulped. Mitsuru was about to figure out that it had all been a lie! She was doomed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's only certain types of Shadow. Or it was the fact that we had our evokers.\" Mitsuru continued, resulting in an unnoticed sigh of relief from Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes remaining in the Dark Hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five? Oh, wow. Guys, we need to get dressed quickly!\" Minako said, dashing back to where she and the others had left their clothes. However, what Minako and the others saw was-</span></div></div>",

I've been dealing with Shadows for years now, and if any of them practiced such deviant behavior I'd have encountered it by now.\" Mitsuru said, her tone stern and her face a mask of anger. \"Now give me the truth. What in the world are you doing out here completely naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Yukari wracked her brain for another excuse. She couldn't tell Mitsuru the truth, she just couldn't! Aside from being humiliating, it would likely enrage Yukari's senpai to hear that Yukari had stepped out into the night like this willingly. Sadly for Yukari, she spent too long trying to come up with a better cover story, and the naked brunette found herself being grabbed by the shoulder by her angry redheaded senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba! I am waiting, and you'd better not try lying to me again. You do NOT want to make me any angrier than I already am.\" Mitsuru said, her grip on Yukari's shoulder reinforcing her iron will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Yukari saw no option but to tell Mitsuru the truth. How she had left the dorm like this, the incident at the station, losing track of time and the Dark Hour ending with her exposing herself completely. With every word from Yukari's mouth, Mitsuru's demeanor grew darker. By the time Yukari was done, Mitsuru was almost shaking with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is wrong with you?\" Mitsuru hissed. \"Exposing yourself, <i>playing with yourself</i> in public, going out during the Dark Hour without your Evoker?! What if a Shadow had attacked, what then? And did you consider the ramifications of you essentially appearing out of midair in front of all those people? Do you have any idea what kind of damage control the Kirijo Group will need to do for that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm sorry, senpai.\" Yukari mumbled, unable to look Mitsuru in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. You're not sorry. Not yet.\" Mitsuru said, now yanking Yukari along and pulling her into a side alley. \"You will be sorry after your punishment, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunishment? Hadn't humiliating herself been enough? But Yukari knew better than to argue with Mitsuru right now. Instead, she simply hung her head in shame and listened to Mitsuru declare her punishment.</span></div></div>",

At first, the only thing Yukari heard was the sharp click of Mitsuru's boots against the pavement, the older girl pacing back and forth. Yukari's heart was racing, each passing moment where Mitsuru did nothing making the quivering brunette more and more apprehensive. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of waiting, Yukari felt the sharp sting of a hand slapping against her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari jumped up with a yelp, her hands leaving the wall to grab her afflicted rear end. This proved to be a mistake as Yukari felt another slap, this time against her uncovered hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands back against the wall!\" Mitsuru snapped. \"Disobey again and your punishment will be worsened! You should honestly consider yourself lucky that I decided not to simply execute you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had only heard whispered rumors of Mitsuru's \"executions.\" Nobody knew exactly what they entailed except those who had suffered them, and those victims all refused to speak of it. If there was one thing Yukari knew at the moment, it was that she didn't want to push Mitsuru to execution. Reluctantly, Yukari returned her hands to the wall, going back to her previous position with her posterior on proper display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" Mitsuru said, her voice returning to its calm demeanor. \"Now, we will continue this punishment until I feel you have learned your lesson. Any more deviations from my orders will result in decidedly unpleasant consequences for you. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari meekly nodded her understanding, her confirmation being quickly met with another sharp swat to her rear. Yukari managed to keep her hands planted on the wall this time, though she couldn't hold back the gasp of pain. This repeated for a good dozen spanks before Yukari's demeanor began to change. Slowly, Yukari's gasps of pain began to morph into gasps of a different nature. The stinging in her cheeks began to take on a somewhat pleasing feel, much to Yukari's shock and confusion. Craning her head to look down at herself, Yukari confirmed her suspicions with the sight of glistening moisture between her legs. Was she honestly getting turned on by Mitsuru's spanking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru! What would she do if she found out Yukari was apparently starting to enjoy this? This was supposed to be a punishment and Yukari was enjoying it. Mitsuru would likely see this as a complete circumvention of her authority, or even worse, what if she assumed Yukari had wanted her to spank her in the first place? However, there was nothing Yukari could do but desperately hope that Mitsuru didn't notice her state of arousal.</span></div></div>",

What really happened?\" Minako pressed, the concern for her friend breaking down Yukari's resistance to keeping everything secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back the tears, Yukari told Minako everything. Well, almost everything- the contest, Yukari's loss, the video (though Yukari didn't mention the exact contents of said video. That was simply too much to share), and her orders for tomorrow. With every new part of the story to come out of Yukari's mouth, Minako's expression grew angrier. By the end, the normally reserved and cheerful girl was practically fuming. The idea that somebody would subject one of her friends to such a humiliating experience made the SEES leader's blood boil and she had no trouble making the fact known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks she can get away with this?!\" Minako raged, barely keeping her voice down enough to keep others from investigating the lobby. \"She humiliates my friend and thinks she can get away with demanding more of her? Blackmailing her?! That's too far! Yukari, I'm coming with you to your practice tomorrow. I'm confronting her and we are settling this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was in no position to argue. Once Minako set her mind on something there was no stopping her, and this kind of reaction was what Yukari was kind of hoping for when she decided to tell Minako the truth. With an enraged Minako on her side, things were bound to improve. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next school day passed calmly enough, with the exception of the feeling of dread in the pit of Yukari's stomach. Every class period brought her closer to the zero hour, when Minako would confront Kaya and hopefully end all of this. Soon enough, the final bell rang and classes were over for the day. Minako wasted no time in coming to Yukari's side and reminding the girl that she had her support. Bolstered somewhat by her friend's resolve, Yukari walked down to the school archery range. Minako and Yukari weren't surprised to see Kaya waiting outside the entrance to the range, though Kaya was surprised to see Yukari still fully clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba, what do you think you're doing?\" Kaya asked. \"You know the deal. Do you <i>want</i> your image to be ruined?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do you think <i>you're</i> doing?!\" Minako shot back before Yukari could even open her mouth. \"Blackmailing her?

Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya was taken aback at the sudden verbal assault from Minako. After a moment, however, her surprise was replaced by a look more akin to a cat eyeing its prey. \"Oh my, it seems Yukari couldn't keep her mouth shut. Told you all about her little lost bet, hm? Tell you what, I'll delete the video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?

While she had no idea of the extent this would go to back then, it was true that she had originally suggested the contest and agreed to Kaya's terms.

There weren't many things that could get under her skin so badly, but having a friend put themselves on the line for her and being unable to help herself was one of them.  But, Minako always seemed to be able to bring her spirits up at her worst.  It wasn't her words, really, but more the spirit behind those words; the spirit of someone who would never give up and see everyone safely to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Yukari sniffed.  \"Just, be careful, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" Minako replied, and turned to face Kaya.  \"One piece per round, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, and because I'm such a good sport, I'll even let you go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari watched as Minako grabbed a nearby bow and quiver and took her place at the shooting range.  Despite the high stakes that the girl was undoubtedly facing, she seemed calm and focused.  \"Maybe she <i>can</i> beat her,\" Yukari thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and one more thing,\" Kaya said, having moved to the nearby fieldhouse wall for some reason, apparently to hang her purse on the wall.  \"My phone with the video is in this bag.

I'll be watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth SEES girls remained silent.  \"Why didn't I think of overpowering her and going for the phone?\" Yukari thought, smacking her forehead.  \"Argh, it's too late now I guess.  It's all in Minako's hands now.\"  She could only hope that the girl had it in her to beat Kaya at her own game.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari's hopes, fleeting as they were, unfortunately proceeded to be crushed.  Just as it was for her own experience, each shot of Kaya's proceeded to fly true to the center circle.  Granted, Minako's first few shots landed on the target's outer ring, but her later shots flew quite close to the bullseye as the contest went on.  Still, with each piece of clothing Minako had to forfeit to Kaya, who for her part callously tossed them over her shoulder, Yukari fell further and further into despair.  The fact that Kaya kept an arrow ready to be drawn and shot at either of them if they made a break for it didn't help matters, especially with the phone and that damned video so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, Yukari-chan!  Eyes on the game,\" Kaya said when Yukari's attention drew to the bag near the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if Kaya would be so bold as to follow through on her threat, but Yukari wasn't going to chance it with Minako's life on the line as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Minako remained calm, not speaking at all in anger or otherwise towards Kaya's playful, yet sinister taunts after claiming each round, and giving Yukari a reassuring grin every now and then.  However, Yukari could tell that the other girl was feeling highly embarrassed too, her face blushing ever-so-slightly once she started losing important garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the seventh round had neared.  Just as before, Kaya remained fully dressed, and Minako was down to a pair of white, simple panties, having lost her shoes, socks, belt, skirt, blouse, and bra, in that order.  Her cheeks were quite red at this point, clearly embarrassed as she struggled to cover herself and ready her possible final shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, down to the last round already,\" said Kaya.  \"You know, you're too good of a friend for Yukari-chan.  I never thought someone would go so far for such an uptight bitch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't help but wince at that remark.  Just how much did this girl have it in for her?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako turned towards Kaya, her expression unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?\" Kaya said mockingly.  \"I'm just telling it like it is.  Her archery's mediocre, at best, and more often than not she just keeps to herself all day long.  How can someone like that be so popular at this school?\" her grip tightened on her bow as her talking grew into a rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  You mean this, all this: the contest, the humiliation... is just a popularity contest to you?\" Yukari burst out, fists clenched so hard that her nails began to dig into her palms.  \"All of this is just plain old jealousy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya's glare narrowed at Yukari, her facial expression contorting into one of anger and frustration.  But, just as quickly as it appeared, she shook her head, smirked, and said, \"Just a difference of opinion, really.  <b>I</b> have nothing to be jealous about.  I'm just... giving everyone else the chance to see things from my point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kaya turned around to Minako, who had spoken.  The girl's posture, which was beginning to cringe moments before, now stood erect and tall.  Yukari couldn't help but stare, not just because Minako was currently half-naked with her breasts exposed, but rather her aura? presence, perhaps? now exuded command and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ends here, Kaya,\" Minako stated.  \"With this shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she turned around, took her stance, and drew back the arrow in one fluid motion.  Pausing a few moments to steady her aim, she waited, and released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow flew steady, far, and true, landing within the center circle, right along the edge of the bullseye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  Yukari cheered, running towards Minako and giving her friend a great, big hug.  Minako, abruptly shaken from her concentration state, returned the hug, somewhat awkwardly as she was still holding the bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff. Showoff,\" Kaya scoffed.  \"Step aside amateurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair watched as Kaya readied herself and took her shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Yukari cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it.  Against all odds, Kaya's shot had landed perfectly within the bullseye mark at the center circle.  Minako had been defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no!\" Yukari continued, breaking out into tears as she clutched Minako close to her.  \"It can't be true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan...\" Minako said, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, don't keep me waiting,\" Kaya said, as she backed up to get her bag.  \"It's time to pay up, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, But-!\" Yukari protested, before being cut off by a pat on her shoulder from Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Yukari,\" said Minako, smiling wryly.  \"I knew this was a possible outcome from the beginning.  I had to try, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Yukari sobbed, too distressed to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could do nothing but watch as Minako slowly hooked her thumbs in the waistband of her panties and removed her last piece of clothing, handing it to Kaya, who added it to the pile of discarded clothing.  Minako struggled to keep her face upbeat, to remain strong in the face of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, turn around, let's have a real good look at you,\" Kaya sneered, having returned with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako complied, making no effort to cover up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you know what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Minako replied, her voice cracking a bit as she reached toward herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't take it anymore.  \"STOP!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Kaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make her do this!\"  Yukari cried.  \"Do what you want with me!  I'm yours... Just give her back her clothes and leave her alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, those clothes are mine now,\" Kaya replied.  \"I won them fair and square, she won't be getting them back, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to take them-\" Yukari said, looking around for Minako's clothes, only to find that the pile was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya gave her bag a couple of pats, and waved her phone at them tauntingly.  \"Camera's rolling, you two.  Now there's no escape for you either, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked down at the ground, her face red with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Yukari,\" Kaya bellowed in command.  \"You can't leave your friend naked by herself, can't you?  Take off your clothes now, or I upload your video immediately.  I've had it waiting just one button push away, you know, just in case you tried anything too rash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari bowed her head in defeat.  With no other choice, she complied, in the vain hopes that her video would not leave Kaya's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, Yukari and Minako were both naked, mere paces away from each other without a stitch of clothing on their bodies, though Yukari's heart-choker remained on her neck, \"to up the sexy factor,\" as Kaya put it.  Both girls were clearly mortified, both faces as red as tomatoes and awkardly trying to turn their gazes, only to be commanded to look back at each other by Kaya.  While each had seen the other in swimwear over the summer, it was a much different experience seeing each other naked.  The moment was quite... awkward to say the least.  Yukari wondered that, if they ever got out of this in one piece, if she could ever look Minako straight in the eyes again, and wondered if it was the same for Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, girls...\" Kaya said,, chuckling wickedly.  \"It's showtime.  While the solo play was quite, titillating, it is time for you two to go <b>all</b> the way together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Yukari yelled in a rushed squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you deaf?\" Kaya said, annoyed.  \"I feel like I've been repeating myself all day.  You know what, just for that, I'm going to upload your video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Anything but that!\" Yukari wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late, I already pressed the button!  The video is uploading as we speak!\" Kaya laughed mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Yukari squeaked  falling to her knees in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun, I'll admit,\" Kaya continued.  \"But all good things must come to an end someday.  But just to show there's no hard feelings, I'll let you in on my little secret.  You must have been wondering how no matter what, every shot I made hit its mark?  Come on, you must be dying to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari turned up towards Kaya, tears pouring down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really.  All I had to do was watch you as you made your shot, see where it landed, and then change my shot accordingly afterwards.  I'm already a pro shot as it is, but whenever some simple-minded fool goes before me they end up showing me the perfect angle and power needed for a bullseye.  Since you were bold enough to go first, my victory was in the bag.  Seriously though, a child could have figured it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gh..guh...\" Yukari choked, clasping her hands over her face.  This was it.  Her life was over.  All because of this one girl and her irrational hatred for her.  And for what, the leers and mutters of lust from idiots worse than Stupei?  She would have killed to be less popular, like that one girl in the class whose name she couldn't remember, precisely because she lacked presence of any sort.  Especially if it would have prevented her from ever crossing paths with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought it couldn't get any worse-</span></div></div>",

Minako had suddenly tackled Kaya to the ground and pinned her under her body.  \"Huh?\" she uttered, as if in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes time to upload videos to the internet, especially from a mobile phone!  Get it and stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!  Right!\"  Yukari replied, suddenly understanding the plan.  Now that Kaya had broken the terms of her blackmail, there was nothing stopping the SEES operatives from fighting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr!  Get off!\" Kaya yelled, struggling to attempt to get out of Minako's grasp.  \"Why can't I move!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kendo Team, bitch!\" Minako yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari couldn't help but smile at that remark as she rushed to get the phone.  Sure, School clubs didn't help build strength as much as fighting shadows, but she was really glad that Minako had taken the extra time to improve her strength.  Picking up the phone that Kaya had dropped, she unlocked the screen-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was greeted with an online YouTube video, titled: \"Hot Sexy High School Slave Girl Fingers Herself on Campus.\" The description read as follows: \"Check it: I can make this bitch do whatever I say.  To all my peeps at Gekkoukan, you might recognize this pretty little face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were already over 100 views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's arms went slack, letting the phone fall to the ground.  \"It's too late...\" she said gloomily, her face having gone pale, head turned downwards in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Minako yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hm hm... Ha ha ha ha!\" Kaya laughed, no longer struggling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already been uploaded...\" Yukari breathed, unable to raise her voice above a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally understand!\" Kaya crowed.  \"I told you that telling <b>anyone</b> would break the arrangement we had!  Oh, I held off when you first showed up with your little friend Minako-chan, because I wanted to know how far she would go to protect you.  But as soon as she tried to defy me, ME!\" she began to yell, raw emotion overtaking her previous demeanor.  \"Acting like some cool manga heroine despite only wearing a pair of frumpy panties, I decided it was time to cash in.  I pretended the camera was rolling just to buy time for the video to upload right in front of your eyes...\" she began to calm down once again, smiling maliciously at Minako.  \"It's a shame you didn't figure things out sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The real shame is how I could have let this sordid affair slip entirely under my nose,\" an imperious voice sounded near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Who?\" Kaya tilted her head around trying to see the interloper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, despite still being naked, was more curious than embarrassed at the thought of this new arrival getting a look at everything, partly from the guilt, but partly because she also sounded familiar.  She looked up to see an two students, an older student with long, red hair, and another student, aqua-haired, with a green sweater.  Both wore familiar armbands on their shirt sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-sempai, Fuuka-chan!\" Yukari cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fellow SEES members met Yukari's gaze, then quickly turned aside bashfully, out of concern for her modesty.  Yukari was too overwhelemed at the moment to care, however, and didn't bother covering up.  After a few moments, Mitsuru shook her head a moment, and regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba, there is no longer any need to worry.\" said Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-but Mitsuru-\" said Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already online!\" Kaya yelled.  \"You're too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you able to do it in time?\" Minako asked, turning her head towards her fellows, but still remaining on top of Kaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest assured, Yamagishi was successful in completing her task.\" Mitsuru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't easy,\" Fuuka said, still blushing and not looking squarely at the naked duo.  \"I've never done anything like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then everything's good now,\" Minako smiled, removing herself from Kaya and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you all talking about?\" Yukari asked, starting to get annoyed.  \"I won't be able to show my face around here again and you're telling me everything's alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what?\" Kaya asked, also confused.  \"I won, you know?  At everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari, play the video that Kaya uploaded after our 'contest',\" Minako said, giving her a smile.  \"Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, pressing play on that video was the last thing Yukari wanted to do, considering what the contents should be.  But if all three of them were so convinced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari started the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's eyes went wide as the video did not show the archery field where she endured her humiliation.  Instead, the scene showed the showers at the female locker room, as viewed from inside one of the lockers.  However, the slits were wide enough to show that the room was completely abandoned save for the star of the video.  Smack in the center of the shower stall was Kaya, completely nude, pleasuring herself under the running hot water.  Despite the rushing of the water, her pleasurable moans could be clearly made out in the audio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the, that's not part of the video,\" Kaya said quizzically, as she moved over to get a look at the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she saw what was onscreen, her eyes bulged with fear.  \"What!?  ME!?  But-but how!?\"  she fell over backwards.  \"Impossible... the room is always empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good fortune can be serendipitous, indeed,\" Mitsuru mused.  \"When Arisato informed us that you had been blackmailing one of our comrades, we set out to retrieve any copies of the wretched video in question, and to collect evidence of you extorting Takeba.  On that note, your network account is currently suspended and your computer has been confiscated to be sure that all copies have been destroyed.  As for the new video, Yamagishi had merely entered the lockers to retrieve your phone, but the opportunity you so clearly presented was too good to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka, that was you?\" Yukari asked, very surprised at the shy girl's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well,\" Fuuka stammered.  \"I was just going to record some blank space to overwrite the video and make it worthless, but then I heard Kaya-chan in the showers, panicked, and hid in the lockers.  I ended up having to call Aigis to let me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, Aigis,\" Mitsuru said.  \"Where is she, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she wanted to know what was going on,\" said Fuuka. \"So I explained to her, but when I told her that Yukari was being threatened by a rival archer, she immediately ran off to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuka-tan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree voices shouted out in unison.  Before anyone could react, three new people burst onto the field.  One was a blonde-haired girl dressed in a black uniform, her voice sounding oddly hollow.  The second was a male student wearing a normal uniform as well as a blue cap and a baseball bat.  The third was a silver haired male wearing a sweater-vest and slacks instead of a normal uniform.  Their furious charge suddenly stopped as they saw the scene in front of them, most notably, the two naked girls facing in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!  Don't look you idiots!\" Yukari screamed and covered her body as best she could, her need for modesty suddenly returning to her thanks to the guys' presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" Minako also screamed. turning aside and covering up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys stared in surprise at their naked friends for a bit before their shouts made them turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, when I heard Yuka-tan was in trouble, I thought there would be gangsters, or something,\" said the boy in the blue cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis, this was not what I was expecting either,\" spoke the silver-haired boxer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-san,\" the blonde spoke.  \"I understand that Yukari-san was in danger.  In order to ensure her safety, I made sure to find Junpei-san and Akihiko-san to combat this new threat.\"  She looked around for a bit at the scene.  \"It appears that everything is now under control, Mitsuru-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Aigis,\" Mitsuru replied, hand covering her face out of frustration.  \"Everything is under control now.  Are you clothes still in one piece, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeak, Yukari and Minako made for Kaya's bag, and retrieved their outfits, hurriedly putting them on.  During this time, Mitsuru walked over to Kaya, who seemed to be having trouble processing what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... it was supposed to be just her, alone.  That bitch...\" Kaya said faintly, clutching her face in a panic. \"How does she know all of these people... Student Council President, Boxing Team Captain, who are you people?\" she asked Mitsuru, who was now kneeling down in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen closely,\" Mitsuru stated.  \"As I will only say this once.  I do not know what grudge you had against Takeba, but you have messed in affairs far beyond your control.  She is an important member of my team, and the work we do is far more important than the selfish fancies of a hormonal, petty little brat.  If you even think of messing with her, or any of us, ever again, well, let's just say being top archer will be the least of your worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, SEES left Kaya in the archery field and headed back to their dormitory.</span></div></div>",

She could guess what Mitsuru would say next, namely that she would scold her for this.  For rising up to childish taunts, entering a humiliating situation entirely of her own will, and creating problems for everyone.  It was partly all her fault to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize that this has been quite an ordeal for you,\" Mitsuru continued.  \"If you... need time to yourself to recover, feel free to take the next few days off from Tartarus and get some extra sleep.  And remember, we are always here for you, as a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was surprised, but in a good way this time.  She knew Mitsuru had her kind moments, but she wasn't expecting this from her.  She looked around.  The entire team was smiling, letting her know that everything was alright now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mitsuru-sempai, everyone,\" she said, overjoyed.  \"I think I'll be ready for Tartarus tonight, though.  I've got a lot of extra stress to work off from that ordeal and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Mitsuru said.  \"Then we should have no problem climbing the rest of what is currently available tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entire block!?\"  Yukari sputtered.  \"Wait, wait a minute.  I think I'm up for a few floors, but the whole block?  Guys!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sighed, as her protests were only met with laughter from the team.  She was actually hoping to have some time off, but when there's Shadows, there's work to be done, it seems.  At least her horrible humiliation was now behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kaya, over the next week, she didn't show up to Archery Club, and ended up transferring out of Gekkoukan by the end of it, all without giving any reasons why.  Though it was clear to Yukari that it was either due to Mitsuru's threat and/or the constant catcalls she got from most of the student body, (despite Kaya having deleted the video as soon as she could, it seems that it had still made its way around.)  Either way, it was probably for the best.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carefully, and with more than a little trepidation, Yukari slowly peeked her head into the school hallway, looking around to see if the coast was clear. Thankfully the school was pretty much cleared out by this point of day, as the school clubs had finished their meetings and even most staff would have left for the evening. Glad that she'd at least be free of living that infamous nightmare of being caught naked in school, Yukari carefully crept through the halls to the front of the school. Reaching the shoe lockers, Yukari quickly scanned the immediate outside of the school, happy to find it similarly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that perhaps her luck might be improving slightly, Yukari threw open the front door of the school and ran like her life depended on it. With one arm held tightly across her breasts and the other reaching down to cover her crotch, Yukari's speed left something to be desired, but it was either that or run with everything on display. Amazingly, things went very well for several blocks. It wasn't until Yukari reached the most integral part of her journey that she ran into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the school was on an island just slightly offshore, the monorail line was a major part of Yukari's commute. In her current state she'd rather walk to the Moonlight Bridge and do her best to creep across quietly, but it would be absolutely packed with cars in rush-hour traffic. Yukari was hoping that she'd be able to sneak onto the monorail and find an empty car, or maybe even find a footpath that had been neglected and forgotten. The problem with either option was that the entire area was packed with people. Between the outlet stores and the movie theater, the station was a buzzing hub of activity, and there was no way in hell Yukari would be able to get to the monorail unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari needed a place to hide. Somewhere she could lay low until the area emptied out and she could progress unseen. The only issue was that potential hiding places were few and far between. There was that alleyway to the more seedy part of the station, and most people kept away from it due to its reputation. But those that didn't avoid it... they were best avoided in the best of circumstances. The other option was a bit risky, but Yukari could try sneaking into the cinema. If she laid low in a theater, the low light might keep her state of undress hidden, and she'd be able to pass time with at least a bit of entertainment. Of course she'd also be surrounded by people, potentially people she knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Yukari had to make a decision. She had to hide, the only real question was: where?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had been a pretty typical day at Gekkoukan High for Yukari. Well, as typical as things get when you play double duty as a savior of the world and regular high school student. She had just collected her things from her shoe cubby and was heading down the walkway to the school gate, perhaps to spend some time at the mall today, when a familiar voice caught up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me, Takeba, do you mind if I speak with you for a moment?\" Mitsuru said as she caught up with Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...hey, Senpai. You usually stay later at school than this. What's up?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you don't mind I'd like to ask for your assistance this afternoon. There is an urgent matter which requires our attention. Arisato and Yamagishi have already agreed to help,\" the class president responded. Yukari couldn't help but feel a little trapped. Mitsuru telling her that Minako and Fuuka had already agreed basically put her on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, okay. No problem,\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you,\" Mitsuru said, smiling casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, rather than head to the mall as she originally planned, Yukari found herself boarding the monorail with Mitsuru back to Iwatodai proper. The two made it back to the dorm with no detours. Yukari followed Mitsuru up to the third floor, the one which the girls slept on, and towards Mitsuru's room. She opened the door and they made their way inside. Minako, Fuuka and Aigis were already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh? Aigis is here too?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Mitsuru replied. \"In fact, she's the reason we're doing this at all. Since everyone is here I'll get straight to the point: Aigis, you have been performing extremely poorly in your academic responsibilities as a student and it's starting to draw attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'd think an advanced robot would be doing abnormally <i>well</i> in school,\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was my initial assumption too, but it seems Aigis has been putting an almost nonsensical lack of effort into her studies,\" Mitsuru responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My function is to eliminate shadows. I have deemed the coursework supplied to the students of Gekkoukan High to be immaterial to this function,\" Aigis stated simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it is most certainly <i>not</i> immaterial to your cover at the school. Some of the answers you have supplied on tests have been downright absurd. Luckily the staff merely thinks you are attempting to be humorous for now, but if this keeps up I don't know how long that impression will last,\" Mitsuru turned to the group at large. \"Therefore, this afternoon we are going to help Aigis learn the importance of her studies, and hopefully some of the course material, by playing a little study game.\" Yukari could hear herself groan inwardly. She had missed out on the mall for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is this like the time you had us all go to summer school even though we did well on our exams?\" Yukari asked. \"And why doesn't Junpei have to suffer with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you honestly think that would <i>help</i> Aigis?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good point,\" Yukari responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Besides, you haven't heard what the game is yet, and once you do I imagine you are going to be quite glad Iori isn't here,\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean by that?\" Fuuka asked, sounding nervous. Yukari couldn't help but feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The game will work like this: you will pair off in to two teams. I will ask a member of a team a question from your grade's coursework. If that person answers correctly, we will move on. If they answer incorrectly, they must remove an article of clothing from their partner,\" Mitsuru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what!?\" Yukari blanched. Minako and Fuuka looked shocked as well. Aigis remained impassive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I believe that having the consequences of your mistakes visited on your partner rather than yourself might help instill a message about the far reaching consequences your actions. In any case, once a person has answered correctly or incorrectly I will ask a question of someone on the other team. Then I will ask the <i>other</i> two members of the teams questions in the same way. We shall continue until one pair is completely naked,\" Mitsuru said. \"I should warn you that the losing team will be justly punished.\" Yukari couldn't help but notice the mischievous glint in her senpai's eyes when she said that last bit, not unlike the look she got before one of her infamous \"executions.\" She wondered what kinky S&amp;M idea she had up her sleeve this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why...why do we have to take our clothes off, though?\" Fuuka asked, reasonably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is my belief that it will help emphasize the seriousness of this situation and will make sure you do not take these events lightly,\" Mitsuru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's easy for you to say! You're the one keeping your clothes on!\" Yukari fired back. Mitsuru considered her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A fair point, Takeba. It would be hypocritical of me not to participate in some way. Therefore, show that my concerns are unfounded and <i>I</i> will be the one to disrobe. If both players in a round answer correctly I will remove a piece of my clothing. However, since there are four of you and only one of me, I will consider more of my items viable. For instance, accessories such as this ribbon,\" Mitsuru pointed to her chest. \"Will count for me, while they will not for you. I will also remove each piece of footwear individually, while I expect you to count pairs of shoes and socks as a single item,\" Mitsuru said. \"Should you render me naked before another team has been stripped completely then no team will have to remove any more clothing and you may punish <i>me</i> in any way you see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait,\" Minako piped up. \"Not to offend anyone or anything, but we're not exactly all on the same skill level here. So, what happens if a player answers wrong but their partner is already naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" Mitsuru said lightly. Yukari couldn't helping thinking by the look in her eyes that she already had some ideas about that, though. The prospect of dares and forfeits was certainly weighing heavy on the group at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yukari's head was spinning. This was insane! Mitsuru wanted them peeling clothes off each other in some weird study game? A big part of her wanted to just say no and leave the room, but she looked at Minako and Fuuka and they seemed rooted to the spot too. Aigis simply didn't care all that much. Mitsuru had this strange kind of commanding aura that made it very hard to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should choose your partners now,\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So it seemed like this was going to happen. No miraculous intervention was going to prevent it. She would just have to make the best of this situation and winning a battle started by choosing the right weapon. Yukari wondered who would best help her through this.</span></div></div>",

She moodily stared at Yukari and Minako. Yukari, for her part, couldn't help but feel a bit guilty. Minako was easily the best student in their year and picking her seemed almost close to cheating. Still, someone had to team with her, and someone had to team with Aigis. Minako definitely seemed to the surest bet to make sure Yukari stayed well modest during the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fuuka was no slouch in the academics department, either. In fact, she was basically on par with Minako. However, Yukari suspected that Fuuka's composure would likely start to crack as she became more and more exposed, probably leading to more and more flubs. Yukari was pretty confident that she and Minako wouldn't have much trouble winning and that Fuuka and Aigis would have to suffer what ever penalty Mitsuru had in mind. Perhaps, though, if Fuuka could hold out enough, they might even save both teams by stripping Mitsuru. Either way, though, Yukari felt she had gone with the safest choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She did feel a pang of guilt, however, as even though she suspected Minako easily had the best chance of keeping her modesty in tact, it was Yukari who had to watch out for Minako. Yukari certainly wasn't a <i>bad</i> student. She was above average, worlds better and Aigis and, thankfully, Stupei. Still, she wasn't in the same league as Minako and Fuuka. Regardless, Yukari suspected that Minako, unlike Fuuka, could handle pressure much better if it came down to the wire for her. In fact, she had to admit that a small part of her might even have chosen Minako partially because it would mean stripping her if Yukari answered wrong. Yukari wasn't sure why Minako could sometimes stir these feelings in her, feelings she had never entertained for a member of her own gender before. She supposed it was simply a facet of Minako's highly magnetic personality. People simply wanted to be with her. It was hard <i>not</i> to feel a slight bit of attraction to a person like that. Mitsuru had some of that quality too, but Minako was much more approachable and less intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, you all seem settled in now. Let's begin with you, Aigis, since you've been having the most trouble,\" Mitsuru said. She asked Aigis a question that Yukari recognized from their last test. She could have gotten that one. Unsurprisingly, Aigis answered incorrectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I apologize, Fuuka-san,\" Aigis said. Fuuka could only grimace as Aigis began to mechanically untie her shoes and then pull them off. Yukari could see white socks on Fuuka's feet. That was first blood, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then, Arisato, you're up next,\" Mitsuru said. As Mitsuru began to detail the problem she wanted Minako to solve, Yukari couldn't help notice that her senpai was being quite clever. She was making sure that Fuuka and Minako wouldn't be answering on the same round. This, of course, would make it harder for Mitsuru to be stripped, as if those two were on the same cycle, every other round would likely result in clothing loss for her. It occurred to Yukari this meant that <i>she</i> was the wild card in all this. She found it unlikely that Aigis would get many questions right so, if Mitsuru was going to lose, it would be up to Yukari to get it done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During her musing Mitsuru had finished detailing the problem. Minako prepared to answer.</span></div></div>",

This is <i>exactly</i> why she picked Minako as a partner. She felt a little bad for Fuuka, but she didn't see why it should be <i>her</i> taking her clothes off for Aigis's sake. Mitsuru turned her attention to Fuuka and asked her a history question. Fuuka thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"1837,\" She replied. It looked like the stripping wasn't getting to her yet.

Good work, Yamagishi. Alright, Takeba, the next question is to you,\" Mitsuru said evenly. This was it, Yukari thought. The chance to prove she wasn't dead weight to Minako's team. If she answered correctly, that would mean two correct answers in this round, which would mean an item of clothing lost for Mitsuru. If she got it wrong, it would mean taking something off Minako. Yukari tried not to imagine herself slowing taking off her partner's clothes.

Nobody's perfect, after all. You can't know everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Minako's ability to handle this so well just made Yukari feel all the more guilty. Yukari knew her friend would never hold it against her if her own incompetence wound up stripping her naked. Could Yukari say the same? After all, wasn't that precisely why she avoided getting teamed up with Aigis? To save her own skin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to shake these thoughts from her head, Yukari carefully unlaced Minako's shoes and slid them off the other girl's feet. With the footwear removed, Yukari looked up as she began to stand. A bit too quick, it turned out, as Yukari caught a glimpse of pale blue fabric between Minako's legs. She'd just peeked up her friend's skirt! Sure, it was an accident, but that didn't make Yukari feel like any less of a pervert. Jeez... Mitsuru's twisted game must have already been getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two rounds in and already both teams have lost something.\" Mitsuru said. \"Certainly a rocky start. Hopefully this will help reinforce the importance of this lesson. Now then, on to the next round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought the next question back to Aigis. To the surprise of nobody present, the android proceeded to answer her literature question incorrectly. Fuuka's face fell as Aigis turned and methodically divested her of her socks. One more bad round and Fuuka was going to start showing some serious skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Minako again. A math question, and one from a chapter the class hadn't actually reached yet.

Taking one for the team was entirely in character for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, Minako-chan,\" Aigis said, showing a rare genuine smile. Yukari had never heard Aigis use that honorific before. She wondered if maybe something was going on there. There was certainly no doubt that that whenever she was around Minako, Aigis always seemed a little more human. Regardless, by process of elimination this meant that Yukari would partner with Fuuka. This was hardly the worst possible outcome, Yukari reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess this means we're working together, Yukari-chan,\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep,\" Yukari agreed simply as they sat opposite Minako and Aigis. Yukari had to admit that this was probably as close to even as a game with Aigis in the mix could be. Minako was easily the best in their year, so handicapping her with Aigis was definitely fair. Fuuka was nearly as good in academics department as Minako, however Yukari suspected she might become far less reliable at answering questions if she were embarrassed. So, Yukari knew it was her job to keep Fuuka as modest as possible so she could stay in top form. Otherwise, the two of them might just find themselves totally naked and at Mitsuru's mercy, and Yukari highly doubted she would show much of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yukari didn't think there was much chance Minako would lose her cool, even if naked, which given her teaming up with Aigis seemed a very likely outcome (something Yukari had to admit did not sound totally unappealing). Dealing with stressful situations and staying calm under pressure was kind of her forte, so it would probably be a while before Aigis had nothing left to lose. She just hoped she and Fuuka could hold out that long, or perhaps they could strip Mitsuru and end this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems both teams are ready, so without further adieu, let's begin. Aigis, since you're having the most trouble we'll start with you,\" Mitsuru said. She rattled off a question from their last exam. It wasn't even a hard one. To no one's surprise, Aigis answered wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry, Minako-chan,\" Aigis said sounding, Yukari noticed, legitimately apologetic. Yukari knew she wouldn't have sounded that glum if she had lost her or Fuuka's clothes instead. Maybe this meant Mitsuru's plan actually made a crazy kind of sense. That didn't mean it didn't totally suck to get caught in the middle, though. Aigis meekly pulled off Minako's brown loafers, fully exposing her knee-high white socks. And just like that, first blood was drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then, I believe we will try Yamagishi next,\" Mitsuru said. She began detailing a problem to Fuuka, and Yukari had to admire how clever Mitsuru was being with the order she was asking in. She had made sure that Minako and Fuuka were not asked questions at the same time, as that would mean Mitsuru would have very likely had to strip every other round. Yukari knew this meant that, in addition to trying to keep Fuuka modest, she was also likely the only person who had a chance of getting Mitsuru to lose the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mitsuru finished explaining the question and Fuuka prepared to answer.</span></div></div>",

Yukari certainly wanted some payback for the situation they had been put in. Yet, shouldn't couldn't help wondering how the shy and reserved Fuuka would act if Yukari started removing her clothes.

Yukari could scarcely think of a worse situation she could have landed in here. Minako and Fuuka were an academic dream team. The best in their year, Minako would likely have no problem answering most questions which, in turn, would keep Fuuka modest, therefore eliminating what Yukari suspected would be her biggest weakness. If Fuuka couldn't be made to feel sufficiently embarrassed enough to start flubbing answers, there was basically no chance they weren't going to win. In fact, Yukari doubted she'd see so much as a bare foot from either of them before she and Aigis would be left stark naked at Mitsuru's feet, played with in any way she saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yukari knew her best hope, her only hope really, was to try and strip Mitsuru before her team lost. Of course, if Aigis screwed up every single question she was pretty sure using basic addition that there was no way that could happen before Yukari herself ended up naked, and that's assuming she get her questions right every time. She would probably even have to do some of Mitsuru's \"cross that bridge when we come to it\" penalties.

She wasn't actually sure if Aigis's shoes acted like normal shoes or not. The jacket she at least understood. Yukari pulled the red bow free and tossed it aside and then undid the jacket. There was no blouse underneath like she thought there would be, just the white torso covering she normally wore all the time. Yukari pulled the jacket off, exposing Aigis's mechanical arms and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked at the robotic girl, now from the waist up resembling her usual appearance.

If Aigis could, at least sometimes, pull out a win, there was a decent chance that the two teams working together might be able to strip Mitsuru before Yukari ended up too exposed. She would have settled for just keeping her underwear at that point. Yukari wondered even if somehow, impossible as it may have seemed, the other team might even lose. Unbidden, the mental image of Minako and Fuuka wearing nothing but leashes in the hands of Mitsuru swam to the front of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Jeez, what made me think of that?

Perhaps I underestimated the lot of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the four dared say anything as they watched the older woman slide her remaining sock down her leg, exposing both of her smooth legs, the skin delightfully fair and unblemished. Amazingly, the two teams had managed to overcome Mitsuru's advantage of boots and socks each counting as separate items. Now, their senpai was on even footing with the rest of them. Or, more correctly, at a bit of a disadvantage. Minako and Fuuka had only lost Minako's shoes, and Yukari and Aigis were both only down one item. Mitsuru, meanwhile, was down to four articles of clothing: her blouse and skirt, and whatever undergarments she had on beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari found herself wondering what Mitsuru had on under that uniform. Images of her elegant senpai in lacy black, silky red, or even plain white undergarments danced through her mind. A pleasant tingling sensation manifested in the pit of Yukari's stomach. The idea of seeing Mitsuru in any of those get-ups, or even less than that, was... exciting. While Mitsuru had planned on fear being the motivator for the other girls, excitement and anticipation was proving to be an even better force, at least for Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka managed to artfully answer Mitsuru's next question, saving Minako another loss and setting things up for another two correct answers.

Yukari was not the only one surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, they come off?\" Fuuka asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may remove them from here.\" Aigis indicated to Yukari a tiny zipper at the top of the white coverings on her legs. Yukari had never noticed it before. She was a little bit scared to touch it, but Aigis had told her that she should, and it was best not to give Mitsuru a reason to punish her. She took the zipper between two of her fingers and carefully unzipped the white fabric. To her amazement, a pale human leg appeared underneath it. A shapely one too, Yukari couldn't help noticing. The case was the same for her other leg. It was strange that it was so shocking. Aigis had skin on her face, why not on her legs and (presumably) her torso as well? She'd just never thought about it, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari suddenly felt bad. \"I'm sorry, Aigis. You've never, erm, shown us your legs before.

At this rate Mitsuru will still be naked before any of my private areas are exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brazen mention of her impending nudity made Mitsuru blush, and Aigis's revelation that she did in fact have 'private areas' was all the more shocking. Minako and Fuuka looked uncomfortable. Mitsuru collected herself and continued the game, trying to ignore Aigis's mention of the rate at which her clothes were diminishing. Fuuka took a long pause to think about Mitsuru's next question, but gave the correct answer eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to Yukari that Aigis's words had rattled Mitsuru, for her next question aimed at Aigis was on science- something that Aigis probably knew a thing or two about.

Classes were their usual boring affair, lunch was pleasant enough, and archery practice was fun as always. Yukari's club rival, Kaya, tried to prod Yukari into a shooting competition, but Yukari wasn't about to let Kaya's showboating and baiting get to her. After all, Yukari had nothing to prove to her, and it wouldn't really be fair to compete when she had experience using a bow in an actual combat situation, unlike Kaya's purely range-trained skills. This was all irrelevant, of course, as Yukari now had a full Sunday to herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she might hang out with Minako or one of her other friends later, Yukari decided to spend the earlier half of the day on her own, enjoying the fresh air and sights of the city. At the moment, Yukari was happily browsing the inventory of the flower shop near the monorail station. Yukari figured it might be worth it to brighten up her room a bit more with some fresh flowers. Of course, she'd need a vase too, and maybe some potting soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yukari thought about what to buy, she had no idea that she was being watched. The flower shop was relatively close to the back alleys where the city's rougher element spent their time; Yukari had been there before with Minako and Junpei while trying to find out where Fuuka had disappeared to, and it was only the fortunate arrival of Shinjiro-senpai that had kept things from taking a bad turn.

Sure, Shinjiro apparently deemed her off-limits, but he couldn't stop what he didn't know about, now could he?

It simply wouldn't do to skip an entire school day if her business concluded before the end of classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Kirijo, thank you again for taking the time out of your busy schedule to stop by!\" Hideki, the scientist that had submitted the request, said respectfully as he led her through the sterile white halls of the laboratory. \"Trust me when I say you won't be disappointed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope not.\" Mitsuru replied as she slipped into her executive nature. \"I'd be rather cross if my time was wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHideki blanched at Mitsuru's cold nature and words.

Mitsuru raised a delicate eyebrow, clearly waiting for Hideki to explain just what she was supposed to be looking at. An awkward silence carried on before the scientist realized this, followed by his own stammering as he hurried to begin explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is something special indeed! While it may look like a black box, what you see here is in fact a colony of nanomachines!\" Hideki explained with a flourish.

These little beauties do anything you can think of! They can actively clean your body and clothing, block signal transmissions and radiation, and even gather together and create a rudimentary force field for your personal protection! At least... they will once we work out the kinks in the hive AI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by kinks?\" Mitsuru asked, finally breaking her silence with the one question Hideki had hoped she wouldn't ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing serious, Ms. Kirijo! The AI just... has trouble with understanding the gravity of her, er, its work. We have a theory that it might learn to take its job seriously if we give it a good trial subject. Normal people wouldn't cut it, but someone important might convince the AI of the importance of its job and get it to be less... playful.\" Hideki explained, trying his best to downplay the disastrous early trials that he and his team \"forgot\" to log and report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An important person might be capable of solving the issue?\" Mitsuru asked. \"Like, say, the future head of the company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's suggestion intrigued Hideki. Her suggestion wasn't wrong, technically speaking. But if something were to go wrong with the AI, it wouldn't just be an intern suffering the consequences, but his boss's daughter.

Most of the student body considered her a stalker, but she knew that it was simply a pure love Mitsuru would come to understand. Until then, she was content to gaze upon the beautiful redhead from afar, fantasizing about meeting her and loving her. It was this complete obsession with the Kirijo heiress that had led Mitsuru's stalker to enact her most daring plan to date. She had spent weeks honing her plan; memorizing Mitsuru's class schedule, her habits, finding the perfect time to strike. When she found it, that was only half the plan; next, she had to get her hands on a school master key (no easy feat, but she had managed it all the same), find an excuse to step out of her classroom (faking a need to see the nurse had taken care of that), and mustering up her courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this meticulous planning had led her here, her heart racing as she thought about what she was about to do. Today, she would claim the ultimate prize- Mitsuru Kirijo's underwear! She had fantasized about those intimate garments more nights than she could count, and now they were just about to be in her very hands! Making sure to stay as hidden as possible, the stalker crept to what must have been Mitsuru's locker. With trembling hands, she slid the master key into the lock, beaming as she felt the lock yield. Opening the door, she gazed upon her spoils. Right there in front of her lay Mitsuru's entire wardrobe for the day. Her school uniform, somehow more elegant and beautiful on the Kirijo queen than on anybody else in the school, and on top of that sat the redhead's undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaking hands, Mitsuru's stalker grabbed the undergarments, handling them as if they were sacred relics. They were just as beautiful and delicate as she'd imagined; silky to the touch and beautifully tailored, they were wonderfully suited for their owner. Before her nerves could fail, the mysterious stalker stuffed the garments into her bag, her heart threatening to jump out of her chest. She had done it! Mitsuru Kirijo's underwear was hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she turned to leave, a thought entered her head. She had the ultimate prize, but why stop there? Mitsuru's uniform was right there, surely imbued with her intoxicating scent. And if she took the uniform, Mitsuru would have to come to her to get it back; more importantly, she'd have to come to her with nothing else but her school towel. The idea sent shivers down the infatuated girl's spine, truly a dream come true. But why entice Mitsuru to come to her when the redhead was just a few yards away, naked and glistening in the shower, just begging her to slip into the stall and join her. But did she have the guts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's dedicated \"lover\" weighed her options. She had her prize, but should she risk taking more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The longer she pondered, the more the stalker realized that she would not be satisfied simply with Mitsuru's underwear.  All of her efforts, the many weeks spent tracking Mitsuru's movements all around the school, and she would only have a pair of underwear to show for it? (The perfect pair of the perfect woman, of course, but still...) She knew that if she hesitated and backed off now, she would regret it for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, with the same care that she had given to Mitsuru's underwear, she removed the uniform  from the locker piece by piece and place them in her bag.  First came the boots, their exquisite leather smooth to the touch, soon joined by the stockings worn underneath.  Then the skirt, and finally the blouse, all neatly folded and placed with tender loving care in the stalker's bag, though it was getting rather hard to close at this point.  With everything claimed, she carefully closed the locker, and embraced her bag tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalker nearly squealed in delight.  All of Mitsuru's clothing was hers!  Now she would just leave and wait for Mitsuru to come to her to get it back and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the obvious flaw in her otherwise brilliant plan hit her.  How would Mitsuru know to come to her to retrieve her clothes?  She had dreamed, nay, fantasized of Mitsuru approaching her in nothing but a thin towel for so long that she was dead set on making it a reality.  But if Mitsuru discovered that she was the one who took her clothes from her in the first place, she would get the completely wrong idea, and shun her forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" a familiar, long-sought after voice interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalker turned around to see her dreams made into reality.  While many right now would be seeing Mitsuru standing neutrally only wearing a towel, the other girl was witnessing the vision of perfection.  The way her still damp hair clung to her shoulders... how the towel accentuated every detail of her body in the best way possible... how the leftover shower water made her skin glisten... the other girl was completely awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in front of my locker,\" Mitsuru continued, oblivious to the true meaning of the girl's fixated stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she squeaked, getting up and standing aside to allow Mitsuru to go through.  As her dearest began to enter the locker combination, the girl knew that she had to get away.  As nonchalantly as she could, she walked towards the door, but just before she could escape, that glorious voice rang out once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold a moment!\" Mitsuru cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned around, seeing Mitsuru poised for action, her face frowned in some degree of anger.  She was had!  She wanted to run, but her legs wouldn't obey her, whether out of longing or fear she could not say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a thief has absconded with all of my clothes,\" Mitsuru continued, glare unwavering.  \"I must ask that you...\"</span></div></div>",

I can't safely travel through the school like this alone; I need a second set of eyes to watch out for any people or obstacles that might compromise my current attire.\" Mitsuru explained in her usual cool demeanor. \"You're the nearest person I can appeal to, and I figure you're likely not the culprit. If you were, you would have run as soon as I noticed something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalker could hardly believe it. Mitsuru was asking her, <i>her</i> to help find her clothes! Mitsuru was trusting her in her hour of need! The stalker frantically nodded her head as Mitsuru spoke, hardly believing her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it, Mitsuru-senpai!\" she chirped. \"I'll make sure nobody sees you like this!\" '<i>Because they're unworthy of such a sight! This is all for my eyes only!</i>' she added in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastique.\" Mitsuru said, employing the french that made the other girl weak in the knees. \"Now, let us be on our way. The culprit can't have gotten far. Would you please make sure the hallway is clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Mitsuru-senpai! Leave it to me!\" the stalker nearly shouted, skipping to the locker room door and cracking it open to peer out. The hall seemed abandoned, and Mitsuru could move with no fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignaling that all was well, the stalker happily held the door open for her dream girl as she carefully stepped out into the hall. This was an absolute dream come true, so far as she was concerned. Not only did she have Mitsuru's clothes, and Mitsuru clad in nothing but a towel, but she was able to watch Mitsuru tread along the hall as she did her best to hide her body under the thin towel that left little to the imagination. Mitsuru's barely clad body in motion was an incredible sight, and the stalker made sure to burn the sight into her mind with every step Mitsuru took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this intense focus on Mitsuru and her towel that clued the stalker in to something that the voluptuous redhead had missed. A corner of her towel had apparently caught on something they passed in the hall, and a single pink thread was busily moving across the stitching as she moved. If Mitsuru didn't do something soon, she wouldn't have a towel to hide behind much longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalker found herself at an impasse. On the one hand, if she said nothing she'd be rewarded with the sight of Mitsuru in all her glory. On the other hand, if she warned Mitsuru of the impending danger, the elegant beauty would probably be very grateful. Maybe she'd give the stalker a little reward? The thought of claiming her reward made the stalker's knees shake. What was the more tempting option, though? Leave Mitsuru's towel to unravel, or warn the object of her affections? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mulling over the decision while keeping pace with Mitsuru, the stalker's eyes were firmly on the towel.  With each step they took, the towel continued to wind away, tugging at the hem and deteriorating the cloth; further exposing flesh that captivated her gaze.  As more and more of Mitsuru's smooth, rounded posterior crept slowly into view, the stalker knew that there was no going back now.  As tantalizing as Mitsuru's potential gratitude was to her, the temptation of witnessing her in her purest form was just too much to bear.  Fueled by lust, she remained silent, licking her lips as more of her idol was laid bare before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru had stopped and had given the stalker a serious look, her right arm raised as a signal.  \"W-what is it, Mitsuru-senpai?\" the stalker stuttered.  \"<i>Have I been found out?</i>\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear voices.  Please, take a look around the corner for me,\" Mitsuru ordered, gesturing down the bend in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken from her delusions, the stalker crept forward and peeked around the corner.  Down the other hallway, she could see a group of boys hanging around by a water fountain.  They seemed to be just standing there, slacking off and talking about some nonsense or another, too involved with themselves to pay attention to their surroundings.  She relayed this to Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Mitsuru spoke after taking in the information.  \"Shame on them for skipping their classes, but as long as they are focused on their own affairs they should not give us any trouble so long as we move quickly.  Go and see if the way ahead is clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" the stalker replied, moving ahead to the next split in the path.  All was clear to the left, all was clear to the right.  She turned to Mitsuru and waved to her that the way was clear.  Giving one more peek down the hallway, Mitsuru readied herself and sprinted towards the stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when it all happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway across the corridor, fully within her sprint, the towel suddenly burst apart into a shower of thin threads, like snow.  The stalker's face immediately flushed red, quivering with joy and ecstacy at the full frontal view of Mitsuru's naked body.  From her firm breasts down to her shapely thighs, taking in every minute detail and committing it to memory, the stalker was fully in awe.  Mitsuru's body was that of a goddess, just as she imagined it would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid goddess, however, was confused at both her protector's odd expression and the sudden draft chilling her to her core.  Gazing downwards, she let out a shrill squeak, surprised, embarrassed, scared, and outraged all at the same time.  Turning around, she could see that the towel she once wore was reduced to nothing more than a pile of linen scraps, unsuitable for covering anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what was that?\" a male voice rang out from the adjoining hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice snapped the girls back into action.  Rushing towards Mitsuru, the stalker grabbed her arm and led her down the hallway, away from the dastardly interlopers who would dare interrupt this precious moment.  Desperate to find a hiding place, she led them to the nearest bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafely away from prying eyes for the moment, they stopped to collect their breath.  Her heart pounding, the stalker didn't know what to do next.  Mitsuru was now fully naked with her, but if she wanted to stay in her good graces as well as protect her from meddlers she'd have to come up with a plan fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was thinking this over, the feeling of Mitsuru's hand leaving her own broke her concentration and gave the stalker a sudden realization.  She had grasped Mitsuru's hand!  She had never been so bold, aside from of course, robbing her love of her clothes and catching a glimpse of her naked form, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks,\" Mitsuru uttered, clearly shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stalker turned around to see Mitsuru huddling nervously in the center of the room, her arms covering her breasts and her crotch somewhat awkwardly, her face a deep crimson with her lips pursed in a wash of shameful emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stare!\" Mitsuru snapped, clutching herself even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" the stalker whimpered, almost breaking into tears and turning around.  This vulnerable, fearful side of Mitsuru was strange and unfamiliar to her.  Did she go too far?  Did Mitsuru suspect her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, Mitsuru sighed deeply.  \"I am sorry,\" she said.  \"I did not mean to snap at you, especially when you have displayed nothing but the utmost in loyalty and trustworthiness so far.  I just could not believe it when my towel suddenly fell apart as it did, leaving me nude.  Either it must have caught on something or someone has been failing to provide the locker rooms with towels of sufficient quality.  Unfortunately, it is obvious that I can no longer safely search for the thief like this.  It sickens me that such a depraved wretch will escape their comeuppance, but I am afraid we must throw in the towel; although it seems I am no longer capable of even that...\" she finished morosely, in a shallow attempt at humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's words cut deeply at the stalker.  She still didn't suspect her at all!  Such kindness from her, and how did she repay that kindness?  If Mitsuru found out the truth now, she would never forgive her.  As much as having her naked by her side was a dream come true, it killed her to see her suffering like this.  It was supposed to be mutual consent!... after a little push, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-senpai!\" the stalker wept, too filled with shame to sneak a peek at her through the mirror.  \"We can't give up yet!  The Mitsuru Kirijo I know would never quit, no matter what!  Isn't there anything else you can think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's brow furrowed in deep thought.  But it was only a few short moments until her face lit up in inspiration.  However, the stalker may soon regret this course of action, as Mitsuru's idea turned out to greatly mess up her plan to get some intimate alone time with her idol.  Her face paled as Mitsuru suggested...</span></div></div>",

Could the stalker really deny her that? With a determined nod, the stalker reassured Mitsuru that she'd get Ms. Arisato for her, quickly turning and hurrying out of the bathroom. As she stepped out into the hallway, the stalker realized that she'd been given an important opportunity at this moment. As long as she kept her bag with her valued prize with her, she'd be at risk of being exposed as the one behind Mitsuru's predicament. However, the path to 2-F went right past the main entryway, meaning the stalker could make a short detour to her locker and store her bag there for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at her locker, the stalker reverently put her bag inside, amazed that she'd managed to actually get away with it. With her bag stored safely in her locker, she was home free as far as the outfit was concerned. The idea of taking the outfit home with her was incredible, and the stalker couldn't even begin to think of everything she'd do with the clothes once she was back in her bedroom that night. So many possibilities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this wasn't the time to daydream! Mitsuru was counting on her, and the longer she took the more risk of another student going into the bathroom where she hid! With renewed resolve, the stalker made a beeline for classroom 2-F. Standing up straight, she firmly knocked on the door, waiting for an answer. After a few moments, the door slid open slightly, revealing a woman in a brown faculty uniform, a white turtleneck shirt, and short brown hair. The stalker recognized the woman as Ms. Toriumi, the composition teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Ms. Toriumi. President Mitsuru requests the presence of Minako Arisato. It's Student Council business.\" the stalker said, hoping to handle the teacher quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Toriumi gave the stalker an inquisitive look, as if she was questioning the legitimacy of her claim. After a moment, however, her expression softened. \"Of course, I'll send her right out.\" Ms. Toriumi said, turning her head to face her class. \"Arisato-san? It seems you're needed for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the stalker was face-to-face with Minako Arisato, who she recognized as the new girl in town. They'd never spoken before, but the stalker had seen her in the halls often enough to recognize her. The gossip was that she had a very kind heart and was great at making friends; the type of person that'd do anything to help a friend in need. The exact type of person that would ruin the stalker's time with Mitsuru-senpai! Could she really let this girl get between her and her alone time with Mitsuru? Then again, Mitsuru was expecting Minako...</span></div></div>",

At the back of the auditorium stood a shirtless man with pale skin and long white hair. Mitsuru knew him instantly. Takaya Sakaki. He was a disturbed young man who led a small circle of Persona Users with an apparent deathwish for the human race. What little they knew about him was troubling: The Kirijo Group had at one time engaged in experiments to forcefully bring out a Persona in a human host. The experiment had proven a failure. While some hosts did manage to manifest a Persona, the being so manifested proved difficult to control and at times openly hostile to the one it was bonded to. The first experiments resulted in the Persona eventually turning on the host and strangling the life from them. Drugs were created to suppress the power of the User to prevent the Persona from breaking free. But those drugs had their own side effects, most obviously a sharp decline in mental stability. STREGA was a group made up of the discarded experiments of Kirijo, a twisted combination of a street gang and suicide cult for Persona Users led by Takaya. His motivations were still unknown, but he seemed to actively oppose the goals of SEES in general and Mitsuru's group in particular. Whatever endgame the Shadows intended, Takaya was evidently eager to be their wingman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru stared daggers at him as he made his way down the aisle. Carefully she began to reach for her Evoker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not be hasty.\" Takaya said, drawing a large revolved from his jeans and firing once into the air. Someone screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CALM YOURSELVES.\" Takaya shouted, his eyes never leaving Mitsuru. \"Please remain seated. I would hate to waste more bullets just because of a few antsy children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru breathed in sharply. \"Do as he says everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakaya smiled, and flipped open a cell phone with his free hand. \"Jin, are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. Their security is a joke. Right now the school is on a solid lockdown. And all security cameras are live and rolling.\" Came the voice over the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid.\" Takaya said, an oily smile on his face. \"Hello, everyone. I'm afraid your time at the assembly is going to be a bit longer than expected. We find ourselves in need a few hostages, and you fit the bill far too well. But do not worry. I have nothing personal against...most of you. Make no fuss, and there is every possibility you will get out of this alive and whole. How likely the possibility is, unfortunately, hinges largely on whether are demands are met. But I'm certain we can negotiate an equitable arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's mind was reeling. What was this madman thinking? He could not have picked a worse day to do this (from her perspective). Aigis was undergoing repairs after a night spent in the labryrinth. Ken, Akihiko, and Junpei were likewise bed ridden from the debilitating effects of Tartarus. This was a crisis and half her people were unavailable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We demand restitution for the crimes of the Kirijo Group.\" Takaya said with a smile. \"They have violated innumberable environmental and human rights over the years. We are a group who demands justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru paused. That...was not unreasonable in and of itself. The Kirijo Group prior to her father's takeover had been a corporation filled with deadly ambition and steeped in corruption. Their crimes against STREGA were only one example of this. Both Mitsuru and her father were determined to make up for the sins of the corporation. That being said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand how you feel. But you must realize that threatening the lives of innocent people will not change the past.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Mrs. Kirijo? Attempting to reason with a terrorist with a gun? Have you not followed your local media? We are all madmen devoid of compassion and bent on creating chaos.\" Takaya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glared again. Was this just a game to him. \"...You said you had demands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. And they are simple. First, I would like you to step out from behind the podium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru complied, her heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I would like Yukari Takeba, Fuuka Fuuka Yamagishi, and Minako Arisato to stand up. Oh, and do loosen your grip on those little toys of yours ladies. I'm well aware of your movements. You aren't going to catch me off guard. And really, what do you intend? Even if you did manage to use those silly little faux pistols, what then? I'm surrounded by your fellow students. Are you going to give away all your secrets here and now? Can you stop me before my pistol goes off? What could you even do to me that has enough punch to be effective that won't endanger all your fellows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one Mitsuru's teammates reluctantly drew their hands away from where their Evokers were holstered. Even more reluctantly they stood. Takaya walked with a swagger to the front of the auditorium. He shoved a large black trashcan onto the stage next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right ladies. I think I'll make my first demand simple. You each come to me, drop off your little toy pistols in the garbage, and then join your senpai on stage. For each pistol that goes in the can, a hostage goes free. Why don't we begin with you, Kirijo-san?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru reluctantly withdrew her Evoker and tossed it into the trashcan in one smooth motion. She had no means left to summon a Persona! One by one her teammates complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Now all of you, stand on stage. Keep your hands behind your head unless I'm giving you other instructions. Oh, and keep your knees shoulder width apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged looks, but complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. You in the back, starting on the left. Congratulations, you've made it out of this alive. You four may go. Feel free to spread the word. No need to keep this secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students practically bolted out the door, which unlocked at Jin's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Excellent.\" Takaya mused. \"Now then, Mrs. Kirijo. Are you ready to make penance for your family's sins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru held her breath. She had no idea what was coming next, but the butterflies in her stomach were back and worse than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll release another student if my next demand is met.\" Takaya said. \"So, let's not keep everyone in suspense. I demand...\"</span></div></div>",

Due to Gekkoukan's size and extensive facilities, the Student Council had more on its plate than what would be dealt with at a normal high school. Thankfully, Mitsuru was no normal student, and she was more than equipped to handle the usual headaches. Today, however, seemed to be more taxing than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could seem to get their work done properly today. Odagiri was caught up in his investigation of a student allegedly smoking in the school, Minako hadn't showed up (likely caught up in one of her other groups that the energetic girl insisted on juggling), and Chihiro had managed to misplace the financial records Mitsuru needed to review. It was this last particular headache that Mitsuru was dealing with when the beginning of her disastrous day struck. Mitsuru and Chihiro were scouring the filing cabinets of the student council room, the auburn-haired junior frantically apologizing for her fumble as Mitsuru did her best to comfort the frantic girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Fushimi. Mistakes happen, and it's not like the records were destroyed, merely misplaced. There's been no long-term damage done, merely a slight irritation. Just make sure it doesn't happen again, alright?\" Mitsuru said as she looked through yet another cabinet to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mitsuru-senpai!\" Chihiro stammered. \"I'll never screw up this bad again, you have my word! I'm so sorry, I... oh! Mitsuru-senpai, here it is, I found it!\" Mitsuru tilted her head toward the other girl, seeing her happily holding a folder marked \"Finances\" and smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile of her own, Mitsuru closed the cabinet she had been searching and turned to properly congratulate Chihiro for finding the papers. Finally, they would be able to get this meeting underway properly. However, as Mitsuru stepped away from the cabinet, she failed to notice that part of her uniform had been caught in the filing cabinet when she closed it. The sound of ripping fabric was heard as Mitsuru suddenly found herself without her-</span></div></div>",

While Mitsuru was no stranger to being the center of attention, the stares usually weren't so blatant. Some students stared with open mouths, a few giggled, some tried to avert their eyes, all said nothing. It was shy little Chihiro that broke the silence, a trembling hand pointing at Mitsuru as she squeaked out \"S-s-senpai! Y-y-your blouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down confirmed what Mitsuru feared. Rather than her elegant white blouse, Mitsuru found herself gazing down on her ample chest cradled in her lacy black bra.  Mitsuru Kirijo, the beautiful and respected President, was standing in front of the rest of the council without a shirt! In a panic, Mitsuru quickly clapped her arms across her chest in an attempt to retain some modesty, but everyone had already been treated to an eyeful. Mitsuru had to find a way to control the situation, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-everyone, stop looking this instant!\" Mitsuru said in her most commanding tone. Normally this would have been enough to make the whole room follow her directions. However, the sight of Mitsuru only half-dressed both undermined her authoritative appearance and was a stronger motivator than anything Mitsuru could say. Mitsuru was not used to her authority being ignored, and she had trouble figuring out what to do in response to this. She had to get herself covered up and back to normal, then she could re-establish control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRisking a look behind her, Mitsuru saw her now ruined blouse hanging from the filing cabinet drawer she had closed. Not only had the buttons seemed to fail under the strain, but the seams of the sleeves had failed as well. How could that have happened? Was the shirt more worn out than she thought, or had somebody tampered with her outfit? It didn't make any sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was neither here nor there. Mitsuru had to get covered up, one way or another. The only question was how?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru turned her back to the rest of the room in order to further examine the filing cabinet and her ruined blouse, trying to figure out whether it would be worth saving or not.  While her instincts told her to take action now, there was something about the accident that didn't sit right with her, aside from leaving her in her bra, of course.  The degree to which her blouse fell apart was too much to have come from her walking alone.  Furthermore, if her side was caught, then she should at least have been left with half a shirt at best, the far sleeve at worst, but everything failed in an instant without her realizing it.  Even if shirts ripped like that when caught in drawers, there should have been at least some resistance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dread chill began to creep up Mitsuru's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this feeling came too late, as Mitsuru suddenly was aware of hands grasping at the middle of her back!  Uttering a shocked gasp, she was stunned only for a moment before quickly whirling around to face her assailiant.  \"What is the meaning of this!?\" she yelled, coming face to face with one of the male student council members.  The fierce glare in her eyes went from perplexed, to bewildered, to terrified upon seeing, in order, a confident smirk plastered on the boy's face, her lacy bra waving in front of her from his hand, and the almost all of the student council members pointing their phones directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, she looked down, only to confirm that what was happening to her was not a dream.   She was now indeed topless in front of the entire student council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Mitsuru screamed, covering her breasts with her arms as best she could, hurriedly backpedaling into the filing cabinet.  Doing her best to calm down, Mitsuru now only wore an expression of utter terror above her waist, clutching herself as tightly as she could as she tried to make sense of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, the cell-phone wielding student council members rose from their seats, continuing to point their phones as they drew closer.  Mitsuru recognized the other three boys and single girl and their positions in the council, but instead decided to focus more on their apparent leader. The boy who had taken her bra had now put the garment in his pocket, and made eye contact with Mitsuru.  He was about average height, wore glasses, but didn't have much in the way of distinguishing features other than that, facial or otherwise.  Mitsuru recognized him to be Arata Suzuki, the representative for Class 3 (the seniors.)  While she knew him to be problematic before, this was a new low for him.  \"Looks like you've put on quite a show for us, President,\" he said smugly, slowly clapping his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do all of you think you're doing?\" Odagiri cried out, standing up and pointing at the group.  \"As leader of the Disciplinary Committee, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll shut up if don't want this to be sent around to every student and teacher in Gekkoukan,\" Arata interrupted, pointing at Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdagiri grumbled in defeat, but remained standing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your intentions, Suzuki?\" Mitsuru stated, voice shaking somewhat, shooting a dirty glare at Arata.  While she still was mortified at her situation, her cheeks now as red as her hair, now that the instigator had revealed himself, she had someone to fight back against. \"I doubt that you planned all this just to see my breasts,\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharp as ever, President,\" Arata replied. \"You see, me and some of the other members have been talking, and we've come to the conclusion that being both the Student Council President and heir to the wealthiest company in the city gives someone quite a bit of power.  Too much power for one person to wield, in fact.  We just want to take some of the power back from the corporations and give it to those who care about the people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmurs of assent came from the other traitorous council members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I just felt like you could use some <i>motivation</i> for the next few meetings to be able to see things from our perspective,\" he finished, raising his eyebrows suggestively when he mentioned \"motivation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, you disappoint me, Suzuki,\" Mitsuru spoke with as much dignity as she could muster, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Arata asked, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the best lie you can come up with?,\" Mitsuru continued.  \"That your plans to blackmail and humiliate me are supposed to be some form of justice?  Did you think I had forgotten your previous attempts to usurp my authority?  This is nothing more than a half-baked power play.  How droll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Besides,\" Chihiro, speaking up from the wall she pressed herself against.  \"The records show that, ever since Mitsuru-senpai took office, everything's been better all around the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked whispers and confusion ran through the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Arata growled, before catching himself and clearing his throat.  \"Ahem!  Well, no matter what you think, the reality here is that you're half-naked, we have pictures, and you are outnumbered!  If you don't want to be everyone's personal wallpaper, you have to do what I say.  Now, because you talked back to me, I command you to bow before me and lick my shoes clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps and chuckles erupted around the room in response.   Odagiri glared angrily while Chihiro clutched her hands in front of her mouth.  Mitsuru blinked and her face grew pale. \"Not pulling any punches are we?\" she said more as statement than question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so everyone is clear who's calling the shots now,\" said Arata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru clenched her teeth.  If if those pictures got out, her public reputation would be utterly ruined.  Her position at school and as the daughter of the CEO of the Kirijo Corporation guaranteed that the ensuing scandal those pictures would cause would never be forgotten.  But at the same time she couldn't let herself be bossed around by this scumbag, and, as she could gather from his first command, blindly giving into his demands would only prolong the inevitable, and perhaps create even more illicit photos to be blackmailed with.  But if she didn't at least play along, then her dignity would be just one click away from vanishing forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she could stop them all right here, it would be perfect, but that was also a long shot.  Only two members were not a part of the coup: Odagiri and Chihiro.  While she could see that Odagiri seemed to be moments away from charging himself, Chihiro, on the other hand, was edging away from the crowd as best she could.  Even with aid from both of them, (that is, if Chihiro could even bring herself to fight,) these two definitely did not have much fighting experience and they would still be at a disadvantage in numbers, almost guaranteeing their defeat.  Why did Minako have to choose today of all days to go to another club?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Arata spoke.  \"I'm waiting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Mitsuru decided-</span></div></div>",

Still, she was the Kirijo heiress, and she had lost count of how many times she'd been able to find victory with nothing more than her words and force of will. All Mitsuru needed to do was display the famous Kirijo charisma and Arata would be sure to find his lackeys abandoning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do no such thing, Arata.\" Mitsuru began, taking a deliberate step forward and standing up as straight as she could. \"What you're threatening is criminal, and you'll be lucky if the worst thing that happens to you is a hefty fine and probation. In all likelihood, you and any conspirators that stand by you will face jail time for this little stunt, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's words seemed to have their desired effect. Two of Arata's co-conspirators seemed to pale at the mention of jail time, and all of them took a small step back from their leader. Arata seemed to show a hint of fear as Mitsuru spoke. Mitsuru allowed herself a small smile at this; she'd called Arata's bluff, and now it was time for this debacle to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was what Mitsuru had assumed would happen. Instead, Arata's look of fear quickly faded, replaced with one of minor annoyance. Shaking his head, Arata let out a small sigh. \"I'd be a fool if I said I hadn't expected that. You're far too stubborn to back down, even when you can't possibly win. Shoji, show our wonderful President the photo you took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of his name, one of Arata's conspirators stepped forward, turning his phone to show the screen to Mitsuru. As was expected, the screen displayed Mitsuru's bare breasts, but it lacked Mitsuru's face. Indeed, were it not for the red hair cascading past her shoulders, one might not even suspect that Mitsuru was the person displayed on screen. Still, what was Arata getting at? Mitsuru already knew that pictures had been taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See it? Good. Shoji, go ahead and send that photo out to your contact list.\" Arata said, smiling as he saw Mitsuru's surprise. \"Thought I was bluffing, huh? I told Shoji to make sure he kept your face out of his picture. Nobody can confirm that it's you without your face, so your reputation is still safe, but now there's going to be plenty of buzz going around the school. Try to put on that little tough act of yours again, and we're sending out one with your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru had underestimated her opponent, it would seem. He had planned for her defiance, and she had just paid the price for falling into his trap. Things were bad enough with the pictures staying in this room, but now that a teaser had just been sent out? How many people would theorize that it was Mitsuru just from the red hair? Sure, it wasn't damning evidence, but it certainly narrowed the list of candidates, and plenty of people might suspect Mitsuru of being the mysterious topless subject. She might be able to run proper damage control on this, but it would be a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you understand.\" Arata continued, taking Mitsuru's silence as her processing everything that just happened. \"You don't really have much of a choice. You either do as we say, or you pay the price. And if either of your little lackeys try to help you-\" with this, Arata pointed at Chihiro and Odagiri \"then they'll have problems of their own to deal with. How about it, Treasurer? Feel like having a photo album of your own?\" Chihiro could only shudder and frantically shake her head in response to this. Mitsuru didn't blame her, but she was disappointed to know she couldn't count on her to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Arata. I'll do it, just leave Fushimi and Odagiri out of it.\" Mitsuru said, slowly sinking to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Madame President.\" Arata said, putting a firm hand on Mitsuru's shoulder. \"The time for compliance has passed. You were too good to lick my shoes, then you'll need to do something else. How about... hmm, what to do. Oh! I know, how about you go ahead and-\"</span></div></div>",

Given all the trouble Arata went to to get her half-naked, forcing her to go the rest of the way was the next logical step.  Not that this made it any easier for her to accept.  Her confidence wavering, she glanced over at Fushimi and Odagiri, cowering and fuming in opposite corners of the room, respectively, in an effort to remind herself that any more uprising would doom them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Madame President,\" Arata sneered.  \"It's time to stop hiding those pretty little breasts of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she was completely out of options, Mitsuru choked back all of her anger and embarassment and complied, slowly uncrossing her arms and lowering them to the sides, all the while continuing to make eye contact with Arata.  It wasn't much, but not breaking her gaze and maintaining some sense of pride was all that she had left.  As the other students whistled and hooted, Mitsuru noticed that Arata wasn't using his phone at all.  \"Where's your phone Arata?\" Mitsuru asked.  \"I thought you would have wanted a record of this momentous occasion for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accidentally left it at home today,\" he shrugged.  \"Talk about bad luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Mitsuru said, her eyes narrowing at the transparent lie.  It may have been enough to fool his lackeys, but it was clear to her that the bastard wasn't using his phone so that he wouldn't have any incriminating evidence in case his plans fell through.  That way, he could claim that it was all Shoji's idea, or something like that.  How despicable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Arata commanded. \"Enough with the stalling, and on with the dancing,\" he directed another member, making their phone play a provocative song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all eyes in the room on her, Mitsuru began moving her body.  Her face grew red as she rocked her body from side to side in time with the song, making sure not to cover her chest at all, given the terms of the blackmail.  After a few sets of this, she moved her hands to her skirt to undo the zipper, when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Arata yelled, drawing stares of surprise from the room and forcing the music man to pause the song.  \"What's with those stiff, awkward movements?  You call that sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am merely doing as you instructed,\" Mitsuru replied, clearly offended that he was finding problems despite her complete obedience.  \"I am disrobing while moving around, am I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a robot, maybe!  Who taught you how to dance?  Ah, never mind, Emiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" The sole girl of the group replied, putting away her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show President Flatfoot here how it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru grimaced at the insult.  Now that casual insults were being thrown at her, it was safe to say that the last of her authority was stripped away, like the rest of her outfit soon would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group spread out a bit to give Emiko some room.  Mitsuru understood the need for space, but she was confused why Emiko was getting a table for herself and having one moved over to Mitsuru as well. \"And you,\" Arata pointed at her.  \"If you don't follow her movements exactly, Fushimi here will be penalized for each mistake you make, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru turned and was outraged to see that one of the other boys, the tallest in the group, in fact, had gotten near Fushimi and was grabbing her wrist, forcing the other girl to tears.  \"You promised that they would not be harmed!\" Mitsuru snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you better make sure to do this right,\" Arata replied, sporting the biggest shit-eating grin Mitsuru ever saw.  \"Oh, and remember to smile... action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing only one more rotten look at Arata, Mitsuru forced herself to emulate Emiko's movements as best she could as the dance began anew, right down to the sultry fake smile that adorned the other girl's lips.  It took Mitsuru a moment to get used to the pace of the dance.  It was a bit faster than the music had led her to believe, especially with far too excessive amount of hip swaying and foot pivoting the other girl was making her do.  The girl then began to lean forward and fondle her breasts, slowly rubbing them on the front and underside as her mouth opened up, as if to eat some food, Mitsuru surmised.  She had no idea what food had to do with sexual dancing, but as her fingers repeated Emiko's movements along her own breasts, she couldn't help but gasp at the sudden bursts of sensual pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the removal of the skirt.  Instead of simply undoing the zipper and pulling it down her legs as she wanted to do, Emiko turned around and flung herself over the table, causing Mitsuru to realize that it would act as some sort of prop.  Taking her place as fluidly as she could, Mitsuru then copied her next distasteful action: looking over her shoulder, one hand slowly pulling down the zipper of her skirt while the other hand had its index finger tugging at her lower lip.  Emiko's skirt remained on her hips, of course, while gravity took claim of Mitsuru's, leaving the red-haired beauty in just her boots and her lacy black panties, with her butt firmly pointed at the phone cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish, Emiko then acted as if she grabbed something from the ground and made a twirling motion above her head.  Mitsuru paused, unclear as to what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah,\" Arata chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP!\" Chihiro squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru turned to see the big guy forcing Chihiro's jacket off of her!  So that is what they meant by \"penalized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she could, Mitsuru gathered the skirt and began to twirl it over her head as Emiko had done.  Cheers erupted from the scoundrels as Mitsuru then released the skirt, letting it fly into the crowd.  Mitsuru suppressed her disgust as she glanced at Chihiro again.  Fortunately, the rest of her clothes were still firmly on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this horrid display back on track, Mitsuru followed Emiko's lead as she turned herself around and reclined backwards onto the table, her face contorted into an emotion reminiscent of ecstacy.  Mitsuru couldn't deny that similar feelings were starting to envelop her body, but her will remained focused on remembering that she was being forced to do this not of her own will.  With a 'playful' wiggle, she kicked off her boots and slowly peeled the stockings from her legs, tossing them towards the audience with a giggle as she did so.  Oh, how she loathed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time to remove the panties, the last shred of bodily protection that she had left.  Forced to face away from the cameras again, she looked over her shoulder to see Emiko's body undulating from tip to toe like a snake, her hands over her head.  While the reactions in Mitsuru's body forced her to concede that she did find some of this to be pleasurable, the excess swaying, gyrating, wiggling, and false emotions she was forced to display were definitely not.  If it weren't for Fushimi being held hostage she had half a mind to end it all right there rather than endure another second of this farce.  With much disdain, she was forced to take one last lean forward and slowly pull the panties down and off her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing back up straight, a chill ran down her spine as she saw that it was not yet over for her.  She was made to face the crowd, holding her arms in the air as she made pelvic thrusts with her now bare crotch in their direction.  Once again, she had to keep her facial expression as one in the midst of sexual throes.  Finally, after seconds that felt like hours, it ended, with a final bow, blown kiss, and wink toward the phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, done, well done!  And with only one little mistake due that I'll just chalk up to inexperience,\" Arata clapped sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru straightened herself upon hearing his remark.  She knew that any gesture of modesty now was pointless, after fondling her breasts and thrusting her nethers towards them multiple times, but she would be damned if she ever had to put on a lewd pose ever again.  \"I have finished your show, Arata, are we done?\" she asked, attempting to keep her rage in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" he mused, pretending to be deep in thought.  \"Although you had that little outburst, you've been nothing but on your best behavior ever since, and that was quite a show, thanks to Emiko's help.  So I'd have to say...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What!?\" Mitsuru hissed, seething with hatred.  \"You have utterly usurped my authority, stripped me bare in front of my peers, and recorded my humiliation to have both the fate of my reputation and the Student Council in the palm of your hands.  What more could you possibly want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a guarantee,\" Arata continued.  \"Your defense of Odagiri and Fushimi, while an admirable display of self-sacrifice, also showed me that you can endure just about any humiliation.  How will I know that I've done enough to you so that you and your friends won't try to get back at me as soon as I leave you alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's face was set in a harsh glare, betraying no other emotion.  \"A topless picture of me is one thing, a five-minute video of me willfully removing my remaining clothing and fondling myself is another,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Arata shrugged.  \"But I just want to be sure, you know, since you did resist even when your boobs were at risk.  So here is my final demand for today: Lie down on that table and masturbate until you reach an orgasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru gasped.  Was there no end to his malice?  But before Mitsuru could respond-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Chihiro cried, a frown appearing on her tear-streaked face.  \"Hasn't she suffered enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pains me to say this,\" Odagiri also spoke up.  \"But for Mitsuru's sake I must insist.  We will all do as you say from now on, you have our word.  Just don't force her to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this going too far, man?\" Shoji spoke up.  \"She already did the strip and everything.  Looks to me like she's ready to play ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Emiko added.  \"And she even made sure to look really into it.  She looks like a complete bimbo in that video, she wouldn't dare risk us releasing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dense are you?\" Arata yelled, smacking his chatty compatriots upside the head.  \"Are you blind, or were you just too entranced by her body to see?  Does this look like someone who's given up?\" he gestured to Mitsuru's erect stature and stern glare.  \"No, that's the look of someone who just doesn't know when to quit and is just waiting for a moment of weakness on our end.  Oh, believe me, I would like to be proven wrong so that we can finish up these negotiations already, but I need to be sure she won't try and fight back.  No, she won't give in, not until that stony face of hers is broken and she is left crawling on the ground.  Throughout all this, has she ever once begun to cry?  To beg?  To show anything other than blatant defiance and disobedience to her master!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent as everyone stared at Arata.  The other conspirators glanced at each other before muttering various degrees of assent, though it was clear that they were shaken.  Chihiro and Odagiri looked to be at a complete loss for words, jaws agape.  As for Mitsuru, she clenched her teeth, finally realizing the true core of Arata's motivations thanks to that emotional outburst.  She had assumed that this blackmail was for nothing more than just control of the student council, to abuse that position of authority for his own twisted ends, and humiliating her was to make sure she wouldn't resist.  This outburst made her realize, however, that the position of student council president was nothing more than an incidental benefit, as well as a lure to gather followers to his side.  What he truly wanted was control over HER, and if he couldn't have her then he would destroy her, completely and utterly.  That anyone would go to such means and harbor such desires felt alien to Mitsuru, but looking back, this realization made Arata's prior demand of licking his shoes suddenly make a lot more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Arata said, frowning and narrowing his eyes.  \"While this has been a fun afternoon for everyone, especially me, it's time we stopped deluding ourselves.  The way she still stands to tall after being humiliated to her core... there is no way Mitsuru Kirijo will ever yield to anyone.\" Arata made to grab Shoji's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Odagiri yelled. \"You already have our word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it!\" Chihiro cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru shuddered.  No doubt Arata had had enough and was going to send that video to everyone!  She had to do something, one way or another!  She either had to submit so much that she'd able to convince Arata that she really has given up in spirit, or go fully on the offensive, even if it meant fighting alone.  There was no more time for half-measures!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The choice was obvious.  If Mitsuru backed down now, then she unworthy to be Student Council President, Kirijo heiress, SEES coordinator, or even human, in her eyes.  She tried to settle things reasonably, but Arata had pushed her too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, Mitsuru threw herself onto Arata, knocking him to the ground.  With Arata stunned at being tackled by the naked redhead, and the rest of the room in shock at her actions, Mitsuru was able to wrest the phone from his grasp and throw it against the wall with enough force to break the device into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!?  Stop her!\" Arata commanded, squirming out from under Mitsuru's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shoji and one of the other boys advanced towards her, Mitsuru backed up towards the filing cabinets, starting to regret her decision.  Fighting multiple opponents naked and unarmed was the last thing she ever thought she would be doing.  True, she had managed to break one of the phones, but there were more that had captured every last second of her humiliation, and they wouldn't be caught off guard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrraggh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would they?  Mitsuru blinked as she saw Odagiri lunge at another one of the guys with a chair.  The sudden blow to the back of the head knocked him out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\" Odagiri shouted, waving the chair menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Emiko's voice could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of her eye, Mitsuru saw her fending off Chihiro, who was trying to make a break for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords could not fully express Mitsuru's joy as she saw that she was no longer alone in her struggle.  She knew that Arata wasn't much of a fighter, and with the other 3 of his cohorts presently engaged, Odagiri might be able to take him out.  Furthermore, if Fushimi could break through and seek assistance, any at all, then the battle would be theirs, even if it meant being temporarily exposed to whoever assisted them.  She poised herself to try and counter the pair as they approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BZZZT!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaggh!\" Odagiri yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mitsuru gasped, looking again to see Odagiri collapsing as Arata had shot him with a taser.  How could he have snuck a taser onto school grounds!?  Unfortunately, this lapse in attention proved deadly as Shoji belted her in the stomach before she could guard herself.  Gasping for air, she doubled over, unable to stop the other boy from knocking her down and pinning her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BZORT!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyaaa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru could hear Chihiro's scream as the taser shot out again, forcing the meek treasurer down in a crumpled heap.  Raising her gaze as best she could, she saw Arata walking towards her, his face wearing an expression of... disappointment?  \"So this was all the great Mitsuru Kirijo was capable of,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose remarks and that expression only served to fuel Mitsuru's anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even now, you still try to resist me?\" he sneered, taking Mitsuru's chin in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru did the only thing she could think of, futile as it was, and spat in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students, now fully focused on Mitsuru, gasped.  Arata didn't react at all, just slowly let the saliva drip down his cheek.  \"You've become so predictable, Mitsuru... It's sad, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, she busted my phone!\" Shoji yelled.  \"Dude, gimme yours, I'm sending it out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Arata stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Everyone in the room, Mitsuru included, responded, leading to complaints from all the other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Arata continued, silencing the muttering.  \"Not like this.  Mitsuru has been especially naughty.  And Odagiri and Fushimi as well,\" Mitsuru's face paled upon hearing their names.  \"They tried to help her as well, even after saying they wouldn't, you see?  Therefore, their punishment needs to be exceptionally harsh, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\"  \"We didn't even do anything to them and they tried to hurt us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Arata cried out exuberantly, his flock firmly under his control.  \"Now, here's what we'll do, but first,\" he then drew his taser one more time, aiming at Mitsuru's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAggh!' she cried, before slipping into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Mitsuru noticed upon waking up was that her throat felt really, really dry.  This was followed by a low growl from her stomach, showing that she was hungry as well.  Thirdly, the room she was in was pitch dark, but as she could not make out a window among the walls that was probably due to them being in an enclosed space rather than it being nightfall.  Upon attempting to stand up, she found that her arms and stomach seemed to have been bound with rope, holding her in a reclining position.  After a bit of struggling, she realized that she wasn't tied to a column, but to other people, judging from the warmth she felt on her bare shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare shoulder.  She blushed with shame and remorse as she remembered what had happened during the Student Council Meeting, and that she was still naked.  Still, the warmth felt smooth, much like her own skin.  Her eyes went wide and became fully alert.  \"Odagiri, Fushimi, are you awake?\" she asked into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-san,\" Odagiri replied, showing that he was also awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Fushimi?\" Mitsuru asked further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came to earlier, but after realizing that we're, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they took your clothes too,\" Mitsuru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he sighed, likewise.  Mitsuru could sense that he was thoroughly embarrassed.  She wasn't surprised.  She herself was mortified beyond belief after what happened today.  It fact, the real surprise that she was handling it as well as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waking up like this next to a boy in a similar state must have been too much for her,\" Mitsuru mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get the subject away from their nudity, Mitsuru turned her thoughts elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Mitsuru looked around, still unable to make heads or tails of their location.  \"Do you know where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in the closet in the Student Council Office,\" Odagiri replied.  \"I overheard one of them mention it before they drugged us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drugged!?\" Mitsuru was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With sleeping pills,\" Odagiri continued, his displeasure clearly apparent.  \"I also managed to stay conscious long enough to overhear that they plan to release those videos after publicly presenting them at today's assembly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today?  But the next assembly wasn't until Monday next week?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdagiri didn't say anything which was all Mitsuru needed to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's Monday!?\" Mitsuru croaked weakly.  \"How could they have kept us here all Sunday without anyone figuring it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that people did get suspicious, or at least Minako-chan did.  But those bastards were able to turn her away by claiming 'Emergency Student Council Business, Mitsuru's orders.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her own name to imprison them.  Well, that would explain why she felt so hungry, thirsty, and sore, but still... \"But if it's Monday, then why do I not need to use the facilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Odagiri said, somewhat bashfully.  \"Apparently, being knocked unconscious by 120V of raw power causes one to evacuate both their bowels and bladder, they said so while also griping about the smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat killed the conversation for a good long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mitsuru broke the silence.  \"You must be disappointed in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Odagiri replied, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I fell into Arata's trap and then tried to foolishly fight back without a plan, I brought you two into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdagiri said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so, so sorry,\" Mitsuru continued.  \"This battle wasn't yours to fight, and now you'll be forced to share my fall from grace.  Neither of you deserve such-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-san, please, stop!\" he interrupted.  \"It's not your fault Arata turned out to be a total scumbag.  If anything, the fault is all mine!  I just sat back and watched like everyone else.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!  Your assistance in that battle was most valuable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I should have acted sooner!\" he continued.  \"Unlike Fushimi, it was my duty to stop these ne'er-do-wells, yet I did nothing until the last moment.  I didn't even record their actions with my own phone to maintain proof of their ill deeds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did as well as anyone could have.  Besides, that wouldn't have helped anyone.  I'm sure they took your phone with everything else, and the hidden cameras would have recorded everything anyways...\" she drew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameras!?\" Odagiri said, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I have forgotten about the cameras!?\" Mitsuru chastised herself.  \"They were installed as a safety measure and record everything that happens in this school!  All I have to do is to get to the PA room, and then I can get the evidence I need.  Que Magnifique!\" she exulted, a plan now in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... wha?\" Chihiro's voice could be heard struggling to regain consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake!\" Odagiri cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wha?  AH!\" Chihiro screamed, squirming around frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fushimi!  Calm yourself!\" Mitsuru yelled.  \"I can't have you fainting again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mitsuru-san!\" Chihiro replied, barely keeping her wits.  \"You're still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I have a plan that just might get us out of this, but first we need to escape this room,\" Mitsuru continued.</span></div></div>",

Everyone, stand on three, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, Two, Three!\" Mitsuru called as the group attempted to stand up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Don't touch there!\" Chihiro squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not touching you with anything, Fushimi!\" Odagiri scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful!  WAH!\" Mitsuru cried out, stumbled forward, and fell face down with her teammates on top of her.  This was going to take a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoji reclined in the President's chair, bouncing a ball along the wall.  He was bored out of his skull guarding Mitsuru and her cronies.  It wasn't like they could do much, tied up butt naked and doped up on sleeping pills.  But Arata insisted, and he had no choice but to follow orders.  He had no chance winning an argument against him, though it was thanks to Arata's stubborness that he was out a phone and would miss the big show.  He'd better follow up on his promise to form an equestrian club at the school, that was the whole reason he signed on to this mutiny, after all.  Though he had to admit, that show they had Mitsuru put on was unforgettable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a loud thud followed by a shrill scream coming from the closet broke his perverted reverie.  \"What the?\" he uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, is anyone out there?\" Mitsuru's voice rang out.  \"Anyone?  We need first aid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're actually awake?\" he said, pondering whether he should reply or not.  Well, he figured that it would be okay to talk with them at least.  It wasn't like they could open the door by themselves anyways.  \"What is it?\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness!\" Mitsuru replied.  \"It's Fushimi, she's gone ravenous with hunger and tore through her own arm!  She needs medical attention immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really expect me to buy that?\" Shoji scoffed.  \"The shy one, eating herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could not believe it either!\" Mitsuru responded, her voice frantic with emotion.  \"But when she started crying that she just couldn't take it anymore and needed something to eat, she just had at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUWAAAAHH!!!\" Chihiro yelled.  \"It hurts!  It hurts!  It hurts so much!  But I need more!  MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" Odagiri panicked.  \"Eat Mitsuru, she's far more pleasing to the tongue, I'm sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad!?\"  Mitsuru screamed back.  \"If anyone deserves to be food it's you, Odagiri.  You'd provide a much heartier meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy... this can't really be happening?\" Shoji asked himself.  He was very, very sure that they were making it up, but who knew what anyone would do after being imprisoned in a closet naked for a full day without food or water.  Arata had said that the drugs would make the time pass for them in the blink of an eye, but to be honest, Shoji thought that Arata was a few screws loose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AARGH!\" Odagiri gasped.  \"My neck!  Grgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM!  SO GOOD!\" Chihiro growled, sounding nearly inhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" Mitsuru sobbed.  \"Oh my God... It's just me and her now.  I'm next...  Please, save me!  I'll let you do whatever you want to me, just don't let me die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to send Shoji running for the door.  The prospect of Mitsuru as his own personal slave was just too much to pass up.  Also, he was curious as to what depraved, beastly state Chihiro had been reduced to.  Always watch out for the shy ones, his brother had told him whenever he asked him advice on girls.  Shoji unlocked and opened the door, fully intent on claiming his prize-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and was met with a triple-sized body slam shoving him into a nearby wall cabinet, bumping his head on the fixture and knocking him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tres Bien!\" Mitsuru cheered, giving Shoji's unconscious body a kick for good measure. \"Now to release us from these bonds,\" she said, kneeling down to search his pockets for anything she could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that actually worked...\" Odagiri mumbled.  \"He actually believed you were a zombie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zombie? I was going for werewolf...\" Chihiro sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I'm getting at,\" Odagiri tried to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could have been a vampire for all I care,\" Mitsuru interrupted.  \"Regardless, the plan worked splendidly, and it turns out that our friend here had a knife in his coat pocket.  Yet another infraction of the rules, but one that works in our favor this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the knife, Mitsuru was able put her wrist ropes along the blade and free herself.  After that, it was only a short few minutes to cut the rest of the ropes, freeing the naked trio.  Upon being freed, Chihiro immediately shoved Mitsuru aside as she ran into the Student Council room.  Mitsuru followed, suprised at the girl's sudden rush, to see her dashing around the room, frantically looking for something.  Half a minute later, it was apparent that her search was fruitless, as she sank to her knees and turned towards Mitsuru, arms covering her chest.  \"It's not here,\" Chihiro groaned.  \"It's all gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Mitsuru to realize that she meant their clothes.  Looking over her shoulder, she saw that Odagiri was also devastated, his hands firmly placed in front of his crotch as he entered the room.  \"Of course they wouldn't leave our uniforms out where we could just pick them up,\" Mitsuru spoke out loud.  \"It's possible that they may have disposed of them yesterday while we were unconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Odagiri and Fushimi both groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was about to chide them for moping around when action needed to be done when she realized that she couldn't really blame them.  The only reason she hadn't fallen into a quivering ball covering her privates was because of extenuating circumstances: Arata needed to be stopped.  Becoming overwhelmed by embarrassment or shame would do nothing to help that.  All the same, she knew that the others didn't have her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me for a moment,\" she said, moving back to the closet, leaving the other two despondent and alone.  A minute later, she returned, carrying a bundle in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said, tossing its contents at Odagiri and Fushimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  This is?\" Odagiri started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoji's uniform,\" Mitsuru finished.  \"These uniforms are for Gekkoukan students only.  What Arata and his henchman have done is tantamount to treason.  Suffice to say, they won't be needing their uniforms any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mitsuru-san,\" Chihiro asked, wasting no time to put on Shoji's shirt.  \"What about you?  You can't possibly mean to move around while you're all, you know... naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glanced down at her own body, completely and utterly bare, and back to the others, nervously averting their gazes.  She was surprised to realize that the thought of covering herself with the borrowed uniform had never occurred to her. \"Truth be told,\" Mitsuru began, starting to blush at being reminded of her predicament.  \"There is nothing I would rather be right now than fully dressed with everything back to normal.  But I cannot do it in good conscience while leaving my close companions out in the cold.\" She looked at Odagiri and Fushimi, now decently covered up in a pair of pants and a shirt, respectively, and was pleased to see their confidence slowly being restored.  \"A true President puts the well-being of the people before her own.  I could be covering up right now, but what would that solve?  Right now all my efforts need to be focused on stopping this mad scheme.  The time is now- 9:55!?\" she sputtered, looking at the clock.  \"There's no time left!  Quickly, to the PA Room,\" she announced, cutting her motivational speech short, throwing the door open and rushing out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was empty, no doubt because everyone was already in the auditorium, meeting for the morning assembly.  Not that it mattered to Mitsuru.  She only had a scant few minutes to spare!  With an emboldened Chihiro and Odagiri fast on her heels, she reached the PA Room and threw the door open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The PA room was mostly empty, save for two students near the monitors.  Mitsuru recognized them as Emiko, and the tall boy who had accosted Chihiro earlier, not that his name mattered at all at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Emiko gasped.  \"You managed to escape?  And still naked, I see... Did Little Mitsuru come for another dose of punishment?\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru nostrils flared, her lips turning back in a sort of snarl.  \"It is the end of the line for you!\" she yelled defiantly, arms at her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you guys?\" Emiko said mockingly.  \"Three people wearing a total of one uniform is supposed to scare us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're outnumbered!\" Chihiro surprisingly spoke up, looking the angriest Mitsuru ever saw the girl, fists balled in front of her.  \"You're gonna pay for what you did to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late,\" the boy taunted.  \"The video's already uploaded into the computer.  At 10:05, it will start playing out in the auditorium and everyone will see your little show.  You know, thanks to that little teaser we sent out and you not being at the assembly, everyone's talking about you already.  Just imagine what they will be saying after today, ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" Odagiri yelled, charging the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Chihiro did likewise towards Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in the doorway, Mitsuru sized up the situation carefully.  Things looked even right now in the battle, but if her allies' sudden burst of energy petered out, they would soon be at a disadvantage.  Odagiri had locked hands with his opponent, apparently challenging him in a match where the stronger competitor would prevail.  Chihiro and Emiko, on the other hand, were fighting in a style more similar to boxing.  That is to say, the most amateurish boxing Mitsuru had ever witnessed, with wild punches swinging off target for both sides, interrupted only by the occasional blow to the noggin.  Her friends' efforts were admirable, but Mitsuru knew that it wouldn't last long.  Malnourished as they were, their strength would soon drain away, leaving them at the mercy of their enemies.  Knowing that she had to stop these two before she could safely stop the video from playing, she looked around the room, searching for anything that could help.  Soon enough, Mitsuru had her plan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking around behind the combatants, she made her way to the wall with the monitors.  Taking a page from Odagiri's book, she hoisted a nearby folding chair and, fueled by her adrenaline alone, charged the tall boy and hit him on the back of the head with as much force as she could muster.  Fortunately, arms otherwise occupied and completely unable to defend any blows from behind, the boy crumpled to the floor like a sack of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" Mitsuru yelled, gesturing towards where Emiko and Chihiro were continuing to duke it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Odagiri replied, charging Emiko and making the match a two-on-one, quickly shifting things in their favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the traitors sufficiently disposed of and occupied, Mitsuru made her way to the computer at the monitors and sat in the chair.  Looking at the clock, the time was 10:03.  They made it with two minutes to spare!  Using her personal password, she was able to access the computer camera logs and gain access to alter the video playlist, despite it being locked in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!  Go ahead and try!  It won't do you any good.\" Emiko yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru turned around.  The duo had succeeded in holding her down on the floor, but Emiko's face remained locked in an expression of triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arata has the last phone on him!\" she continued.  \"Even if you stop the video here, he will send it out on his own from that phone right there on stage.  And it won't be limited to a small group of friends, he's set it up to go to everyone in the school right here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krr...\" Mitsuru growled.  She looked at the assembly through the auditorium monitor.  Arata had taken to the podium and was gesturing to the crowd.  Most likely he was preparing them for the show that was yet to come.  There was simply not enough time.  One way or another, her naked body was going to be shown to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had failed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but she hadn't given up yet, despite everything she had been through, and she wasn't going to start now.  There was still one option left to her.  It was an unpleasant one, but it was the only option remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru fiddled with the computer a bit more, making sure everything was in place before hitting CONFIRM, just before 10:05.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and without further ado, a side of your Student Council President that you've never seen before, that I am sure will change your opinion of her,\" Arata said, concluding his opening speech with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents and faculty alike muttered confused whispers.  This assembly was supposed to be about the update for the new club itineraries over the summer.  The last thing they expected was a last minute change to an impeachment hearing against Mitsuru, claiming her unfit for office, of all things.  But Arata had insisted that all will be made clear after seeing a video Mitsuru had apparently shot of herself on campus that he had been able to acquire somehow.  A lot of this seemed sketchy, but between that and rumors of that mysterious sexy photo from Saturday, anything was possible, so they all decided to sit back and see what was in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir confusion intensified as the video began.  The opening scene was nothing scandalous.  It was just the Student Council Room, during a normal everyday meeting.  The angle and timestamp in the corner of the footage made it appear as though it was taken from a security camera this past Saturday, during the normal meeting times.  Due to being shown on the large screen, everyone could be made out clearly.  Arata's eyes bugged out as he saw that this wasn't what he planned to show.  With everyone's eyes and ears focused on the video, no one noticed him as he quickly crouched down and dialed Emiko's cell number from his personal phone.  His face went from white to red as the voice on the other end was not Emiko's at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Arata,\" Mitsuru spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing, Kirijo!?\" Arata whispered hoarsely.  \"How did you escape?  Never mind that, don't you know that I'm going to send your sordid actions out to everyone if the proper video doesn't show!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mitsuru replied matter-of-factly.  \"Your co-conspirator was quite insistent that if I tried to stop your broadcast, you'd send it out anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!  You lost!  So what are you trying to pull?  How did you get that footage!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, no matter what I did, it was clear that my humiliation would be made public to everyone.  So, I figured, why not give everyone the extended, uncut version?  As for how I acquired this, is it really that surprising?  Wasn't it you who said that the Kirijo group holds too much power everywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act all smug with me!  I'm uploading the video and sending links to everyone right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a mixture of gasps and laughter roared through the auditorium.  The video had just reached the part where Mitsuru's blouse got caught in the filing cabinet and was torn off completely.  \"Hear that?\" Arata crowed through the laughter, which peaked again after Chihiro had to point the obvious out to the perplexed President.  \"You're a laughingstock now!  Your humiliation has only just begun!  It will be even worse once everyone gets to view a free replay on their phones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see it clearly from here,\" Mitsuru continued, her tone remaining calm and unperturbed.  \"I did simply just stand there like a slack-jawed buffoon, didn't I?  Giving a full view of my brassiere to everyone in the room.  I really do look quite the fool.  But do you remember what happened next, Arata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, what do you mean nex-! !!!\" he froze up in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you have finally caught on,\" Mitsuru continued, an edge becoming apparent in her voice.  \"The next thing to come off was indeed my brassiere, but that was not due to mere chance, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it...\" he faintly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, now!\" he said, nearly breaking his whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Mitsuru asked condescendingly.  \"You already sent out the incomplete video.  I'm just giving everyone the complete story.  Aren't I such a gracious host?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I lied!\" Arata lied, struggling to regain control.  \"Obviously that was just a bluff to get you to stop this!  Come on, we can still work this out reasonably, man to woman, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that ship is about to set sail,\" said Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a collective gasp echoed throughout the room, as the video reached the part where Arata snuck up behind Mitsuru, removed her bra from her body, and then proceeded to taunt her with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit all!\" Arata swore, cutting the call and quickly making his exit while everyone was distracted by Mitsuru's breasts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the PA room, Odagiri and Chihiro stared indescribably at the screen where the camera footage was playing as well as Mitsuru, sitting in the chair in front of the computer.  The video had reached its climax, with Mitsuru being forced to perform that awful dance while Chihiro was being held for hostage.  Though the video was muted in this room, it was likely that every gasp and moan could be heard in the auditorium right now, where the audio rang clearly.  Mitsuru herself betrayed no emotion, simply setting down Emiko's phone on the desk after Arata hung up, just staring at the monitors, not making a single response.  Even Emiko had shut up, utterly baffled at Mitsuru's final option.  Unable to take it any longer, Odagiri was the first to break the silence.  \"Mitsuru-san, are you... alright?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am far from alright,\" Mitsuru responded, her voice as cold as her element.  \"It goes without saying that I am greatly disappointed in this entire affair.  The most intimate details of my body are now common knowledge amongst the entire school, that vile video exists on everyone's phones, and to add insult to injury I am nearly dying of hunger, but at the very least I can take solace in the fact that everyone will know Arata's true role in this debacle, as well as that the video they have just recieved is nothing more than a gross distortion of the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's gonna happen to us?\" Emiko asked, beginning to cry.  \"We were just following Arata's orders, nothing more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you were,\" Mitsuru said dismissively, keeping her back towards the room.  \"Due to the extreme lengths Arata himself went to, any one of you could claim to the proper authorities that he forced you into this, and they would most certainly believe you.  However,\" Mitsuru turned her head to look Emiko straight in her eyes.  \"I will never forget what all of you did to me, Odagiri, and Fushimi.  Any further disloyalty will be met with the most severe consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  I'm sorry, I'm so, so, sorry!\" Emiko launched into a string of feeble apologies.  Mitsuru didn't pay much attention, though she did feel the slightest relief that the proper order had been restored at last.  She turned back to the video, where their first struggle had ended in disaster, where all three of them were tazed into unconsciousness.  With all of the relevant information having finished its broadcast, she contemplated letting the video continue to play further, but stopped it as she saw them gather around Chihiro and Odagiri's bodies and began to fiddle with their uniforms.  There was no need to let it go any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen to Arata, anyway?\" Chihiro asked, shuddering at the last image she saw before the view cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexual Harassment of multiple students, confining them against their will without proper nutrition, drugging them, conspiracy to frame one of those students as a perverted, sexual deviant,\" Mitsuru rattled off.  \"Expulsion at the very least.  That is, if they're able to find him after he ducked out of the assembly.  If he's smart then he's probably at the train station, booking a ticket to 'I Don't Give Two Shits'-ville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others shrunk back at the sheer venom in Mitsuru's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIRIJO!\" A voice cried out, slamming at the door.  \"You bitch!  Open this door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we all know better by now, don't we?\" Mitsuru asked rhetorically.  \"I see no reason to, Arata,\" she called out.  \"Why did you come crawling back here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ruined thanks to you!\" he yelled.  \"If I'm going to burn for this, you can bet I'm taking you with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny,\" she continued, her voice completely serious. \"Because from my perspective, that's exactly what you forced me to do to you.  I tire of repeating myself to fools who fail to grasp basic concepts such as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you thought I was bad before!?\" Arata yelled, nearly incoherently, pummeling the door with all his might.  \"When I get in there, I'm going to make you regret ever standing up to me!  Regret ever being born, even!  Five minutes is all I need to- GUH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden outburst was the last noise he uttered, silence filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough out of you,\" a male voice spoke from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-senpai, are you in there?\" A familiar female voice rang clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan!\" Odagiri and Fushimi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them in,\" Mitsuru directed towards the door, swivelling around in the chair to face the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she expected, she recognized the two figures standing to greet her outside the door.  A young brunette girl wearing the school uniform, Minako-chan, and a silver-haired boy around Mitsuru's age, wearing a vest and holding his jacket off to the side.  The two were quite shocked to see Mitsuru sitting in the chair wearing only her serious expression, but with her arms and legs crossed to conceal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you showed up, Akihiko-kun, Minako-chan,\" Mitsuru greeted them, shaking them free of their stupor.  \"It's rude to keep a lady waiting, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko-senpai, your coat!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" Akihiko replied, handing it over while Minako rushed to Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-senpai!\" Minako wept, barely able to contain herself, handing over the jacket.  \"I couldn't believe my own eyes.  The nerve of that guy!  When you didn't show up at the dorm I checked back at the Council room for you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Minako-chan,\" Mitsuru interrupted as she put it on.  Fortunately, it was able to stretch down her thighs, but only barely.  \"They kept us imprisoned against our will, and lied to prevent anyone from checking for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mitsuru-senpai... Chihiro-chan, Odagiri-kun,\" she addressed to the other members standing in the room.  \"It must have been so horrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro broke down into tears and embraced Minako tightly.  \"It was rough for all of us, but Mitsuru-san most of all,\" said Odagiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this, and you still put yourself on the line to make sure that dirtbag wouldn't get away with it,\" said Akihiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still was able to cause irreparable damage,\" Mitsuru said morosely.  \"I don't think anyone will ever forget that video, and the worst of them have the version he made sitting right on their phones for their personal amusement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but fortunately they won't ever get a chance to see it again,\" Akihiko grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mitsuru fixed him with her stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as the video ended, and realizing that the mail everyone received was Arata's dirty ploy, the faculty blocked the exits and confiscated everyone's phones,\" he continued.  \"Thing is, most of the students were handing them over willingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Minako added.  \"I took a look at the people's faces during the crowd, and as soon as Arata started threatening you and Chihiro, almost everyone changed from laughter to hate.  People were actively turning away during that forced dance and outright booing after he shocked you all unconscious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though not everyone, I take it?\" Mitsuru asked.  She was not naive enough to believe that the video was completely eradicated, nor was her humiliation completely met with revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... no...\" Minako replied glumly.  \"But there's always those creeps sitting out there, caring about nothing but their own sick fantasies.  You can't let them get you down!\" she said, attempting to cheer Mitsuru up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, Mitsuru sighed and took a great big stride forward, walking towards the exit.  \"Enough standing around here,\" she said.  \"It's time we all got something decent to wear and a nice, hot meal to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered around her.  It was a very good idea at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do with him?\" Akihiko pointed at Arata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru took a long look at Arata's body collapsed on the ground, his cheek swollen and glasses cracked from Akihiko's punch.  She wanted so badly to give him a kick between the ribs, but she had to be the bigger woman here.  It wasn't easy being President, after all.  \"Take him to the faculty offices,\" Mitsuru commanded.  \"I wish to be rid of him as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" he replied, hoisting the body over one shoulder and taking it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArata's punishment was as swift and severe as Mitsuru had predicted.  Fortunately, this also resulted in Mitsuru never having to see his ugly mug ever again.  The other conspirators quickly fell back in line, and were more than willing to give up to triple their previous work efforts, given the right incentives from Mitsuru, Chihiro, or Odagiri, of course.  Just as Mitsuru had worried, however, her ears still picked up occasional snickers from various students, and even a couple of teachers.  These remarks would occasionally force her to remember that horrible dance, but only for a second.  Under her withering stare, these noises were soon silenced every time, without fail, and life would carry on.</span></div></div>",

Mitsuru, surprised as she was by the sound, took a few seconds to fully comprehend what had happened. She was used to most eyes in the student council room being on her, but not quite like this. Chihiro's hands were clasped over her mouth in shock, Odagiri was actually making a point of looking at anything except Mitsuru, and the rest of the council members were either staring openly or trying to avert their eyes. Mitsuru wondered what was wrong. Was their something on her face? Had she said something offensive without realizing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro was, surprisingly, the one to break the silence. With one trembling hand pointing at the Kirijo heiress, the timid treasurer squeaked out \"S-s-senpai! Your skirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mitsuru looked down. While she had assumed to see her skirt torn, finally realizing what the tearing sound must have been, the sight she was greeted with was far worse. Rather than the black fabric of her skirt, Mitsuru only saw the bottom of her blouse covering her lacy black panties! Behind her, still hanging from the closed filing cabinet, hung the torn remains of her skirt. Mitsuru was flashing her panties to the entire Student Council! For once, the calm and collected Mitsuru was at an absolute loss for words and had no immediate resolution in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first order of business was to try and cover herself. With only her hands to aid her, Mitsuru's efforts were weak at best as her delicate palms flattened across her front, though plenty of fine black lace was still openly visible. Her second order of business was to turn her head and inspect her ruined skirt. It looked as if the seam had failed completely and ripped apart under the strain of being held by the drawer as Mitsuru walked. In any case, the skirt would need some serious mending to function properly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the biggest problem was that the Student Council, classmates and underclassmen all meant to look up to and respect Mitsuru, were now being treated to a peep show of her unmentionables. This absolutely would not do, and Mitsuru had to come up with a solution to the situation before her image was damaged any more than it just had been. To this end, Mitsuru realized that she needed to get some proper cover for her lower half. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to wrench open the cabinet and salvage her skirt, of course. The considerable damage would mean that Mitsuru would need to keep both hands on it to keep it on, assuming she could even pull it out in the first place. The skirt was hanging from the corner of the drawer, and the fabric might have jammed the slide the drawer moved along, essentially locking it up tight. Plus, doing this would mean exposing her backside to the room while both her hands were occupied with the drawer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second possible solution would be to run away. Get out of the room and try to find somewhere to hide. Then she could at least try to think of a more complete solution, and perhaps even find something to cover herself up with. Of course, that would mean running through the halls of the school with no skirt on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Mitsuru could try to appeal to the room for help. Perhaps someone could loan her a school jacket that she could tie around her waist? It wouldn't be perfect, but it would at least be something. Assuming, of course, that anybody was willing to do that for her. While Mitsuru was popular and loved, she was also envied, and there's no telling who might jump at the chance to make the redheaded beauty squirm...</span></div></div>",

Not only would it send a message of weakness towards the Student Council and, by extension, the entire school, but today was the deadline for finishing the new budget plans for all of the school clubs.  Between everything on Mitsuru's busy plate, this meeting right now was the only chance she had to review and approve of this year's plan.  The issue was, without her approval, the plan could not be submitted, and if the plan wasn't submitted today, then the 30 or so clubs all around the school would be completely without funds for the next three months, the blame for which would all be placed squarely on her shoulders, obviously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for seeking aid from the other students, Mitsuru looked around the room once more to see if any would be willing.  Unfortunately, the warm weather meant that not a single person had a jacket, sweater, scarf, or other superfluous garment of sufficient coverage.  And according to the glances most of the boys kept making, it seemed they would rather like it the longer she was left like this.  In fact, the shock her sudden disrobement had on all of the council members was beginning to fade away.  For the girls as well, frozen stares were slowly melting away to wry smiles of amusement, and those that had turned their gazes of our respect or fear were quickly diminishing, all eyes returning front and center.  As whispers and stifled laughter began to creep up from the back of the room, Mitsuru knew that she had to act now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining her hands in front of her panties and putting on her best poker face, Mitsuru addressed the Council, \"It seems I have had some difficulty with the filing cabinets.  Please, allow me a moment before we continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the students blinked in response, a few mouths parted lips as if to say something, but no one did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good, everyone is silent again.  I believe that has bought me some time,</i> Mitsuru thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep, silent breath, Mitsuru turned around to face the filing cabinet, tugged the back of her blouse as far down as it could go, which unfortunately wasn't very much, and examined the cabinet in front of her.  Just as her cursory glance had informed her, one of the side seams had torn apart completely, splitting the skirt evenly down its entire length.  She grasped the skirt with one hand and gave it a couple quick pulls.  Nothing.  She then knelt a little to test the cabinet drawer.  It remained shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru grimaced.  It looked like brute force was going to be her only option in retrieving her skirt.  It would be disastrous if it ripped more, but she figured that If she could get it out at least mostly intact, she might be able to use some of the office supplies to salvage it in some way, allowing her to continue the meeting with at least some decorum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fushimi,\" Mitsuru spoke firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" Chihiro, who moments ago was taking a fascination to the ceiling tiles, replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your assistance,\" Mitsuru directed, pointing at the cabinet drawer.  \"When I give the word, lift and pull the drawer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" she said, nodding and doing her best to keep her eyes at or above chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Chihiro in position, Mitsuru crouched to ready herself to free her garment.  She winced as she could feel her blouse sliding up above her hips, realizing that, bent over as she was, she her panty-clad posterior was now completely exposed to the entire council.  <i>Just 30 seconds, that's all I will need,</i> she thought, doing her best to keep herself motivated enough to stay in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, pull!\" Mitsuru commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heave, Mitsuru dug her heels into the floor and tugged at her skirt, while Chihiro tried her best to work the drawer loose.  Unfortunately, after three full attempts, neither skirt nor cabinet were making any leeway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she paused to catch her breath, Mitsuru could hear whispers rising again.  She was starting to lose control of the room, and she knew it.  <i>This is turning into a complete fiasco... Do they seriously not think I can hear them, their snickers at how my bottom wiggles as I attempt to preserve my modesty?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru gritted her teeth, and made one last attempt, pouring all of her strength into pulling backwards.  With the resistance this endeavor had provided thus far, Mitsuru was caught off guard as the skirt gave way with a loud tear.  However, her excess momentum sent her hurdling backwards, stumbling into the center table with a loud thud, and falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding insult to injury, a nearby water bottle one of the students had carelessly left uncapped at the edge of the table was knocked over from the impact, drenching the unfortunate redhead with its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncomprehensibly muttering under her breath, Mitsuru cleared her wet hair from the face to find a good portion of her skirt in her hands.  As for its condition, it was-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru's face fell as she surveyed what remained of her skirt. While she had managed to free a fair amount of it from the cabinet, it hadn't been freed in good condition. Rather than a solid piece of fabric, Mitsuru held a ragged chunk of her skirt, loose threads and dangling scraps hanging in every direction. This black rag that had once been her skirt might have been capable of covering her front or back, maybe, had it managed to stay in somewhat good condition. As it was, however, the Kirijo heiress was now completely deprived of her skirt. Mitsuru knew she had to find a way to control the situation again, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to her feet, Mitsuru turned and faced the rest of the council once more. Similarly to her initial loss of clothing, the room had gone silent in the wake of Mitsuru's newest accident. What Mitsuru didn't notice, however, was that the room's eyes weren't focusing on her lower half quite as much as they were before. Thanks to the uncapped water bottle, Mitsuru's shirt had become transparent and left Mitsuru's magnificent cleavage and lacy black bra on display with little left to the imagination. Mitsuru, however, assumed that she had managed to regain some measure of command over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat, Mitsuru began to speak once more, adopting her normal authoritative tone. \"It would seem that my current issue cannot be resolved. I would ask that everyone here be mature and respectful, and let us all handle this matter like adults. Shall we continue with the meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's question was met with complete silence. Normally there would have been an audible agreement to Mitsuru's plans, at least that was the way things went when Mitsuru was in control of a situation. So what had changed? If they weren't being quiet out of respect, then why were they? It couldn't be Mitsuru's panties; she had managed to somewhat awkwardly shield them with the tattered remainder of her skirt, though her undergarments were still plainly visible in most areas, and her rear end was still exposed to anybody that might step behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I asked a question. Shall we continue the meeting?\" Mitsuru repeated, assuming that the council simply needed to be snapped out of a daze resulting from the recent events. This time Mitsuru was answered, but not by words. Instead, Mitsuru heard giggling again, this time louder than before. Mitsuru hadn't regained control of the situation, she had lost control even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, may I ask, is so funny?\" Mitsuru asked, her face starting to betray a mixture of agitation and apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, President, you are!\" one of the council members managed to say between giggling fits. \"It's just hard to take you seriously when you're standing in front of us basically half naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half naked? Now I may be suffering from a... minor wardrobe malfunction at the moment, but I'm far from half naked. I still have my shirt on, after all.\" Mitsuru said as she wiped some wet hair out of her eyes once more in annoyance. That was when it dawned on her- the water. Looking down, Mitsuru's eyes were met with tragedy for the second time. Her shirt might as well have been off for all the good it was doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop a gasp of shock, Mitsuru threw her arms across her chest. While this left her lower half uncovered as the ruined skirt fell to the ground forgotten, Mitsuru's mind was focused on the new issue at hand. Losing her skirt was humiliating enough, but now to be in front of the rest of the council essentially in her underwear?! This was insane! Mitsuru desperately wanted to run away, get as far from the room as possible before she lost even more respect. But running would harm her reputation just as badly; after all, she was supposed to be the unshakable Mitsuru Kirijo! </span></div></div>",

As much as her honor demanded that she keep going despite her rapidly diminishing wardrobe, Mitsuru just couldn't take it any more. Doing her best to maintain some composure, Mitsuru carefully pulled one hand away from her chest and fanned it out in front of her panties. Looking around the room, Mitsuru noted that she at least wouldn't have to get everyone's attention for her next words, though that was an incredibly small comfort, given the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to... call a short break so that I may regather myself.\" Mitsuru said, her normally imperious tone quivering. \"I apologize. We shall reconvene shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout leaving time for anyone to respond, Mitsuru immediately turned and ran from the room. She knew that her attempt to save face hadn't done much, but she had to do it; if she didn't at least try to maintain composure she'd never be able to forgive herself. Now in the hallway, Mitsuru frantically looked around for a place to go. The lower floors were out, at least for the time being. Mitsuru would rather thoroughly search the current floor than risk putting herself further from the Student Council room than absolutely necessary. She just had to figure out a way to at least salvage what remained of her outfit, perhaps find a way to dry her shirt so it wouldn't be transparent any longer. That's it! She could use the hand dryer in the bathroom to dry her shirt. It wouldn't be ideal, and it would probably take a fair bit of time, but it was a sound enough idea, and certainly better than standing in the hallway with no plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly turning to her left, Mitsuru spied the bathroom sign hanging from the hallway ceiling. Thankfully it was a relatively short distance, and the sound of Mitsuru's boots slapping down the hall as she ran only lasted a few scant seconds, though to Mitsuru they felt like an eternity. Sharply turning into the bathroom doorway, Mitsuru began hurriedly unbuttoning her blouse and slid it off her arms. Now standing in nothing but her undergarments and boots, Mitsuru walked to the hand dryer on the wall and activated it, holding her dripping shirt under the hot stream of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several cycles of hot air, the shirt seemed to be at least slightly less drenched, though still not good enough to put back on. It would seem that this would take some time, but at least it was being done in the seclusion of the women's bathroom, Mitsuru reasoned. That was when Mitsuru noticed something in the reflection of the bathroom mirror, just out of the corner of her eye. As she realized what was being reflected, Mitsuru's heart skipped a beat; she was looking at-</span></div></div>",

This is gold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergh... Yes, well this has been a hilarious event for all of us, but I really must be going now,\" Mitsuru said, picking up her still-damp blouse not wanting to be in the same room as this jackal any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast,\" the girl said, centering herself squarely in front of the door.  \"We both know you have a reputation to maintain.  How will I know you won't pull some crazy Kirijo Group stunt and sick the school on me because of my new precious secret photo album?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could save us both the trouble and delete the pictures right now,\" Mitsuru stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be a crime!\" the girl suddenly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A- what?\" Mitsuru asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crime against nature, and art!\" the girl started bouncing back and forth energetically.  \"You getting caught in your underwear... the chances of that happening are like a blizzard in the middle of summer, or getting struck by lightning and a meteorite.  This is too rare to just lose to nothingness.  It must be preserved for posterity forever with me as its keeper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was starting to get the feeling that the girl had her own personal, less than wholesome, reasons for wanting to keep these pictures of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Mitsuru sighed.  \"I give you my word that, so long as you keep those pictures secret, you will receive no retribution from me, and we can both just go our separate ways.  Is that fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" the girl mused, continuing to sway back and forth, finger to her head in mock thought.  \"That sounds really good, but can I really be sure you would just leave me alone, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already given you my word, what more do you want from me?\" Mitsuru raised her voice.  <i>\"This girl is incorrigible!\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...\" she said, winking.  \"You give me something.  A little insurance for my safety, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackmail, is it?  You are really testing my patience!\" Mitsuru marched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh!\" the girl said, backing to the door.  \"If you try something, I'll scream so loud that everyone nearby will see the half-naked President beating on a poor, defenseless little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation had gone entirely out of control.  Giving in to this wretch was deplorable, but Mitsuru could see no other options that she could take in her compromised state.  \"Fine...\" Mitsuru said in defeat.  \"Just make your demand already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then,\" she said, satisfied, giving off a cold smile.  \"To pass the tollbooth and be on your merry way, I just need you to give me-\"</span></div></div>",

You can't tell me you bought underwear that looks like that without expecting to show it off to someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru wanted to protest this claim, explain that the design wasn't what had influenced her purchase. Mitsuru had bought this underwear simply because the fabric was of a fine quality and was very comfortable, she certainly had bought it with the intention of showing it off! Still, Mitsuru knew that her tormentor wouldn't believe her claim, and even arguing for the sake of saving face would simply be a waste of breath at this point. Nevertheless, there had to be something Mitsuru could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you can't do this.\" Mitsuru pleaded. \"I-I can offer you something else once I'm decent once more. Name your price, I'll write the check.\" As much as she was loath to resort to using her money to solve problems, Mitsuru was willing to make an exception given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Student Council President trying to bribe a student?\" the girl asked, a mock look of shock on her face. \"Does the shameful behavior never cease? No, money isn't what I'm after. Either hand over the blouse, or I make as much of a scene as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she hated to admit it, this girl had Mitsuru beat. She wouldn't be satisfied until she had Mitsuru's blouse in her hands and the situation was too dire to call her bluff. With great reluctance, Mitsuru held out the still-damp blouse to her captor. The other girl quickly snatched the blouse from Mitsuru's hands, wrapping it up into a tight ball of fabric and stuffing it into her bag. Closing her bag back up, Mitsuru's captor quickly held up her phone once more, a sharp *click* signifying that another picture had been taken. This shot Mitsuru back to reality, her arms quickly crossing over her body to cover herself, even though it was too late to prevent to photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful.\" the girl said, a smile on her face as she looked over her last picture. \"Thanks for the show, Kirijo. And remember, try to get back at me and these get sent out all over school, and maybe even a few to some other places where the Kirijo Group is a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to remind me of your blackmail.\" Mitsuru shot back, her glare burning almost as much as her blushing face. \"Now leave me be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the girl stepped aside and gave Mitsuru enough space to leave the bathroom. As she stepped out into the hallway, the gravity of her situation came crashing back down upon the redhead. She was in the middle of the school building with nothing on except her bra, panties, and boots. There was no way Mitsuru was returning to the Student Council room in her current state. No, she had to find something to fix the situation, some kind of clothing or <i>anything</i> she could use to cover herself. The problem was what she could do to that end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would require running the length of the school building, but Mitsuru could try to get to the locker room and find her gym clothes. It would be risky, and there's a chance that it would be in vain; with the school day over and most of the sports clubs done by now, there was a very real chance that the locker rooms had been locked up for the day. If that was the case, it'd be a wasted effort to make the run. Worse yet, she'd be at greater risk of being seen after such a run. Still, what other choice did Mitsuru have? As far as she could figure, it was either that or try finding a solution outside the school building... could Mitsuru even bring herself to step outdoors in such a state?</span></div></div>",

One could almost imagine that the Dark Hour had descended if not for the sunlight still pouring in through the windows. Mitsuru resolved to take advantage of the moment, rather than allow the calm before the storm to break while she was still out in the open. A slim hope was better than none at all. At worst, the gym might provide some cover in which to hide until the building was vacant and she could contact someone trustworthy to aid her. Preferably Minako or Yurkari or another female ally. Akihiko might be reliable, but...no. Letting him know about this humiliating situation would be deeply embarrassing for both of them. Junpei of course was out of the question. He would peek, and she would be forced to execute him, and then where would they be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch were her thoughts as she carefully made her way across the school. Tell tale foot falls allowed her to slink around corners or hide behind lockers as needed. She had a few close calls, but did manage to make her way to the gym unseen (if nothing else, exploring the tower honed one's ability to avoid or get the drop on enemies with great alacrity). The gym, however, was occupied. And from the sounds of metal clashing against metal with a whip like snap-snap, Mitsuru could guess what club was meeting tonight. She cringed inwardly. Of course the fencing club, of which she was a prominent member, had relocated to this area due to renovations in their wing. It seemed fate wanted to expose her humiliating situation to the associates she worked with most closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru shook her head. No turning back now. Unfortunately, she would make too much noise in her thick leather boots. Breathing in deeply, she unzipped her boots and removed them. The floor beneath her bare feet felt strange and cold, but it would allow her to move more quickly and quietly throughout the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru snuck into the gym, carefully timing her entry when the student's backs were turned. As silently and swiftly as possible, Mitsuru slunk behind the bleachers. This situation was more and more awkward by the moment. She could either wait for her club to leave, or sneak to the locker rooms on the other side of the gym. Either way, the odds of being seen grew higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, there were few ways indeed it could get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn announced bell rang overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Hidetoshi Odagiri, from the student council disciplinary committee.

An apology will be issued before the student body and the representatives of the Kirijo group, appropriate reprimands and disciplinary measures will be administered, and the perpetrator will be made to attend to school and business in only the attire he or she is found in at the time for a period to be determined by the Council and school board. While I admit such measures sound harsh, the student council has convinced me that rigorous enforcement of the dress code will encourage all our members to approach all of their duties with the utmost respect and seriousness. I encourage all our students and faculty to do likewise. Remember, success begins with appearance! Good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was trembling in terror and rage. Those backstabbing little....and to drag Hidetoshi away from his investigation and use him as the unaware figurehead of their little power play against her (surely as harsh as Hidetoshi could be he would never willingly ambush her like this if he knew the complete situation....but he could easily be talked into delivering the message if they omitted certain details and Chihiro was bullied into silence). When this was all over, she would execute every one of those smarmy little judas', slowly and painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mitsuru consoled herself with such thoughts, a whistle was blown. Their instructor was calling an end to the match. At last! Now just wait a few moments and sneak in after the team had entered the lockers. Discovering her in there would be embarrassing, but she could concoct an excuse easily enough. Then get some spare clothes, and this nightmare would be over and she could return to the important business of cracking heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the club dispersed, the coach hit a button on the wall. The bleachers began to slide back up against the gym wall on an automated track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Mitsuru whispered as her hiding space started to close in around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, Mitsuru was extremely agile and flexible. Her body had been honed by years of training and pitched battles with Shadows. So she was able to manuever herself into a tight position cramped position and slip through the obstacle course of metal and wood even as it conspired to pin her against the back wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, just as she had squeezed her way out, the mechanism caught the edge of her bra AND her panties, pinching her garments against the wall. Try as she might, Mitsuru was unable to remove them. Worse still, they were caught in such a way that tearing them free would make them effectively useless for any purpose of modesty. Thus, she was trapped. She could wiggle free, and thus able to roam the halls with total impunity and utter nudity. Or she could stay there...clothed and trapped and almost certain to be seen by her teammates when they exited. The choice was to risk being caught completely naked out in the open and be subject to the sadistic whims of the council's new laws, or be guaranteed to be caught and face those sadistic whims with a modicum of dignity still intact as she would be allowed to attend school in her skimpy underwear. What would her choice be?</span></div></div>",

This whole stunt with the new dress code enforcement was designed specifically to entrap Mitsuru and she knew it. No, even if it meant doing the unthinkable, there was no way Mitsuru was going to just lie down and admit defeat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself, Mitsuru reached behind her back and managed to unclasp her bra, awkwardly squirming out of it and rendering herself topless. Now for the hardest part... The elegant redhead reached for the waistband of her panties, firmly gripped along the strap going over her hip nearest the wall, and yanked her hands apart. The fabric strained and dug into Mitsuru's palms before finally snapping. With one leg free, Mitsuru was able to hop forward and ease her other leg out of her panties, leaving her now completely naked in the school gymnasium. Her only clothing now torn and pinned fast against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bra and pair of panties was a small sacrifice in the face of being publicly humiliated. Speaking of which, Mitsuru had to get out of sight before she was caught in an even worse state. Making a beeline for the locker rooms, Mitsuru quickly slipped inside and hurried to the relative safety of the lockers. At least being naked here wasn't completely unbelievable. Being naked in the locker room for hours on end, however, would raise eyebrows and lead to unpleasant consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely there must be at least one locker with something to wear. A spare uniform, or even just a spare set of gym clothes. Honestly, Mitsuru would be grateful for even just a towel at this point. Anything would be better than getting caught naked with the newly established punishment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if there wasn't anything to wear, there was another option. It was insane, it was indecent, and it was unthinkable, but then again the same could be said of Mitsuru's current situation. If Mitsuru was caught naked in school, it would mean having to relive the humiliation for an indefinite amount of time. But if Mitsuru were to be caught naked off school grounds, she arguably wouldn't be breaking the new rule. She'd be breaking the law, and risking exposure to far more people, but it would be, at least theoretically, temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no good answer to this situation. Mitsuru carefully considered the problems inherent in both situations, and finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Holy shit!  Kirijo-sempai's naked!\"<br>\r\nHearing that, Mitsuru's blood ran cold.  Regardless of her attempts to return to being decent, she had been caught totally nude by her peers.  Right after that traitorous announcement, no less!  She slowly turned to face her fate.<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a body!\"\"What a slut!\"\"I've had dreams that weren't this hot!\"\"I can't believe she'd do something like this!\"\"So she IS a natural redhead!\"<br>\r\nThis was it.  Her life was over.  The scandal of this day and the ensuing punishment would absolutely destroy her reputation, as well as the reputation of her father's company.  The rowdy comments of her classmates merely served to drive home the fact that there was no way out.  No doubt the comments would continue through the entirety of her 'punishment' for violating the dress code.  Damn that new rule!  She'd never expect a student...to...<br>\r\nSuddenly, she had an idea.  She'd still be nude for the foreseeable future, and personally, she might never live this shame down, but there was a way for her to emerge from this debacle with her reputation intact, if not her dignity.  She had to act fast though...<br>\r\nQuickly, she stood up tall and faced the crowd directly, concealing none of her unclothed form.  As much as she wanted to shield herself from their gazes, if this was to work, she had to appear completely confident.  Fortunately for her plan, if not her pride, one of the gym coaches ha arrived after hearing the commotion.  Even as the coach opened their mouth to ask why the hell the student council president was naked in the boys' (the Boys' Locker Room!  Why, oh, why didn't I pay better attention as I ran!?) locker room, she spoke out loudly and clearly, despite her nuclear blush.<br>\r\n\"Classmates, I see you have an apparent streaker-\"\"Apparent nothing!  You're naked as a newborn!\" the coach interrupted.  \"I think that I am fully aware of that Miss Haruno, but I do request that you let me finish what I was about to say.  It is important to school discipline.\"  After waiting a moment to make sure the coach wouldn't interrupt again (and remind herself that she lost any footwear she had left when the bleachers almost closed on her) she started again.<br>\r\n\"Classmates, I see that you have caught an apparent streaker.  Knowing the new school rules, my punishment will indeed be steep.\"  At this point, many of the gathered young men started grinning.  \"I, personally, proposed a different punishment for uniform violations.  Unfortunately, the majority of the Student Council felt that such extreme measures were required.  As such, I knew that it was entirely likely that some poor student would forget the consequences of dress code violations and be stuck in an unfortunate position with no way to correct it until after their sentence had been served, possibly leading to a repeat or even worse infraction due to forgetfulness and habit.\"<br>\r\nTo her own personal horror, Mitsuru felt herself growing more aroused the longer she stood in front of her not-so-small audience.  She knew she needed to finish quickly before her newly discovered exhibitionist side discredited her plan.<br>\r\nShe resumed speaking at a slightly faster pace, hoping that the climax of her speech would mask her uneasiness and arousal.  \"As such, I felt that an immediate example of the punishment would serve to help save other students unnecessary embarassment.  Naturally, even though I am against the current punishment, I felt that the only person I could ask to make such a sacrifice would be myself.\"<br>\r\nGood god, she was almost dripping!  What was wrong with her?!<br>\r\n\"Why did you feel the need to strip down to your bare skin then?  Surely removing less would have had the same effect?\"  Someone from the crowd spoke out.<br>\r\nMitsuru's response was quick, but not too quick.  \"In order to make the new punishment as clear as possible, I needed to go to the absolute limit of what it could do.  Given how it's worded, I felt that complete and total nudity\" she almost came as she said nudity \"was the best example I could show to my fellow students, to show that the Dress Code will be enforced in the strictest of ways from now on.\"<br>\r\nIf her plan worked as it should, then even if she was forced to attend school au natural for a while, her reputation wouldn't suffer, and may even be boosted by this ordeal.<br>\r\nNow, the boys look fairly convinced (granted, her nude speech probably could have convinced the majority of them that the sky was neon pink with green polka-dots, but still) the only variable left was the coach.  Her next action would determine if she came out of this looking like a fair-minded and thoughtful Student Council President, or an exhibitionist slut trying to get off to being naked in the Boys' locker room.<br>\r\nShe's afraid to even breathe as Miss Haruno opens her mouth and says...</span></div></div>",

Even if other students take your warning seriously, you still have to attend school naked for at least a day.  However, what's done is done.  Boys, you stay here, while I take Miss Kirijo to the Director's office so she start to prepare her public apology.\"  At that she quickly pulled Mitsuru through the door and out of the gym before any of her students think to protest.<br>\r\nOnce outside the gym, Miss Haruno confronts Mitsuru about her speech.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever seen someone pull off a lie that well.  Miss Kirijo.\"<br>\r\nMitsuru quickly blushed and covered herself, being careful not to brush her absolutely soaked womanhood.<br>\r\n\"I-\" Once again the coach interrupted her.  \"Stop covering yourself before you blow your cover.\"<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mitsuru does as the coach commands and starts speaking again.  \"I had just heard the announcement and it was the only idea I could come up with on short notice.\"<br>\r\n\"The announcement was a good twenty minutes before you were found so forgive me for being skeptical.\"  Mitsuru looked shocked at the news.  Had she really deliberated a plan of action for almost twenty minutes?  That was completely unacceptable!  Naked or not!  She was so mad at herself and embarassed by her nudity that she almost missed when Miss Haruno began talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I think I can believe that you froze after hearing that announcement.  But the problem I brought up earlier still stands.  No matter what you do now, you're going to be attending school naked for at a couple of days.  On the other hand, you look like you might not mind that so much as when you have to get dressed again afterwards.\"  Mitsuru nearly faceplanted in surprise at the last statement.<br>\r\nTurning to her escort to disabuse her of that ridiculous notion she opened her mouth \"You're leaking like a broken faucet.\" and closed it again as Miss Haruno pointed out her obvious arousal.  Truth be told, Mitsuru was about a light breeze away from the biggest orgasm of her life.<br>\r\n\"I-I-I can't be aroused by this!  It isn't decent for a young lady to enjoy being unclothed in front of her peers!\"<br>\r\nMiss Haruno rolled her eyes before she quickly turned, and, before Mitsuru could react, reached out and flicked the young lady's clitoris.<br>\r\nMitsuru's eyes widened for a fraction of a second before she came, and came, and came, and eventually passed out in pleasure with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned to consciousness, she noticed that, first of all, she was still naked as the day she was born, and secondly, she was laying on the bench in the Director's office.  She quickly sat up and stretched out, feeling the afterglow of, if she was honest with herself, something she hoped happened a lot more often.<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I see that you are awake Miss Kirijo.\"  She absolutely did not attempt to dive for cover as she heard Mister Ikutsuki's voice, she just... thought she saw a mouse and wanted to catch it.  Yes, that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Miss Haruno explained everything.  I do wish that you'd run it by me first though.  I dislike the idea of the Student Council President being a nude young lady, but at this point, there is nothing that can be done.\"  Mitsuru swallowed unsteadily and tried to ignore the fact that she was getting wet again.  \"I'm sorry, Director Ikutsuki, but I could not leave this burden to another.\"<br>\r\nHe sighed, but he accepted that she didn't really have any other choice if she was going to keep her reputation.<br>\r\n\"All right, Miss Kirijo, I'm going to be honest with you.  If you want your story to stick you're likely going to be a nude student for at least a good month.\"  Mitsuru paled even as she got a bit wetter at the thought.  \"I'll at least make sure that you can carry self defense items, and I'll try to get you a shorter sentence, but I doubt that I'll be able to do much on the day this new policy was instituted, especially considering how badly the dress code was broken.  Will that do, Miss Kirijo?\"  Mitsuru thought it over.  Obviously, there was no way she was coming out of this dressed, but Director Ikutsuki was a fairly good friend and would probably get her the best deal he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But what if she doesn't want that?) a recently-discovered part of her whispered.  And no matter how much she tried to suppress it, it grew in both volume and intensity.  (What if we asked him to make the sentence as long as possible.  Through graduation, even?)  The thought was as terrifying as it was arousing.(We could even ask him to extend the punishment to all times.  Imagine it, living life naked as a jaybird, never getting dressed, even to go somewhere public like the mall.  It's so sexy, and it wouldn't be your fault.  After all, you'd just be following the consequences of your actions.)  No, no, NO!  It wasn't proper!(But It'd be so much fun!  You'd probably orgasm like earlier at least once an hour.)<br>\r\nShaking her head to clear it, Mitsuru turned to the Director, who was awaiting a response.</span></div></div>",

She hopes she doesn't regret it.<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer Director Ikutsuki,  but, umm, would you mind asking for something else?\"<br>\r\nShuji Ikutsuki blinked in surprise.  He had honestly thought she'd just jump on board with his plan.  After all, it was the one that let her get dressed the soonest.  He was curious as to what she would want him to say instead.  \"I guess not, but I warn you, you'll still probably have to spend at least a month naked in school.\"<br>\r\nMitsuru blushed a bit and rubbed her legs together before she spoke again.  \"Actually, I was wondering if you could argue for me to be naked longer.\"  The Director openly gaped.  He would have never expected this.  Numbly, he spat out his next question before his brain caught up and decided to ask something else.  \"I suppose I could.  Is there anything else that you want to add?  And how long would you like it to be?\"  It was instinct that carried him now, even as Mitsuru opened her mouth and spouted out more shocks to his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it to be till I graduate Gekkoukan High School.  Including graduating naked.  Also, could you get them to forbid me to dress at any time, as well as confiscate all of my clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dream.  This had to be one hell of a dream. But it wasn't.  The skin he nearly removed from his arm proved it.  Mitsuru Kirijo, the Student Council President of Gekkoukan High School, was asking to be basically forced to become a nudist all the way through her own graduation.  Still wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-miss Kirijo.  I'm afraid I must ask, are you feeling okay?  Because, you must realize that getting such a punishment laid upon you would have you naked for well over a year, including public functions and all... extracurricular... activities.\"  After all, nobody would want to fight Shadows naked, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru understood his confusion, but she did not relent. \"Well, obviously, I would need an exception for personal defense equipment.  Walking everywhere naked, I would have to protect myself, but it wouldn't cover any of the more... interesting areas.  And before you ask again, yes I really do want this.  It is... fun... to be naked.  But I still want to pay those backstabbers back for this,  Even though I enjoy it, te fact remains that they pushed a proposal through while I was indisposed.\"<br>\r\nQuite honestly, if he hadn't already checked, he'd think it was an imposter or that she was being mind-controlled, but it appeared that she actually wanted to be forced into permanent nudity until she received her High School Diploma.<br>\r\n\"Very... well.  I will push for what you asked for.  I think that you are likely to get it too, so I hope that you don't regret this.  In the meantime, there are rules about when a proposal like this can pass, so the other Student Council Members won't get away with it, but I'm afraid that the punishment will have to stand.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\"  She was getting wetter already.  She hopes she didn't stain the bench as she stands up to go.  \"I still need to take care of the budget.  I will send the guilty parties to you for their punishment.  I don't think I'm in the right frame of mind to do it myself.  As for my 'public apology,' that will be tomorrow, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll call a school assembly in the morning for the announcement.  You'll also be informed of the specifics of the punishment in front of the entire school.  However,\" He started to look a little hesitant, and Mitsuru could guess why. \"I'm guessing that the punishment includes not changing my attire outside of bathing and sleeping until I'm sentenced?\" \"...yes, so I'm afraid that you'll be walking home as you are now.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine.  I'll need to get used to it anyway.\"  With that Mitsuru walked out of the office and started heading for the Student Council Room, leaving an almost invisible trail of pussy juice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she get what she asked for.</span></div></div>",

Reflexively, Mitsuru crossed her arms across her chest, her exposed panties forgotten as she shielded the demanded garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you want what?!\" Mitsuru stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me.\" The girl said, the same cold look on her face. \"Give me your bra, and you're free to go. Besides, you've still got a shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true, Mitsuru did indeed still have her blouse. Of course, said blouse was still damp and slightly transparent. Even if the shirt was bone dry it would be crazy to wear it without a bra. The personally tailored nature of the blouse meant that Mitsuru's lack of undergarments would be plainly obvious, and Mitsuru was well aware that she was the subject of plenty of stares even when normally dressed. Still, what choice did she have? There was no way her tormentor was going to let her leave the bathroom unhindered unless she surrendered her bra, and risking a public spectacle was completely out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a vile woman, I hope you know.\" Mitsuru said as she slowly brought her hands together behind her back and unclasped her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know.\" the girl said, smiling viciously as she continued to hold her phone up, likely photographing Mitsuru's disrobing. Mitsuru could only hope that she kept the most intimate parts of her chest hidden from the camera's lens, though she couldn't know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully sliding her bra off her arms, Mitsuru carefully kept her left arm clamped across her chest as her right held out her bra to the girl in front of her. The girl quickly snatched the bra from Mitsuru's fingers, holding it up in front of her face and, much to Mitsuru's shock, giving it a sniff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, what is that? Some kind of fancy perfume, I'm guessing?\" The girl asked, a twisted smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is none of your business!\" Mitsuru snapped. \"Now let me pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, the girl stepped aside, giving Mitsuru a way out of the bathroom. \"Sure, sure. Have fun out there, Madame President. Be careful though, there's no telling what kind of weirdos might take advantage of you in this state!\" This was punctuated with a swat to Mitsuru's behind as the now half-dressed redhead stomped past the girl and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was free of her bathroom tormentor, Mitsuru remembered the blouse still clenched in her hands. Realizing that, while it might not have been presentable, it was still better than absolutely nothing, Mitsuru quickly pulled the blouse on. Shuddering a bit at the feeling of the still damp fabric against her bare skin, Mitsuru looked down to assess just how ridiculous she looked. The diagnosis was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric hadn't had a chance to dry completely, and Mitsuru's skin was still visible in the spots where the fabric pressed against her. Unfortunately for Mitsuru, these spots included the majority of her breasts which, thanks to her lack of a bra, meant that she was essentially topless to the casual observer. Worse yet... had the heat of the dryer shrank the shirt? It still fit, of course, but it seemed a bit tighter than normal, though this could just be Mitsuru's mind playing tricks on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru had to do something to rectify the situation. Clearly she wasn't going to find a solution to her predicament on this floor, but that sadly meant she'd have to risk descending the stairs and possibly running into more students. Still, the lower floor offered both a path to the gym, where Mitsuru could at least hopefully grab her PE shirt, as well as the Home Ec room. The Home Ec room was barely ever used, and often locked as a result, but it would have fabric and potentially even finished garments that Mitsuru could use. With her heart hammering away in her chest and her breaths deep and fearful (which Mitsuru failed to notice seemed to be straining the buttons of her blouse), Mitsuru resigned herself to a path, deciding to make a run for-</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, not a soul was in sight.  Taking advantage of her good fortune, she dashed as fast as she could to the Home Ec Room.

Additionally, there was a rack that had some clothes hanging from it.  Unfortunately, there was no spare fabric out on the floor.  There was a supply storage cabinet that might have had some in the corner of the room but it was locked.  She was stuck just with what there was, not that she had much experience in sewing anyways.  It irked her somewhat that, with the variety of colors and styles of the outfits, it was unlikely she would find one that matched.  Still, anything was better than what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking her shirt, Mitsuru grimaced.  It was still as damp and see-through, (and maybe tighter?) as ever.  With a sigh, she undid the buttons and hung it on the rack.  As these clothes were newly made, their lack of size tags meant that she would have to try on each piece individually.  And wearing her wet blouse at the same time would only get in the way of that.  Not that it made the feeling of being topless at school any easier for Mitsuru, of course.  \"I just hope there's something my size,\" she muttered, as she removed her shoes as well and began to look through what was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoring through various shirts, pants, and skirts, hopes were dashed as none of the clothes fit right on her.  Each and every one of them were too small in some way, whether it was her bust or hip size, the garment's length, or both.  Her size wasn't THAT uncommon, was it?  It took all of her will not to throw each failure to the floor in disgust.  The students must have worked very hard on these, after all, even if they were useless to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merde!\" she swore, slamming her arms down on a nearby desk.  \"Is there nothing at all that I can use!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as Mitsuru was about to give up, regather her blouse and shoes, and head to the gym, her gaze stumbled on the corner of the room, showing an outfit that she hadn't seen before.  Worn by a mannequin with a build similar to her own, she quickly, but carefully, took them off the doll and put them on.  Sure enough they fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a cheer, Mitsuru turned towards the mirror to see herself in the clothes that might save the day for her, which were:</span></div></div>",

Even better, they were of the school colors, so it would look to the Student Council that she simply went to get her spare outfit.  The only problem was that the jacket didn't have buttons, so it was open in the middle, but the sides were able to close enough to cover her breasts on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Mitsuru said.  \"With this, even my ruined blouse will work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off the jacket and putting the blouse on, Mitsuru could have sworn that the buttons were more difficult to put on together than before.  <i>\"Nonsense,\"</i> she thought.  <i>\"It must be nerves.  Today truly has been quite the ordeal.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the jacket and shoes back on once more, she took one last look in the mirror.  Staring back at her was the proud reflection of Mitsuru Kirijo.  Even her damp blouse seemed less transparent.  At the very least it was less noticeable as it was now only a vertical stripe along the center of her body instead of her entire top half.  Also, it was not obvious that she wasn't wearing a bra at the moment, which was a huge relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything in order, Mitsuru proudly strode back to the Student Council Room.  Throwing the door open, she saw that everyone was still there, though they seemed to be in the middle of packing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-san!\" \"Mitsuru-senpai!\" various voices gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru pressed her advantage.  \"I apologize for the delay,\" she announced.  \"It has been a long day, and I am sorry to have kept you, but we can now finish this without any further interruptions.  Fushimi,\" she turned to Chihiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Chihiro replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The financial records?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" Chihiro nodded, picking up the Finances folder from a nearby table.  \"I almost forgot about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mitsuru, taking the folder from her, making her way to the table and sitting down to read it.  Taking a look at the faces of the other council members, many were showing expressions of shock, and some of dismay.  <i>\"Hmph, so sad that the show's over already?\"</i> Mitsuru thought, smirking.  It was quite the embarrassing moment for her, and she was sure that the Council wouldn't be forgetting it any time soon, but what's done was done.  What mattered now was that everything was back in control.  And it was a good thing too.  A good 15 minutes had been wasted with this diversion.  One way or another, the budget plan had to be finished today.  With luck, she could finish the review of this plan and be done within the hour, just in time to submit the plan to the budgeting office before the deadline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately for her, today wasn't Mitsuru's lucky day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Mitsuru, her outfit was not nearly as secure as she wanted it to be.  Not only had the shrinkage of her blouse tightened it to the breaking point, but her new skirt's zipper was cheap and poorly made, and was only part of the skirt in the first place due to a lack of quality materials.  However, Mitsuru remained oblivious to this, as she was too absorbed within her review of the financial plan to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... everything seems to be in order.  Wait... Hold a moment!\" Mitsuru said, seeing something odd in the plan.  \"There seem to be transfers of funds between clubs labeled only as 'expenses'.  What are these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mitsuru rose from her seat and leaned forward to address the council while pointing at the plan-</span></div></div>",

However, these were not the normal outfits Mitsuru was expecting, instead there were outlandish items including various outfits too complicated for use in everyday life, shirts, masks, and spandex leotards emblazoned with symbols Mitsuru did not comprehend, and something quite provocative along that back wall that she was unable to tell whether it was supposed to be just scanty clothing, some new type of swimsuit, or seductive lingerie.  \"Arisato, what is this place?\" Mitsuru asked, overwhelmed by her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Minako beamed.  \"It's costume party time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Costume... party?\" Mitsuru responded, puzzled.  \"Please, explain yourself.

Besides, she enjoyed everything else so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back,\" Minako called, knocking on the door.  \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mitsuru replied.  \"Let us begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first is this lovely number,\" Minako said, handing Mitsuru an outfit under the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru took the hanger and saw that it held a red dress with a thick white fur trim along the hem and neck lines, accompanied with a similarly colored cap and gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Arisato?  Christmas isn't for another 5 to 6 months,\" Mitsuru stated dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it matches your hair perfectly!\" Minako piped up eagerly.  \"And there's plenty of people that celebrate Christmas in July, at least according to the advertisement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the temporal inaccuracies-\" Mitsuru started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on... could you please just wear it?\" Minako whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Minako's insistence, Mitsuru found herself putting on the dress.  It was a snug fit, so much that she had to remove her bra to get it to fit right.  Even then, a lot of skin was showing, with the bust line resting just above her breasts and the skirt covering only slightly below her waist along her thighs.  She was a bit uncomfortable at the degree of exposure, but she had to admit that the red did indeed match her hair.  And she had always enjoyed Christmas as well, feeling some of the holiday spirit as she gazed at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Mitsuru then presented herself to Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" Minako whistled.  \"Looks like someone's ready to get down and party like they mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a bit daring,\" said Mitsuru.  \"But I suppose a bit of daring is perfect for the night you have planned for us, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" she grinned.  \"But if you think that's great, just wait until you see what I have next,\" Minako giggled, presenting item #2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's jaw dropped to the floor.  She recognized this second outfit to be that filthy attire from the back walls.  In her hands, she could now see that it was nothing more than a black and gold metal-plated bikini connected with some kind of latex straps.  \"What the hell is this!?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little piece called \"High-Cut Armor,\" Minako replied, her smile ever-bright and cheerful.  \"It's the perfect mix of beauty and functionality, with actual metal making for surprisingly effective protection during battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle?\" Mitsuru questioned, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, a-according to the advertisement, of course...\" Minako said, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arisato,\" Mitsuru began.  \"The holiday dress is one thing, but this?  I have standards to maintain!  How will the others respond if they see me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll be just between us friends and besides, it covers a bit more than a swimsuit,\" Minako pleaded.  \"Just try it on at least, for me?  If you absolutely hate it, there's always other options...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked at Minako's begging face and sighed.  \"Very well, then,\" she took the outfit and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru removed the dress and set about putting on the glorified underwear.  With disgust, she found that she could not pull it on over her own panties, forcing her to go commando just to fit it onto her body.  The coverage the outfit provided was minimal, unable to fully cover her cleavage above and buttcheeks below, though, just like a swimsuit, it was enough to cover everything important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Mitsuru's surprise the outfit came with its own set of gloves, boots, choker and headband.  Even with the extra equipment added on her person, it all felt very light and didn't restrict her movements in the slightest.  Minako may have been right in her assertion, she almost felt as though she could do battle in this.  However, she did take note that covering her limbs only seemed to increase attention towards her exposed midriff, shoulders, hips, and thighs.  That discovery made her want to get rid of it right then and there, but she had to be fair to Minako and give her a chance to see the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you may come in,\" Mitsuru called out, unlocking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowza!\" Minako gasped as she laid her eyes on the scantily-clad redhead, completely awestruck.  \"I knew you could pull off sexy, but seeing it in action...\" she drew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had enough?\" Mitsuru grumbled, face fully red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Sorry!\" Minako squaked.  \"I mean, it's not that you're mostly naked,\" she stopped, seeing Mitsuru's glare.  \"Well, it kinda is, but it's more the presence you're giving off as a result.  This ensemble just screams 'overwhelming sexy power!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Mitsuru gave herself another look in the mirror.  She didn't know much about sexy, but she admitted that she was starting to feel a need to crush something under the metal boot she now wore.  A definite display of power; perhaps Minako was onto something after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I just have one more for you to try on,\" Minako rushed back out to grab the last costume.  \"I know how you felt about the last two, so I got you something a bit more conservative this time.  Hope you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the outfit from the excited girl, Mitsuru moved her out of the room and shut the door once more and eagerly removed the scandalous outfit.  Examining the final choice, Mitsuru could tell that Minako wasn't kidding about conservative; this was downright homely.  With a thick blouse, knee-length skirt, stockings, apron, and headdress, Mitsuru recognized it to be a Maid Uniform.  She put it on without difficulties and examined herself in the mirror, unsure of what to make of her appearance.  This was the most decent outfit of the three, yet something felt off.  Perhaps she just needed a second opinion, like she did with the \"armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door and showed herself to Minako one more time.  \"Aww!\" Minako squealed as soon as she saw Mitsuru.  \"You look absolutely adorable, Mitsuru-senpai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adorable?\" Mitsuru repeated.  \"That's a new reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's just how I feel when I see you wearing this costume,\" Minako shrugged.  \"You just look so cute and sheltered and give you a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similar to a pet?\" Mitsuru ventured.  \"This is the outfit of a servant, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako wasn't able to come up with a real response to that, so Mitsuru went back and changed into her normal clothes.  Upon returning, Minako spoke up again, \"You looked wonderful in all of these costumes!  So, which one are you going to pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well...\" Mitsuru began. \"These are three drastically different outfits, Arisato.  Shouldn't I worry more about which would match everyone else's costumes to make a more consistent theme for tonight's party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that, I've been helping everyone get costumes all week for this.  Trust me, with all the costumes everyone chose, you could pick any of these three and not feel out of place,\" Minako said, grinning again, but with a hint of... mischieviousness? Mitsuru thought she spied on the girl's expression.  \"Just go with the one you feel most comfortable with, Mitsuru-senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru beheld the three outfits she had worn.  Remembering the subtle differences she felt while wearing them and Minako's reactions to these outfits, it was clear that her choice of attire had a chance of affecting how the party would go for her.  After much thought, Mitsuru eventually decided to go with-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru sighed with pure contentment as the warm water cascaded over her naked body. She presented quite a sight to a sadly nonexistent audience. Water was cascading off of her in little rivulets, tracing a path across her lovely face, down her slender neck, trickling between her wonderfully large orbs, running down her taught stomach to finally drip off her magnificent curves and pert butt. Mitsuru closed her eyes as she began to lather herself with soap, humming softly to herself. This was the moment she lived for. After a hard day of student councils and intense studying and demanding classes and coordinating Shadow Exterminations with Minako there was nothing she relished more than the simple serenity of a long shower. The roar of the shower blotted out any sound from the outside world, and the warm slick embrace of the water was heaven all on its own. And best of all, there was no one here to interrupt or secretly spy on her (she had had to 'execute' more than one of her maids who's taste, as it happened, ran towards the same sex). Here she could waste as much water as she desired, and no one could complain. This was the ultimate reward she owed herself for all her hard work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally shut the how water off, she stood stood in the steaming pool left over. To her surprise she found her bathrobe nowhere in sight. She sighed softly to herself, remembering she had left it buried under a pile of dirty laundry. With no servants waiting on her who might spy her naked body, the girl had gotten into the habit of wondering around it. It wasn't a good habit to fall into. But with a smile and a shrug, Mitsuru gathered up a small towel to dry herself with and wandered out of her private bathroom quite naked. She was away from her mansion now. Being a little lax could hardly hurt. Might as well treat the whole thing like a vacation and be just a pinch daring (for Mitsuru, of course, vacation meant getting away from the lap of luxury and living what to a simple middle class girl would be considered normal). As mortifying as it would be to be seen butt naked by someone, she might as well enjoy the freedom a lack of clothing would grant her. Besides, the AC unit was fairly small for the dorm, and it could get very hot around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Mitsuru dried herself off and wrapped the towel around her hair to help it dry as well. It was a slow laundry day, and the towels she had available were far to small to wrap around herself like she normally would. But that hardly mattered, right? If it was okay to be lax about wearing a robe, it would surely be okay to forgo the towel as well! And it had been such a long day, with so many demands for her time and so many decisions to be made! Mitsuru had had enough with making decisions, even ones as trivial as which pair of PJs to wear. Time to let it all hang out! She laughed slightly to herself as she boldly strolled around her room, the only item of clothing the small pink towel in her hair. An impish little part of her was getting a naughty thrill out of the decision. This was very much the anti-thesis of what her father and tutors had said about how a young aristocratic japanese girl was supposed to conduct herself. But none of them were here, and for once Mitsuru could afford to indulge herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped trotting around her room rather suddenly. A tiny little tickle was building up inside her, and a moment later she let out a loud sneeze. Ugh. She had been told time and again that staying naked all day was a likely way to catch a cold. But Yukari and Fuuka claimed that was just an old wives tale. And they did understand so much more about the world than Mitsuru and her sheltered background could have comprehended. She would be fine. Nothing was going to go wrong....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease pick from this list of options which scenario you would like to go wrong.</span></div></div>",

The top floor's meeting room contained a massive computer meant to operate and catalog all this information as well as monitor the city for Shadow activity. Unbeknownst to Mitsuru, this observation equipment was in her room as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako had been asked to check out a strange error with the computer early into the school year, and the SEES leader had discovered that this observation equipment had been coming online and recording random rooms at seemingly random times. Minako had considered bringing the error to the team's attention and having the problem fixed, but then she started to peruse the recordings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discovering that watching her teammates when they thought they were alone was both entertaining (and at times decidedly erotic), Minako had slowly taught herself how to operate the cameras herself. Now, whenever the bubbly SEES leader had no other obligations, she'd quietly slip away to the meeting room to spy on her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have never guessed some of the other girls' secrets. Yukari was far more inventive with pleasuring herself than Minako would have suspected, and the things that Fuuka watched on that laptop of hers could be downright shocking. However, Minako loved watching Mitsuru most of all. The elegant and beautiful redhead had proven the most difficult to catch in a private moment, always properly dressed, or just off camera, or wrapped in a towel. So imagine Minako's surprise when Mitsuru strode into the camera's view without a stitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Minako whispered, a hand slowly slipping under her skirt. \"Mitsuru-senpai, how naughty of you, walking around naked like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her heart racing, Minako watched as her senpai plopped down on the couch in her room, grabbing a book and idly beginning to read. Believing herself to be alone, the gorgeous redhead did nothing to cover herself, giving Minako an unobstructed view of every wonderful detail of her form. This was a once in a lifetime event!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It probably was, wasn't it? Minako considered the fact that she might never catch Mitsuru in this state ever again. Minako had plenty of recordings, but those were all the computer glitch's doing, and the SEES leader had never attempted to run the recording software herself. But how hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that it couldn't be too hard, Minako-</span></div></div>",

But the more buttons she pushed without any apparent effect the more exasperated she became. Soon enough she was mashing buttons all across the keyboard, occasionally pounding the controls with her tiny fist, all futilely trying to get the damn thing to do SOMETHING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart skipped a beat when she pounded one control and watched the awesome sight of her Senpai's body vanish from the feed completely. With a squeek of horror she pushed the button again. To her great relief, the image popped back up without any fanfare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. So you turn off just fine. But make one lousy little recording to mark a really special occasion? Nope! No nice things for Minako-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako pouted, glaring at the monitor. In order to console herself, she focused on her Senpai's magnificent body while her eager fingers \"worked off her stress\" under her skirt. She gave a little bow and a prayer of thanks to whatever kami was responsible for the Kirijo gene pool. Those beautiful curves, that pert yet bouncy little butt, that cute and neatly trimmed bush, and of course those magnificent breasts...it was so much more than even Minako had dared to imagine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! No! It can't end like this! I gotta...I gotta...\" Minako trailed off as she took in the sight of the big laundry pile in one corner of Mitsuru's room. \"Minako-chan, you are a genius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully turning the system off, Minako then dashed out of the control room and down the stairs as fast as she could (probably as fast as she'd ever run, with the possible exception of when she and Yukari were fleeing from her first encounter with a shadow). Fleeing into her room, Minako hastily gathered up the biggest laundry hamper she owned, tossed some of her dirty things in, and then back down the hallway. With her heart racing, Minako knocked loudly on Mitsuru's door and opened it without waiting for a reply. Thank heaven Mitsuru (unlike all the other killjoys on this floor) had never gotten into the habit of locking her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" Mitsuru screamed in shock and dove behind her sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii Senpai! Making a laundry run! Figured I'd make take on a load of your things while I'm at it! Been running you guys hard through Tartarus with all that blood and stuff so I know your clothes must get really gunky really fast!\" Minako said, deliberately speaking a mile a minute while pretending to be oblivious to Mitsuru's state of nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MINAKO! G-GET O-\" Mitsuru said in mortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SENPAI!!\" Minako said, deliberately raising her voice above Mitsuru's own shout. \"What have you been doing this whole time? How did your laundry get like this? Oh, this is worse than I thought! Sigh. I know your maids used to do all this for you, but you HAVE to learn to keep up with this! What would the others say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Mitsuru trailed off, her cheeks burning. \"I was getting around to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Senpai! This can't be hygienic at all! I need my team in top shape every night! If you get sick it could put our training back for days...maybe weeks! Well, never mind. I'll take care of this just this once! But you'd better do it yourself in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need...err...Sorry. I appreciate the gesture, Minako-chan, but really...what are you doing?\" Mitsuru asked, keeping herself hidden behind her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't get up, I've got this!\" Minako said cheerily as she dumped the pile of laundry into her hamper and then began going through Mitsuru's chest of drawers. \"But if its been this long, we better wash everything! It can gather dust and mildew if you let it sit, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I...I didn't know that...\" Mitsuru said, then shook her head. \"But...Minako, please, your taking away everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me!\" Minako said, grabbing a big suitcase to fill up the clothes her hamper wouldn't accomodate. \"Ewww, those bedsheets look pretty bad too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! What are you...??\" Mitsuru began, as Minako proceeded to gather up every piece of clothing and every bit of cloth that could conceivably be used to wrap herself in or provide decent cover. All seemingly perfectly innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Mitsuru's shower was the sort that had a glass door rather than a curtain. Minako had no idea how she could have justified stealing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....ENOUGH! Arisato, will you stop for one moment and.....STOP!\" Mitsuru snapped. \"Minako, you are taking my clothes away! Can't you see I'm naked here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Minako asked innocently, glancing at her. \"Oh. Heh heh heh! You got me Senpai! Your hiding back there with a low cut night gown that bares your shoulders, right? Good prank! But come on! Walking around your room butt naked? That's the kind of stuff Junpei or Yukari would do! I know sophisticated girls like us would never be caught dead doing such a thing! We're leaders and examples for the rest of our team! I mean, I could never respect or listen to anyone who ever did something so...so scanty and wrong! Could you, Senpai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru blushed intensely and shrank further behind the sofa. \"....Of course not. Yes. Yes indeed. Just a little joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Senpai! Well, Great! I'm off! Should have all this done in a few hours! But don't get mad if it takes longer! Is a pretty big load. But I'll try my best to get it all done tonight! No need for thanks!\" Minako said, in her best manic pixie voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mitsuru began to panic and tremble, Minako strolled truimphantly down the hallway. She'd find a more permanent place for everything later. Right now....She dropped all the items in the heap on her floor, shut her door firmly, then fell on her bed. Her hands were underneath her skirt before she even knew what she was doing. Her pussy was sopping wet and it took no time at all to find the perfect frantic rhythm for herself. In less than a minute she felt herself cumming hard and fast, her insides exploding in pure pleasure. She couldn't believe she had just done that! She couldn't believe it had worked! And most mysterious all was how her release could feel so very fulfilling and yet completely unquenched! She needed more! And for that this game would have to continue!</span></div></div>",

Now there was only one bottle left, an jar full of purple liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was feeling a little woozy.

Hmmm...side effects...may cause drowsiness, guiddiness, lapses in memory and judgement, and sexual side effects....what was that supposed to mean?....do not operate heavy machinery, blah, blah, blah....huh. Driving was okay? Interesting. No information on dosage? Was she meant to drink all of it? That was how it worked with the items they found in Tartarus, after all.

Nearly choking on the taste of the stuff, she was able to hold fast and feel her throat clearing as well. She sighed a deep, contented sigh, nothing left of the medicine but it's aftertaste. It was amazing how well she suddenly felt; she didn't now whether to thank her company's R&amp;D team or the strange sinister workings of Tartarus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Mitsuru was starting to feel better than she had before feeling sick. She giggled to herself, shaking her long red hair out of the pink towel, and tossed it into the pile of laundry across the room. The warmth from her fever was moving down towards her cheeks, and her elation at her own nudity was returning full force, and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru started posing in the mirror, dancing around her room, dashing back and forth in front of her window. It all felt very silly, but Mitsuru was enjoying the freedom incredibly. Of course, there was only so much excitement to gain inside the four walls of her room, she soon realized. No, the thrill of walking around naked was starting to lose meaning.. without risks. She only started doing this because no one would see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But</i>, Mitsuru thought, a smirk creeping onto her face, <i>what if someone <i>might</i> see me?</i> She crept over to her door, opening it a crac to peek out into the hallway. None of the other girls seemed to be around. It made sense; most of her friends having a number of after school activities to keep them busy. She quickly shut it, darting back into her room, and laughed to herself. Yes, she knew just how to continue her fun. Mitsuru took a deep breath, once again exiting her room, this time only shutting the door once she was on the other side of it. Grinning, she took a few tentative steps down the hallway... </span></div></div>",

Almost everyone in the dorm had something to be doing that day, be it sports practice, studying at school, shopping or... whatever Iori did to waste time during the day. Even if any of them <i>had</i> come back to the dorm, it was likely that they were taking a load off in the lobby. None of the boys had much reason to come up to this floor, and no one had any reason to go further except for when she called a meeting. Still, just because it wasn't likely for anyone to see her, knees shaking and smile beaming as she strolled unabashedly naked past her dorm mates rooms, doesn't mean it was impossible. The adventure of it all was what kept Mitsuru going, and what caused an uncharacteristic giggle to bubble up as she bounded up the stairs to the command room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeked through the double doors first, and finding no one inside, she swung them open dramatically, striking an authoritative pose for the SEES members she was pretending were inside. The pose lost some of its impact as she quickly turned and mooned her imaginary audience, scrambling to shut the doors, but Mitsuru was feeling silly enough that she got back to her fun without worrying about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all for joining me here on such short notice,\" Mitsuru said, and she marched with hands behind her back and chest stuck forward to sit in the chair at the head of the table. \"I understand that we're all very busy, at this time of year, but I've noticed a few problems lately in our performance in Tartarus.\" Mitsuru paused for a moment. She opened her legs, baring a red patch of hair to the room, before very exaggeratedly folding one leg over the other. \"First off; what's this I'm hearing about this so-called... 'High Cut Armor?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on like that for a good few minutes, lecturing and imagining her pretend-teammates, while stretching and posing in all sorts of ways that would be devastating if anyone else was actually there to see. She was just about to launch into a tirade, demanding a return to the location of the Lover's Full Moon Shadow 'to make sure there's no further trace of it', when something caught her attention.

Not many people would even call her a passable chef.  She herself knew that cooking was not one of her strong points, but she had a strong reason in wanting to learn how to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a member of SEES, Fuuka spent her evenings helping her comrades defend the city from the mysterious monsters known as Shadows.  However, unlike her friends, she possessed no combat abilities whatsoever, and was instead only able to assist them in a support role, providing them with useful tactical analyses and warning them if any extraordinarly strong foes were near.  These abilities of hers have proven invaluable in the team's efforts, but that didn't stop her from wishing she could help out more.  And so, she had asked Minako if she would taste her cooking, in an attempt to find such a way to prove herself more useful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout once every two weeks or so, Fuuka would prepare a meal she had been working on, and bring it up to the school roof so that she and Minako could test it in peace.  After a disastrous first attempt that sent Minako screaming to the Nurse's Office, Fuuka had stuck to more simple recipes in order to practice the basics.  So far, the results of these, while not amazing, at least ended with Minako able to finish the whole thing and providing an encouraging compliment.  It was this steady progress that emboldened Fuuka to try a more complicated recipe for today's test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof, as usual, was essentially empty during the lunch break.  Only Fuuka was up there that day, sitting and nervously staring at the food box containing today's attempt, sitting in her lap.  It wasn't long before Minako arrived as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for coming, Minako-chan,\" Fuuka said as Minako made her way to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, Fuuka-chan,\" she replied, giving a broad grin.  \"Always glad to help out.  So, what's on today's menu?  Is it chicken and rice, again?  I think you've almost got that one down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm trying something special today, Minako-chan,\" said Fuuka as she opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Minako uttered, her sunny smile instantly turning flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a new recipe,\" Fuuka continued, noticing the girl's sudden change in demeanor.  \"I wanted to make something with a bit more... pep to it,\" she extended the dish to Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Minako said, accepting the dish and appraising the meal. \"It certainly looks filling... *sniff* Whew!  I guess that's the pep, then?\" she asked, giving Fuuka a searching look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka returned Minako's gaze, doing her best to remain calm.  Every time Minako hesitated before a meal she would wonder if this whole cooking thing was such a good idea; but this dish especially was on a whole new level.  If it was done properly, then today's food should be a stew that would re-energize everyone for when they got tired, which would prove invaluable for their late night adventures.  The only problem with this was a severe one: the book had called for the use of several herbs whose names Fuuka did not recognize and were not carried in the grocery stores.  But, having already come so far and not wanting to give up, she spent over a week finding similar substitutes and used them in the meal instead.  At least, she hoped they were similar enough, herbs were still a bit of a mystery to her.  But what was the worst that could happen?  After all, the shops wouldn't sell ingredients that could accidentally make a deadly poison instead of a delicious meal, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's best while it's still hot, I think,\" Fuuka continued, becoming increasingly anxious as to how this trial would turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako turned back to the still-warm container and took a deep breath, before taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka watched intently as Minako ate, hoping and dreading to see a reaction to the food.  The first bite went as it always did for the worst meals, slow and forced, almost as if she was choking it down.  But as she continued, Minako settled into a basic, almost rhythmic pace for eating the food.  It was great that it was all going down, but it did nothing to tell Fuuka what Minako thought of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, and soon enough Minako had finished every last bite of the stew, letting out a small burp as she finished, followed by an \"excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it, Minako-chan?\" Fuuka asked, desperately curious as to whether this was a success or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, almost as soon as she asked, Minako suddenly clutched at her stomach, breathing in short, sharp bursts.  \"Urg!  Ah!  Ah...\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan!\" Fuuka cried out and rushed over, holding the other girl steady.  \"It must have been those herbs... Minako-chan!  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Minako's body relaxed, and she looked at Fuuka with a blank, almost indescribable look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Fuuka's choice of replacement herbs did have an extraordinary effect on the other girl, which was about to be unleashed to its fullest on the unsuspecting Fuuka.  As a result of eating the Mystery Stew, Minako-</span></div></div>",

It was when Minako gave Fuuka's rear end an appreciative squeeze through her skirt that the smaller girl finally regained some control of her senses. With a startled push, she separated herself from Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, what are you doing?!\" Fuuka asked, shocked at her friend's strange behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked at Fuuka as if she'd just grown a second head. \"What do you mean, Fuuka-chan?

I can't help it that you're irresistible.\" Minako answered, quickly closing the distance between the two of them once more. \"Come on, Fuuka-chan, let's have some fun.\" With that, Minako wrapped her arms around Fuuka once more, her hands hungrily exploring her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had gotten into Minako? One minute she was fine, the next she was all over her! Could her cooking have done this? How? She was just using herbs, not aphrodisiacs or anything like that. So why was Minako suddenly so physically affectionate? Fuuka had to talk some sense into this girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, we're on the roof of the school! It's lunch hour! We can't just... do things up here, even if I wanted to!\" Fuuka pleaded, trying to talk sense into Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? We'd just need to be quiet and smart. Besides, nobody ever comes up to the roof, we'll be fine! Now come on, let's see what you're hiding under that uniform.\" Minako answered, her groping hands changing their objective, now seeking to undress Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka knew she had to get out of here. If she didn't, there was no telling what Minako might try to do or how they might be found! But Minako was stronger than Fuuka, and breaking out of the other girl's grip wouldn't be easy...</span></div></div>",

The effect must have just been delayed; an annoying side-effect, but at least it worked! Fuuka was glad that she had finally managed to cook up something that could be used to help the rest of SEES during their exploration of Tartarus. All she'd have to do is work on fixing that little initial effect and her stew would be good to go!

Minako had one of the widest grins Fuuka had ever seen before, and she found herself slightly unnerved by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright? Fuuka-chan, I'm more than alright!\" Minako beamed. \"I've never been better! This stuff you made was awesome! Hey, you ever gone streaking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's overly energetic tone had been enough to knock Fuuka off guard, but it was the last thing she said that made her do a double-take. \"Wh-what?! Minako-chan, what are you talking about? Streaking? O-of course I've never done that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, why not? You only live once, right? Come on, let's do it! Let's do right now!\" Minako said, already beginning to fumble with her own outfit. \"I've always wanted to give it a shot, and now we can do it together! Come on, it'll be tons of fun!\" By this point, Minako had already managed to undress herself completely, leaving her stark naked in front of a beet-red Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-Minako-chan!

Fuuka wanted to run away, but was afraid that Minako would simply catch up to her from behind, where she would be completely unable to defend herself.  As Fuuka frantically struggled to think up an escape plan, her concentration was broken as Minako stopped grabbing at her clothes and wrapped Fuuka in a full-body hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan!\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Fuuka-chan,\" Minako replied.  \"But we can't keep doing this all day, lunch will end soon!\" With a squat of her knees and a grunt of effort, she hoisted Fuuka into the air and slammed her down on the ground, knocking the wind out of the frail girl and pinning her firmly on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as though she had just been hit by a truck, Fuuka was only able to manage slight breaths, unable to resist any further as Minako went to work.  While she couldn't feel her limbs at the moment, she was still able to feel embarrassment quite strongly.  She felt warmth and red slowly pool in her cheeks, her remaining attention fully focused on Minako's nude form pinning her down with her hips, leaning in back and forth as she worked to remove Fuuka's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same speed Minako had done on her own uniform, it was a matter of moments before Fuuka was stripped bare, still flat on the ground.  \"Fuuka-chan,\" Minako called invitingly, standing up and giving Fuuka some space.  \"Fuuka-chan.  Wakey-wakey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Fuuka groaned, finally recovering from the impact and moving to a reclining position.  Gathering her bearings, she turned from Minako, still standing tall and proud without a shred of modesty, to their clothes, piled off in a heap at Minako's feet, to finally her own body.  Looking down, from her bare breasts to her dainty toes winking in the noonday sun, any hopes that the past 15 minutes were just an extremely vivid nightmare went up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-Wahhhh!\" Fuuka broke down crying, curling forwards into a fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, Fuuka-chan!\" Minako rushed over to the crying girl's side.  \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Fuuka replied, almost choking out the words.  \"What's wrong?  Everything, that's what!\" she wailed, continuing to sob into her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Minako said thoughtfully.  \"I know what will cheer you up, come on,\" she knelt down and grabbed Fuuka's arms, lifting the girl to her feet in one quick motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" Fuuka gasped, nearly falling over if not for Minako holding her hands.  After a moment, she wrenched her arms free with a squeak and covered her intimate areas as best she could, looking around for her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just us girls, right now,\" Minako said, attempting to cheer Fuuka up, it seemed, despite sill being completely insane.  \"How about we just go around the roof for now, so that we can get used to it?\" She extended her hand to the quivering girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka could hardly believe anything right now, with what was happening happening much too quickly.  Bewildered and embarrassed, she took Minako's hand before she could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, around the roof we go!\" Minako cheered, tugging Fuuka along in a little jog.  Stumbling a bit from the sudden tug, Fuuka soon matched her pace as they ran along the border of the roof.  She tried to cover her breasts with her free arm at first, but whether it was due to the cool, yet inviting feeling of the midday breeze, the infectious cheer and goodwill Minako seemed to exude, or just good old-fashioned peer pressure, Fuuka soon found herself running naturally alongside Minako, neither covering up nor being held by the hand.  Minako shot her a broad grin, which Fuuka reflexively returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair finished their fourth lap around the roof, Minako turned to Fuuka and said, \"Wow, that was amazing, better than I thought it would be!  Don't you agree, Fuuka-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well,\" Fuuka said, blushing, but unable to suppress a slight smile.  \"It was very... liberating, I have to give it that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fuuka-chan, I knew you would understand!\" Minako grabbed the girl in a big hug, not to piledrive her this time, fortunately.  \"That feeling is the best, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka returned the hug, but still felt a bit awkward.  Minako was always quite friendly, but under the influence of this stew she was something else, that's for sure.  \"I may actually be starting to get used to this...\" she mumbled, in concern to Minako's state, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Then let's take it to the next level!\" Minako abruptly broke off the hug and dashed to their piles of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... it?  Next level?\" Fuuka spoke, confused.  However, as she saw Minako gather up their clothes into one big bundle and walk to the edge of the railing, her jaw dropped in horror and realization.  \"No!  Minako-chan, stop!\" she cried out, rushing over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... fly!\" Minako cheered as she tossed their clothes, their only chance at preserving decency, over the fence and off the school roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka slammed into the fence, desperately extending her arm through the gap.  It was all in vain, of course, as the garments were already out of reach, falling down into the center of the school courtyard and landing at the foot of the old persimmon tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direct hit!\" Minako yelled, pumping her fist into the air as if in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan...\" Fuuka spoke gloomily.  \"Our clothes... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that we don't have to walk all the way up here for them after we make it to the tree, of course!\" Minako said with a wink.  \"You didn't think I'd make us risk being seen naked twice, did you?  Besides, you said you were getting used to being naked by yourself, so after that the only way to get that perfect feeling again is to increase the risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking about your reckless new personality!\" Fuuka almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Minako asked, cocking an eyebrow.  \"I'm completely fine.  And besides, I'm not reckless, I saved us our shoes and socks!\" she smiled manically, holding Fuuka's footwear in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka was dumbstruck.  \"Why, out of all our clothes, did you choose to save only those that don't cover anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to our practice run, I found that it was too uncomfortable running around without footwear.  It's a good thing we did that practice, or we would look really stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka couldn't find anything to say to that.  Minako was too far gone to reason with.  With their clothes abandoned in the courtyard and only 25 minutes of lunch left, the only way out of this was to indulge her crazy friend and go streaking through the school.  <i>\"If I get out of this alive, I am burning that recipe,\"</i> she thought to herself as she put her shoes and socks on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to look so glum,\" said Minako, bouncing about from foot to foot.  \"Tell you what, I'll let you choose our route!  We can get through the courtyard from the staircase on the other side of this wing, so we just need to decide on whether we go through the second floor or the first floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options were choices Fuuka would rather not take.  The second floor held the majority of classrooms, and by this time students would be heading back to class from their meals, filling with more students the longer it took, or, even worse, a teacher!  As for the first floor, there would be less people, so long as they stayed away from the main entrance.  There was no way Fuuka would go near the main entrance in this state, but that meant the only acceptable first floor route would take them around the gym and practice building.  Either path spelled disaster, not to mention whether or not anyone was already in the courtyard to begin with!  Did Minako want them to get seen when she threw their clothes away!?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to decide which route would be the lesser of two evils...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way Fuuka was about to risk the second floor hallways. The idea of running past the classrooms, and the high chances that the halls wouldn't be empty, was too frightening to even imagine. As much as she hated the thought of it, she'd be safest with the long path. Besides that, Fuuka wasn't sure she could count on Minako not to compromise their secrecy in her current state. The more timid of the two was afraid that Minako might start shouting or something to \"up the ante.\" If they stayed away from the classrooms, then any potential antics from Minako should be curbed, at least in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Minako-chan. We're going to be going around past the gym and practice building.\" Fuuka said, pointing at the door leading toward her desired path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Taking the scenic route, huh? I knew you'd love it, Fuuka-chan!\" Minako squealed, still as overly-energetic as she'd been since ingesting the mystery stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do NOT love this!\" Fuuka snapped back. \"We're going this way because there shouldn't be anyone along that path!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and because it means we get to enjoy the sensation even longer!\" Minako chirped, oblivious to Fuuka's exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in defeat, Fuuka grabbed Minako by the wrist and wordlessly began to lead the way. Fuuka just wanted to get this nightmare over with before anybody saw her. Leading Minako into the stairwell, the gravity of the situation seemed to hit her once more. She was completely naked in school, in the middle of the school day, with an overly energetic Minako in tow. Fuuka could feel her heart beating in her chest, each thump feeling like a drum being struck inside her. If she didn't know any better she'd swear her heartbeat could be heard throughout the entire stairwell. She knew for a fact that the slap of hers and Minako's shoes against the hard tile floor echoed in the relative silence around them. Every small noise worried Fuuka, fearful that the next sound might give her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like a hundred flights of stairs, Fuuka and Minako reached the first floor. Now the long part of the trek began, and the idea that she wasn't even a quarter of the way done made Fuuka's hair stand on end. Carefully, she cracked open the door leading to the gym and looked around. Thankfully, the coast was blissfully clear. Maybe Fuuka's luck was turning around? This thought was driven from Fuuka's mind as she felt a pair of slender hands on her back for a moment before being shoved firmly through the door! Stumbling to catch her balance, Fuuka spun herself around to see the grinning face of Minako beaming at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan! What's wrong with you?!\" Fuuka shrieked, appalled at her friend's apparent disregard for secrecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just giving you a little push along, Fuuka-chan!\" Minako said, happily skipping over to her. \"Can't just hide behind a door forever. Lunch hour's running out, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was right, as much as Fuuka hated to admit it. Taking things nice and slow also meant burning precious time. If Fuuka took too long, the lunch hour would end before she and Minako got to their clothes, and then they'd really be in a bad situation. Still, that didn't mean Minako had to do something so reckless. What if there had been people out here? Fuuka really hoped that Minako would recover from her altered state of mind soon, before she came up with something even crazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, but a bit more aware of the passage of time, Minako and Fuuka made their way to the courtyard. There were a few close calls where Fuuka heard the sound of conversation close by, but thankfully she and Minako (with a bit of coercion from Fuuka) found hiding places while making sure the coast was clear. Luckily, the sounds passed without any hint of the people coming closer. Maybe, just maybe, Fuuka would be able to put all this behind her and laugh it all off one day. Finally, Fuuka and Minako reached the home stretch- the last hallway to the courtyard. Throwing caution to the wind, Fuuka gave up her careful pace with a dead sprint, Minako following close behind. Meeting the doors with her arms outstretched, Fuuka threw them open and let her momentum carry her into the courtyard, only to see-</span></div></div>",

Their uniforms were supposed to be somewhere at the foot of the tree, wrapped all up around each other like a tight ball.  Fuuka had seen it land there with her own two eyes back on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, they had vanished without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...\" she uttered over and over again, frantically searching the entire ground around the tree as well as looking up to the tree itself.  But her worst fears were confirmed: their uniforms were nowhere to be found in the entire courtyard.  Slowly, she sank to knees, burying her head in her arms as she began to weep heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Minako cried out, suddenly grasping Fuuka from behind in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaa!\" Fuuka screamed.  \"W-what was that for *sniff*?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what's the matter, Fuuka-chan?  We made it all the way to the tree with no one spotting us!\" Minako said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But our clothes are gone!\" Fuuka wailed.  \"Now it's only a matter of time before we're seen naked by everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...\" Minako shrugged.  \"There was always the chance that a janitor or some other guy would just come right up and take them while they were just sitting there.  All part of the risk, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All part of the-\" Fuuka repeated, her emotions of sorrow building up to something else entirely.  \"Minako, is all of this just some game to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda?\" she shrugged. \"It is fun, isn't it?  You've felt the rush too, I know you have.  Besides, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Some boys see our bodies?  If they want to see naked women they can just use the internet or take an art class,\" Minako answered as if everything was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You think everything would just be over like that?\" Fuuka yelled, her rage reaching its peak.  \"This isn't just some fun little romp where everyone has a laugh and we all just forget about it by next week!  There are consequences, Minako.  Who's to say that any boys who see us will just be satisfied with a view?  And if a faculty member sees us, we'll be expelled for sure.  And if Mitsuru sees us...\" she shuddered.  \"I don't even want to think about what would happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I didn't even think about Mitsuru,\" Minako gasped.  \"You think she'd be up for a run as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka, baffled and shocked yet again by her comrade, whirled around, grabbed Minako by the shoulders, and started shaking her back and forth.  \"None of this is getting through to you at all, is it?\" she shouted.  \"Ever since you ate that stupid stew that I cooked up you've turned into some sort of ditzy exhibitionist who's willing to throw away everything she has on a whim and drag her friend down with her.  Now we're both naked in the middle of school, with only a matter of time until someone sees us.  Both of us are doomed, and it's all my fault...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to stream down Fuuka's cheeks once more as she finished her rant, her head collapsing on Minako's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stared at Fuuka as she continued sobbing, before embracing the despondent soul in a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka returned the hug.  While she didn't say anything, the tightness of her embrace showed just how much she appreciated the gesture, despite the situation the two girls were now in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...\" Fuuka sniffed.  \"But it doesn't change the fact that we're still doomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... we could always just go to the gym,\" Minako suggested.  \"Our exercise clothes should still be in our lockers, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's eyes widened.  Of course, the gym!  How could she have forgotten about that?  \"Minako, thank you!\" she cheered, embracing her friend even tighter.  \"We still have a chance!\" she said as she dashed back towards where they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, it's off to the gym!\" Minako pumped her arm in the air before following Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her second wind, Fuuka quickly made her way through the hallways with Minako at her side.  Unfortunately, they had spent a lot of time in the courtyard and lunch was just about over, meaning that if they didn't hurry soon they'd run into the next gym class before they had a chance to make it to their lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her morale boosted and time being of the essence, Fuuka was now only practicing the slightest amount of stealth.  Only bothering to take a quick look around corners to check for people and only crouching to avoid classroom windows, she continued her charge with only victory and safety in mind, her arms now fully devoted to helping her run and no longer for coverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Fuuka-chan, taking it a little fast, aren't we?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that the sooner we get there, the sooner we can be done with all this,\" she replied boldly.  \"Besides, what happened to feeling the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Minako muttered in agreement, but not nearly as enthusiastic as before, it seemed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was lost on Fuuka, however, as they had made it to the gymnasium doors.  Cracking them open, Fuuka could see that the main room was empty.  \"Yes!\" she whispered, and signaled for Minako.  The two entered the room and started to make their way towards the locker rooms when the locker room doors suddenly flow open!  Quickly, the two girls dove under the nearby bleachers to hide, hoping that they hadn't been noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka breathed hoarsely as the students piled out into the center of the gymnasium, viewing them from the relatively safe vantage point underneath the bleachers.  From their behavior, it seems that the two girls were still safe, but for how long?  Could they wait out the entire period like this, or should they work their way to the other side of the bleachers, go for it now, and hope no one notices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Fuuka could decide on a course of action, her thoughts were interrupted by Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... all those people so close to us...\" she spoke, almost as if in a trance.  \"And we're naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't remind me,\" Fuuka whispered irratibly.  \"Easy now, we're almost there.  I just need to figure out our next move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the threat of discovery looming so close Fuuka started to feel chills running up and down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all of these people,\" Minako gasped, taking in short, sharp breaths while speaking.  \"Right next to us, like this...  We can see them, they could probably see us if they looked...  I, I-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?  What's wrong?\" Fuuka turned around, and was shocked at the state of her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, at this point-</span></div></div>",

Minako's hand wasn't simply covering one of her breasts, it was <i>squeezing</i> it, and Minako's other hand between her legs was moving back and forth. Fuuka gasped in shock as she realized what was going on: Minako was <i>playing with herself!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, what are you doing?!\" Fuuka hissed, trying to keep her voice down while still getting her anger across. \"This isn't the time for... for... for <i>that!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fuuka-chan... it's soooo hot!\" Minako groaned between breaths. \"Sitting here like this, so many eyes so close, nothing keeping us hidden but some flimsy boards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka couldn't believe what she was hearing. Minako was enjoying this? How could anybody enjoy being in such a humiliating predicament? If they were caught now there'd be no living it down!

Thankfully that wasn't a risk any more, though that didn't solve their current predicament. As things stood for the two, their situation was still decidedly disastrous; hiding underneath the bleachers, an entire class mere meters away, and the only way to any kind of clothing would require risking complete exposure. Maybe, just maybe, with Minako's sane mind on their side, the two naked ladies might be able to get through this unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would require Minako calming down a bit. As it was, Fuuka found herself as the more rational of the two as Minako did little more than shake and mutter to herself. If Fuuka didn't want to be stuck under these bleachers all day, she'd need to find a way to settle Minako down. Remembering a few movies she'd seen, Fuuka carefully pulled back a hand and gave Minako a quick slap across the face. For a brief moment the two girls were both startled by the sound of the slap, Fuuka forgetting how important it was to keep quiet. Thankfully luck seemed to be on Fuuka's side for once, and the sound went unnoticed by the other students; even luckier, Minako seemed to settle down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, I know this is scary, but I need you to be focused right now.\" Fuuka said. \"We need to come up with a plan if we're gonna get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're right, Fuuka-chan.\" Minako mumbled, a hand cradling the cheek Fuuka had smacked. \"I just... after everything I did, and I couldn't control myself...

Come on, let's try to figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the two SEES girls crept toward the front of the bleachers, keeping themselves somewhat obscured from sight while allowing them a decent view of the gymnasium. The class seemed to be playing kickball, which unfortunately meant that there were eyes on pretty much every area of the gym floor. There was no way Fuuka and Minako could sneak by with the class spread out like that. Unfortunately for them, it seemed that they'd need to wait out the class period and try to slip into the locker room when the opportunity arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this plan would require nobody looking under the bleachers...</span></div></div>",

We need to get back as soon as possible before people start searching for us, but we can't let this class see us.  That means we'll have to go in and get changed in the break before the next class starts.  Then we go back to our classes as soon as we can and play it from there.  Is that all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Minako nodded.  \"Sounds solid to me.  Just tell me when we should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Fuuka nodded back, and turned her attention back to the gym floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the students began to return to the locker rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BBBBRING*</b> went the class bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost...\" Fuuka said as she began to descend the bars to the floor, motioning for Minako to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering around the corner, Fuuka could see the door open as the students filed on through.  She couldn't see the students themselves, but that meant they couldn't see her, which she was grateful for.  Soon enough, the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Fuuka said.  \"I think there's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-stragglers.  I thought so,\" Fuuka sighed.  If they had jumped the gun just then, it would have spelled disaster for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka counted to five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" she said, falling to the ground and dashing into the main room, Minako close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she trusted her judgement, Fuuka held her breath as she popped out and looked around.  Not a soul was in sight.  \"Phew!\" Fuuka sighed, releasing her breath as she sprinted to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds, she and Minako were inside, panting and leaning back against the door.  They had done it, safety was within their grasp!  All that remained was to get to their lockers and get dressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless- Fuuka suddenly feared the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she raised her head and saw-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Haaa...\" Fuuka sighed once more.  The room was empty, just as she thought it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes, Minako and Fuuka had gathered their gym clothes from the lockers.  It felt a bit odd wearing the T-shirt and shorts without anything underneath, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, finally we're wearing clothes again,\" said Minako.  \"I still can't believe I put us through all that, though,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Minako-chan,\" said Fuuka.  \"I think I'll just stay away from cooking for a while,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, for what it's worth, even though it made me crazy, the stew was delicious, Fuuka-chan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Fuuka blushed.  \"Thanks, but, seriously, I am never making that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls snuck back to the main lobby of the school, and up to the second floor, where they separated to their respective classes.  Fuuka stood in front of the door, gathered her resolve, and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamagishi,\" the teacher addressed her.  \"You are quite late, young lady.  And apparently you missed the earlier period as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I am sorry,\" Fuuka apologized, trying to play it as cool as possible.  \"I... wasn't feeling well at lunch, so I lay down on the roof to feel better.  Next thing I knew, it was almost 2:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you appear to be... out of uniform?\" the teacher narrowed his gaze at Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" Fuuka stammered.  This was the tricky part.  \"Y-you see... I also, um, threw up while I was up there, and completely covered my uniform in it, unfortunately.  I couldn't wear it in that condition, so I had to change into my gym clothes and get it cleaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vomiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fuuka continued, \"It was probably something I ate for lunch, now that I think about it.  It... it didn't agree with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't think to go to the Nurse's Office?  Or let anyone know of your condition?\" the teacher asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" Fuuka bowed her head.  \"I was alone up on the roof, and I felt too weak to move!  It won't happen again, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher sighed.  \"Just sit down already,\" he said, turning back to the class.  \"Now, for today's topic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka carefully walked to her desk, aware of the gazes from her fellow students.  Taking her seat, she tried to focus on the lecture, to no avail.  She kept replaying everything in her head.  So many things could have gone wrong, so many chances for them to be seen, but somehow, they both made it through okay.  It was quite an adventure, all right.  Fuuka took a deep breath and shook her head.  There would be time to reflect on everything in detail when she was safe in her room, right now, she just had to focus for the rest of class, and then head on home when the period ended.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lecture continued, but as Fuuka tried to pay attention to the class, she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye.  Was that girl looking at her?  Fuuka glanced at her, only for the girl to turn back towards her workbook.  Then, she saw two boys sitting in front of her whispering to each other.  But just as she noticed, they too, turned back to their work.  Fuuka grew nervous.  What could they have been talking about?  Was it about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's unease continued until ten minutes before the bell, when-</span></div></div>",

Y-yes!\" Fuuka stammered, getting up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked towards the door, she could hear the other students' whispers more clearly.  \"Kirijo...\"  \"What trouble has she gotten into?\" \"Wait, could she have been-\" \"Sh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now,\" the student councilman said.  \"We don't want to keep her waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Fuuka was brought to the Student Council Office.  Inside, she saw Mitsuru and Minako, both sitting down at a table and facing each other.  Minako turned towards Fuuka, then quickly turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka wished that the earth would swallow her then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Mitsuru addressed the councilman.  \"Now, leave us in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe councilman nodded, and left the girls alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru, turning to Fuuka, calmly spoke: \"Have a seat, Yamagishi,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka immediately complied, knowing that this was not a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do you know why I have summoned you here?\" Mitsuru asked, cooly staring at the girls sitting across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Fuuka looked at each other.  \"N-no,\" Fuuka said as levelly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't told why we were coming here, so no,\" Minako said, somewhat more solidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru paused, closing her eyes and opening them before continuing.  \"I am already aware of your truancies for the past period, and your breach of dress code is clearly evident,\" she said, causing Fuuka to squirm uncomfortably.  \"But that is not why I have brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why did you ask for us, Mitsuru-san?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This-\" Mitsuru brought forth a bag from underneath the table, \"-was found in the courtyard near the end of the lunch period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's lips pursed together, her eyes going wide with shock, as Mitsuru revealed the contents: a wadded up bundle consisting of a pair of female Gekkoukan uniforms, as well as two different sets of brightly colored women's underwear.  She immediately steadied herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Mitsuru asked expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what?\" Minako asked, though not without noticeable unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you seriously going to make me spell it out for you?\" Mitsuru shook her head disapprovingly.  \"Two discarded uniforms and undergarments are found during lunch, two students disappear the following period and return without their uniforms, and you two are the <i>only</i> two students to be out of uniform.  Everyone else is accounted for,\" Mitsuru glared at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean it's us!\" Minako shouted back.  \"There's no proof that those clothes are mine.  I spilled some of my lunch on my uniform and had to change, and spent the hour cleaning my clothes so they wouldn't stain, but I remembered I had to get to class, so it's probably stuck with the rest of the uniforms in the laundry as well.  Check it out for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to check the school laundry system,\" said Mitsuru, standing up from her seat and walking towards Minako.  \"In fact, I don't need to leave this room to determine the validity of your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You don't?\" Minako asked, standing up and backing towards the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arisato, I must ask you to disrobe!\" Mitsuru pointed at Minako.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not make me say it twice!\" Mitsuru continued.  \"Remove your clothing at once.  Or I shall do it for you.  The culprits do not have underwear, therefore the presence of underwear shall determine your innocence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Fuuka cried out, slamming her arms against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan!\" Minako gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Minako-chan!  No more!\" Fuuka shuddered, on the verge of tears.  \"It was us, Mitsuru-san.  But don't punish Minako-chan, it's all my fault anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Fuuka-chan!\" said Minako.  \"You couldn't have known that would happen!  Mitsuru-san, I take full responsibility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Mitsuru shouted.  \"Perhaps it would be best to start from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---One Explanation Later---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're telling me,\" said Mitsuru, clutching her head, \"Is that because of a dish Yamagishi cooked using some unique combination of herbs, it somehow hypnotized Arisato into tearing off and disposing of both of your outfits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" said Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said both at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds weird,\" Minako spoke.  \"But it's all true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe this... 'Naked Stew' really exists?\" said Mitsuru incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, either that's what it does, or it made me act on some primal instinct by giving me an overdose of energy.  How else do you explain what happened?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" Mitsuru said, tapping her forehead.  \"Yamagishi's stew had no effect at all, and you simply took advantage of the weather and dragged Yamagishi into your depraved little fantasy.  One that you said you've had for some time now, if I recall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point!\" Minako blushed beet red.  \"Even if I have, I would never force anyone into it.  It's purely a private, personal fantasy like we all have.  I never even thought I would do it for real!  I'm telling you it was the stew that made me do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm telling you that is pure nonsense!\" Mitsuru snapped back.  \"I want to believe you, really, I do, but how can you prove this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try it ourselves!\" Minako said, desperately.  \"Fuuka-chan cooked it after all!  She can do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan!\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Mitsuru pondered. \"Yamagishi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Fuuka asked, full of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make the stew again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.  I still have the recipe and spare ingredients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough for how many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the entire team, and then some,\" said Fuuka, suddenly realizing Mitsuru's intent.  \"Wait, no!  Mitsuru-san-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled,\" said Mitsuru.  \"We will all settle this tonight, before the Dark Hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're bringing everyone into this!?\" Minako gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An adequate sample size is necessary for accurate results,\" Mitsuru stated, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mitsuru-san, that's too dangerous, even if it was just Minako-chan again!\" Fuuka pleaded.  \"Don't make me cook it the stew, it will end terribly.  You have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan's right, Mitsuru-san,\" Minako added.  \"There's no telling what will happen!  I'll take whatever you can throw at me, just please, let this go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you enough to test your theory,\" said Mitsuru. \"And I must admit I am curious to see first-hand whether this mystical stew truly exists.  But I cannot let this matter slide.  After all, you two broke the rules and made a mockery of this institution, and it is only due to our friendship that I am not stringing you up right now.  If you are unwilling to provide proof, then I shall have to punish you both for streaking.  Not public, of course, but I am aware you've heard of my executions by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrg...\" Fuuka groaned, looking to Minako for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako herself seemed to be at a loss.  She simply looked back and said, \"It's up to you, Fuuka-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Mitsuru could have been convinced without putting all of them at risk.  But, there seemed to be no alternative.  It was either make that accursed dish, or face severe, private, punishment for a crime they were only partially responsible for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Fuuka knew what she had to do:</span></div></div>",

Dinner will be at 11:30.  You are free to go about the rest of your day as you please as long as that stew is ready by tonight, though I suggest you head on back to the dormitory first thing to get some proper attire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second!\" Minako interrupted. \"Can't you just give us our clothes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately not,\" Mitsuru frowned.  \"Your uniforms have been confiscated as evidence.  If anything goes missing before the investigation is closed, then we would have a case of theft on our hands as well.  This would lead to increased efforts on our parts to find the culprits, which would not be pleasant for anyone.  You know how zealous the Disciplinary Committee can get, don't you Arisato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And furthermore,\" Mitsuru continued.  \"Even if most of the students had gone home by now, there are no doubt plenty left on campus.  If anyone were to see you have changed clothes again, even more suspicion would be thrown onto you.  In fact, you should be lucky that these were claimed before anyone could recognize these as your normal clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Fuuka gasped. \"I hadn't thought about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, now if you'll excuse me, I must finish up here.  Be careful on your way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mitsuru-sempai,\" said both Fuuka and Minako as they left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to the dorm was uneventful, for the most part.  Aside from stares and whispers from remaining students on the way out, and occasional glances from passersby on the monorail and the way home, nothing noticeable happened on the way back to the dorm.  But their safe travel did nothing to ease Fuuka's mind.  Proceeding in silence, all Fuuka could think about was what was going to happen tonight.  She desperately wanted to take her mind off of it, at least temporarily, but she couldn't think of anything else to talk about.  Not that Minako seemed to be in a talking mood, anyways.  The normally cheery girl had a glum look on her face, staring down at nothing in particular as she walked onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two arrived back at the dorm right around 3:00. \"Looks like no one's back yet,\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Minako replied, still deep in her funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Fuuka continued, walking towards the stairs.  \"The stew takes several hours to cook so I'll need to get it started soon.  We should get changed before the others arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako didn't respond immediately, so Fuuka decided to go on ahead, but just as she reached the staircase, Minako spoke. \"Wait, Fuuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Fuuka turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About tonight...\" Minako said nervously. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes.\" Fuuka said, eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it means you might end up like I did?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, even if it means being naked-,\" Fuuka paused as she uttered the word, cheeks flushing red. \"-in front of everyone.  I can't let you take the fall for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually,\" Minako said uneasily.  \"Embarrassing as it would be, the naked part is not what I'm worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" Fuuka gaped. \"Then, is it because you really are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! I't's not like that, Fuuka-chan!\" Minako stammered. \"It's just, I trust everyone on this team with my life.  What's a little nudity between friends like us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone... Even Junpei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, he's not that bad once you get to know him!\" Minako laughed.  \"But yeah, everyone.  And besides, they'll be in the same boat as us,\" she winked.  \"So we're not getting a completely raw deal this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka flashed red as a tomato as the mental image of all the guys naked popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is, if it all works out...\" Minako continued, her grimness returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  What do you mean?\" Fuuka asked, shaking the image out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan, even though I wasn't completely myself back on the roof, I wasn't lying when I told you about wanting to go streaking.  But just as I told Mitsuru later, it was a hidden, <i>deeply</i> hidden urge I had.  I've been thinking... what if that stew simply brought it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, brought it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I had... entertained... the thought of streaking well before eating the stew.  What if the stew didn't create the urge to streak, but simply gave me the energy, courage, and recklessness to try and live that fantasy?  And if that's the case, what would it be like if everyone had it happen to them all at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan...\" Fuuka drew off, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" she said, boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it yourself, you trust everybody on this team with your life, right?  Then I will trust in them too.  Even if these 'urges' are unleashed, I think we can handle it.  And who knows?  Maybe some of them aren't perverted, but just stupid, like doing a song and dance routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought about that...\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what else?\" Fuuka continued, getting worked up.  \"If Mitsuru is going to force us into this situation, then I can't wait to see what happens when she eats her helping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru?  That would be too priceless!  Ha ha ha...\" Minako laughed, looking somewhat relieved.  \"Thanks, Fuuka-chan, I think we can get through this now.  Let's get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, it was time for the stew experiment to commence.  Seated at the table were Fuuka, Minako, and Mitsuru, as well as the other members SEES: fellow students Yukari, Junpei, Akihiko, Ken, and Shinjiro.  All were dressed in preparation for the Dark Hour, weapons at their sides.  In addition, at the foot of the table, happily chomping away at his own dinner, was their canine teammate, Koromaru, and over by Mitsuru's side stood the android Aigis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, everyone,\" Mitsuru greeted after everyone had taken their seats.  \"Tonight we are trying something different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Junpei exclaimed.  \"What's the deal with us having dinner so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit it is rather odd, but tonight's meal may prove to be quite special, isn't that right, Yamagishi?\" she turned towards Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> made this?\" Shinjiro asked, narrowing his already narrow gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fuuka replied, taking the response in stride.  It was understandable that he would be skeptical, as he had witnessed a few of her earlier cooking attempts, and had given some very helpful pointers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to Yamagishi, and Arisato who has already tasted this meal,\" Mitsuru continued.  \"It should revitalize you and give you an enormous amount of energy.  That is what we are going to test tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like ordinary stew to me, what's makes this special?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the beef and potatoes are standard, but the herbs I added is what gives this its kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All according to the recipe,\" Fuuka cut Shinjiro off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you tried this before Minako-chan?\" Akihiko asked.  \"How was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flavor's a bit <i>strong</i>,\" Minako said, reflexively glancing at Fuuka.  \"But it actually tastes pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start eating now?\" Ken interrupted.  \"It's almost time for the Dark Hour, and we can't fight while hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid's got a point,\" Junpei shrugged.  \"Chow time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they began to dig in.  Just like with Minako earlier on the roof, the first bite seemed to give them pause, but after that they continued steadily eating away.  Fuuka for her part, was very conflicted.  While she was glad that she was able to provide support through her cooking, she knew it would start getting messed up soon.  It would only be a matter of time now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, thinking like that now wouldn't help.  The meal's been cooked, they were all in this together.  Fuuka looked down at her own portion.  It was funny, all this chaos over her dish and she hadn't even tried it yet.  Taking a bite, the first thing Fuuka noticed was the taste.  That flavor was strong all right!  She was only able to barely just get it down, chasing it with some water.  But it did actually taste really good.  Taking a second bite, she felt that the flavor not quite as sharp as before, probably now that she knew it was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka turned, and Mitsuru's face drawn as she swallowed, the same reaction she had to the first bite.  Had Mitsuru waited until everyone was eating before she began as well, or was it just Minako and Fuuka she was waiting for?  However, these questions soon dissipated as Fuuka's thoughts turned solely toward eating more and more of that delicious stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal passed quickly, and was soon over.  Fuuka sat back in her seat, full and content.  Looking around, she saw that the rest of the team members were sitting likewise.  Even Mitsuru seemed more relaxed than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that rest wouldn't last long.  Already Fuuka could feel something welling up from within her belly.  As the feeling grew spread throughout her body, she felt herself begin to heat up as well.  The side effects had taken hold of her, and the rest of the team as well.  What was going to happen?</span></div></div>",

Fueled with the energy of the mysterious stew, they were feeling just like Minako was on the roof earlier that day.  Hyped up, excited, and ready to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone!\" Mitsuru announced, exuberant yet still composed. \"It seems that Yamagishi's dish was a success after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered at Fuuka, who was sitting tall in her seat, breathing excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're completely refreshed, it's 10 minutes until the Dark Hour, enough time to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHINJI!\" Akihiko yelled, interrupting Mitsuru's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko!\" Mitsuru shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't take long,\" Akihiko shouted back, jumping from his chair and pointing at Shinjiro.  \"Shinji!  It's time we settled this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settled what?\" Shinji replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once and for all, which of us is stronger,\" Akihiko said, removing his vest and tie and starting to take off his shirt. \"One-on-one, no-holds-barred, last man standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko,\" Mitsuru glared.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only take five minutes Mitsuru,\" he said, now barechested and bouncing from foot to foot.  \"It's just something a man's gotta do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes huh?\" Shinjiro replied. \"Someone's feeling confident, but no can do.  Because I-\" he pointed at Fuuka. \"Have a score of my own to settle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, me!?\" Fuuka gasped.  Energized as she was, that didn't mean she couldn't be surprised or intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you, this meal...\" said Shinjiro.  \"How could have gotten so good in such a short time!?  I've never cooked anything like this in my entire life!  I must know what you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm happy to give you the recipe,\" said Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, no way,\" Akihiko interjected, placing himself between Fuuka and Shinjiro.  \"Not until we settle our score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch!  Fine then,\" Shinjiro growled, taking off his coat and shirt as well.  \"Like men it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinjiro, Akihiko, stop!  I demand order!\" Mitsuru yelled, slamming her fist onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!  Check out the gun show! Whe-Whew!  Keep it coming, studs!\" Yukari whistled lewdly, leaning back in her chair, a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba!?\" Mitsuru whirled around, her face contorted in bafflement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mitsuru!\" Yukari whined.  \"Just because I'm a girl I can't find hot guys hot?  Is it not <i>proper</i> to let a fine young man know just how handsome he is?  Is it <i>demeaning</i> to treat guys how they always treat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not what I- look!\" Mitsuru face-palmed.  \"This has gotten completely out of hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you like those,\" Minako cut in, having crept over to Yukari's side.  \"Then check out <i>these</i> babies!\" With a flourish, she undid her jacket and blouse and tossed them off onto the floor, flexing her bare, toned arms inches away from Yukari's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Minako-chan!  I-! Oh! Oh my!\" Yukari swooned.  \"Oooh... Such definition.  I never would have expected-!  These are great too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, so it was true... Aigis, restrain Arisato!\" Mitsuru commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Aigis ran behind Minako and pulled her arms behind her back, holding her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it!\" Minako winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru!?\" Yukari gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot take any chances,\" Mitsuru growled.  \"If left unrestrained she will soon disrobe entirely.  Just like earlier today, when she threw all caution out the window and disgraced our fair school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Wait, that means, <i>you</i> were the streaker, Minako-chan?\" Yukari asked, mouth agape.  \"But you said you got your uniform dirty at lunch and had to change!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, yeah, that was a lie,\" Minako chuckled.  \"As it turns out, I dumped my clothes off the roof and someone found them before I could get them, forcing me to sneak around naked until I could find and wear my gym clothes.  It was intense, and a bit scary, but also was the greatest thrill ever!  Ain't that right, Fuuka-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" said Fuuka, who, under the effect of the euphoria, was viewing the memories in an uncharacteristically favorable light. \"I got roped into it as well.  It was unlike anything I'd ever done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan too?\" Yukari blinked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, when Mitsuru found out it was us, she was so pissed, ha ha!  Though I have to wonder,\" Minako turned toward the fuming redhead. \"For someone who likes to uphold decency and the rules so much, you don't seem to have a problem showing off my bra to everyone like this,\" she motioned her eyes down to her chest, partly sticking out thanks to how Aigis was holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence that scandalous tongue of yours!\" Mitsuru roared, temper rising with her spiked energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*DOOF* *BAP* *CRUNCH*</b> the sounds of fists and fury rang from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh,\" Mitsuru groaned.  \"And would you two stop fighting already?  This is pointless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, stop making Mama Mitsuru mad!\" uttered Ken, who had stumbled forth and pointed his spear at the quarreling duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room paused at that outburst, including the two half-naked brawlers, who were starting to get covered in bruises from each others' punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama?\" Fuuka whispered under her breath, stifling her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... going to pretend I didn't hear that,\" said Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the stew has affected Ken-kun somewhat differently than everyone else,\" Aigis stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, stay out of this,\" said Akihiko.  \"We'll be done soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you're giving up?  Cause I've got plenty more fight left within me.\" Shinjiro taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call yourselves men?\" Ken glared with half-lidded eyes.  \"To cause all this trouble for someone so wonderful and tough, strict yet caring, just like my mom was until she...\" he paused.  \"Anyways, you two started all this, so apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Junpei finally spoke, having remained quiet up until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, Stupei finally joins the party...\" Yukari rolled her eyes.  \"What, gonna be all disappointed that you missed Minako-chan's earlier show at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Junpei shouted, glaring at her.  \"This isn't about that, Yuka-tan!  What Minako-chan did today...\" he clutched his fist, turning towards the floor. \"How can I hope to measure up to that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost me,\" Yukari said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time, you show me up every time,\" Junpei grumbled.  \"As a Persona-user, as a leader... we joined the group at the same time, but you've left me in the dust from the very beginning.  I thought at least I could be secure in my status as a lovable, happy-go-lucky class clown, but then you take that from me too by pulling off the ultimate prank!  Streaking the school and almost not getting caught?  How can anyone hope to top that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" went Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Yukari grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iori... that is hardly something to be envious of,\" said Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" said Junpei.  \"Well, I'm not gonna take this lying down.  You think you're bad just because you streaked the school?  Well, I'm going to streak Tartarus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei-kun,\" Minako shook her head.  \"What good would that do?  There's no one there in Tartarus to hide our bodies from, other than shadows, and I don't think they care whether we're clothes or not.  Where's the thrill in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this isn't about sneaking, Minako-chan,\" Junpei smirked.  \"This is about conquest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conquest?\" Minako asked, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it,\" Junpei said, waggling his finger. \"One man, his weapon, his persona, a gauntlet of shadows, and nothing else.  With only his wit, his magic, and his blade at his side, fighting against impossible odds; it is the ultimate test of manhood.  What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei,\" said Yukari.  \"That has got to be the most stup-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant!\" Minako exclaimed.  \"I've been wracking my mind trying to think of what could be better than plain old streaking, and you just gave me the perfect answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Yukari asked.  \"You do realize he just wants to see you naked, Minako-chan,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no he doesn't,\" Minako smirked.  \"I mean, sure he does, but, it's more than that, I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is about a man's pride.  So, that means you accept my challenge?\" Junpei grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Minako beamed.  \"This is going to be so stimulating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" said Mitsuru, brandishing her rapier towards Minako, resting the tip near her neck.  \"Such foul, disgusting behavior needs to be dealt with at once.  Prepare to be exe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwargh!\" Ken screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amada!\" Mitsuru yelled.  She turned and saw Ken knocked down on the ground, rubbing his now-bloodied nose.  Like the others, he had taken his shirt and jacket off as well.  Akihiko was standing above him, rubbing his knuckles.  \"Now, where were we, Shinji?\" he asked, turning back to his original opponent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Akihiko!\" Mitsuru gasped, horrified.  \"How could you?  He is only a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By fighting shadows, he is a full-fledged adult just like the rest of us,\" Akihiko shrugged.  \"Besides, he fought admirably, there is no shame in a defeat like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *hack* I'm not done... yet,\" Ken coughed, picking himself up and leaning on his spear for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not finished?\" Akihiko flashed a wicked smile.  \"Looks like this is getting interesting after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Mitsuru swore.  \"Aigis, standby!\" she commanded, as she ran to block Akihiko's advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru!\" Akihiko flinched.  \"This doesn't concern you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have gone completely out of your mind, Akihiko.  Since you refuse to listen to reason, it seems that violence is the only answer.  Now, let's settle this, 'like men,' I believe you said?\" Mitsuru said cooly as she untied her ribbon, unbuttoned her blouse and cast it aside, leaving only an elegant dark bra covering her chest, mirroring the state of the other three fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mitsuru!?\" Akihiko blinked, turning slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even Mitsuru's getting into this?\" Shinjiro shrugged.  \"Heh, reminds me of the good old days.  Guess our fight has to wait, Akihiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma... Mitsuru-san,\" Ken said, gritting his teeth as he got into position alongside Mitsuru, as both pairs squared off against each other for the next round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" said Minako, stretching her arms.  \"Aigis sure has a tight grip.  So, you ready for this, Junpei-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born ready, Minako-chan,\" said Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, here we go!\" Minako cheered as she reached around and unclasped her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Whoa!\" Junpei gasped as Minako pulled it off her body, exposing her breasts.  \"Already?  I didn't think you'd actually do this till we got there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Junpei-kun?\" Minako said, spinning her bra around one of her fingers.  \"Getting cold feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly!  You just took me by surprise, that's all,\" he said as he went to work taking off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, now that I think of it...\" Minako pondered, tossing her bra casually aside.  \"Just the two of us might be a little dull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, backing down already?\" Junpei balked, having removed his shirt and jacket by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you know the saying: 'The more the merrier?' So how about it, Yukari-chan?\" Minako asked.  \"Want to take part in the Ultimate Tartarus Challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... look, Minako-chan,\" Yukari said.  \"I know we're friends and all here, but I don't think I'm ready to bare it all right now, you understand?  And also, Stupei over there will probably ruin whatever fun I can get out of this little game by watching, so I should probably just stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mentioned Junpei, he turned towards Yukari and raised an eyebrow suggestively, dressed only in his shoes, socks, boxers and hat at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" said Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true,\" Minako nodded.  \"But consider this.  Staying here means that you will be with Mitsuru, and I don't think she approves of your 'appreciation' for buff studs and beautiful bodies.  Do you really want to be stuck with her after she's done with Akihiko-kun and Shinji-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Yukari only had a side view of Mitsuru from where she was standing, the red-haired President was as imperious as ever; having her bra on display did nothing to lessen her furious presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if you don't want to look at Junpei-kun, perhaps you'll enjoy seeing more of <i>this</i> in action?\" Minako asked, raising her skirt teasingly and rubbing her hand along up her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's lips pursed together at the sight.  \"Fine,\" she grumbled, turning red and glancing to the side.  \"After all, it's no fun staring when the meat's beaten up.  But seriously, I am not getting naked unless I want to.  No forcing me into it, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" said Minako, undoing her skirt and letting it flutter to the ground.  \"You can help referee us then.  And how about you, Fuuka-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Fuuka responded incredulously.  \"I-I'm flattered, Minako-chan, but I don't think that, well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, Fuuka-chan can't fight, remember?\" Junpei reminded her as he stepped out of his boxers and straightened his cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Minako smacked her forehead.  \"You'd just be stuck at the lobby like always, sorry Fuuka-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's still the fight here I can watch,\" Fuuka shrugged.  \"And also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also?\" Minako asked, bending over to remove her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's nothing.  Good luck, Minako-chan,\" Fuuka smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on, no luck for Junpei?\" Junpei asked, arms open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Minako-chan is going to kick your sorry little butt, Stupei,\" Yukari taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big words from the girl who's coming along just to watch and not join in the fun,\" Junpei taunted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukari and Junpei continued to argue, Fuuka surreptitiously brought her phone out and snapped a picture of the mostly-naked trio.  Examining the result, she cracked a crooked smile as she saw everything they had to offer was there.  Unlike everyone else, whose desires either wanted to be seen or to exert control over others, Fuuka's urged her to lay low, putting her efforts to a more subtle use.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't start that way, of course.  Knowing what would happen and fearing that Mitsuru could concievably try to hold her at fault for this, Fuuka had decided to take some precautions, just in case.  By using her phone at opportune moments, Fuuka planned to capture Mitsuru's stew-induced faux pax as insurance, in case Mitsuru tried to pin it all on her as the chef who made the stew.  However, when the stew's effects had set in, Fuuka realized, why just capture Mitsuru's moment, when she had a whole team's worth of opportunities?  And what a bounty it was: the fight, Yukari becoming a perverted loon, the stripping, all of it was captured in photos on her phone.  She felt on top of the world right now.  All these embarrassing moments captured for posterity.  And it was more than just that, she felt.  All of this was priceless data that had to be preserved, solely for her use, of course, but preserved nontheless.  However, the data collection wasn't enough to satisfy the energy pulsing through her.  Still, she had some ideas brewing that could satisfy the urge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Aigis and Koromaru could only behold insanity their team had been reduced to.  In one corner, Akihiko, Shinjiro, Ken, and Mitsuru were all in a half-naked sparring match and had all started using their weapons by this point, and in the other, Minako, Junpei and Yukari were about to go to Tartarus, with only Yukari wearing anything more than shoes, socks, and a weapon.  Fuuka, for her part, hadn't moved much from the table, but who knows how long it would be until she started doing something crazy as well.  Things weren't looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoromaru peered up at Aigis and let out a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Aigis nodded.  \"I have never seen them acting like this either.  I have no clue how I can be of assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoromaru barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time?  Let me check,\" said Aigis.  \"Why, it's just about midnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Aigis finished her sentence, a deathly chill was felt throughout the room.  Instantaneously, all the lights and electronics in the room dimmed and shut off, as the sky outside the windows turned a pale green.  The Dark Hour had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that late already?  We've gotta get going, pronto!\" Minako shouted as she ran to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Junpei shouted, in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Yukari said, taking up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that?\" Shinjiro mused.  \"We're already behind schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then allow me to finish this quickly!\" said Mitsuru, drawing her evoker from her hip holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going to use their Personas against each other?  This isn't good!\" Aigis yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoromaru whimpered, looking back between the two groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis-chan, Koro-chan!\" Fuuka addressed the struggling pair, putting her now-disabled phone back in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san?\" Aigis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time left, the only way you can watch over everyone now is if you split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-yes... that is sound advice.  But which one of us should-\" before Aigis could finish her sentence, Koromaru charged across the room, just barely following Yukari outside before the front door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem solved, it appears,\" said Aigis.  \"I will remain and help mediate the struggle between Akihiko-san and the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure looks that way,\" said Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Fuuka-san,\" said Aigis.  \"You still seem to be in complete control of your mental faculties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Fuuka asked, caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is that you have not yet expressed interest in starting a fight, removing your clothing, or made known a desire to see others naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that, ha ha,\" Fuuka laughed nervously, glad that no one could use her phone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which leads me to ask you a question.  What will you do now?\" Aigis asked with her unyielding gaze.  \"I do not think you are so irresponsible as to just sit there while everyone loses themselves.  Are you going to help me sort out the fight right here?  Or will you follow Koro-chan and the others to Tartarus to watch over them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" Fuuka asked.  \"Well, that is...\"</span></div></div>",

When the arms then took off her sub-machine guns located in her hair band, she was confused, but thought that Fuuka was just being thorough.  When the covers of her leg boosters were being removed, however, Aigis began to grow concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san, my leg units do not contain any lethal weaponry, why has their protective covering been removed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka didn't reply, she just continued to tap away at the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis silence concerned Aigis, but not as much as when the arms returned and began removing the cover of her torso chassis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san!  What are you doing!?\" Aigis spoke, sounding very worried, as her inner mechanisms became exposed to the outside atmosphere.  \"The plan was to exchange my weaponry, was it not?  This exposure of my internal systems is unnecessary and dangerous to my operating capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...  Don't worry about it.  All you need to do is to sit back relax...\" Fuuka cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a robot, Aigis could do anything but relax at the moment.  The equipment change procedure was in its exiting stages, she recognized, but the non-lethal weapons had not yet been added.  In addition, her protective coverings had also been removed, thus leaving her essentially as naked as Minako and Junpei were before they had left the dormitory.  \"Fuuka-san?\" Aigis asked, a tinge of worry overlaid in her metallic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will be fine, let's just enjoy the moment, Aigis,\" said Fuuka, in a tone entirely unfamiliar to Aigis.  \"Fuuka-san, your clothing?\" Aigis noted in further confusion.  Indeed, Fuuka was now wearing only her bra and panties at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've already grounded myself,\" said Fuuka.  \"Without all that useless fabric in the way, there's no risk of static discharge.  You are perfectly safe, now relax...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis now recognized Fuuka's new tone of speech.  Seduction.  \"You are the same as everyone else,\" Aigis stated.  \"You are currently not in your right mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, I've never felt better!\" Fuuka said rapturously.  \"If Mitsuru-senpai had her wits about her, I would never be able to do this!  Aigis... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis didn't know if robots with Personas could procdess fear, but she was at least 90% certain this that emotion was running through her at maximum capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... LOVE technology,\" Fuuka said, swooning and clutching her face, blushing red.  \"The way everything functions, from small gizmos to large machinery, I love ALL of it!  But the school,\" her demeanor suddenly turned sour.  \"The school doesn't understand at all.  The most complex apparatus they have are the sewing machines in the Home Economics room.  I've always dreamed of asking to form a Technology Club, but I could never work up the courage to do so... not that they'd ever approve anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san?  That is quite... saddening,\" Aigis said, choosing her words carefully.  \"But what does that have to do with me or our companions right now?  Have you forgotten that they need our help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be fine,\" Fuuka stated.  \"I'm sure they'll be all right.  But if I don't do this... I don't think I'll have another chance.  I won't be fulfilled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would <i>that</i> be?\" Aigis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Examining you!\" Fuuka crowed.  \"This is the only chance I get to see how you tick, hehe,\" she giggled.  \"Please, I promise I'll be careful, and you won't feel a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Aigis started to protest, but stopped.  It was clear that Fuuka was beyond words.  The maintenance pod had opened up, which would allow Fuuka to get to her, but it would also let Aigis herself escape.  She needed to move-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she thought, should she?  She was in no state right now to stop the others, and leaving the lab without any protective covering for her interiors could prove quite damaging for her machinery and/or circuitry.  And what would happen to Fuuka if she denied her?  Would she get angry and go to further drastic measures?  What if she got hurt in doing so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis...\" Fuuka said, suddenly swooping in front of Aigis, and looking longingly into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Aigis-</span></div></div>",

Her surprise doubled upon seeing that it was Aigis.  What was she doing here, of all places?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san, I have finally found you,\" Aigis spoke in her usual monotonic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another student?\" the teacher asked.  \"What are you doing here?  Why aren't you in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, sir,\" Aigis stated.  \"But I have to make a delivery of the highest priority for Fuuka-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A delivery?</i> Fuuka wondered, curious, but then realizing that Aigis had already entered the room and was extending something towards her.  She soon realized what it was, her face turning crimson immediately upon doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those clothes?\"  \"It's her uniform!\"  \"Dude, there's underwear right on top of that pile too!\"  \"Does that mean, right now she's-?\" \"I knew something was suspicious!\" the class whispered, unable to contain themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Ah...\" Fuuka uttered, mortified and unable to form a coherent sentence.  Her mind, however, was rushing furiously.  <i>So Aigis got to our clothes first!?  Has she been running around the whole school asking where me and Minako-chan were all this time?  How many students has she talked with?  How many teachers?  Was my underwear on top and being shown around the entire time!?  Can't she have been subtle about this!?  You idiot, now everyone knows that I've got nothing underneath this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your garments, are they not?  Fuuka-san?\" Aigis asked, seemingly perplexed at Fuuka's unresponsive state.  \"What is the matter?  Did I perhaps make an error?\" she said, setting the pile down and taking the first article off the top, which happened to be Fuuka's light-green panties.  \"Let us start with this.  Are you able to recall any memories of this item?\" she asked, dangling them back and forth in front of Fuuka's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comical display was the last straw for everyone.  For the class, which immediately burst out into laughter, for Fuuka, who snatched the panties out of Aigis's hands, then gathered up the rest of her clothes and clutching them to her chest, crying out, \"Yes, just shut up!\" and nearly crying out of embarrassment, and for the teacher, who was near the end of his rope after a long day.  Slamming his fist onto the table, getting everyone's attention and silencing most, but not all, of the laughter, he slowly asked, very seriously, \"What were you doing with her clothes, Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis,\" Aigis replied.  \"And I merely was returning what was lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost?  But Ms. Yamagishi said that they were being cleaned,\" the teacher said suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Discarded as they were, how could they be anything but lost?\" Aigis continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you mean by that, exactly?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\" Aigis began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What she means is that I asked her to bring them to me!\" Fuuka interrupted. <i>If she continues like this, then they'll find out what Minako-chan and I did, and I can't let that happen!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... after I got better, I needed to get to class and, well, sent a text to Aigis.  I was using a bathroom to clean my clothes, but, that is, if I stayed to dry them, I would miss all of class.  So I asked Aigis to dry my clothes and bring them back to me.  You see... if they were left in the bathroom all alone, I was afraid someone would steal them.  So everything Aigis said about them being discarded and lost was just a figure of speech.  I was hoping that she would be more discreet though, and I-I am sorry for disrupting class like this!\" Fuuka said, bowing her head and hoping she sounded believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher silently considered this, and after a small pause asked Aigis, \"Is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis looked at Fuuka, who was looking at her with pleading eyes, slightly puffy from her outburst earlier, and said.  \"Yes, every word.  I am sometimes told that I have a tendency to exaggerate.  I am sorry for any concern this may have caused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you!</i> Fuuka sighed internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the final bell rang, causing the students to get up from their seats.  Though several remained seated, some even with their phones out, Fuuka noted with dread.  No doubt they were waiting to see how this episode would end first.  Hadn't she been through enough today!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, classes seem to have ended for the day,\" said Aigis, as the students began to funnel through the door around her.  \"May we be excused now, sir?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher clenched his teeth and looked at the two girls.  It wasn't a friendly look to say the least.  \"This day...\" he muttered under his breath.  \"Yamagishi,\" he addressed.  \"You and Aigis have caused a lot of trouble this day, but I suppose one can't predict sickness.  But you did cause quite a disturbance just now... I have made up my mind-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl with the scissors struggled to keep herself from laughing.  with the sleeves cut, all that was left of sly little Fuuka's clothing was the center of her shirt, wrapped around the top of her collar like a ring.  Honestly, they could leave it there, her breasts were already breathing the stuffy classroom air just fine, but they couldn't leave her with any way to cover up, now could they?  So with one final snip, she cut the shirt down the very center of her back.  It didn't fall yet, still bunched at the top of Fuuka's chest as it was, but any serious movement on her part, like say, getting up from her seat, would do the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scissors-girl slinked back into place and gave a wink to her friend, who winked back, and together they leaned back, ready to take in the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, as soon as they settled in, the teacher called on Fuuka once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Yamagishi, stand and answer the question please,\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fuuka said, raising herself from the desk.  Class was going on much longer than she hoped it would, (she could have sworn it was ten minutes till four times now!  Hopefully these ten minutes were the actual last ones,) but she was relieved that she didn't have to go up to the board again.  Surely this would be a far less harrowing experience than the last problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not to be, since as soon as she stood up, the girl's handiwork took it's toll.  First off came the shorts.  With their sides completely severed, the front half fell away as soon as Fuuka straightened herself, and the back half never even left the seat.  This was soon followed by her shirt.  With the back opened up and the tops of the sleeves being destroyed, there was no way left for the shirt to stay on her body, and so the bunched up coil of cloth fell from her neck onto the desk, then slipping down to Fuuka's feet, unnoticed by the unfortunate girl thanks to keeping focused on the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the class certainly noticed.  Though the blatant yet subtle prior exposure of Fuuka's chest had gone largely unnoticed, the collapse of her gym clothes into a few choice scraps of cloth had gathered the attention of everyone, save for the teacher who was looking at the work to see if Fuuka's answer was going to be correct or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka could hear the growing murmurs, gasps, and mutters of the class, but owed it just to the fact of the lightness of her gym clothes.  If that obnoxious girl could tell that she wasn't wearing any underwear, the rest of the class would likely figure it out too.  It wouldn't do good to dwell on this, she just needed to give her answer and finish class as soon as she could.  So she did just that, all the while oblivious of her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, Ms. Yamagishi, you may sit...  W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\" the teacher stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Fuuka gasped taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class couldn't hold it in anymore.  Everyone burst out laughing, pointing at Fuuka, more than a few of the students making obscene gestures and catcalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, show it off!\"  \"Not bad at all!\"  \"What a sicko!\"  \"Ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop that!\" Fuuka stammered, turning down.  \"W-Why are you doing this?  It's very- AAAH!\" she shrieked, finally seeing what everyone else had already gotten a good look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes were gone!  For the second time today she was completely naked at school, except this time she was surrounded by people, and people she knew at that, people she saw every day!  What happened?  She was dressed just moments ago, and for this to happen to her now... now... after all she had been through with Minako...  Meekly, Fuuka tried to cover her body, with one arm covering her crotch, and the other arm across her chest.  However, her rear was still completely uncovered, with many unhelpful reminders from the class about that, and Fuuka could only whimper and cower in panic, her entire face flushing crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUKA YAMAGISHI!\" the teacher bellowed, face red with anger.  \"WHY ARE YOU NAKED!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... Aaaaaaaa,\" Fuuka squeaked, unable to form a coherent sentence.  Why was this happening?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Did she do something to deserve this?  Was it all because she wanted to help with that damned, dirty recipe?  Slowly, her legs gave way and she curled up into her chair in a fetal position, using her legs and the chair to cover up as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to flow as she closed her eyes, unable to handle the class staring and mocking her anymore.  But she could still feel their stares, as much as she could feel cold all along her shivering, naked form.  The cold air of the classroom on her arms, the cold wood digging into her shins, the cold fabric of the chair under her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabric!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on instinct, Fuuka's eyes snapped open and she wiggled an arm out to pull the fabric from beneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, what's she doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she gonna do some sort of naked dance with that cloth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pft!  You wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the class as best she could, Fuuka, brought it in front of her and examined it.  The color and composition looked familiar, but she couldn't quite place it, that is, until she turned it around and saw the size tag in the middle.  <i>Th-These are my shorts!</i> she thought.  <i>But why are they like this?  Underneath where I was sitting...?  Wait!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith realization, she leaned over and checked under her desk, (knowing she would be exposed yet again, but was too focused to notice,) and found two more similar scraps of cloth, which she soon identified as the rest of her shorts and her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should match here... and this... that means-!\" she said, breathing in sharply, and looking up, seeing the class having huddled all around her, now just as curious as they were mocking/perving earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEK!\" Fuuka squealed, clutching her destroyed clothes to her body and hunching down into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka Yamagishi,\" the teacher said, towering over her angrily.  \"I will give you one, just one, chance to explain yourself.  Why.  Are.  You.  Naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Ah... er...\" Fuuka stammered, overwhelmed with everything that had happened.  <i>Focus, Fuuka,</i> she said to herself.  <i>This is the only chance you have.  It's embarrassing, but you can do it, you have to do it.  Or else... well, don't think about or else!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" the teacher said threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, um... It's because of this,\" Fuuka said, drying her tears and picking out her shorts while keeping the shirt-cloth covering her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your shorts, what of it?\" the teacher asked, taking them as evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't you see?\" Fuuka said nervously.  \"The edges, these haven't been ripped.  They, they've been cut.  By a scissor or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... it certainly looks that way.  And you're saying you did this, then?\" the teacher growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"  Fuuka gasped.  \"W-Why would I cut off... my own clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think someone could get away with tampering with another student's clothes in my classroom, under MY watch?  Do you think I'm incompetent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were the last one to realize Fuuka was naked, other than herself that is!\" another classmate said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" the teacher shouted.  \"Regardless, the notion that anyone could just do that to someone else so easily is ludicrous!  So what is really going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka didn't know what to say.  It was ludicrous.  Surely she would have known if someone was taking her clothes apart, right?  Could that have been what that draft was?  But even so, and even if they had succeeded without getting spotted, who would even do such a thing to begin with...?  Well, there was that girl, the one with the perverted note and mind, but even if it was, why would she do this to her?  She hadn't even said two words to her before now, so why would she do something so horrible?  To do this to another person... no matter what her reasons were, that was too cruel!  She couldn't just let that girl get away with this!  It was all too insane, it was like she was in a nightmare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... what if this <i>was</i> a nightmare?  That would explain everything that had happened with Minako, and the girl's actions right now.  And isn't being naked at school one of the most common nightmares?  Everything certainly felt real, but there were dreams that had that quality to them, a lucid dream, was it?  In that case, all she had to do was ride it out.  Anything she did right now would be pointless, as she would just wake up in her own bed soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was, however, everything that was happening was very real, but the possibility that all this was just a dream was a very tempting option for Fuuka and her overburdened psyche.  Tempting... Tempting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you have to say for yourself, Fuuka Yamagishi!?\" the teacher demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sir,\" Fuuka said, feeling eerily calm, despite only being covered in front by a damaged, unwearable shirt, \"The thing is-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fuuka smiled softly as she stepped inside the club's meeting room, offering a quiet \"Hello\" to those assembled.  Despite it being a Saturday afternoon, they'd managed to get a near-perfect turnout, much to Fuuka's surprise.  The others must really be dedicated, she thought.  What didn't surprise her were all the sewing machines situated in a loose circle around the room's center, as if they were loitering there.  Keisuke had been pleased to inform his fellow club mates that the school had provided them with new equipment at last, and while several of them had grumbled about how sewing hardly counted as art, Fuuka was willing to at least give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday's meeting had been cancelled due to the grumblers informing Keisuke that they would return as soon as they got back to painting.  Despite Fuuka's presence that day, she'd been forced to re-attend once their bespectacled club leader informed the dissenters that they needed to at least try the sewing machines out, and that if everyone really hated them, they never had to use them again; a fair compromise, in Fuuka's book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with this attitude that the art club met once more.  The grumbling ceased after a few minutes, and some of the assembled students found themselves actually doing an alright job; Fuuka was not one of those students, unfortunately.  Her affinity for technology didn't extend to devices as old as the provided sewing machines, and it didn't take long for her to wind up with a completely hopeless doily.  Keisuke offered to help her, but she just smiled sheepishly and told him she'd figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when everything started to go downhill for Fuuka.  If she'd known what was about to happen, she'd have skipped the meeting altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn about her fourth attempt at spinning her yarn into something even remotely workable, Fuuka found her machine stopping all of a sudden.  Frowning with frustration, and worried she might have somehow broken it, she got to her feet and leaned over the machine, lightly hitting it with the palm of her small hand.  She wasn't usually keen on \"fixing\" machines like that, but with a machine that old, she wondered if it didn't just need a light jostling.  To her credit, her surprise, that seemed to do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Fuuka sat back down, she failed to notice a few stray threads from her skirt getting stuck in the needle of the machine.  Glad to see she'd finally done <b>something</b> right, she quietly continued trying to actually sew something, gradually unraveling her own skirt inch-by-inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a few minutes and two more failed attempts to realize something was wrong, and by that time, her skirt was a full three inches shorter!  It was barely even covering her underwear now, and the machine was still going!  With a quiet \"Eep!\", Fuuka attempted to tug her skirt back down to her knees, willing it to get longer again.  Needless to say, that didn't work, and more and more of Fuuka's white nylons peeked out from under her quickly-shortening skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do?  She needed to stop the machine, or soon she would end up losing her skirt!  But she couldn't stand up; not like this.  If the others realized what she'd accidentally done to herself, she'd never hear the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka felt her cheeks turning red as she decided to-</span></div></div>",

There had to be something she could do quickly and quietly to handle the situation. But what? She couldn't figure out how to get the machine to stop, and just waiting for it to break down again was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a hunch, Fuuka tried tugging on the thread of her skirt being fed through the machine, hoping she might be able to snap it free. Unfortunately, all this accomplished was making the machine work harder against her pulling, causing a grinding noise to begin emanating from the machine. Seeing other club members start to look up from their work in curiosity, Fuuka quickly abandoned this plan, letting the machine continue its work and cease grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka could feel her time running out. Her skirt had diminished to the point that she could feel it disappearing between her body and her seat. She didn't have to look down to know just how much was showing at this point. Fuuka could feel her heart start racing; she needed a plan, and quickly! Her analytically inclined mind considered the possibility of finding a way to jam the machine. Force the needle to stop moving and at the very least keep her skirt from shrinking any further, even though there wasn't much skirt left to salvage. Opposite this idea there was a more \"practical\" one, at least practical so far as her nervous mind was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Technically, I have all the materials I need to make a new skirt. I just need to figure out how to sew it into the proper shape, shouldn't be too terribly hard.\"</i> Fuuka's mind told her.

Jamming the machine would still leave her with a shamefully short skirt, and that was completely unacceptable.  Besides, she thought, what could be a better way for her to improve her sewing than working under this kind of intense pressure?  Maybe this was the moment when she'd finally tap into some sort of hidden artistic talent that had been buried deep, <i>deep</i> inside her all those years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to give it a shot.  She'd pulled the team out of tougher spots than this in their trips into Tartarus, so surely she could pull herself out of an embarrassing blunder all on her own.  Besides, she'd worn enough skirts to have an idea of the basic shape one needed to be.  How hard could it really be?  Riding a wave of unsure courage, Fuuka set to work making herself a new skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took approximately a minute before she realized her plan <i>really</i> had no chance of working.  To start, Fuuka may have known what sort of shape a skirt was meant to have, but getting it to take a shape even remotely close to that was the tricky part; actually, it was the entire thing.  She'd hoped that would be the tricky part, but it turned out that all of it was tricky.  There wasn't a single part of this that was going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes in, and Fuuka could feel her skirt disappear underneath her entirely, leaving her with practically nothing except the part around her waist.  Fuuka felt her cheeks turning redder as she realized the only thing covering her panties were her white nylons, and those were nearly transparent!  And she still wasn't any closer to making a serviceable skirt for herself.  She needed to do something, and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first instinct was to just grab her bag and bolt for the door, but if she did that, she knew she'd be seen.  Her other option was to try and find some way to cover up below her waist without looking too conspicuous.  She wasn't sure how she was going to do that, but if she didn't want to get noticed, she'd have to figure it out soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka stole a quick, nervous glance down, hoping she'd somehow imagined the whole thing and she was still fully-dressed.  The clear view of her modest white panties underneath her nylons was enough to tell her otherwise.  Cringing with embarrassment, Fuuka quickly decided on her next move-</span></div></div>",

The sound of hurried footsteps drew the attention of those around her, and Fuuka could only hope that she moved too quickly for any of them to fully register what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning out into the hallway, Fuuka realized that she had to find somewhere else to hide. While having no skirt in the art room had been embarrassing, the school hallways weren't exactly better. In a way, they were a downgrade, since just about anybody might come down the halls and see her. That was no good at all! Quickly reasoning to herself, Fuuka decided that her best bet was to hide out in the women's bathroom until she could gather her thoughts and figure out a solution to her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards the nearest bathroom and bolting off before anybody from the art room could come out to investigate her sudden flight from the room, Fuuka failed to notice something dangerously important: another thread leaving her body, feeding under the door and back into the art room.

She was thinking of nothing but the safety of the restroom, however, so even as her blouse continued to unravel, she still failed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the door to the girls' room, however, she could hear voices coming from the other side; high-pitched laughter and even...jeering?  There was a crowd in there, and it sounded as though someone was being made fun of.  That's what Fuuka thought she heard, anyway.  Re-assessing her own lack of skirt, Fuuka realized that perhaps scampering into the restroom wasn't a good idea.  But then, where else could she go?  She couldn't stay in the halls.

Still unaware of her second compromised piece of clothing, Fuuka didn't notice as her shirt was completely undone, the final bit of thread falling away from her and coming to rest in the middle of the hallway. The only thing keeping Fuuka's upper half modest now was her school jacket and the bra underneath, and one of those was far less modest than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the classroom, Fuuka quickly slammed the door behind her, hoping nobody caught a glimpse of her ducking into the room. Leaning against the door, Fuuka took a moment to catch her breath, still trying to figure out a solution to her missing skirt dilemma. Looking around, Fuuka saw that she had chosen wisely; the room was blissfully empty. While somebody might drop by later, she was safe from prying eyes for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her brow with her jacket sleeve, Fuuka had an idea. She remembered how Yukari would wear her pink camisole around her waist on the warmer days, keeping her identifiable pink on her person while keeping cool. Fuuka might be able to recreate that idea with her jacket. While tying her jacket around her waist would still leave some of her lower half exposed, she might be able to mitigate that with her bag. She could cover her rear end with the jacket and hold her bag in front of her. It wasn't perfect, but it was certainly something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this was her safest course of action, Fuuka pulled her jacked over her head only to finally realize her latest development. Shrieking, Fuuka crossed her arms over her chest despite nobody being around to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my shirt?!\" Fuuka nearly shouted, surprised at finding herself in nothing but her bra on her upper half. While she didn't know what had happened to her shirt, what was important was that it was gone, and THAT was bad news. Now Fuuka had two issues to fix; her top and her bottom. She could use her jacket to solve one, but she'd still need to improvise a solution to the other. At the moment, Fuuka had to decide which was more important. Should she put her jacket back on and keep her top half decent, or go through with her plan to replace her skirt with her jacket and bag?</span></div></div>",

Having her panties on display was embarrassing, to be certain, but she'd still rather be showing those than her bra, especially with all the extra bare skin around it.  But now she was back to square one.  Actually, it wasn't even square one.  Square one was when all she'd lost was her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming with embarrassment, Fuuka paced around the empty classroom, wracking her brain to come up with an escape plan.  Maybe she could just hide in the classroom until the school closed, then escape back to the dorm under cover of darkness.  No, no, that wouldn't work.  Then she'd end up locked inside the school again and...well, that just wasn't an option.  Tartarus was deadly even under good conditions, so she didn't want to think about what it would be like to scamper around the labyrinthine tower dressed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was going to have to make her escape soon, though.  The school would be open for another hour at most.  It was then that Fuuka had an idea: What if she were to escape through a window, then climb down off the roof and down onto the track field?  She had never been any good at sports or exerting herself, but if she were careful - very, very careful - she might be able to slide down a nearby drain pipe and then hide in the bushes until she reached the monorail.  How she was going to deal with that was...well, she'd figure that out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis still seemed like a terrible plan, but her only other option was to head back into the hall and brave the first floor lobby.  There was another problem, however; one which, like her unraveled shirt, Fuuka didn't immediately notice: When she'd yanked the zipper on her school jacket back up, it had been so frantic and with such force that it had been partially torn from its track.  The jacket was closed, for the time being, but there was now a noticeable gap at the bottom where Fuuka's belly button was now peeking out.  If that zipper gap were to catch on something, Fuuka's jacket would be ripped clean open.  Of course, she didn't realize any of this just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka knew she needed to make a decision now, so she decided to-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fuuka realized how outlandish this plan was, but her only other option would be to walk through a crowd of her peers dressed as she was. How could she show her face in school after something like that? No, stealth was her only real option. Thankfully, Fuuka reasoned to herself, she was light enough that she shouldn't have too much trouble keeping her grip and sliding down the drainage pipe. Likewise, the pipe was unlikely to fall out of place due to her weight. All in all, the plan was, at least in terms of physical danger, not terribly bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the classroom window open, Fuuka eyed the drainage pipe to her left with trepidation. Looking out onto the track field, Fuuka felt fortunate for the first time today as she found it blissfully empty. The track team must have already left for the day, so she wouldn't have an audience for her descent from the school. Making sure her bag was safely with her, Fuuka reached out and got as strong of a grip on the drainage pipe as she could muster. Carefully, Fuuka swung herself out of the window and hastily brought her other hand to the pipe, affixing herself to it and making sure her grip was nice and tight. Once she was sure she had a good grip, Fuuka slowly began to shimmy down the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka could only imagine how ridiculous she must look. Shimmying down the side of the school, her nylons doing a negligible job of hiding her panties, the colors of her uniform jacket contrasting sharply with the walls of the school would surely have drawn the eye of any observers in the area. Thankfully that wasn't an issue. What was an issue, however, was the drainage pipe itself. Due to building codes, the pipe was affixed to the wall of the building with a series of metal rings. Though they barely stood out from the pipe itself, they still stuck out enough to potentially snag debris such as falling leaves or the like. In this particular case, while there may not have been any falling leaves to snag on the rings, there was an abundance of material on Fuuka's person just begging to snag on one of them. So focused on keeping her grip and climbing down quickly, Fuuka was completely oblivious to yet another part of her wardrobe getting ready to abandon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been a little bit more observant, Fuuka may have been able to free her-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chancing a glance down, Fuuka saw that the ground wasn't too far beneath her at this point. She could likely hop off and land without any injury, and it would get her into the bushes faster. While there was nobody around at the moment, Fuuka would rather not chance somebody turning the corner of the building and getting an eyeful of her in this state. And so, steeling herself and preparing for the landing, Fuuka carefully released her grip from the drainage pipe and began her short fall. Unfortunately for her, the loose bit of zipper track on her jacket had caught onto one of the pipe's fastening rings. Fuuka heard the sound of popping metal as the zipper failed and felt her arms pull through the sleeves of her jacket. Before she could fully register what had happened, Fuuka was on the ground and her jacket was hanging limply from the drainage pipe several feet above her, out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, her sudden removal from her jacket had caused her bag to slide off of her, falling several feet away from the bushes onto the hard concrete walkway. Fuuka could only hope that the contents of her bag weren't terribly damaged; the last thing she needed to top the day off was having to replace her laptop and her cell phone. That's it! Her cell phone! Fuuka wanted to kick herself for overlooking this obvious choice. She could use her phone to call someone for help, someone to bring her clothes and get her out of this mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she might be able to. To get her phone, she'd have to get to her bag, which would mean leaving the relative safety of the bushes. And even if she did venture out to retrieve the bag, the fall may very well have broken her phone and rendered that option completely invalid. Still, the chance of a quick solution that could save her from having to find a way home in her rapidly deteriorating state of dress might be worth it. Really, it was that or continue on and hope she could find a better solution.</span></div></div>",

She feared the worst, and what she saw was exactly that: The front of her white nylons had caught on one of the pipe's metal rings, snagging just below her waistband and tearing a thin hole.  Fuuka's eyes widened as she realized she wouldn't be able to keep climbing down without further damaging her nylons, and just abandoning them was completely out of the question.  She'd already lost an alarming number of clothes, and she wasn't in a hurry to lose even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling slightly panicked, Fuuka began to struggle against the metal ring, hoping to somehow tug her nylons free.  Each desperate movement began to rip a longer and longer hole.  It was obvious that, at best, Fuuka would come out of this with a pair of ruined nylons, but some cover was better than none at all.  If only she could let go of the pipe with one hand, she'd have no trouble at all getting herself free, but she knew she'd slip and fall if she tried anything like that.  So she continued her struggling, each tug causing the tear to travel lower and lower, until it had reached the middle of Fuuka's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the next tug happened to be a bit too vigorous, and Fuuka suddenly lost her grip on the pipe.  Letting out a panicked shriek, Fuuka clung on with her knees for dear life.  Fortunately, while she did continue sliding downward at a very quick pace, she was still able to keep her precarious leg-hug the whole way down, straining her nylons even more.  However, disaster struck once again as she neared the bottom.  Fuuka's legs squeezed together once more in an attempt to halt her descent altogether, but the sudden stop caused her to fall backwards until she was actually upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only a foot or so from the ground, so her inevitable fall would be little more than a bump, which was good, since right as she was flipped upside-down, she finally lost her grip once more and fell off the pipe entirely.  Fuuka let out an embarrassed squeal as she felt her white nylons slip off her legs entirely, as their waistband had been completely shredded in the fall.  The sudden feeling of silky cloth abandoning her legs would have been bad enough without the fall, but the sudden shift in momentum caused the blue-haired girl to lose her shoes in the process, as well.  Once she climbed out of the bushes, Fuuka looked down at herself and \"Eep!\"'d once more.  Her school jacket still hid her bra, but now she was standing out in the middle of her school's track field with her panties on display for anyone who happened to walk by!  Fuuka squirmed with embarrassment, her hands flying down to shyly cover the front of her modest, white panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarefoot, bare-legged, and with her panties clearly exposed, Fuuka needed to come up with a plan, and fast.  She needed to get home, but how could she without someone seeing her?  She did still have her bag with her, but she couldn't exactly hide the fact that she was running around in her undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a little, embarrassed whine, Fuuka decided to-</span></div></div>",

Not an option, not as far as Fuuka was concerned. She had to take the longer path, if only because it'd be more likely to be deserted or sparsely populated. So, with modest being at the forefront of her mind, Fuuka quickly made her way toward the detour. It didn't take long before she found what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long way was actually quite nice, were the situation any different. A quiet stretch of assorted buildings against a small park-like area. It was meant to offer the people of the city a place to feel relaxed and closer to nature, though in reality it was little more than an infrequently traveled path students took to and from school. Fuuka wasn't in any mood to linger and admire the scenery, however. She had a journey to make, and this was the best path available. Taking careful steps, Fuuka made sure to stay near the wildlife, ready to hop behind a tree or into some bushes in case there was any sign of people coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Fuuka thought about how ridiculous she must look. Wearing nothing but her underwear and a school jacket, she figured she'd look more at home on a poster in some boy's bedroom. The idea of her in this state being photographed made Fuuka shiver, reminding her of just how important it was that she stay out of sight and stay on her guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this careful mindset that clued Fuuka in to the sound of approaching footsteps. Reacting quickly, she jumped for the nearest cover, which just so happened to be a particularly thick patch of bushes. While it wasn't comfortable, Fuuka was glad that the cluster of branches and needles more or less completely obscured her from view. Deciding against peeking out, lest she give herself away, Fuuka chose to listen to the footsteps as they approached, reached her location, and thankfully continued on their way. Whoever had walked by was none the wiser about the half-naked girl in the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved, Fuuka began pulling herself out of the bushes. Had she been paying more attention, she wouldn't have felt quite so relieved, as one of the pricklier branches of the bush had managed to snag her-</span></div></div>",

One wrong move, or even just one right move made too hastily, could spell disaster once again.  The fading footsteps gave Fuuka the courage she needed to make such a hasty move.

Unfortunately for Fuuka, her focus on stopping her descent made her blind to her jacket's compromised state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the end of the hill started to meet the start of the river, Fuuka finally managed to stop herself completely. Managing to wrap her legs around a small shrub on the hillside, Fuuka found herself in quite a ridiculous position: her momentum had carried her body in such a way that her head was now pointed toward the running water, while the way she had hooked her legs around the shrub left her thighs spread a bit more wide open than Fuuka would prefer to be out in public. Her hands actually resting in the running water itself, Fuuka began to realize that something was wrong as she felt her jacket sleeves begin to get pulled off her arms by the current!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her head upwards to see what was happening, Fuuka was shocked as she saw her jacket pulling away from her, leaving her in nothing but her bra! With a strangled cry, Fuuka desperately clawed at her retreating jacket only to be met with air. She had realized her predicament too late, and now her jacket was gently floating down the river, further and further away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka didn't know what to do at this point. Here she was, nothing on except a bra and nothing to aid her except her bag. She wasn't even at the monorail station, let alone anywhere near the dorms, and there was no way she'd be able to take any kind of public transportation now! Deciding that her first order of business was finding somewhere to hide, Fuuka carefully freed herself from the shrub that had stopped her from falling into the river and began to weigh her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka certainly wasn't dumb, she was confident enough to admit that much. However, her smarts could only go so far in a situation like this. Maybe, just maybe, if she found something, like a discarded newspaper or a shopping bag, she might be able to make some improvised clothing. It'd be flimsy, and it would certainly draw a lot of people's attention, but at least she'd be covered. Provided she didn't have any more unfortunate mishaps, that is. On the other hand, if Fuuka chose her hiding spots more carefully from now on, she might be able to make some real distance without losing what little she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaylight was burning, and Fuuka knew she had to make a choice.

Besides, she thought, having to quickly hide in bushes or by climbing down pipes had caused her to lose the rest of her clothes, hadn't it?

Taking great care to avoid the other passengers' jostling as much as possible, Fuuka waited until most of the other people had left before taking a few timid steps back out into the open air.  The boys had lingered a bit longer, apparently wanting to see what she was up to, but eventually even they left the car.  Breathing a quiet sigh of relief now that she was finally alone in the car, Fuuka knew she had to get off as well, but the momentary seclusion was so welcome after being in the spotlight for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped off the monorail, however, disaster struck once more: The doors closed behind her almost instantly, capturing the newspaper pages and even part of her bra strap in its metallic clutches.  Realizing she was stuck, Fuuka only let out a tiny gasp.  She didn't want to draw any more attention to herself than she already had.  A few experimental tugs told her she wasn't getting free on her own, and the monorail was set to depart any second.  She needed some help, and fast!  Because if things stayed the way they were, she was going to get stripped naked in front of all these people, including those boys from her school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought things couldn't get worse-</span></div></div>",

Her clothes would get dragged away along with the train!  There had to be <b>something</b> she could do!  Struggling with all her might against the doors, Fuuka could hear her newspaper cover starting to rip, her bra strap straining dangerously.  Feet scrambling furiously, Fuuka felt the train begin to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!</i> Fuuka wailed inside her head, dreading what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid motion, every single stitch of clothing Fuuka had left, from her plain white bra to the flimsy newspaper pages she'd used to cover her modesty, were ripped clean off her body.  The loud tearing sound would have been noticeable enough on its own to make everyone on the platform stare, but what really got their attention was the humiliated squeal that came from Fuuka's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was: Standing in the middle of a train platform, still nearly an hour from the safety of her dorm, naked as the day she was born.  Fuuka's face was bright red as her hands flew down to cover up, one arm slinging across her small breasts while her other hand shyly rested in front of her wispy tuft of blue pubic hair, not able to completely conceal it.  Tiny, curly blue hairs peeked out from behind her palm, and as she squirmed with embarrassment, those watching her would see she'd even accidentally let one of her shy, pink nipples slip out from under her arm.  And evey if they hadn't noticed, the barrage of flashes from nearby camera phones would certainly catch it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another squeal of humiliation, Fuuka bolted from the station, red-faced and bare-assed.  She tried to escape the camera phones as best she could, but they still got plenty of shots of the shy, nerdy girl in her birthday suit before she left.  Bare feet slapping against the pavement as she ran away, Fuuka felt humiliated tears prickling at the corners of her eyes.  How could she face everyone on Monday?  The pictures would probably be uploaded to the internet by then!  The whole school would have seen her naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-faced, covered precariously by nothing but her school bag, and on the verge of tears, Fuuka just wanted to get home; or, if that wasn't an option, crawl under a rock and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened was-</span></div></div>",

Nothing mattered except that, and it was for that reason that Fuuka simply kept running. She knew the route back to the dorm like the back of her hand, so she didn't need to pay attention to where she was going; this was good, since Fuuka couldn't bring herself to look up and risk looking anybody in the eyes as she ran by. This confidence in her path finding would lead her into more trouble, however, as Fuuka should have been keeping her eyes ahead to see any potential obstacles. Instead, Fuuka didn't realize what she was running into until it was far, far too late. If she thought her current predicament was humiliating, she didn't even know the half of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's ears barely registered the woman's voice growing louder as she approached. At first, she just thought it was a normal conversation between whoever was speaking and somebody else next to her. Had she paid closer attention, she would have heard \"Thank you, Hakamichi-san. This is Yuuko Shimizu, coming to you live from- ah!\" The sharply dressed news reporter was cut short as the unwillingly streaking Fuuka slammed into her, sending the two women crashing into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" The reporter yelped out, surprised at being tackled and ever more surprised at seeing the culprit. \"Wait, why are you naked?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka couldn't even think to make a reply, her eyes taking in her surroundings. What had that woman said? 'Coming to you live?' That was when Fuuka noticed the news camera. The news camera pointing straight at her! First the phone cameras, now live television?! Fuuka didn't think she could get any redder, screaming in humiliation as she tried to free herself from the reporter she had stumbled into. Fuuka could only hope she could get out of there before the camera could catch anything more than it already had.</span></div></div>",

She was convinced things couldn't possibly get more humiliating than this.  Not only was she buck naked in public, but anyone watching the news that night would end up seeing her!  Going bright red, all she could hope for now was that the camera hadn't caught anything too important, and all the viewers would see would be flashes of bare skin.  In reality, Fuuka's bare backside had already been in frame for a good five seconds, even if she didn't realize it.  Fuuka wouldn't be able to miss what happened next, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fuuka freed herself from the mess of tangled limbs, she found herself suddenly off-balance, and before she knew it, she'd fallen backwards right onto her ass.  That wasn't the worst of it, however: The camera had followed her, and as she'd fallen quite suddenly, Fuuka suddenly found herself in a terribly compromising position.  Hands propping herself up, bare boobs bared for all to see, with her legs splayed out wide, giving the camera a clear view at her naked pussy.  The only thing covering her was the wispy patch of curly, blue hair between her legs, and that wouldn't exactly provide her much comfort.  It took Fuuka a few seconds to realize her situation,and by the time she had, the camera had caught the whole thing on tape.  Anyone watching would be able to see the whole thing: Fuuka Yamagishi, naked from head to toe, giving the camera one hell of a show.  As she sat there, eyes wide and face bright red, Fuuka realized her whole school - no, the whole <b>city</b> - would see her naked now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all just too much for the already-embarrassed Fuuka.  This was the final straw.  Screaming with humiliation, Fuuka threw her arms over herself, suddenly bursting into mortified tears as she tried to scramble to her feet.  Leaving her bag behind, Fuuka's hands flew down between her legs as she began to run away.  The whole thing was, obviously, seen by the camera, and would most definitely be appearing on the news that evening.  Humiliated tears streaming down her cheeks, cupping her bare crotch like a child, Fuuka ran naked down the street toward her dorm, catching the attention of those she passed and anyone who happened to look out their windows.  Each person who spotted her only further added to her embarrassment, and while she'd managed to stop crying after a few minutes, she still had to contend with the stares and laughter of those who saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka reached her dorm after a few minutes more, and though she'd left her bag lying in the street, the door had been left open.  Bursting into the living room, the humiliated girl felt actual relief for the first time in what felt like ages...until she saw the entire rest of the SEES team staring straight at her. She'd just given all her friends a full look at her bare breasts and pussy!  Letting out another humiliated squeal, Fuuka pushed past them and ran upstairs, not even remembering to cover this time.  Slamming the door to her room, Fuuka wrapped her blanket over herself and stayed there for the rest of the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka had finally made it home, but she didn't even want to think about what Monday was going to be like, once those pictures and that news footage were seen by the public.  What was certain, though, was that Fuuka would never, ever forget how humiliated she'd felt that day, and no one who'd seen her would ever forget the sight of the girl who'd accidentally given the whole city a look between her legs on the evening news.</span></div></div>",

I just... No. It's not happening.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimidly, Fuuka peeked out from her hiding spot behind the pillar. Looking around, the main advantage Fuuka had was that the area was relatively quiet. If she timed things right, she should be able to navigate the area unseen. Of course, that wouldn't mean anything if she couldn't find something she could use. Fuuka carefully took stock of her surroundings, hoping that she could find something to grab to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one end of the platform, Fuuka noticed something wonderful. A long jacket, or at least long for Fuuka, was sitting on a bench, apparently unattended. For once, Fuuka was glad that she was short, as the jacket would be long enough to cover her most important parts. Of course, there was the issue of its location: while the jacket's owner wasn't apparently present, a group of people were near the bench. Getting close enough to grab the jacket would also mean getting close enough to be seen by that group, and if one of them happened to look in her direction when she was over there, she wouldn't have anywhere to hide. Besides that, there was the fact that the jacket's actual owner might return, and then Fuuka would have to explain why she was stealing someone else's property...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one other option, but it wasn't as favorable. Clearly abandoned, a large paper shopping bag sat on the ground near a garbage can. The bag was both closer to Fuuka's current hiding spot, and wasn't near anybody that Fuuka noticed from her vantage point. It shouldn't be terribly difficult to run over, snag the bag, and run back to her spot behind the pillar. Fuuka could easily punch some holes for her legs or one for her head in the bottom of the bag and turn it into a makeshift dress. A makeshift dress of relatively fragile paper... that would certainly catch people's attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, those were Fuuka's options, and she had to decide what she wanted to do. Weighing the risks and rewards of each path, Fuuka made up her mind, readied herself, and dashed off to-</span></div></div>",

While her one hand extended to try and get the thief's attention, the person turned towards her before she could so much as blink. Two long-sleeved hands shot for Fuuka's chest, and she gasped in panic as she stared downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever it was was cupping her breasts! \"L, let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka shrieked and tried to move back from the figure before those hands could squeeze any tighter... and instead, the gripping fingers took hold of the cups of her bra, and pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed to happen in slow motion. Fuuka stumbling backward, the thief pulling away from her... and the thin confines of her bra lightly snapping apart, leaving her body completely before the thief took possession of her last single possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrouded figure might have smiled before moving to depart as the train stopped. Fuuka was left standing there blankly with her arms extended in a hapless gesture, her body exposed from head to toe, and beginning to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N, no... please don't ta-...\" She helplessly reached after the thief, and he was gone through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C, come back...!\" Fuuka couldn't stay on the train naked! She ran after him in a panic, and the train door closed just inches away from her exposed rear... and she stared blankly at the small crowd waiting for the train, who were all staring at her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer small breasts rose up and down with her tense breathing, her nipples taking the worse moment to protrude gently outward and make her nudity all the more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...t, this can't be happening...\" Fuuka whispered to herself deliriously, and finally covered herself, shrieking one last time before running off through the station, her arm cupping her breasts while the other uselessly tried to cover as much of her lower body as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did little good. She could feel her unbound curvature moving freely beneath the clasp of her arm, and a telltale draft against her rear as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had only been four or five people, all older workers. They were too stunned to react. Fuuka tried to reassure herself that none of them could have recognized her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she just ran.

She suspected something about the place affected her sleep, made it a little less restful. But the Velvet Room's occupants had proven to be nothing but helpful, so she didn't hold it against them when they felt it necessary to summon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant stretch, Minako sat up and looked at the calendar posted on her bedroom wall. It was Saturday, so at least tonight she'd be able to turn off her alarm and sleep in. At least, she could do that, but she also thought it might be worth heading to Tartarus tonight. The team could always use the exercise from fighting the Shadows, and there's no telling what useful items they might come across in their exploration. Of course, if she decided to bring the team to Tartarus, she'd need to do her usual ritual. It wasn't something she told the rest of the team about, and they didn't need to know. It made her feel more alive, and considering the very real danger they all faced when they ventured into the mysterious tower, feeling alive helped her remember what she fought for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hm, I guess I could just do it without going to Tartarus. Kind of like having my cake and eating it too.\"</i> Minako thought to herself as she brushed her teeth, the final step of her morning habits.

It would look even worse to Mitsuru, who she had plans to go shopping with after school today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing out of the dorm, Minako made it to the monorail with a little time to spare. Quickly finding Yukari and Fuuka, Minako approached her friends and teammates, engaging them in pleasant morning conversation.

A little obsessed with training, but he's a cute dork when you get to know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...did you just call him a dork?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, he can be super intense and serious sometimes, and he's still dealing with some things in his past, but he's really fun when you get to know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it must be nice getting to know him better.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! It wasn't easy at first. I was a little intimidated by his constant gaggle of vapid fangirls. But once I figured out how to ignore those losers, it was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mob leader looked livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVapid.

All she had left was one of her after school clubs, the only question was which one to attend? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a Saturday, Minako's clubs had somehow all managed to have special rescheduled meetings today. Mitsuru had called for a Student Council meeting, though she told Minako that she understood if her other clubs needed her. Photography club had been postponed while the special lights in the development room were replaced, and today was the earliest day the room had been serviceable again. Lastly, her sports club had to put off practice while their training area underwent some scheduled maintenance. It was certainly odd, having to make a decision like this on a Saturday, but that's just how life worked sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako thought long and hard about her decision. She always enjoyed photography club with Fuuka as company, so that could certainly be a good time. Mitsuru's meeting might be worth attending to make sure she stayed up to date on school policies and events. Sports club was always good for keeping Minako fit, though Tartarus likely did a better job of keeping her in shape; of course, practice in the school was less dangerous than fighting evil monsters in a labyrinthine tower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of weighing her options, Minako made her choice and set course for-</span></div></div>",

While one's brain might lose details and memories of sights turned fuzzy, a picture would always retain that crisp clarity. Minako certainly enjoyed the company of Fuuka and Keisuke as well, the two of them being great friends that made the club meetings that much more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a routine meeting, all things considered. Picture ideas were discussed between members, photos were developed with the utmost care, and good times were had by all. The catalyst for Minako's downward spiral that day came in the form of Fuuka approaching her near the end of the day. Something about Fuuka's body language told Minako that the other girl was nervous, but clearly wanted to discuss something with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fuuka-chan, what's up? You look like you've got something on your mind.\" Minako asked, trying to make Fuuka feel a bit more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing really. I just wanted to ask if you'd be willing to help me with an idea I had. I've got an idea for some pictures, but I need a second person to be the subject, and you're one of the only people I'm really comfortable asking to-\" Fuuka stammered, only to be cut off by Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more, Fuuka-chan. You need someone to pose for pictures, I'm your girl!\" Minako beamed, always happy to help a friend in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka was clearly relieved at Minako's energetic agreement. Letting out a small sigh of relief, Fuuka smiled and said \"Thank you, Minako-chan. I'll get everything ready when we're done here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Where are we gonna do this thing?\" Minako asked, curious as to what Fuuka had in mind. Her curiosity was piqued when Fuuka told her where to meet her.</span></div></div>",

The Naganaki Shrine was certainly a quiet enough place that they could work in peace, so Fuuka clearly put thought into the location. Minako didn't have to wonder too long, as she saw the other girl waiting for her as she ascended the stairs to the shrine. Fuuka's face perked up at the sight of Minako, and she quickly walked up to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, Minako-chan. Thanks again for agreeing to do this, it really does mean a lot to me.\" Fuuka quickly said, still clearly nervous about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of leader would I be if I didn't help out my friends when they needed it?\" Minako asked, still ready as ever. \"So, what do you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako now knew that something was up; Fuuka's cheeks took on a slight red hue as she avoided eye contact with Minako. Fiddling with her camera, Fuuka quickly began to explain her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never been happy with any of my photography. I mean, I get the technical aspects of it all, but I just can't manage to make anything decently artistic. So, I thought maybe I should try something new, something other than just landscapes and still life. I decided that maybe going way outside the box, I might find that artistic aspect I just can't find. So, well, uh... I need you to, er, disrobe.\" Fuuka explained, her cheeks reddening with every word and the final part of her monologue said so fast Minako practically didn't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to... disrobe? You mean, like, pose in my underwear?\" Minako asked, feeling a little uncertain about agreeing to Fuuka's request earlier. Still, Minako wasn't one to go back on her word, and she did trust Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, no.\" Fuuka said, still refusing to look anywhere but at her own shoes. \"I mean all the way. I-I mean you won't be showing anything too private to the camera, we'll use strategic scenery to cover that! And I'll make sure your face doesn't appear in anything, nobody will ever know it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako really wanted to say no, the idea made her uneasy. Letting Fuuka photograph her naked? Out in a public place like the shrine? But Minako could see how much courage it took for Fuuka to even approach her about this idea, and Minako believed Fuuka's assurances that her identity and privates would be safe from the finished product. As much as she'd rather not, Minako's obligation to help her friends won through, and she found herself sighing in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Fuuka-chan. I'll do it. But only for you, and nobody hears about this, right?\" Minako asked, to which Fuuka replied with an energetic nod. \"Alright. So, where are we starting this? And where can I put my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can put your clothes in my bag. They'll be perfectly safe there.\" Fuuka said, gaining confidence from her friend's resolution to go through with her idea. \"So, I've got two ideas. The first one is to have you posing at the shrine itself; you know, look like you're praying or making an offering. The other would be for us to use the playground equipment over there. There's plenty of stuff there you could hide yourself behind, so we could have some creative poses there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing her options while starting to disrobe, Minako considered Fuuka's advice. It would certainly be a memorable experience either way, so it really all came down to personal preference. Flipping a coin in her head, Minako decided she'd go ahead and head over to-</span></div></div>",

She was really going to go through with it, letting Fuuka photograph her like this. While she was nervous, she was also slightly giddy. While she'd never tell Fuuka about this, this wasn't too far off from what Minako's little ritual entailed, minus the camera and the photographer and poses of course. Indeed, it was always the fear of suddenly finding herself with an audience that helped Minako feel so alive, but that was neither here nor there. Stepping up to the shrine, Minako instinctively began to go through the motions of prayer. The sound of the camera clicking helped remind Minako that this was anything but a routine visit to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea for a first shot, Minako-chan.\" Fuuka said, snapping a few more pictures as she spoke. \"I think that should be the general idea. Just go about doing whatever you'd normally do at the shrine, just forget about being undressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako didn't need Fuuka's advice, as she was going through the motions to try and make herself feel normal. She visited all of the shrine's fixtures, Fuuka revolving around her the whole time. Minako could only trust that Fuuka was keeping her more intimate spots out of most, if not all, of her photos, especially some of her more ambitious frontal shots. One in particular, of Minako as she pantomimed presenting an offering, had the naked girl somewhat nervous. Fuuka assured her that the top of the picture wouldn't reach her nipples and her hands blocked any view of the treasure between her legs, but Fuuka's assurances didn't make Minako feel terribly secure. She could only hope that Fuuka chose to develop the film somewhere other than the club dark room, just in case she made a mistake in one of the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were wrapping up the shoot, at least Minako figured there couldn't be too much more she could do for the camera, the moment came that signaled the night's change from unusual to disaster-in-the-making. It was the sound of footsteps, several pairs by the sound of it, heading down the street and towards the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, someone's coming!\" Fuuka gasped, herself not wanting to be caught doing something that could so easily be construed as obscene. Operating on fear instinct, Fuuka quickly put away her camera and picked up her bag. Minako could see that Fuuka was ready to bolt, her panic causing her to forget something the naked girl considered incredibly important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka, hold on, all my stuff is in your bag!\" Minako cried, hoping to remind her friend of the predicament she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta run! Come on Minako!\" Fuuka fired back in a quick whisper, her hand resting on her bag.</span></div></div>",

The intent was to keep the bag from catching, spilling, or anything else. A wonderful idea for someone who only needs to run away. A dreadful one if a spill is exactly what a dear friend needs. Fuuka's concern for herself and her gear left a pale Minako to bask in the artificial light surrounding the shrine while the crisp breeze teased her sensitive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps only grew louder, snapping the SEES leader from her mumbled prayers and sending her running towards the offertory box. It wouldn't be very hard to hide from the street if she ducked down behind it, but the milky white skin of her back could be seen if her interlopers were here to make a prayer. Anything else would have been preferable, but with the bell locked up for the night the only other hiding spots were the statues along the side of the box and the support beams behind them. They'd offer the same protection, but Minako would have to be on her knees the whole time, leaving one bad slip to expose her in more ways than one, and she could be seen from the sides. The box allowed her to lie down and focus on the world around her, await the moment when she could make her way back to the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako felt her heart sink. Even on the other side of the shrine, they could be heard as clearly as a gun shot. The group had stopped in front of the shrine, surrounding Minako. She'd have to endure this and hope they go away without approaching the shrine. Fortunately, they were still on the sidewalk, letting Minako rest easy for a moment. It was an opportunity to replay the night in her mind and figure out how this whole thing turned sour, or find some way to get out of this without hurting Fuuka's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Sorry Fuuka-chan, but I can't do it,'\" Minako mumbled to her imagination. \"'I'd love to help you, but Junpei-kun found out some creep's been taking secret photos of me. I don't think I should strip in public under these circumstances.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't I just say that? It's Fuuka-chan! I can talk to her about anything! She'd worry about me, forget about her photos, and we'd get ice cream to talk about solutions. All I had to do was tell my friend my...troubles. And then she wouldn't feel responsible if someone else posted other nude pics of me around school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes downcast, Minako continued, \"Maybe I wasn't such a good friend tonight, Fuuka-chan.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"D'you guys here something?\" one of the intruders called.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShut up, Minako!

She was less glad, however, that the intruders didn't seem to be walking away. Rather, their footsteps were slowing and settling around the shrine area, as if they weren't planning to leave any time soon. Minako heard the clicking of a lighter followed by the sound of a sharp intake of breath. Whoever was out there was apparently using the shrine as a smokers' hangout...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trembling high schooler could only wait, facing the ground and contemplating her situation. Here she was, naked as a jaybird, blocks and blocks away from the dorms, with who knows how many strangers so close they'd have an eyeful if not for the offertory box. She couldn't risk making another noise, lest her \"company\" fail to write it off as a dog again, so her only auditory comfort came in the form of eavesdropping on their conversation. It honestly wasn't anything special, just small talk, complaints about the workplace, their assessment of some of the women they knew (which didn't help Minako's comfort), and their thoughts on the newest episode of their favorite show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night wore on, Minako became more acutely aware of how cold Iwatodai could get in the evenings. Doing her best to keep from shivering, Minako tried to focus on something else; particularly, the feeling of the rough concrete on her sensitive skin. Usually the most of her skin touching concrete was her hands, and occasionally her feet, but her entire front side was a different story. In a way, the rough texture of the concrete against her soft flesh was almost... exciting. Minako's mind stalled for a second at that thought. Was she... was she getting turned on by this? No way, that would be ridiculous! She was just tired, and her mind was going weird places because of it. Yeah, that's the right answer, absolutely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the conversation between her uninvited company wore on and on, and Minako lost track of time. More than that, Minako lost track of her body's own condition, compromised as it was by the late hour and the chilly air.</span></div></div>",

Between school, social events, and Tartarus, all she wanted more than anything at that moment was to just curl up in her cozy, fluffy bed and sleep until the afternoon.  Instead, she was freezing her literal butt off on cold, rough concrete, unable to even scratch her nose out of fear that she would be spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered just bolting for it.  By this point, she was desperate enough that all she wanted was to get back to where it was safe and warm, even if that meant giving a bunch of strangers a little peep show.  After all, she might get sick if she stayed out here all night!  But just as she mustered her nerve to do so, something other than fear stopped her.  Both of her legs weren't moving at all.  They had gone numb from the cold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy waiting for so long, her body had succumbed to exhaustion and began to fall asleep.  Upon realizing that her legs were now as stiff and immobile as the surrounding statues of the shrine, it was as if a chain reaction had begun.  The rest of her body quickly followed suit, collapsing fully on the ground with a soft pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minako's senses slowly seeped away, she thought she could hear the strangers' voices in the distance.  She could only hope that she hadn't alerted them to her presence, especially now that she could no longer lift a finger to defend herself.  Mentally cursing her overall situation as well as Fuuka for leaving her high and dry, Minako soon lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely exhausted as she was, the next few hours passed in the blink of an eye for her.  The good news was that Minako had succeeded in keeping hidden from the other people, who soon left the shrine to head back home for the night.

While the average person might be confused at such a sight, Minako instead panicked as she realized she was face-to-face with a Shadow! Worse yet, as the rest of her body came awake, she realized that the prodding she was feeling all across her body was cold and ghostly, the feeling of the semi-corporeal bodies of Shadows! She was surrounded by Shadows, and they were callously touching all over her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" Minako shrieked, scrambling to her feet as she tried to get past the Shadows surrounding her. The dark creatures weren't going to let their prey escape so easily, however, as several of them reached out and grasped at her naked body. Thankfully for Minako, her experience with fighting Shadows had made her accustomed to their tactics and she was no stranger to eluding their holds. Of course, she was normally fully clothed and had a team of her friends there to help her, to make no mention of her Evoker and the myriad Personas at her disposal. As it was, Minako was naked and completely unequipped to deal with these monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Minako could hope to do was elude the Shadows until the Dark Hour passed, returning the world to normal and taking the Shadows with it. Of course, that would mean all the normal citizens out and about would revert from their coffins back into their normal forms. Depending on where Minako was when this happened, that could be incredibly inconvenient. Still, anything was better than being left at the mercy of the Shadows!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to get away from the Shrine, Minako quickly looked around in an attempt to take stock of the situation. Shadows normally didn't stray far from Tartarus, but tonight seemed to be a different story. While they weren't as prevalent as they were in the tower, the streets were absolutely filled with Shadows tonight! Being the only non-Shadow in the area that was still awake, Minako found herself the center of attention for the nefarious creatures. Just about every path available had Shadows to contend with, and Minako had no idea how far into the Dark Hour she was. Was she merely a few minutes away from a return to the real world, or had the Dark Hour just begun? How long would Minako have to run? Could she evade the Shadows for the remainder of the Dark Hour?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for what felt like an eternity, Minako was in the middle of a street littered with several dozen coffins, the questions were finally answered.</span></div></div>",

This particular Shadow was stronger than most of its brethren, not on the tier of the great and powerful Arcana Shadows that manifested when the moon was full, but still strong.

At the time, there were three others with it: one with a bow, one with some kind of sword, one that was \"there\" insofar as its presence could be felt, and one that was... different, human in appearance, but not quite right. Those four had proven dangerous, and the Shadows that dared stand in their way had been summarily destroyed. If left unchecked, these humans could prove dangerous to everything the Shadows existed for. This simply would not do, and the Shadow had contemplated ways to undermine the strength of these humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night had been a blessing for the Shadow, as it had learned a great deal from watching this particular human. Normally so dangerous and confident, it was now cowering in fear without its garments. Perhaps, if its allies could be brought to a similar state, their ability in combat would vanish? It wouldn't necessarily have to be during the Dark Hour, so long as the effect was psychological (and considering the human's behavior, it was safe to assume that this was the case). So, emerging from the swarm, this unique Shadow made its move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako watched in curious horror as a single Shadow emerged from the swarm before her. Rather than attack, however, it lifted up until it neared Minako's height. Once Minako and the Shadow were eye-level, a burst of pink light erupted from the Shadow and flew towards Minako, who covered her eyes in frightened anticipation. When she noticed that she was fine, however, Minako opened her eyes again. The Shadows were gone, and the night sky and moon had regained their proper hue. The Dark Hour was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, Minako couldn't believe her luck. The Dark Hour had ended before the Shadows had been able to do her any real harm. Heck, the only one that attacked didn't even seem to do anything! Now she just had to figure out how to sneak back to the dorm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Minako know, however, that the Shadow's attack hadn't been harmless. Indeed, even now Minako was under its control. The attack was similar to the technique Marin Karin in that it influenced the victim's mind. This attack, however, was more hypnotic, coercing the victim to fulfill certain objectives without even realizing it. These objectives, Minako and her friends would soon learn, were quite diabolical indeed: Minako was to strip herself and her allies whenever the possibility arose! As Minako stealthily made her way back to the dorms, the mental suggestion was already deciding on her first target:</span></div></div>",

Probably just thinking of ways to put the evening's events behind her, Minako rationalized. All this pondering was scoured from her mind as Minako was startled by the sound of movement. <i>Oh crap! Is someone awake?!</i> Minako thought, panicking at the thought. Thankfully, as the sound approached, Minako saw that the source was just Koromaru, SEES's canine companion. Said dog was giving Minako a decided confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey boy.\" Minako said, leaning over to scratch Koromaru behind the ears. \"You scared me there. I know this probably looks weird, but let's just keep this our little secret, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoromaru responded with an affectionate lick of Minako's fingers before turning around and walking back into the darkness, likely going back to sleep. Relieved that it wasn't one of the human members of SEES she had run into, Minako crept to her room and went to a much-desired sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning saw a much calmer Minako. Her escapade from the previous night notwithstanding, things were looking good. It was a Sunday, Minako had managed to get her schoolwork done earlier, and she didn't have any obligations for the day. The day was hers to enjoy! Happily heading down the stairs, Minako caught sight of Yukari on the couch in the lobby, her face buried in a magazine while Junpei fiddled with one of his games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukari-chan.\" Minako said, taking a seat beside her friend. \"What're you up to today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Minako-chan. To be honest, I don't have anything going on today.\" Yukari said, looking up from her magazine to address her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence, same here! What do you say we do something together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, alright!\" Yukari replied, a small smile appearing on her face. \"But... what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got a whole city to find something.\" Minako said, tapping her chin in thought. \"What do you say we...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, undetected with the exception of a <i>very</i> confused Koromaru in the dorm lobby, but there wasn't any risk of the dog telling anybody what he saw. Sneaking up the stairs, Minako quietly slipped into her bedroom, threw on some pajamas (a welcome change from being naked), and promptly collapsed onto her mattress. Convinced that all was well, Minako drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day saw a fairly upbeat Minako making her way down the stairs to the kitchen. It was a Sunday, meaning rest and relaxation, and Minako planned to take advantage of that. At least she would have, were her actions not being subtly manipulated by the Shadow's attack. Idly eating her breakfast, the energetic SEES leader subconsciously kept an ear out for Mitsuru. Sure enough, a few minutes after Minako started eating, the redhead in question descended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Arisato.\" Mitsuru greeted, searching through the cupboards before going about with preparing her own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Senpai!\" Minako chirped. \"Just the person I was looking for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Mitsuru asked, taking a seat at the table with her bowl of cereal. \"Is there something you need me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been thinking, we've got a free day today, right? What do you say you and me hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru went quiet for a moment, looking into her cereal bowl as if it held the answer to Minako's question. \"Well, I don't actually have anything scheduled for today. I was considering taking care of a few things, but... I suppose I can sacrifice a day for a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Minako cheered, hopping up from her seat. She wasn't entirely sure why, but a small part of her mind was convinced that having time alone with Mitsuru was a very good thing. \"Gimme a few minutes to think of what we're gonna do. This is gonna be great, Senpai, just you wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving a somewhat baffled Mitsuru behind, Minako skipped back up the stairs to her room to get ready. Along the way, she bumped into a very guilty-looking Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan... I, uh... I'm really sorry about last night. I panicked, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat if, Fuuka-chan.\" Minako said, waving away Fuuka's concerns. \"I'm fine, nobody saw me, and all's well that ends well, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure.\" Fuuka said, though still couldn't bring herself to look Minako in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive. I'll see you later, Fuuka. Mitsuru-senpai and I are gonna be hanging out today.\" Minako said, continuing on to her room. As she stepped in, she quickly set about finding a good outfit for the day. Minako had no delusions about being dressed as sharply as Mitsuru, but that didn't mean she had to just throw something on. Now Minako just had to find something proper to wear for a day at-</span></div></div>",

There were plenty of people, to be sure, but there were still plenty of places the two of them could sit in relative privacy.

Settling in just as the previews began, the two Gekkoukan students were ready for a pleasant few hours of cinema. At least, that had been the plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the previews began, a strange change befell Minako. Her expression shifted from cheery to somewhat nondescript, and her eyes seemed to glaze over as if she wasn't paying any attention to her surroundings. Mitsuru was too focused on the screen to notice this change in her companion, and even if she wasn't, the low light of the theater would have made the change difficult to discern. Regardless, Minako had come under the physical control of the Shadow's mental manipulation; a proper time and place had presented itself, and so Minako would be subject to the manipulation's will until her objective had been fulfilled. After this, the physical control would go dormant once more, waiting for the next opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the perverse objective of the Shadow's manipulation in the forefront of her mind, Minako enacted her plan by-</span></div></div>",

It was all for naught, however, as her body continued to move on its own. For a few long moments, Minako's hands made no move to either of Mitsuru's remaining articles of clothing. Instead, they seemed content to softly massage Mitsuru's legs, lightly squeezing her hips before gliding over to caress her thighs.

The Shadows knew it, Minako knew it, and Mitsuru knew it most of all. It had taken all the will to resist she had left to push Minako away. If Minako went at her forcefully, she could not possibly hold her back. It was all or nothing now- time to be aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako felt herself preparing to take action. \"Oh no...\" she thought. \"Mitsuru, I'm sorry about this!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You want me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were not a question. They were a statement, a soft whisper into Mitsuru's ear delivered with a satisfied purr. Mitsuru trembled as she looked into her teammates eyes. Her resolve was gone, and Minako knew it. There was no mercy or quarter in those eyes. Minako, seemingly a sweet and somewhat shy girl, was going to brazen get her senpai off in front of a hoard of onlookers as they both stood completely naked in an alleyway. And she, Mitsuru Kirijo, heir to a multi-billion dollar company and respected President of their student council, was going to meekly allow herself to be subjected to this humiliation without further protest. All because Minako had awakened something in the older woman, a passion Mitsuru never knew she had and did not fully comprehend. A desire, a hunger,to be controlled, put in the harsh mercies of this shameless creature her classmate had become. To feed that hunger was worth any price to Mitsuru, a fact she realized with no small amount of alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes locked on Mitsuru, Minako kissed the girl's neck, and then began trailing lower. Gently grasping the red head's arms, Minako pushed her hands behind her neck. Trembling, Mitsuru complied with the silent instruction, forfeiting any way to keep herself covered and effectively putting herself on display for the crowd. Minako played with Mitsuru's ample breasts, licking and pinching the hard nipples with slow tantalizing strokes. Then lower down, kissing a trail down Mitsuru's flat stomach, flicking her navel with the marvelous tongue Minako had employed so well, and down still lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shame of Minako's inner thoughts, the girl posed herself on her hands and knees, giving an excellent view of her butt and her moist folds all at once. Her tongue probed deep into Mitsuru's most secret of places. Mitsuru moaned loudly. With the same slow, agonizing probing she was administering to Mitsuru, Minako snaked her right hand behind her, sliding her fingers into her own opening. To the humiliation of them both, the audience documented the performance in meticulous detail on their cameras, practically blinding them with strobing lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru could feel it all building up inside, and could not find the strength to hold back the tide. Just as she was about to climax in front of the whole crowd, Minako withdrew her tongue and rose to her feet. Mitsuru was about to speak, whether in protest or relief was hard to say, when Minako's probing fingers began providing the stimulation her tongue had just abandoned. But it was a slow, measured stimulation, enough to keep the poor redhead on the edge without bring her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me.\" She said again. \"You want what I can give you. And you will do anything to have it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked at her in confusion, but her breath caught in her throat as Minako provided a modicum more stimulation to her nether regions. \"YES!\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll let me do whatever I want with you, whenever I want it, no matter how humiliating it will be to endure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you in turn will bring those gifts, and those humiliations, to all I desire, falling short only of true violence or death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what? I...ah-ah-ah-ah- YES, DAMMIT! ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO SAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, my dears, I think we have a contract.\" Minako smirked. \"Shall we seal it with a kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last feeble whimper from Minako's constrained personality and more half-hearted moan of protest from Mitsuru, the space between the naked girls vanished entirely. Minako found Mitsuru's lips, pushing the tongue she had used so marvelous on the lower regions to plunder the upper. At the same time, she wrapped her body tightly around Mitsuru. With a gentle push Minako's knee parted Mitusuro's legs. It took no time at all for their inner folds to embrace one another, Minako's hardened clit probing in of Mitsuru with desperate abandon. Both girls had been riding on the edge throughout the Shadow's speech. It took them no time at all reach a mutual climax, their bodies shuddering in rapture, their convulsions inspire additional orgasms to run through their naked forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, with the pair naked and coming down from high of their simultaneous release to smolder in the shame of actions, that the Shadow finally relinquished its will back to Minako. It had bound Mitsuru to its will, humiliated them both beyond all measure, and left them stranded naked far from home. It had been a good day. The two might have their suspicions about what had just transpired, but neither would be allowed to speak on the matter to anyone but each other. Doing so would inspire both of them to cease talking and perform a strip tease wherever they happened to be, with additional humiliating compulsions to follow should they persist in giving voice to the matter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru was recovering from what was easily the best succession of orgasms of her life when the crying began. It took her a moment to clear her head (and the spots in from of her eyes) and locate the source. It turned out to be close by indeed. Minako was still pressed up against her, hugging her fiercely, her knee (and more intimate parts of her anatomy) still pressed up between Mitsuru's legs. The girl currently had her face buried between Mitsuru's substantial breasts, mumbling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Mitsuru asked, still dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako raised her head, her face full of tears. \"Senpai! I don't know what happened! It wasn't me! I couldn't stop! I'm sorry! I don't know what going on!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apologies fell from her as freely as her tears, forming a garbled litany of pleas for forgiveness. The whole display was too much to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako.\" Mitsuru said, her typical air of authority reasserting itself for the moment. Her classmate sucked in a breath and fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it wasn't you.\" Mitsuru said softly. \"You don't need to be sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako let out something between a wail and a sigh of relief, again burying her face in her recent lover's breasts and sibbing softly to herself. Her embrace became all the tighter, but Mitsuru was not yet ready to disengage from the comforting hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...the most humiliating....\" Minako lamented again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush.\" Mitsuru said, cupping her chin and raising her face to eye level. \"We'll deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their mutual shock, the two shared a kiss. They were never sure afterward who initiated it, but their lips parted almost instantly. The gesture seemed so natural after what the pair had just been through that it took a moment for their bodies to register the bizarre circumstances under which they had fallen into each other's arms. The stunned silence lasted only a moment before the pair shared a slower, more hesitant kiss. In that moment the pair decided, long before either would articulate it in words, that something very good and precious had been discovered amongst the utter ruin the rest of the night had been, and that this precious thing would not be discarded so readily, circumstances be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mitsuru needed any reassurance that her Minako was back, the kiss provided ample proof. This was not the kiss of the deviant, aggressive creature that had systematically stripped the upper classman of her will and clothes. This embrace was soft, uncertain, timid, but tender and giving for all of that. Without even a flicker of resentment or resistance, Minako allowed Mitsuru to do what she was accustomed to do with her lovers- take control. She established the rhythm and the pace, and if she felt a momentary pang for the assured relentlessness of the Minako she had faced mere moments before, she found the somewhat innocent yet sweet mouth of the real Minako to be...quite pleasant all by itself. Given that the few lovers she had had until that time had all been men (biologically, anyway), this latest revelation both mystified and pleased the student council president.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh brought the pair back to reality. \"Look at em, boyos. Already at it again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.\" Minako squeeled. \"They watched us the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you run?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I think so? My legs feel a little whobbly, but...\" Minako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Mitsuru said, gently pushing Minako off her own naked form. \"Gentlemen! Did you like what you saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud chorus answered her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to see more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother chorus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can I direct your attention to those doors at the end of the alleyway?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one the mob turned. Mitsuru made a frantic gesture to Minako, who shook her head in disbelief as the pair fled down the other side of the alley. The front of the theater lay before them, a cop car parked out in the open. Mitsuru's bike was parked across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Mitsuru whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's sneak across the street!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My keys are with my clothes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako smirked, and slipped from the alley despite Mitsuru's protests. The buxom woman attempted to follow, but found a car hurrying down the street and yelped in response, her hands quickly attempting to cover what they could of her endowments. Her cry in turn drew the attention of the cop inside the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer! I can assure you that-\" Mitsuru began as the cop approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands in the air!\" The cop exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru blushed profusely, pulling her hands obediently away from her naked body and leaving herself exposed to the cop's lecherous gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up against the wall!\" the cop exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all a misunderstanding!\" She said as she obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it.\" The cop snapped. To Mitsuru's outrage, the cop proceeded to give her a complete pat down as if it were possible to conceal a weapon in her current state. The breasts, apparently, were an especially likely hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can have your badge for this!\" She hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your word against mine, honey bunch. Now, where's your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a motorcycle whirred in the distance, barreling down on them both. The cop gaped in shock, providing all the distraction Mitsuru needed to smashed him across the face. The man was unconscious before he could hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru stared at her classmate, riding proudly atop her beloved bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot wired. Duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....HOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Akihiko was bored, and I didn't feel like running a marathon that day. He's been teaching me useful skills.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'll have to thank him for that. After I reprimand him, of course. Move over.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gave a small pout but relinquished the driver's seat without protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where are we headed, Senpai? We...won't make it very far on a bike...like this.\" Minako observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't relish returning the dorms dressed like this either.\" Mitsuru said softly. \"Assuming we have a choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gulped. \"Y-yeah. So where are we going?\"</span></div></div>",

Shirakawa Boulevard is not far from here and will help fulfill all those needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have no money! And...like this?\" Minako queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an air of self-satisfaction, Mitsuru produced a slender credit card from a barely seen pocket of the vehicle. \"I like to keep a spare one nearby in case of emergencies. Though I was thinking more along the lines of robbery than a public tryst. As for our nudity...if any place is likely to look the other way, it will be a love hotel. They will just assume we are two lesbian lovers who get a thrill out of public indecency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blushed bright red. \"I see. So, you aren't going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contrary to what my actions tonight might suggest, Minako, I usually prefer to know ahead of time when an outing is actually a date, and I prefer to have several before I allow intimate contact of any variety. Also, I generally keep my clothes on while in a public place, and I greatly prefer to engage in any sexual behavior while I am not surrounded by jeering males photographing me in the midst of the act. For future reference.\" Mitsuru said in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Minako pressed firmly against her bare back Mitsuru could feel her body heat increase as a blush suffused her whole body. The red haired woman smiled slightly to herself. Oh my, this girl was going to be fun to mess with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to live this down, will I?\" Minako moaned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush. I'm only teasing. In retrospect it was obvious that some other force was controlling your actions. You have nothing to be ashamed of.\" Mitsuru said in a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But everyone saw me...saw us completely naked! Doesn't that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUSH. Yes, it bothers me. Mortifies me. At least you had the excuse of being under another's control. I...let myself fall to the advances of a shameless floozy for the promise of a little release! And the worst part is I enjoyed it!\" Mitsuru said through clenched teeth. \"I'm trying very hard not to think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shameless floozy?\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't, senpai. I...I don't know where I stand with you after all of this.\" Minako said. \"I don't know how you can stand me after all of this. Even if it wasn't my mind, it was my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it was.\" Mitsuru said. \"Perhaps...that's why I let it happen? You've always been sweet and innocent, Minako. Your personality belies your charisma. There's a reason you are the leader of our squad. I blamed it on my sexual desires while it was happening, but in retrospect I think the reason I did nothing to stop you is simple. I would do anything you ask me to, Minako. I put my faith in your leadership a long time ago, and I have never had reason to change that opinion. Where we stand is your choice, Minako. I was your friend before this, and I'll gladly resume that role if that is what you need to happen. If you want something more of me...I've never been with a girl, Minako-kun, tonight's encounter aside. But I think I can be do that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned for a long time thereafter. Minako stared at her senpai's naked back, watching the wind swish through her red hair in elegant tangles. Minako shivered a little. Although it was hardly cold for a Japanese Spring night, the acceleration and the constant rush of air across her bare skin was stealing away all her warmth. Minako pressed herself more tightly against her companion, laying her cheek on Mitsuru's shoulder and basking in the heat of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. Your hair smells nice, Senpai. You smell good, and your body is warm and soft. Right now that's all I'm asking you to be. We can decide the rest as we go along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor perhaps the first time that night, the pair found themselves blushing for reasons quite removed from their lack of clothes or the humiliating games forced upon them by errant Shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The few passersby were greeted with sight of two highschool vixens riding along on a motorbike, their young bodies on full display. While Mitsuru was somewhat correct that such sights were not unheard of on Shirakowa Boulevard, they were very rare and extreme even for the folk who frequented the district. And while no one was likely to call the police (the general understanding being what happens on Shirakowa stays there) that hardly meant the pair would not turn heads. Probably moreso, really. If the clientele of Shirakowa tended towards being circumspect with on another's affairs, it also attract a heavy dose of perverted men (and women!) who would not shy away from enjoying a free show when one was offered. It wasn't long after the pair had parked that they found themselves passing dozens upon dozens of leering faces and the occasional flashing camera. Covering their private bits (what little good that might achieve) and hurrying along the side walk was their only recourse, and yet the parade of grinning faces seemed to stretch around the block (more and more drawn to the commotion, like a hoard of zombie voyeurs). Minako looked like she might burst into tears at any moment, and even the assertive Mitsuru looked in agony by the time they fled into the hotel lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was horrible.\" Minako whined inbetween breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...well.\" Mitsuru said, quite winded herself from the trek to the hotel, the last several meters of which had been made in a dead run. \"I admit I did not think the street would be so...lively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure any other night of the week it would have been a ghost town. Its just tonight there has to be a throng, because clearly the universe wants us to be at the center of every sleazeball's fantasy tonight!\" Minako complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she recovered and stood up, Minako visibly winced in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, are you okay?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah. I'm fine.\" Minako said, blushing intensely under Mitsuru's suspicious gaze. \"Its really nothing serious. I...ummm...our little...performance at the theater...left me a little tender...down there...and your motorcycle vibrates. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Mitsuru said. \"I'm...glad it wasn't just me then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stared at each other, then burst out laughing. One thing Minako did have to admit. While having a partner in shame made the naked humiliation no less unbearable, it made the aftermath a little easier to cope with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mitsuru?\" Came a voice from behind the pair. Both girls froze in alarm. That voice, although full of shock and disbelief, could never hide the air of disdain and snobbery inherent in the inflection. No. Out of all the places, that man couldn't possibly be here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's Note: Mitsuru's (Ex) Fiancee is never given a name in the game itself. I've taken the liberty of picking something that sounds thematically appropriate and sterotypically upper class douche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair turned to see a well-dressed man with short black hair and a white suit, his nose upturned in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masterson-san!\" Minako almost screamed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic. What...what are you doing here?\" Mitsuru managed to choke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here, at this lovely hotel, to make reservations for my honeymoon.\" Dominic replied, glowering at the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your getting married. That's wonderful.\" Mitsuru said, flinching under his hard gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Now...to my earlier question. What in the name of sin are you doing here, with that common girl, without a stitch to your name. I knew the Kirijos were shameless, but this...\" He trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru bristled at the comment, but then seemed to deflate. Even...smile? Minako stared in puzzlement, then silently screamed when she found herself curling up next to her senpai in an overtly sexual manner. Not again, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dominic, you were right about me. Do you remember the last time we spoke?\" Mitsuru asked, the meek tone to her voice sounding quite alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I recall, it was when you broke off our engagement. Something to do with this bit of common filth, in fact.\" Masterson said, pointing at Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! And you were so very right! Consorting with commoners has led to nothing but trouble. Why, today do you know what she did?\" Mitsuru said, speaking like some high class gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Senpai! Don't tell him that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, she stripped herself naked in a movie theater, then stripped ME naked when I tried to protest, and proceeded to orally pleasure me until we were kicked out, and then brought us to climax in a back alley while a group of commoners watched our display! Can you believe it?\" Mitsuru said, chatting along as if nothing was strange, her body language perfectly casual. If not for the brief eye contact she made with Minako, a gaze that held the same wide eyed panic and shame Minako had felt when her own mind was held hostage earlier that night, Minako herself might have believed the performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Senpai! I'm so sorry! I know we can get through this! Just hold on a little longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As...appalling as that ghastly little tale is, I believe every word of it, Mitsuru. I warned you were headed for a bad end. I never imagined you would crash as hard as this...but I did warn you.\" Dominic said, moving past the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dominic, you were right. You were so very good to me while I was yours! I'm sorry I allowed this degenerate lesbian trollop to lure me away from the sweet, obedient wife you deserved. But please...can I apologize?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Mitsuru's eyes met again. The pleading look Mitsuru was giving her broke Minako's heart. She hoped she could somehow communicate all the absolution and understanding she wanted to convey in return. The Shadows had robbed her mouth of words, and eyes were a poor substitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your breath. There is nothing you could ever do or say to atone for the insult you handed me that day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Dominic! Please! Let me, and my new paramour, apologize and accept your stern retribution as penance!\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako felt butterflies in her stomach as Dominic slowly turned around. The look of unmitigated dread in Mitsuru's eyes implied she knew exactly what that meant, and did not like it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....a true apologize is not delivered while standing up.\" Dominic said slowly, a malicious smile spreading across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Mitsuru said, starting to go to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Outside! I believe everyone will want to hear this.\" Dominic turned towards the night attendant. \"Sir, I believe you have certain...accoutrements available for...carnal games and the like? I require your stoutest paddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako now shared the terror in Mitsuru's eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru was screaming with every step she took back out of the Inn. Her body was completely out of her control, and seemingly all too happy to leave her ample charms on full display for everyone to gawk at. She could feel her large breasts swaying freely with every little motion, and there was a little bounce and wiggle in her butt as she moved onto the street. She was not only exposing herself, she was doing it so...gleefully! And worst of all, HE was seeing her this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru stewed in her own mind. Why did he have to be here? It was true that the Seaside Clamshell Inn was of late catering to a \"higher\" clientele than before. They had recently undergone rennovations and added a more gothic facade to their establishment. It was something of a joke on Shirakawa, really. The Clamshell still made the bulk of its income as a love hotel, afterall, which made the pretense of luxury seem absurd to any of the \"regulars\" in the area. Then again, if Mitsuru hadn't been mingling with the commoners, as Dominic had put it, she might have fallen for the ruse their advertising was attempting to accomplish. The added luxury had certainly settled her pick of places to lay low on the boulevard, but it appeared Dominic had bought the entire story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's heart was beating faster as she got to the bottom of the stairs and turned around to face him. Dominic was the worst kind of person. There was nothing romantic about their intended wedding. Mitsuru stood to inherit her father's company. Her youth and her sex made the Kirijo Group nervous, and in her grief Mitsuru had allowed herself to indulge in their insecurity. Dominic was a spoiled, petty little creature who just happened to own a company that would benefit the Group enormously if they could pull off a merger. The arranged marriage was something he had insisted upon, and Mitsuru continued to kick herself that she went along with the idea as long as she had. It was the overbearing insistence on his part that she would have to abandon her \"low class\" contacts in general, and her friendship with Minako in particular, that finally drove Mitsuru to break everything off. He had been insulting in every way possible, implying that women could rise to power in the corporate world by, in effect, using their bodies to sleep their way to the top. She had taken no small amount of pleasure in stomping over his pathetic little ego. In the process, she made it abundantly clear that she was rising in the business world through her shrewd intelligence and ability as a leader, and that she was never going to sell herself out for power. Her body was hers to give to whoever she chose, not the plaything of greedy corporate execs and certainly not something Dominic Masterson would ever get to see, let alone enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat memory was at the forefront of Mitsuru's mind as Dominic strode down the stairs with a pair of enormous paddles in hand, as she and Minako waited completely naked and smiling like a pair of Stepford Housewives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still standing, Mitsuru?\" Dominic said. \"A sincere apology can only be delivered on your hands and knees before the wronged party. Any book of etiquette will tell you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Mitsuru, to their complete consternation, immediately lowered themselves into a deep bow, pushing their bodies all the way to the sidewalk and sinking their foreheads all the way to the cold ground. In Japan this was the pose of one who had wronged another in the deepest ways possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't seem necessary.\" Dominic said. \"Pick yourselves up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the edge of one long paddle he pushed Mitsuru up, directing her to rise until she was on her hands and knees, roughly at the height of his waistline. Her breasts hung below her, swinging freely, and her butt was fully exposed to the crowd. Minako was made to assume the same position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen! Would you care to aid these ladies in making proper penance?\" Dominic pointed at two burly men in the crowd, holding out the paddles. \"Wonderful! Now then, I have no intention of keeping track of her punishment. So, we will begin with a series of spankings. You will both keep track of the number, repeating the number back for us. Then you may issue an apology. Tell me you are both sorry for showing me disrespect. I'm sure your words will eventually move me to forgiveness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Mitsuru were practically in tears. Dominic was a sadist behind closest doors, though Mitsuru mercifully had never acquiesced to his desire to 'discipline' her willful attitude. Or any of his pre-marital attempts to consummate their deal. He had already seen more of her tonight than she had ever been willing to show, and he was about to use her in ways she'd never allowed him to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer revere was interrupted by the smack of the paddle against her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! One! We're sorry for our disrespect!\" Minako and Mitsuru said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went. The two girls found themselves an island in a crashing sea of leering faces and flashing cameras. Their butt cheeks soon turned red from the barrage of spankings they were receiving. Each swap of the paddle inspired a brief exclamation from both girls, somewhere between a gasp of pain and a moan of pleasure. The reaction of their bodies was almost sexual, swaying forward and upward, their breasts bouncing everywhere, their faces flushed and gasping. One could easily imagine them bucking and gasping for a very different reason. Worse, the shadows had expertly filtered there own responses through the control they were administering. Neither girl was certain whether the clear enjoyment they were exhibiting from their punishment and exposure was a facade enforcement on them by their puppetmaster or an honest, as yet untapped passion found within themselves. But no one could deny the state of arousal they were left in afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that will do.\" Masterson said smugly. \"Good day, Mitsuru. I sincerely hope this...derangement of yours can be brought under control, and that this public disgrace will allow you to mend your reputation...if it can be salvaged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Dominic.\" Mitsuru said contritely, hating every word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nControl came back when Dominic was out of sight. The pair rose slowly, wobbling on their feet like new born deer. Everywhere they looked they saw grinning faces delighting in their humiliation. They meekly retreated into the relative safety of the hotel. The clerk at the front desk smiled at them, taking in their nudity with a bemused smugness. Without prompting, he provided a package of ointment with their room key. Apparently tender bottom were not an uncommon occurrence here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence in the elevator was oppressive. The pair looked at one another, then decided the floor was still a more interesting sight. At last, they both drew in a breath. Minako was in agony. The humiliation for her had been awful, but for Mitsuru it was viciously and mercilessly personal. It was her fault Mitsuru was being manipulated, and so far their unseen master seemed intent on making the experience more hellish for her by tormenting her friends in excess of her own plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Minako.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my shame to bear. He...he had no right to make you a part of it!\" She said, her face downcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But! But if it wasn't for me...\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF I had controlled myself earlier tonight, I could have spared us both this...this embarrassment.\" Mitsuru said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....this isn't your fault, Mitsuru-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it certainly isn't yours!\" Mitsuru said, looking at her sharply. \"I'll hear no more apologies from you on the matter. Whatever did this to you is the one who deserves my anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" Minako said. \"....But if I can't apologize, you can't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the one in control of her body when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't your fault.\" Minako said firmly, crossing her arms. \"You didn't know what was wrong, and we don't know of a way to break these stupid trances except for waiting for them to get bored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilenced reigned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides.\" Minako said after a long pause. \"I-its kinda nice...knowing you can't resist me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked at her in surprise, then acquired a shade of pink. \"One instance hardly prove a rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So...so if I said...I wanted us to forget...about the plan, and...and use this hotel room for what its supposed to be used for...what would you say to that?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...this hypothetical?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to say it, Senpai?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I think I want to hear it, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine! This night has been insane! I've been exposed, humiliated, controlled, leered at nonstop for hours now, photographed doing things I never even imagine doing by myself let alone in public! I've had sex in the most humiliating way possible with a friend I...I admire and respect and...who I think is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met, who I can't stop staring at even now! And I'm scared, and ashamed, and helpless, and everything's twisted up inside of my stomach, and I feel like if I don't get any relief soon I'll go crazy! And my butt hurts! And your stupid motorcycle vibrated right on my clit the whole way here, and that damned spanking was also kind of exciting and...and your NAKED and HOT and HERE and I WANT YOU! W-what else do you want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice Mitsuru close the distance between them until the older girl enveloped her, her tongue exploring Minako's mouth an increasingly familiar and welcome sensation. Their hands were everywhere, exploring each other's bodies, remembering (mostly) to move gingerly over their abused backsides. For a long moment they basked in each other's warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-see, Senpai? Irresistible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't said yes yet, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, keep thinking it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips met once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mitsuru sighed in consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan, you understand what a love hotel is, correct? These rooms are normally rented by the hour. I've been able to stretch that period out a bit more (at an outrageous price) but even the longest time frame gives us limited window here.\" Mitsuru said with consternation. \"So, I admit, your tempting me. But we have time to makes some calls and get ourselves some clothes, or have another round of lovemaking. Not both. And, I'm sorry Minako, I've had enough humiliation tonight. When we're back out on the street, I want to be in some clothes. We can attend to...our other needs...afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked at her like a small puppy just denied a treat. Mitsuru sighed again, turned her back, and left the elevator. Minako grunted to herself and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She said. \"But if its all the same to you, Senpai, I'm going to let you make the arrangements. I'm getting a shower in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd attending to other needs, she finished silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru shook her head. This was, of course, the responsible thing to do. Hardly made it easy. In any case...who to contact. The Kirijo Group could help easily, but rumors would fly. Not the best answer, given her encounter with her ex who would no doubt spread his own rumors. No, best to keep it \"within the family\". Also, keep it female. Akihiko could be relied on to be discreet, but Mitsuru could never look him in the eye afterwards. Junpei...that thought would almost be funny if the idea of him learning anything about their circumstances didn't make her queasy inside. So then, who was left? Yukari, Fuuka, or Aigis. Of those, Fuuka was unlikely to be able to keep a proper poker face or invent a good excuse if any were to question what she was doing out of the dorms so late. Aigis was unlikely to bother with either. No, really, there was only one option. Yukari was clever enough to avoid attention and of all of them she was the most likely to have plenty of spare outfits to pick from. Mitsuru picked up the hotel phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako felt the water washing over her body, and sighed softly to herself. This was heaven. Better yet, the shower head was detachable! She was oscillating between teasing herself and washing off the sweat from her strange journey. While she sorely missed Mitsuru's embrace, this would suffice. And at last she could pleasure herself as wantonly as her body desired without the shame hanging over her head that her display was being witnessed and enjoyed by some creepy pervert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings.\" Came a voice behind her. Minako screamed and attempted to cover herself. What was going on now?</span></div></div>",

Wh-what are you doing here?! S-stop looking at me!\" Minako shrieked, her arms crossed over her body in an attempt to conceal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos, however, seemed to barely even notice anything wrong with what was going on. Indeed, even the water of the shower blasting onto him didn't seem to register as he stood there with his usual enigmatic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem? You didn't seem to mind letting your friend see you.\" Pharos asked in his normal high-pitched monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's different!\" Minako stammered. \"This better be really important, pal! If you poofed in just to ogle me, I'm gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Shadow.\" Pharos said, cutting off Minako's threat. \"You've fallen victim to a particularly nasty Shadow. That's the root of your recent troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's eyes widened at this revelation. This strange behavior did manifest seemingly out of the blue, only happening after the previous night's debacle. The Shadows didn't just leave her alone, then! Finally, something to work with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Shadow? Oh, I'm gonna kill it! Kill it dead! Where is it, Pharos?\" Minako asked, clenching a fist in a show of dedicated vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" was all Pharos said. \"I simply understand the nature of Shadows, not the location of every specific one. I simply felt I should explain the nature of your predicament, as well as its quirks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'quirks'?\" Minako asked, her voice trembling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos explained the general idea of the Shadow's manipulation to Minako. The focus on embarrassment and humiliation, the intention to spread it to the other girls in SEES, and the new restriction placed on explaining what had happened to herself and Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru!\" Minako exclaimed. \"She's calling for help! Whoever she's calling is bound to ask what's wrong! I-I've got to stop her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako hopped out of the shower, leaving a puzzled and somewhat amused Pharos behind, the strange boy disappearing shortly after. Throwing open the door to the bathroom, Minako saw Mitsuru spread out on the hotel room's bed, phone already in hand and clearly in the middle of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeba, it's Mitsuru. Listen carefully, Minako and I are in need of your help. We need two sets of clothing, anything you think would fit us, brought to the Seaside Clamshell Inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't take a genius to figure out that Yukari would be understandably confused about such a request. Easily confused enough to ask for an explanation. Minako couldn't let that happen! She had to stop that call! Frantically, Minako leaped at Mitsuru, hoping to knock the phone out of her hand before the Shadow's little trick could take hold.</span></div></div>",

The phone fell from Mitsuru's hand, who was likewise now as still as stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Mitsuru? I didn't get that. Really, what's going on?\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako slowly came back to life, like a tin soldier who's key had just been wound. She raised her hands to her face, staring at them as if she had never seen them before. She casually inspected the front and back of fingers, then moved her head one way and then the other, popping her neck in the process. She made a luxurious stretch, sighing in contentment to herself. She leered openly at Mitsuru, who had begun to stir on the bed. Then pair gave each other a good once over, exchanging sultry smiles with a knowing edge. Mitsuru extended one slender finger and cocked it in a gesture that said 'Come to me'. Grinning broadly, Minako crawled onto the bed, heading towards her Senpai with a predator look. Mitsuru adjusted her position and opened her legs wide. Minako began eating her out without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yukari?\" Mitsuru said, cradling the phone in one hand while cradling Minako's head with the other, pushing her further into her folds. \"I'm so sorry. Minako startled me and I accidentally knocked the phone behind some furniture. In any event, the situation is rather complicated and would take a great deal of time to explain. Also, at the risk of being paranoid, I believe we need to be cautious and not discuss such matters over a phoneline. You never know who might be listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....all right....\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, on further consideration let me clarify my earlier instructions. I will need THREE outfits rather than two. And we are not in need of clothing so much as swimsuits. Do you own any string bikinis?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...wow. Uh....yeah, a few. But most of them are a few years old now. I've...um...grown a bit since I bought them. Minako's about my size, and I doubt I could slip into one anymore without being in constant danger of popping out! And even then, they'd only just cover everything important. And your chest is bigger than either of us!\" Yukari said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem. Bring them, and if possible find some matching high heels for each piece. If there's one thing I have faith in it is your ability to accessorize for any occasion. I don't want to go into the business tonight, but I'll reveal this much- once the three of us are done here, I want to take a break after school tomorrow. Your participation in the matter tonight is absolutely vital, as is your secrecy on where you are going and what you are doing. In thanks for all of that, I'll be renting a private yacht. Let's have a little girl's night amongst the three of us!\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Okay. Just so you know, this is weird and I'm a little edgy by all the cloak and dagger stuff. But if its important I'm in. And yeah, the yacht sounds awesome!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Well I'll *AHHHHHH*!\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what was that?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stubbed my foot, dear. Didn't want to curse into the phone.\" Mitsuru said. \"See you soon! If you hurry you can be here before the Dark Hour. So...do hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up and then glowered down at a grinning Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little bitch.\" Mitsuru said in mock fury. \"You were waiting to give me your best performance just as I was hanging up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Senpai.\" Minako said. \"Its just so much fun rolling my tongue around inside of you! And I keep thinking about the theater when you screamed and everyone saw me licking you!! Oh, it was so embarrassing! It was almost as exciting as making you beg in front of all those people and then making us orgasm in front of all of them! I'm just trying to relive the thrill a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. So you'd rather have the other me here instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. She was fun to humiliate, but she's such a prude! No sex so you can talk on the fun? Really? Does she not know what multitasking is?\" Minako said, before returning her mouth between Mitsuru's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edmonds!\" Mitsuru said, again on the phone, her body quivering in time to Minako's licks. \"I'm going to need some help. Ran into some bad business tonight, and I had to leave my motorcycle parked in front of the Seaside Clamshell Inn. Have it picked up within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Good. I'm glad to &lt;ha&gt; hear &lt;ha&gt; it. Hmmm? No, I didn't say anything. Its a poor connection &lt;ha&gt;. Hmmm? Really? The movie theater? Our IDs AND clothes? Interesting. Is that so? My, what frivolous accusations people will &lt;ha ah ah ah ha&gt; make these days. Assaulting an officer? Never. All the same, let's pull our usual smokescreen measures to cover up the incident. Also, be a dear and get our best paralegals on the nudity laws in the city. Of course &lt;ahhhhhhhh!&gt; we weren't! What sort of degenerates do you take us for? But if the police insist on pressing charges, it will be helpful to have a proper case ready to refute them. I'm especially interesting in the &lt;Gaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!&gt; in whether the federal laws can technically be applied to this city. The island was artificial, after all. Technically that means the Kirijo Group owns the city. We should be able to decide when and how Japanese law is enforced. YES! I mean, yes, of course that's going to be a hard sell in court. But our legal team is the best money can buy, and we have about a thousand senators in our pocket. My point is, if our hand is forced, it should be doable. So make it doable! Goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stuck her head up. \"Awww...you mean the cops are never gonna arrest us? But I was looking forward to getting handcuffed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. But having to contend with a courthouse proceeding will make life too troublesome for the plan. And besides, my other half is a sheltered little rich girl who barely understand the intricacies behind ordering fast food. How long do you think we could last in prison?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point. Excuse me....\" Minako went back to work on Mitsuru's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem....Hello, Hidetoshi? Excellent! Listen, we need to call a student council meeting. I want to schedule an event for the morning assembly. A swimsuit competition, to be specific. Eh? Yes, its short notice. Beside the point. What? Now, listen here, Hidetoshi, I respect your opinion on the council, but I am the president. We meet when I need us to meet, and we discuss the business I want to discuss! Yes, Minako and I will both be there. Wouldn't miss it. Good, I'm glad you understand. Yes, of course we will vote on the matter. Really? I have reason to disagree. I believe that despite the short notice, our fellow council members will see things my way without much persuasion. I believe Minako and I will make an excellent case for ourselves. Good bye.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeeeenpai.\" Minako said. \"I don't want to wear a dumb old bikini. It covers up all the good bits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh. We can't make nudity legal overnight, Minnie-chan. Believe me, having to ride the morning subway in a tiny little swimsuit will be plenty humiliating for all of us, especially if our fellow passengers decide to pluck one of those tempting little strings! And don't worry. I promise we won't be leaving in our bikinis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako sighed, like a child who didn't get its way. \"Is it really tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been assured it is absurdly small even for a bikini.\" Mitsuru assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So what's the plan when Yukari gets here?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? We make her one of us.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww! I have an idea. Remember that time in the Love Hotel Dark Hour? Yukari and I ended up making out a little before 'other me' decided to spoil everything by snapping out of it. So I think its time to figure out how that little fantasy would have played out if Yukari and I had been a bit more into the 'fun'. We're seducing her in the shower! This is not a request.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru snickered. \"You are our leader afterall. What can I do but obey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never forget it.\" Minako said. \"Temptation-sama expects results, and it is my duty to deliver on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't just the secrecy. That was par for the course where Mitsuru was concerned (although Yukari had thought by this point that the Kirijo heiress had moved beyond the need to be evasive about Kirijo operations around her teammates...that stung a little). No, the whole conversation had just been...weird. The sudden silence on the phone, the complete about face in her instructions, the oddity in the items she was carrying with her...even Mitsuru's voice had been off. Not in the sense that it was someone else speaking, Yukari was quite certain it was her friend on the phone. It just sounded...deeper, softer, playful...sultry? Yukari shivered. It made no sense, but it sounded so sexually charged. As if every word were heavy with secret innuendo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer destination had not eased her worries in the slightest. This part of town was fairly rundown anyway, slipping ever closer to becoming a slum year by year. The street lights felt like they were spaced farther apart here than anywhere else in the city, and the shadows (the mundane ones, that is) between somehow felt deeper. Iwatodai City was supposed to be an ultra modern metropolis, and yet the architecture had a noticeably Gothic character to it (was it the city that had inspired the look of Tartarus, or was Tartarus' leaking into the dreams of the city designers?). With the city completely claimed by night as it was, the whole atmosphere was disturbing. Nothing like the Dark Hour, of course, but it gave Yukari pause nonetheless. In truth, it was only the proximity of midnight and the inception of that unnatural 13th hour that pushed Yukari forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one last reason for her hesitation. Although it was arguably the least pressing of her concerns, Yukari found herself focusing on it nonetheless. It was here, on this gross little boulevard, that she and Minako had shared their first (and as yet, only) kiss. The circumstances had been intensely awkward. During the night of the full moon a powerful shadow had lured them into a twisted version of a love hotel on the boulevard. There were in fact two shadows roaming the building, something no one was aware of at first. In the battle that followed Akihiko and Junpei were severely injured and had fallen unconscious. In a way, what followed might have been easier if they had been present. Yukari was naturally weary of men. By default she associated them with the skeevy company her mother liked to keep. If it had been a man waiting in the bed, Yukari was fairly certain she could have broken free, probably delivering a slap to her would-be lover in the process. But Minako...the second shadow had used a powerful magic to cloud their minds. Yukari had been led to undress and enjoy a hot shower. Minako was in the room adjacent, getting filled with thousands of lusty whispers. Minako was her best friend, the girl who knew all her secrets and helped her through her worst days. Minako was safe, caring, and honest. Why should Yukari care if she had nothing on around Minako? Why would she be afraid of a little kiss? The night had been so long, and her body was aching SO much, and Minako was so pretty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had broken free. But not as quickly as they might have. Not in time to avoid the kiss. Not in time to feel those soft lips, to taste the cinnamon on the lip gloss, to feel that tiny spark of delight as their tongues danced around one another. Not in time not to feel her little fingers running along the edge of Yukari's thigh, curling up underneath the towel to squeeze her round cheek playfully. Certainly not in time for Yukari herself to drop the towel, lean forward and guide Minako's hands to her waiting breasts, aching and demanding attention, or to emit a little gasp as Minako gently played with her nipples. It was Minako who stood up, took a step back, and shouted her name. Yukari had stood there, divorced of even her towel, realization dawning on her face. There was no slap, only a blush and an awkward apology and a race for her clothes in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither had talked about the incident since then. Minako was clearly as embarrassed by the happening as Yukari had been. And yet it was still etched in Yukari's mind. As nervous as she was about dating, the thought of being with a girl had never really crossed Yukari's mind until that incident. It...had felt good. And yet Minako was her friend, in some ways closer than a lover. Certainly she had admitted things to her Yukari doubted she could ever say to someone sharing her bed. And Minako had shown no interest in pursuing anything but a friendship. So they had moved on, and if the thought of stealing a second kiss from Minako or experimenting with another girl had occasionally wormed its way into Yukari's brain, she had always been happy to stuff it into the closet in the deepest part of her brain and bolt the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, the boulevard was not a place she wanted to be tonight. She had strong memories of the place, some of them bad and some of them...not, but all awkward and embarrassing! By the time she had walked up the step (past the unusually large gathering of grinning men who looked at her in a way all too much like men looked at her mother) Yukari was a bundle of nerves and anxiety. She moved past the night clerk (who smiled in a very disconcerting way when she mentioned the room number!) and took the elevator. The door on the right was a big, red door with a little welcome matt. Yukari breathed in hard and raised her hand to knock.</span></div></div>",

Mitsuru-san!\" Yukari squeeled, turning around in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was dressed in an expensive looking leather trenchcoat wrapped tightly around her body. She had decided to make a few more phone calls that night, collecting some weapons and equipment from the group who were picking up her bike. Of course, she had been sure to shamelessly flaunt her body in front of the delivery personnel, shaking her charms and even offering a kiss on the cheek to one particularly flustered worker. Soon rumors of her impropriety would be spreading across the city! Even now, she was entirely naked beneath the coat save for a pair of boots, but that was not obvious from the outset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako whirled around, covering herself and letting out a scream. A little overly dramatic, but convincing enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing, Yukari?\" Mitsuru demanded. \"I leave the room for a few moments to attend to our provisions, and I find you staring at your fellow students?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- No! I thought I heard my name-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE! I will accept no excuse!\" Mitsuru said, brandishing a rapier at Yukari's neck (another collected bit of equipment).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Senpai, don't-\" Yukari squeeled, backing into the bathroom. Minako let out another scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a misunderstanding!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I would tolerate no such behavior as peeking on other students from either Akihiko or Junpei, Takeba.

I mean, I saw you on accident, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Minako moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept my eye on you ever since the love hotel incident, Yukari.

Take it off yourself, or watch me cut it apart one piece at a time. The longer you hesitate, the more I'll cut.

And yet, what could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari took off her ruined coat. Her white undershirt was next, and it seemed to take an agonizingly long time, her fingers fumbling with each button.

I remember that night in vivid detail, Yukari. I remember the kiss. I remember how warm and alive your body felt. I remember breaking the spell just as I started taking off my clothes. I remember how my head couldn't decide whether to be relieved or regret that things didn't go further.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...why are you telling me this?\" Yukari asked in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to understand, Yukari-chan. I never thought I could have such dirty thoughts about anyone, let alone my best friend. But they keep on creeping in! I'm sorry, Yukari. But I can't stop thinking of you that way, so warm and passionate with your beautiful body standing in front of me. That's why I was fantasizing about you just now.

Do you...do you ever think of me the way I keep thinking of you?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stared into Minako's big hazel eyes for a long time. She didn't find any hint of the deception there...the Minako locked away from the party was feeling just as vulnerable and curious as her words implied. Her doppleganger had been exaggerating...but not by much. Minako fantasized about Yukari very often, even if she felt ashamed of it afterwards. She wanted to know Yukari's answer as much as her other half (though for very different reasons). And alas for poor Yukari, that need to know reflected in Minako's eyes. She couldn't lie to her even if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know if I would have looked away.\" Yukari said, blushing with shame. \"And yes, I do think of you that way. Sometimes. Maybe...a lot of the time. I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari hung her head. Minako gave a little 'tsk' and crawled over to her naked friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not angry, Yuka-chan. I just...want to see you. Please, show me your pretty body again. I think about it all the time. I...miss it.\" Minako begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari took a moment to realize she had stopped breathing. Her head was swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want...\" Minako said softly, positioning herself on the floor. \"We can have a more even exchange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..what do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You interrupted me. I wasn't done.

She was already suspicious of Mitsuru, and Minako hoped she could sense something off about her as well. Soon she was going to slap Minako across the face, or bolt for the exit, or do something to resist. And that was when they could turn the tables. At least, Minako hoped so. Personas were supposed to be a living projection of the inner self. It took a supreme act of will to manifest one (though the Evokers helped), and there was no way a Shadow could use her Persona while there was even one little sliver of her will free to resist their efforts! And Yukari's own power could easily subdue them both if they had no magic of their own to counter her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, Minako hoped so. It sounded a little desperate, but it was the best move she could hope for right now. Yukari just needed to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako watched in shock as Yukari took in a deep breath, lowered herself down to the tiled floor, and spread her legs wide open her feet folded up beneath her. To Minako's shock and awe, she began slowly to massage her inner thighs, running her hand over her folds. Minako blushed as she felt herself assuming the same position directly across from her, pantomiming her gestures with her right hand, sending unwanted jolts of pleasure through her body as she manipulated her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Yukari, don't fall for it! Its not me! You don't have to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, her words never came out. Minako was the girl with the Wild Card, that rarest of Persona users able to manifest a manifold of Personas in any situation. How such a talent could exist was anyone's guess- perhaps her mind was such that she could adjust to any situation, be anything she desired to be? No one knew for sure. And while her combat abilities were devastating as a result, there were more subtle aspects to the magic as well. One such was her ability to grow stronger through the bonds she forged with her peers. This might be an aspect inherent to the Wild Card, or perhaps the Wild Card could only exist in humans prone to forming and nurturing a plethora of relationships. Up until now, Minako had never thought of the full implications of her power, or her personality. Her bonds were her bonds, her comrades were all dear to her and she would do anything to protect them. Coercion and manipulation did not come naturally to the outgoing and friendly girl, so it had never occurred to her that she might be able to abuse the relationships she had cultivated. Certainly it had never dawned upon her that her comrades had grown, inch by inch as the year progressed, so very close to her that she could ask them to do anything. And yet, first with Mitsuru and now Yukari, that terrifying truth was becoming evident. The bonds with her friends had become so tight that they were now chains...and the Shadows were not afraid to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan! Don't! Look at me! See me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's fingers parted her folds, while her free hand began to play with her breasts. She stared at Minako intently...lustily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! No! Don't see me like that! Stop looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's panic showed no trace in her actions, where her own folds were partly and her own fingers began to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh god. That feels good! Oh! Dammit, why wow! Why is 'other me' YES! so much better at this AHH! than I am? No! Stop! Don't look at AH! at Yukari like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Minako's eyes were obeying a different master, and she stared with lusty intensity at her friends beautiful body wantonly displaying itself before her. Their fingers were moving in time with each other, each deliberately mimicking the other, as if the pair were connected to one another. It was easy for each to imagine the other sliding her own digits into those hungry folds, playing and thrusting and manipulating to the inevitable release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This is not happening! I am not enjoying watching my friend play with herself! I am not enjoying the attention she's giving me! I don't like being naked, or being humiliated, or any of this! I'm not going to cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's whole body arched back and gave a little spasm as her fingers continued to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO ONE ASKED YOUR OPINION!\" Minako mentally screamed at her body, even as she outwardly moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari sat perched in front of her school mates, her legs folded up beneath her and parted in a wide 'V'. Her right hand was busily plundering her inner folds, her left playing with her ample breasts. Every few moments she let out a soft gasp, her body convulsing a little under her caresses. In those moments her back would arch, her breasts pushing out in a quivering and lusty display, and her head would lull to the side with her eyes closed and a breathless smile on her face. Then her eyes would open, and she would look at Mitsuru's smirking, malicious face or Minako's encouraging lustful stare, and all at once she would shrink back in on herself, hiding her breasts and pulling her limbs closer as if to cover up. Then with a blush she would open her legs again, and thrust her fingers back inside herself, her body trembling with shame and a hint of determination. Her inner turmoil was obvious, the lust and the shame creating a strange little dance of gyration, half her instincts telling her to hide her body and the other begging for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was struggling with her own conflicts. Outwardly she was the picture of the disciplinarian and the slave driver, her hands crossed over her ample breasts and her eyes locked on Yukari. She made certain Yukari knew she was being stared out, and the look of smug contempt she gave her every time the embarrassed girl said all she needed to say. Yukari's performance was being watched, and judged, and every little jolt of pleasure her body felt was more confirmation that she was a slut. Or so Mitsuru's alternate intended to convey. Her inner thoughts were quite different, or much more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at her. It has to feel so surreal. Only a few moments ago, you had your clothes and your dignity. Life was normal. And then this...this little imp with the face of an angel and the body of a vixen half-pleads and half-forces you to strip off both of them. And lost in a haze of confusion and lust...you let her, before you even understand quite what you are doing. And it has to be even worse for you, Yukari-chan, with me to play bad cop on top of it all. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Mitsuru came from different worlds. Mitsuru had wealth, ambition, and an upbringing so lavish it was almost alien to her fellow classmates. Yukari was a typical middle class girl, struggling through school and dealing with life as it came. Their early relationship was not good- Mitsuru treated and all too often thought of her fellow students more in the abstract than anything else, and even her fellow SEES members were just pawns on a chess board arrayed against the Shadows. Yukari, for her part, was jealous and vindictive about Mitsuru's status and aloofness. The thaw came in time, as Mitsuru gradually opened up. Yukari in turn learned to forgive Mitsuru her at times cold nature, realizing it was a combination of the burdens she was shouldering and a general ignorance about the outside world that was frankly embarrassing for her to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear that they were, in fact, kindred spirits. Mitsuru had gained her power at a young age, and had pledged to atone for her family's sins. Yukari had a more personal familial atonement. With her father dead, her mother had shamelessly pursued one empty relationship after the next all in the name of not being alone. Both women desired to be strong, powerful, and self-sufficient in every way. This was an uphill battle for a female in Japanese society, and the level of harsh discipline and aggressive determination it required showed in their outward demeanor. Neither accepted help easily, and both had an aggressive hate for signs of inner weakness. And yet that hid a depth of compassion- something that came out over their time together. When Yukari had to face new revelations about her father's death, it was Mitsuru who helped her back on her road. And when a betrayal ended the life of Mitsuru's father, it was Yukari's chance to return the favor. In their ambitions, their pain, and their dreams Yukari and Mitsuru were two halves of one coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they had another thing in common. All they had sacrificed to be themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did we deny ourselves, Yukari-chan? How much contact did we avoid in the name of old promises? We've had our share of admirers, haven't we? And yet, we stay single. No dates, no boys...or girls. Even the act of pleasuring myself was vile. Such things were beneath Mitsuru Kirijo! No matter how many sleepless nights it might cause. I threw myself into my studies and my swordsmanship and my role as a shadow-hunter. You always seemed much more normal than me...I still envy that. And yet in your own way it was the same, right? Love and sex were just extra attachments that would make you weak...dependent on someone else. And seeking pleasure was for perverts, anyway. Right? Oh, Yukari, what have we done to ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Yukari give in was like a mirror of herself mere hours before. Her clothes discarded, her body before an audience, her head spinning in a fog...and subjected to the most insistent, delicious pleasure she had ever known. Mitsuru was watching, helplessly, as Yukari walked the same treacherous path, giving in a little at a time, that culminated in Mitsuru's current enslavement. She remembered vividly being caught in that stalemate between deep shame and desperate need. The libido she had neglected for years was suddenly and voraciously awakened, reveling in every sensation and glorying in every eye cast upon her. And her equally carefully cultivated pride was drowning in a deep sea of embarrassment. And the worst part, by far, was her poor neglected body. It had never felt more alive! It was reveling in the emotions and the adrenaline her emotions were pumping through it. To her everlasting mortification, Mitsuru had enjoyed her humiliation, had reveled in the sheer and utter abandonment of decency, sanity, and control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reveled now, vicariously, in Yukari's downward spiral. Underneath her coat, her sex was wet and throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can beat them, Yukari! I know it! You know more about the world than I ever will, books be damned. Your falling into this trap...but you can still get out. If you can just see what I didn't see...But...If you fail...No hard feelings. I would even...NO! I can't think that way! Yukari is my friend. My teammate! She's...who I can talk to...about things I could never say to Akihiko or Minako. She doesn't deserve...none of us deserve...but can get through it. Carry each other's pain. And embarrassment. She's...very cute when she blushes. They both are. I wonder if Minako can make her cum as hard as I...STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru heard herself laugh. She had a moment to wonder if the other her was privy to her thoughts. Then her hands were moving, undoing her trenchcoat, tossing it aside to join the others in wanton nudity. Her breasts were large, the pink nipples painfull erect. With a few steps she was next to Yukari. With a another motion the big breasted girl was practically enveloping her as she knelt behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai??\" Yukari squeeked, as a scowling Mitsuru pulled her hand away from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you could cum, Yukari-chan. This is a punishment, after all.\" Mitsuru purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo. Senpai, please! That's way too cruel!\" Yukari pleaded, evidently close to release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....perhaps I can show a little mercy. Minako-chan, I've decided Yukari cannot be allowed to finish herself. I'm willing to let you help, though, if Yukari will accept it? I'll even split the work with you...you take the bottom, I'll handle the top half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha??\" Yukari said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm. That sounds like fun. What do you say Yukari-chan?\" Minako purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru felt her heart beating faster. This was the moment of truth. Yukari had one chance left. If she didn't realize the ploy, the pair of them would surely trick her into begging for servitude just as they with Mitsuru. And caught up in the frenzy of hormones as she was, Mitsuru had no idea which outcome she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pease forgive me, Yukari-chan. Its all up to you now...\" Mitsuru said silently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all seemed so hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari was sitting on the tiled floor of the Love Hotel's bathroom. Her legs were parted as wide as the limber girl could manage, her pussy (soaked through and through with her juices) lasciviously presented to her classmate, her back arched and resting against her Senpai (the older woman's large breasts practically serving as a pillow for her head) while Mitsuru's hands busily played with Yukari's own perky nipples. Yukari gasped and her whole body shuddered in restrained delight as Minako's soft lips made contact with Yukuri's waiting clit. It was a complete and utter surrender to the sweet pleasures and harsh disciplines of the two women now playing with her body, the crowning achievement of her desires and her utter shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interruption was brief, but telling. Yukari gasped and flailed in surprise, toppled Mitsuru and narrowly avoiding kicking Minako in the face in her shock. She scrambled about on the still went floor, coming to a stop in the dark and looking around in the confusion. The world was almost completely black, save for a sickly green glow coming from the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark Hour.\" Yukari whispered after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was close by.\" Mitsuru said with disinterest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" Yukari said, struggling to clear her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway....\" Minako said somewhere in the darkness. \"Let's continue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yukari said. \"But..we had a mission, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get out of your punishment, Takeda?\" Mitsuru said with disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But...I mean...is it even SAFE here?\" Yukari asked. \"This is where that big shadow manifested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pick the strangest times to worry about such things.\" Mitsuru said, shaking her head. \"We've kept a careful eye on this area. No shadows should threaten us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...then why are we even here?\" Yukari asked. \"Did...did you two PLAN all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Yukari? Deflecting blame? I expected better of you.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here! In fact....there's no way...you would ever lie about a mission. Or blow a mission off just to...to have sex! You both know how dangerous the Dark Hour is! You would never...unless...the shadows already got to you!\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's completely absurd.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not! Shadows messing with your head and get you obsessed about sex? That's not only possible, that's EXACTLY what happened to me the last time I was here! You both KNOW that! Oh my god-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari...\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that hard...to believe that I want you?\" Minako asked, with a trace of hurt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no.\" Yukari whispered. \"But...but...you aren't acting like you, Minako. That love confession was the only thing from you that sounded at all genuine. And Mitsuru-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me, Yukari?\" Mitsuru asked softly. \"Is it really that hard to believe? You and I have fought a thousand battles back to back. I've told you things I would never dare tell another soul. You've became my family when my father died. You've been closer than a sister to me this past year...I trust you with my life, and I would do anything to protect your well being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari drew in a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your as close as a lover to both of us already, Yukari. You have been for a very long time. So why bother with the distinction? If your going to feel the pain that goes with it, if your going to suffer because we suffer...why not get the fun out of the attachment too?\" Mitsuru said, smiling in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" Yukari began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have personal trainers, Yukari. Fencing, physical fitness, diet specialists...a complete entourage dedicated to keeping me fit and attractive. And yet, you keep to your own routine, pick out your own clothes, maintain your own diets. What I would utterly fail at without a guiding hand you do every day by simple force of will. And where I stay silent and accept you have no fear of speaking your mind, sometimes viciously! I've always admired you, Yukari. Your personality...your body. Lately, its become more than that.\" Mitsuru said. \"Please believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...I do.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a pair of arms embrace her in the dark. And like lightning she pushed them both away and bolted for the door. Her clothes law just out in the hallway. Her invoker lay hidden within the pile. As she felt around on hands and knees for the tell tale solidity of the weapon, she felt hands grasping at her, no longer with any hint of gentleness. She felt herself being pulled away, just as she got a firm hold of the gun. A shot went out in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world exploded around her. The windows of the hotel room shattered outward. Papers, clothes, and even furniture began to spin around the room the sound of a harsh gale thrummed in the air. Mitsuru and Minako found themselves pinned against the wall, a minature hurricane making it impossible to move. And at the eye of that storm, illuminated in the pale green light of the Dark Hour, stood the naked form of Yukari Takeda, a glare of determination on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe it, Senpai. Which makes this really hard, because it means you two aren't just shadows that look like them. You have their memories and their emotions, too. But you definitely aren't them! There's nothing good or kind about either of you! Its all manipulation and lies! So who the hell are you? What do you want? Tell me what I want to know, and get out of their heads RIGHT NOW! Otherwise....I swear I'll rip Tartarus apart brick by brick to find you, and there won't be anything left when I'm done!\" Yukari screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stared. Then laughed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE HELL IS SO FUNNY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Yuka-chan.\" Minako said in a syrupy tone. \"Its just I've never been so hot for you as I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT THE HELL UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, she means it. Neither of us has ever seen you quite this angry before. You look very fuckable right now.\" Mitsuru said with a smile. \"And believe me, that's not just us saying that. Your two girlfriends agree completely, even if they're two cowardly to say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem pretty smug for someone who's been found out.\" Yukari said, advancing on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your hardly going to harm us. Not if you want to avoid hurting your friends.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well, here's a question. An invoker is basically a tool that breaks through the mind to unite the conscious with its persona, right? You always said it wasn't very effective if used on another person rather than yourself. But I wonder...\" Yukari said, moving closer to Mitsuru and pressing her mock pistol against the older woman's temple. \"How good a hold do you have on Senpai's brain right now? Think you can keep a firm grip if I pull this trigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I have absolutely no idea.\" Mitsuru said with perfect honest, a sentiment the original echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I take it back. NOW I've never been hotter for you.\" Minako said, a little awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru, if you're in there, sorry ahead of time. This is probably gonna hurt. But I'm getting the impression your puppet master is not gonna cooperate with me here or let go on her own...and frankly she's been a huge bitch all night long. Plus I kinda owe her for what she did to my ass earlier. So here goes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as a soft, soothing whisper, compelling yet sinister. Yukari whirled around, only to be confronted by a figure decked head to foot in a vast black cloak. Her eyes widening, Yukari raised her Invoker to her head with a trembling hand. From inside the darkness of the cloak two pinpoints of pink light glowed, then a beam of energy shot forth and struck the naked girl. With a gasp she staggered back, her head instantly woozy. She attempted again to raise her gun up, but found herself dropping it instead. Dizzy and dismayed, Yukari stumbled. Two arms caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari!\" Minako called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Mitsuru asked urgently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys...\" Yukari muttered. \"Your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have given them back their minds, for the time being. Their bodies still belong to me. As does yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like....hell.\" Yukari said, only to yelp in surprise as all three sank to the floor in a humble bow. \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Mitsuru said on her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its all my fault.\" Minako spoke up on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let us go right now!\" Yukari said impotently, blushing madly to be completely naked and on all fours in front of an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked figure ignored the three, gesturing about the room. The broken glass and disarrayed furniture began to right itself, sealing up and returning to its original condition. With a second gesture, Yukari watched with a sense of panic as her clothes burst into ash and bluish flames that gave off no heat. All the three had left to their name was her supply of skimpy bikinis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked a question, Yukari Takeda. I will give a partial answer. My purpose and my name are one. I am Temptation. I am the whisper of every forbidden desire in every human ear. And I want what you want. An end to the Dark Hour, and the prevention of the Fall.\" The thing spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stared in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well, this recent setback notwithstanding. So, have your minds free. Welcome your new arrival into your midst in a way that will please me. The morning shall offer new delights and shames for you all.\" It vanished as they stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's eyes widened as she rose to her feet, a pair of arms once more embracing her. She found her lips and hands moving without her approval, kissing and groping and touching everywhere. It was going to be a long night...</span></div></div>",

She reddened with shame as Theo, the handsome male attendant (and the brother of Elizabeth) gaped at her in surprise, only to get a little red himself and avert his eyes. Mostly. She could see him sneaking glances at her despite his apparent best intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Yukari asked lazily, her hand stroking Minako's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Minako began, noticing Theo pointing at the doorway while trying (mostly) not to stare. \"I think I have to...go take care of something here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.\" Yukari deadpanned, pressing herself up against her teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that!\" Minako said with a blush. \"I...Just...keep going and I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Like you can help it. We've all been helpless to stop ourselves for like two hours now. So- hey!\" Yukari said groggily as Minako somehow hopped out of bed. \"Since when can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh....I'm not sure, actually...\" Minako said. \"I guess...Igor can countermand the shadows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Mitsuru asked, poking her head up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one. Look, just..wait a minute, okay? I'll be right back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako bolted for the doorway, covering herself as she ran past Theo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...did...she just disappear?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....This...isn't the first time I sensed something strange about her. Certain phenomena seem to congregate around her like she was magnetic. But...I don't think this one is dangerous.\" Mitsuru said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So...its not just us, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That get drawn to her.\" Yukari clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. No. No its not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the weird part? If they'd gone after me first, I'd be fine. Pissed, but pretty okay. I'd want to murder 'Temptation-sama' or whatever his name is, but the fact that she was the original target? I don't want to kill him...I want to destroy him. Like, tactical nuclear strike on Tartarus kinda destroy. I want him to live just long enough to regret even looking at her forever.\" Yukari muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We feel the same way.\" Mitsuru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we? Its not just this shadow. That's...what I feel whenever I think of anything that might hurt her. Or anyone who might get in the way of her and me. It...it kind of scares me, Senpai.\" Yukari said softly. \"And I feel it stronger than ever after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that include me, Takeda?\" Mitsuru asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...I don't know.\" Yukari said honestly, looking at the naked older woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...until yesterday, I would never have thought I could enjoy being with a woman. Or making love in public. Anyone else, man or woman, would have suffered my wrath for even suggesting such a thing. Yet I did it, of my own free will, for her. I can't imagine anyone having that kind of pull over me. And until tonight I couldn't imagine anyone I would yield to regarding her. But I would for you.\" Mitsuru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was mostly a lie, what my other self told you. But I did know about you and Minako. Suspected, anyway. I promised myself not to say anything so it would grow on its own, if it was going to grow at all. I didn't want to interfere. And yet here I am, inadvertently in the middle of everything.\" Mitsurur lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your fault. I keep telling you two that.\" Yukari said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the point. Back in Kyoto you promised to stand by me in our fight. I made my own promise. I was going to support you, no matter what. So...so for you I can give up Minako. You alone.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stared at her Senpai a long moment. Then pushed her onto her back and straddled her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan?!\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No talking. Just hold still a sec....\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's eyes widened in surprise. She felt more than saw a big, long phallus inserted into her deep womanhood. The double sided dildo was one of many accoutrements taken from the front desk. With a swish of her hips back and forth Yukari worked the opposite end into her own body, until the pair had embraced both ends of the device fully and had touched one another's sopping lips in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have a question, Senpai...\" Yukari said, flicking on the instrument and moving lightly up and down as a pleasurable vibration moved through them. \"Does this feel wrong? Do you want me to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! No!\" Mitsuru gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Yukari whispered, controlling the pace. \"And I've lost some very precious people in my life Senpai. We both have. So unless you decide you want that for yourself rather than for our sake....DON'T AH! EVER! AH! SAY! AH! IT! AH! AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emphasized her words by moving faster and thrusting harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Understood!\" Mitsuru said, gasping in delight. \"Ah! Yukari, don't stop! I'm...I'm going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right there with you!\" Yukari gasped, pressing herself against the naked woman and kissing her hungrily. The pair came in a shuddering, sweaty mass of limbs and pleasure. Then they were still, Yukari clicking off the vibrator without bothering to extricate herself or her companion from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was wonderful.\" Mitsuru said after a moment. \"How can this feel so...natural?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its like the other you said, Senpai. We've been as close as lovers for a long time now. It didn't take much of a push.\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've adapted well to the situation, Yukari.\" Mitsuru said in admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be fooled, Senpai. This is massively embarrassing, and going through what you guys went through would probably kill me! I'm...hoping maybe they'll go easy on us tomorrow?\" Yukari ignored Mitsuru's grim expression. \"But I was already pretty turned on when I got hit by that stupid mind ray, and...well, this is literally the easiest part of this whole situation to get over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point.\" Mitsuru said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides...I also feel a little guilty letting us be trapped like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's absurd. You almost saved us all! You would have, if that...that monster hadn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. But I wouldn't have figured it out without your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Senpai. This hotel? This street? You picked this location specifically so I'd be on my guard. If anywhere would scream 'sex crazed girls possessed by shadows' it would be here. Especially for me.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. All right, Takeda, you've made your point. I was just trying to be modest.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modesty kinda went out the window awhile ago, Senpai.\" Yukari kissed her once more. \"You REALLY have nothing left to hide this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru blushed, remembering the previous conversation the pair had had regarding the hot springs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Senpai...have you ever heard of motorboating?\" Yukari asked with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what? No...is it anything like taking a yacht out on the ocean?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very good guess, Senpai. Here, let me show you. Wanted to do this for awhile, to be honest...\" Yukari said, flipping the vibrator back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ack! Yukari, that tickles! OH! OH! OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp; #62;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMInako found herself once more in the Velvet Room, that strange extradimensional space decked out like a bizarre elevator as blue as the name would imply. Igor was seated before her, his enormous nose and bloodshot eyes staring at her as intently as ever. If he was surprised by her nudity, he showed no trace of it. Not so Elizabeth, the blond haired woman dressed in the blue outfit of an elevator attendant. Her eyes were roaming up and down Minako's body in a show of delight and sexual excitement Minako found completely mortifying. Theo, by contrast, was blushing profusely and was covering his eyes in a show of embarrassment almost as acute as Minako's own. Seated to Igor's left was another woman, blond and regal, her dress and looks closely reminiscient of Elizabeth and Theo. She gave Minako a hard look, clearly disapproving of her complete nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Velvet Room.\" Igor intoned pleasantly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Minako said in a low voice, covering herself and walking awkwardly into the large room. SHe wanted to shrink into herself. She could feel every eye on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan!\" Elizabeth said, excitedly rushing up to her. \"Is it true you've forsaken the use of clothing? What a bold new lifestyle choice! What is it like? Is at as exhilarating as I imagined?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blushed and bent over as her friend beamed at her, making no effort to conceal how excited the sight of Minako's naked body was to her. \"Hi, Elizabeth. Mostly...just really embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's even better!\" Elizabeth exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, please.\" Theo said in mortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stern looking woman next to Igor cleared her throat. Minako found herself under the woman's penetrating gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Margaret, eldest sister of those who serve the Velvet Room. I am here to discuss your breach of contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...what?\" Minako said, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your contract. You do recall signing one upon your entry into this room, correct? At the time, you were given only one stipulation. To abide by the contract, and assume responsibility for the choice you make.\" Margaret said with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes?\" Minako squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the past day, very few of the choices you have made have been your own, and you have not been responsible for your actions!\" Margaret declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Umm. Yes. That-\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The consequences for such a breach of contract are SEVERE.\" Margaret declared, glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Oh no. Are...are you going to punish me?\" Minako said in small voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The terms of the contract are admittedly vague in certain regards. Besides that, it is not as if your recent actions were willing or intended. The contract does not hold one responsible for times where extenuating circumstances remove one's own control. Considering the nature of some Shadows, it would be quite cruel to expect full compliance at all times.\" the mysterious man explained, his tone never changing from its eerily pleasant nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret glared. \"But, Master, surely she can't be allowed to walk away from this free of repercussions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made my decision, Margaret. You do not have to like it, but you have to accept it. I will not have our guest punished.\" Igor said, his voice taking on a surprising edge. Clearly he did not take well to the attendants questioning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret immediately backed off, fear flashing across her face. In fact, all three of the attendants seemed fearful at that moment. Clearly, Igor was not one to be angered if merely raising his voice could shake these three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uh... am I free to go, then?\" Minako asked quietly, not sure if she should speak at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm afraid not.\" Igor said. \"You see, we've summoned you for a special reason. This Shadow you and your allies have encountered is an aberration. It does not seem to answer to any master, and instead works towards its own agenda. In fact, it has expanded its ambitions, looking to spread its influence to another place experiencing Shadow activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is why I'm here.\" Margaret said, stepping forward. The look she gave Minako made it clear that the eldest of the three siblings still did not care for the naked girl. Staring intently at Minako the whole time, Margaret began to explain. \"I am in charge of aiding another Wild Card guest, this one a young man in a small town called Inaba. This Shadow of yours has begun to make moves among the Shadows there. I cannot allow this to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you tell your guy? I mean, if he's a Wild Card, he can fight Shadows too, right?\" Minako asked. \"Or is he not strong enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My guest is plenty strong!\" Margaret snapped, quickly regaining her composure. \"Ahem. As I was saying. Since this Shadow originated here, in YOUR city, the Master has agreed that you and your allies should be the ones to face the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll have breached your contract.\" Igor said. \"And Margaret would be entitled to punish you for allowing a threat to spread out of your control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako realized she didn't have much of a choice. \"Okay. I'll do it. So... when do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret simply smiled. \"You and your two friends begin-\"</span></div></div>",

Given how events had progressed so far, that meant several more hours spent in a bed engaging in a series of erotic activities with her two best friends she had never imagined doing in even her naughtiest of fantasies. Being helpless to do anything about the situation was both extremely exciting and extremely embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Minako said at last. \"But what exactly are we supposed to do? I can't even talk about this shadow without 'pervy me' getting switched on and taking over! Unless there's a way to break this spell, we can't even get close to it without getting hypnoed again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fate would have it, there is a solution.\" Igor said, as pleasantly as ever. \"Inaba is a most remarkable place, a town in which many secrets are hidden and many truths are revealed. A solution to your current dilemna may be one such truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we need to go to Inaba?\" Minako guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Margaret said in her sullen tone. \"The situation is more...complex than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Inaba he speaks of doesn't exist yet.\" Margaret said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....are any of you capable of saying anything without being incredibly cryptic??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is as I said. The Shadows have not yet manifested in Inaba. They will do so a few years from now, at least assuming that your current circumstances have not already corrupted the timeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oooooookay. So...your from the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you could say so, although to be more accurate you are from my past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....right. Anyway...how is that possible? I knew you guys in the Velvet Room were powerful, but isn't this a little much even for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm. An interesting question. I have never attempted to pass through time under my own power on the scale of several years before. It would be an interesting challenge...\" Margaret said, then blanched as Igor glared at her. \"Ahem. The reason I can be here is the same as the reason you and your comrades have a Persona. The Dark Hour, and more to the point the edifice at its center, have allowed my passage to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Tartarus is a time machine?\" Minako asked, reeling in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a fashion. To be more specific, if one knows the correct path it is possible to move from one's present into one's past by way of the Tower. Or to be more accurate still, by walking through the Abyss hidden beneath it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. There's something underneath Tartarus? Since when?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For as long as the edifice has existed! Had you not been so focused on ascending, perhaps you would have learned what lies beneath!\" Margaret snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there aren't any stairs going down!\" Minako protested. \"Where's this entrance supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. The way into the Abyss does not appear with the reliability of the way into Tartarus. The doorway appears in the mortal realm only in response to intense emotions focused on a specific event in the past. Otherwise the entrance flickers in and out of existence, moving from one place and time to another through an infinite number of realms each hidden within the depths of the sea of the human psyche. Even for one such as myself, finding the gateway in order to come here was...a challenge.\" Margaret said, a hint of pride in her voice. \"Unfortunately, the Abyss and Tartarus are linked to each other, each the opposite face of the same coin. For that reason, the forces that cause Tartarus to come into being will not allow the entrance to the Abyss to manifest in this timeline. To put it simply, while I was able to enter the Abyss by the 'front door' to get here, we will have to find an alternative way to enter it to get back to my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we...\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will go to your school, and endure the humiliations your taskmaster has in store for you for that day. And you will find a means to remain there until the night comes. As you know, there are two methods for entering Tartarus. You may either enter from the ground floor after the Dark Hour has begun, or you may stay within the confines of the school as the Dark Hour arrives and be transported to a random floor as the Tower forms. As I said, Tartarus and the Abyss are linked. If you remain within the school and stand at precisely the right location long enough, the Dark Hour will take you into the Abyss rather than the Tower. And finding that spot will be child's play for a servant of the Velvet Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But didn't you say the Abyss only takes you into the past?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but such things are relative. Were any of you to attempt to find a path to Inaba, the effort would fail. You could only walk into the past or return to the present. But my present IS your future. Once inside the Abyss, I can return there any time I wish. And in that way, I can guide you to the proper place and time as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...doing all that will help us with this Shadow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. As with all things, my duty is to guide the guest down the road to the place where they might realize the destiny. Whether they have the wisdom to grasp that fate in their hands, or the courage to follow through with the role it would have them play...these things are up to them. I will take you into the future, and if you can fulfill your potential there I will take you back to your own time. But what you accomplish there is entirely out of my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to be concerned with the trials of your temporal journey. I believe you will have quite enough to occupy yourself with, considering your current lack of attire beyond those bits of swimwear and the plethora of humiliations your other self no doubt has in store for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. RIght.\" Minako said, the butterflies in her stomach returning with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all I had to say to you. You may go now.\" Margaret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I...\" Minako bowed briefly. \"I am sorry for offending you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Margaret said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I apologize for my sister.\" Elizabeth said darkly. \"She is normally the picture of hospitality and patience towards our visitors. She usually does not take contract breaches as personal affronts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Stay out of this, my sister.\" Margaret warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I have held my tongue long enough, sister. Will you not accept her apology? You have never acted this way, not even in the face of MY indiscretions! Which, if I may say sister, were one and all more egregious and more deliberate than anything Minako-chan has done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sister, I remember. You and Theo both, you have always been impressionable and naive...and powerfully curious about the human world. I found your antics amusing back then, and I saw it as my duty to protect and mentor you both. Perhaps I should have paid more attention, to save you from your own foolishness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this all really about, sister?\" Theo chimed in, stepping up beside Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart can be stirred more by a single action than a thousand words.\" Margaret said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I agree with Minako. These cryptic statements are becoming tiresome.\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl's actions have stirred both your hearts, have they not?\" Margaret asked, pointing at Minako accusingly. \"She has captivated many in this way. She not only stirs the hearts around her, she captures them. The proof lies there in the mortal world, in the ease with which she entrapped her comrades in her new master's web. And she will continue to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor glared in warning, but Margaret pretended not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long from now, this girl will perform another action. This will be the culimination of all she has sought to do, and it will be a vital action for many. And yet for you both it will stir something once again in your hearts, deeper than anything ever has. And in response you will do something...beyond foolish. You will commit a sin that can never be redeemed, and it will forever sever the bond between us. Because of her my family has been taken from me and I alone am left to fulfill our obligations! But I WILL fulfill those obligations, even when they say not to harm this little girl and to help her out of this absurd situation she trapped herself inside. But forgive her for what comes next? Nothing on this earth or beyond it will ever force that from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was deafening. Minako could feel her heart pounding. Then slowly the blue door behind her creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-chan.\" Igor said softly. \"Please return to your world. There are things to be discussed now that would disturb you. And I do not wish to do that to our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. I'll see you tomorrow.\" Minako squeeked, racing from the room as quickly as she dared.</span></div></div>",

She felt completely relaxed and satisfied, her exhausted body relishing all the more the chance to rest and sleep thanks to her earlier exertions. And all around her she felt herself wrapped up in something snug, warm, and soft, as if she was buried in downy pillows. She was dead to the world, deep in sleep, and whatever tiny bit of awareness that might trickle into her head between dreams of soft lips and exploring hands and licking tongues was very willing to let her drift through her slumbering heaven as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course the phone had to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minako came crashing back to reality, she let out a small cry of protest. As her eyes fluttered open, she was momentarily confused about where she was. Why was it so dark, and what was this vaguely pink obstruction in her face. As her mind traced its way back through the events of the previous day, she felt a blush growing on her face. The \"pillows\" she was surrounded by were in fact the bodies of her teammates...friends...lovers pressed up against her own. What she was partially blinded by was in fact Mitsuru's fantastic breasts, her face currently buried between the great orbs. She had a vague recollection of passing out somewhere in the midst of licking and sucking on the magnificent things (Mitsuru had proven very receptive to such treatment). If the warm space enveloping her left knee was any indication, Mitsuru had similarly fallen asleep while entwining her inner thighs around her lover and rubbing the younger girl's knee against her sensitive areas. As for Yukari, the hand on Minako's thigh and the ticklish sensation of breath on her butt and across her folds proved the girl hadn't gone far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Temptation had its way, Minako would probably wake up like this a lot in her immediate future. And while she distinctly remembered this was a bad thing, Minako's semi-awake mind was straining to remember exactly why that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother explosion of sound rocked smashed into her plain of awareness. Oh right. The phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako heard a pair of small gasps on either side of her. Her blush grew deeper as she realized that her friends were going to be greeted with an intensely close look at Minako's naked body as the first thing they would see upon returning to consciousness. Minako held her breath, feeling the eyes of the girls on her. The scrutiny lasted through three loud rings of the phone before Minako dared to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" She said in a tiny voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Morning.\" Came the dual reply. The three embarrassed women began to stir, gently untangling their limbs from the tight contact and slowly rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako scampered to the phone and hastily answered. Yukari and Mitsuru found themselves staring at her retreating form, her bouncing bottom almost hypnotic. Tearing their eyes away from the sight, the pair looked at each other and found themselves spellbound once again. Dim memories of the previous night flashed behind their sleepy eyes, memories full of what the pair had done to those naked bodies, things far more naughty and embarrassing than anything they had learned about in school. As their eyes finally met the pair blushed and quickly looked away. Without a word exchanged between them, they knew exactly what was going through the other's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Minako croaked into the phone. \"Eh? Its 5:00! But...yes, I know how a love hotel works! But we're not even showered or dressed yet! You can't just kick us out like this! Please! At least...half an hour? Okay. That's...okay. Arigato. We'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looked at Minako in totally agony. \"Don't tell me we have to get up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're giving us thirty minutes to get out. We need to get showered and dressed!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come onnnnnn.\" Yukari said, collapsing back onto the bed. \"We've had...what? An hour to rest? Maybe two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less than two.\" Mitsuru said, her head drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this is so you guy's fault! The shadow possession stuff I get, I'm not holding any grudges for that! But...but dammit, who uses Media like that, huh? Which one of you perverts came up with THAT little maneuver?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Mitsuru blushed intensely. Media was a basic healing spell that effected the whole group. It turned out that in addition to its other properties, Media easily allowed one to recover from certain...vigorous activities one might put one's body through...activities that would otherwise strain the body and cause so much soreness that it would become hard to walk (let alone continue with said activities). In addition, it turned out that the energies invoked by Media could be...focused on certain parts of the body. Doing so caused a surge of adrenaline and hormones in those areas. In the case of erogenous zones, the effect was a more intense arousal and added sensitivity to another's touch. Given that all three girls had access to Personas with healing abilities who's mystic energies had been honed through the course of the year to incredible heights, their threesome had been far more daring and energetic than it otherwise might have been...after all, no matter how intense, painful or exhausting the lovemaking would get, the three of them could instantly recover with a snap of the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it wasn't fun, but healing doesn't equal being well rested. Otherwise we could run amuck in Tartarus all the time and never get tired.\" Yukari muttered. \"Seriously, which of you came up with that? What kind of perverted freak would want to use our powers like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Mitsuru looked at each other, brows furrowed. Mitsuru coughed once. \"Yukari...wasn't that your suggestion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blinked, then blushed. \"Oh. Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three paused. \"Okay, just shut up!\" Yukari blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your thinking it, dammit! So stop right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....in any event.\" Mitsuru said, shaking her head. \"Perhaps we should just call the front desk and rent the room for another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Isn't that expensive? And what about school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is expensive, but I can afford the cost. Given our lack of rest, and our limited supply of clothes, I would rather call in sick. It neatly avoids a new round of humiliation, it will let us rest as long as we like, and....\" Mitsuru blushed. \"And it would allow us some leisure time to play with one another on our own volition. Assuming...that proposition appeals to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye contact was a difficult achievement this morning, but the nervous glances and blushing smiles the trio gave one another before casting their eyes back to their bare feet offered an embarrassed affirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then-NO!\" Mitsuru cried, as quite against her will she found herself rising to her feet, pushing her chest out and swaying her hips erotically as she moved. Minako and Yukari looked on in confusion, then found their own bodies acting of their own volition. The three moved into the bathroom in a naked conga line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Humiliation it is.\" Mitsuru muttered glumly, walking under the spray of water, her actions no longer under her control. She began to soap herself up, then turned her attention to her naked partners. The next ten minutes were an embarrassing mix of rubbing, squeezing, and stroking as the trio explored one another's bodies once more. Despite being allowed a few licks, kisses and strokes of their intimate parts, the three were not permitted to go beyond teasing and arousing one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been dreading this.\" Mitsuru noted as they emerged from the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Yukari's bag came a few tiny scraps of cloth and three pairs of high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most girls her age, Yukari had occasionally struggled with a pair of jeans a little too small for her waist (or, more often, a pair that had become too small thanks to a lapse in a diet or a simple growth spurt). Here now she found herself going through a similar emotional rollercoaster of embarrassment, frustration, and grim determination as she pulled and yanked and wiggled her way into her bikini. Only her emotions were compounded by the desperate desire to squeeze as much of her exposed body into the tiny thing, to hide even a little of her flesh from casual inspection. She'd been going through a phase, trying to mimic her mother's wardrobe on the beach (at the time she called it daring, now she called it slutty). So of course it was a thong, and no matter how she tried the thin material kept slipping between her butt cheeks to leave nothing of her backside to the imagination AND give her the uncomfortable (and humiliating) sensation of a wedgie as she walked. As she feared, the tiny top she wore barely contained her breasts. The twin orbs were pushed up and back, their immense girth being squeezed by the cloth, simultaneously exaggerating the size and promising to burst completely at any moment.  To her fierce embarrassment, she found herself stuck in an awful catch 22. Her recently erect nipples were prominent and obvious beneath the thin fabric. But the material was so stretched over her orbs that she feared her breasts would slide one way or another to expose her nipples unless the erection was there to \"anchor\" the material around something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was in a similar state, save that her bikini and high heels were dark blue rather than the deep red of Yukari's suit. Mitsuru was even worse off, her butt and breasts so big the bikini would not even tie in place. It took some hastily applied safety pins on the corners of her outfit to get her covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beat red trio drew in a breath, then walked out of their room on unsteady legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how are we getting to school?\" Minako asked.</span></div></div>",

Trying to ignore the looks and words (and largely failing) they stepped out onto the street. Mitsuru stepped forward, prepared to hail a taxi, when she hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... could one of you hail the cab, please?\" Mitsuru asked. \"I would, but I fear this top might not survive the movement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako nodded in understanding and stepped up beside her redheaded senpai. Carefully, the SEES leader held out a hand and gave a little wave, hoping to get the attention of an incoming taxi. Of course it was essentially impossible for the three girls to not get people's attention, and a taxi practically sped into the space in front of them. Flashing her friends a hesitant smile, Minako pulled open the backseat of the vehicle and climbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gekkoukan High, please.\" Minako said, her voice barely a whisper. \"The faster the better, if you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises.\" the driver answered as the other girls filed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukari filed in after Mitsuru, the SEES girls quickly realized that there was a major issue with their decision to take a cab. While a train could be crowded, there was at least floor space and the technical possibility of a personal bubble. The back seat of a taxi allowed no such thing, and the three were huddled tightly together in the back seat of the taxi. While none of them were unfamiliar with skin-on-skin contact with each other at this point, it made things no less awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, Temptation's magic seemed to be inclined to make this prolonged contact lightly arousing, slowly beginning to make the three girls restless. Hiding the obvious signs of their arousal was essentially impossible, pebbled nipples pressing tightly against the meager material of their tops, and small dark spots appearing between their legs. When the driver took a turn a bit harder than the girls were expecting, things got even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako leaned into Misturu, her hand slipping between her senpai's legs as she tried to steady herself. Mitsuru, meanwhile, leaned into Yukari, her face pressing tight against the younger girl's collarbone. The simple contact in the car had been bad enough, but this was enough to start tearing down their inhibitions. All three could feel the fire building within them, and they knew that things were about to get serious if the trip didn't end soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari gulped in a lungful of air. She could feel her whole body trembling. Her Senpai was pressed up against her body, her beautiful lips less than an inch from Yukari's skin. Yukari had very vivid memories of what those lips could do, and that unfocused lusty stare Mitsuru was giving her was also very prominent in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. We'll get there in no time, and then....\" Yukari said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the cab stopped abruptly. Yukari felt Mitsuru press against even more tightly, her sweet breasts pushing up against Yukari's own perky endowments. Minako smashed in her senpai's back, pushing them even more tightly together and accidentally slipping her hand now completely underneath the thin covering of Mitsuru's bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason most of the students of Gekkoukan took the train, even those like Mitsuru who normally had other means of transit. Unless you were traveling by rail or ship, there was literally one way in and out of the artificial island. That was a long suspension bridge that connected the mainland with a secondary island made up of businesses and the local mall, a maze in its own right, then a SECOND bridge onto the correct island. That bridge was the worst kind of bottle neck most days of the week, even at such absurdly early hours of the morning as this. In other words, the girls were stuck in a confined space practically naked and unbelievably horny for any number of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gasped as she felt Mitsuru's agile tongue play across her sensitive collarbone. She blushed crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senapi!\" She whispered in alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked up at her with those dazed, hungry eyes. With a dawning sense of embarrassment Yukari took note of Minako's little hand slipping inside Mitsuru's bottoms, making a motion that looked positively unhelpful to solving their current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Yukari. I can't help it...\" Mitsuru whispered, her lips connecting with Yukari's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........no. No! NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavoring the taste of her Senpai for just a moment, Yukari raised her left hand and gently (but insistently) pushed Mitsuru's probing lips away from her. In the same motion, she grasped Minako's hand and extricated her fingers from their erotic play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me.\" Yukari whispered as the pair looked at her with expressions oddly similar to Koromaru when he watched his adopted family eat. \"We aren't like this! We...(deep breath) are stronger than this. We're not going to take the easy way out here, no matter how much we want it! We're...we aren't slave to our desires! They can take control of us, they can strip us and humiliate us, but they won't get the satisfaction of seeing us give in and humiliate ourselves when we have a choice! We aren't giving them that victory! Do you two understand me??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Yukari reasoned, this was exactly the sort of crap she'd given her mother for years. She'd be damned if some stupid shadow was going to prove her a hypocrite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru and Minako looked as if they wanted to protest, but both looked down and nodded. Whatever scrap of pride and dignity they could claim after this ordeal was worth avoiding yet another public sexual encounter. At least, that's what they told themselves. Other parts of their anatomy might not agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then I think...heh...err, I mean, I think that we- HAHAHA...!!! I...\" Yukari paused in alarm, suddenly possessed by a sharp fit of laughter. \"What's going...hee hee hee oh I can't take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru and Minako stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victory? Won't give them the satisfaction? This is too funny!\" Yukari said, giggling as her hands gave Mitsuru's breasts a good squeeze before she recoiled as much as the small space of the cab would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little Yukari. Her head's really messed up by all this, isn't it? Then again, her skull was already full of so many mommy and daddy issues I don't even know where to start! 'I'm not easy, I'm not weak, I don't need anyone!'. How many times is she gonna repeat that bullshit in her empty little head, huh? Truth is she's more of a needy little brat than the rest of you combined! Mrs. Independent would die if she had to go a day without any of you losers. How sad is that? She's the most popular girl on campus, has a billion friends, but its only with you poor saps doing this SEES crap she pretends to hate that she feels any connection with! And as for being EASY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Don't even get me started!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked worriedly at the cabbie while Mitsuru just glared. \"Let her go now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwww. Look at you, big bad Senpai, ready to go all momma bear on my ass. But I'm gonna have to say no. Defiance has consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Mitsuru paused, then glowered in anger. \"She had the sense to talk us down from making love in the middle of downtown traffic and you want to punish her for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? You disapprove? I thought that was your modus operandi, Senpai. Aren't you looking to be punished for the sins of the Kirijos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what? NO!\" Mitsuru said, almost forgetting to keep her voice down. The cabbie was aware that a rather intense conversation was taking place in back, but had yet to understand the details thanks to their low voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's what I hate about you. You lie all the time. You say one thing and mean another. That's just one thing Temptation will save us from. No more lies. No more secrets. Everything about us is going to be bared to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough games. You are Temptation. Your speaking through Yukari, but you aren't her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Senpai.\" The Yukari-thing said smoothly. \"I don't like being told who I am and who I'm not. You'll find its kind of a trigger with most of us. And your wrong- I'm not Temptation-sama. What did Yukari say before? None of you are slaves to your desires? She couldn't have been more wrong there! Temptation's power doesn't control us. It awakens us! All the little things you've secretly wanted, all those guilty little pleasures and fantasies you've been craving but were too cowardly to acknowledge. He reached in, drew us out, and gave us life! Now we get what we want, whenever we want it, and you can't deny us any more. There's the punchline. You really are a slave to your desires, in the worst ways possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I care. In any case, I seem to recall you two being exposed to more than one crowd of leering strangers while getting naked and humiliated. Isn't it about time for little Yuka-tan here to get a taste of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait-\" But Mitsuru's protests were ignored as Yukari opened the side door, and stepped out into the middle of the unmoving traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi driver looked at her as the mostly naked Yukari wrapped on the window. \"We're not going anywhere for awhile, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not...\" The cabbie said, staring at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Do me a favor. Find a song with a good beat and crank it up.\" Yukari said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bored, and its stuffy in there. So I want something to dance to.\" Yukari said with a wink. \"Don't drive off, now! I'd hate to be stranded here like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabbie smirked at her. Yukari turned around, cars all around her honking and photos being snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukari-channnnnn,\" Said the thing who had stolen her voice. \"I know you can hear me. And don't worry. I'll let you talk in just a sec. Just wanted to make this next part clear. Congrats in resisting your hormones there. Savor that victory for whatever its worth. But naughty girls always need to be punished. So have a taste of what happens when you go against Temptation. I'm sure it'll be the first of many. You are pretty stubborn, after all. I'll be looking forward to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari found her voice at last. Her body, however, was moving on its own. Music blarred from the Taxi, and she began to sway to the loud pounding beat. She could hear horns beeping all around her. Some people had camera phones. In between shaking her assets in every direction Yukari would pause for the cameras, this time grabbing her breasts and squeezing them together, another time bending over to provide an excellent view of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop! You can't do this to me, dammit! Everyone's staring! Nooooo!\" Yukari pleaded with her unseen puppetteer, all to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside herself, Yukari's mind was paralyzed with horror. Last night she had consoled herself with the belief that hearing the horror stories of her friends turned lovers might somehow inoculate herself against the impending embarrassment. Surely nothing could be worse than submitting herself to Mitsuru and being forced to pleasure herself in front of Minako! She knew now what a flimsy lie that had been. What could ever prepare her for this? The world around her was a confusing mesh of honking horns, screaming voices (angry motorists and cat calls in equal measure), and faces....an endless number of leering, grinning faces pressed up against car windows or crowding the sidewalk. Everywhere she looked she found more eyes staring at her, in a nightmarish panorama that seemed to go on forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a sight she was. Her mostly naked body was gyrating to and fro with increasing energy. Her hips swayed back and forth, acting as a fulcrum for the rest of her body, allowing her breasts and her hips to bounce in a hypnotic pattern. Her traitorous hands did nothing to cover herself, either raised well above her hand as she moved in reckless abandon, or worse moving up and down her body in time with the music, touching and teasing her sensitive areas. Periodically she would pull on her tiny red top, pressing her breasts up and together. Her sensitive nipples were being yanked this way and that in a way she found painful and pleasurable all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt a hand on her shoulder. Turning around Yukari stared in stunned silence as Minako stood there, her brown hair blowing in the breeze and her large red eyes filled with concern. There was a light blush running down her whole body, something the dark blue of her tiny bikini served to emphasize in contrast. Yukari took a moment to stare. Her friend (girlfriend? That would take a little getting used to!) was an awesome sight. Which of course meant Yukari herself was no less memorable...the poor girl blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here??\" Yukari squeeked, as she and Minako pressed up against one another in time with the music, their breasts squeezing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just stand there watching that happen to you!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get us out of this??\" Yukari whispered, as she did a little pirouette and turned away from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...no. Not really.\" Minako said, as she unwillingly untied her friend's bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well THANKS!\" Yukari squeeked as she turned back around, her nipples barely hidden by the remaining fabric. \"Who said I wanted your help anyway??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Oh, sorry! Next time I'll just sit back and enjoy your humiliation!\" Minako said, duplicating Yukari's earlier movements and feeling her own top being loosened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think two naked girls solves anything??\" Yukari sniped back, as the pair took their hands and dipped them beneath the remaining fabric. As one they flung the garments as while turning back to face one another, their now fully naked breasts against pressing together, teasing both their audience and themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you wouldn't be alone!\" Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle myself! I don't need you to babysit me every time something goes wrong!\" Yukari snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair glared at each other, then to their mutual surprise started to kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wurt yu duick??\" Yukari tried to ask despite the sudden intrusion of tongue in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'not Meh\" Minako moaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently their other selves didn't care for this particular argument. The pair tried to fight the public display of affection for a moment, then began to kiss of their own volition. Unfortunately, what comfort and delight they could glean from the contact was painfully marred by their public display and the habit their puppetteers had with taking things further than either wanted. They continued to kiss, even as their legs entwined themselves and began to rub against their most sensitive of areas. The fabric between their legs was soaked with their mutual juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Yukari said, breathless and horny. \"Thanks for being here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You really are a little Tsundere sometimes, you know that?\" Minako whispered, her body still pressed tightly against her lover's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up.\" Yukari muttered, then gasped in alarm. The pair separated suddenly, their breasts exposed to the public. Worse, as one they clapped their hands together and held them above their heads, moving their shoulders from side to side like a pair of snake charmers. Their breasts bounced in every direction, emphasized and exposed to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't happening!\" Yukari cried, then glanced up in renewed horror. A familiar sedan was amongst the vehicles. From inside she could see the faces of her schoolmates, part of the click the popular girl hung around when she wasn't chasing shadows. They looked shocked, but also were giggling to each other. One had a cameraphone out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! This can't get any worse!\" She cried. Her other self disagreed. She and Minako suddenly found their hands around their hips, playing with the strings of their bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please! I'm sorry! Doooon't!\" Yukari begged her body. Her hands did not expose her all at once. Instead, as her hips continued to sway her hands pulled at the edges of the bikini, stretching and stretching, making her intent obvious. Then, down came the bikini bottom for a moment, then back up. Yukari heard laughter, clapping, and more catcalls in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness!\" She said to herself as the tiny bikini came back up to cover her inner folds. Her relief was short lived. She and Minako found their hands continuing to pull on the fabric, higher and higher into the material was enveloped by their throbbing slits. Her humiliation was now complete, as she felt her hands move the fabric up and down along her sex, rubbing against her clit in an embarrassingly pleasurable way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Minako did nothing to hide their display, throwing their heads back, thrusting their beautiful breasts out, and eagerly molesting themselves with the former fabric. Yukari found herself facing her former peers directly, completely open and exposed and pleasuring herself to the shock and awe of her social circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOO!\" Yukari moaned as she felt an orgasm building up. \"Please! Let me wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!\" Mitsuru called, pulling them both away just as the orgasm would have come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai!\" The pair gasped as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back in the car before...\" Mitsuru sighed as she felt her body move on its own. Without any fanfare both girls moved to either side of Mitsuru, grasped the top of her barely held together bikini, and pulled. Mitsuru's massive, beautiful breasts popped into view. The motorists honked their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Minako wailed. \"Its not us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of that.\" Mitsuru said, trying to keep calm. \"That, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ripped away the bottom of Mitsuru's bikini, leaving the three entirely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...makes this no less humiliating.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What choice did they have, really? The only way to run in either direction was along the bridge for hundreds and hundreds of yards. The police would have ample time to realize what they were doing and would easily arrange by radio for their fellows to intercept the naked criminals well before any of them managed to get back to dry land. Hiding was out of the question, not with every car constantly honking and hooting and generally giving away their positions. They could try throwing themselves on the mercy of a driver and hide in the back of a car, but that had a whole new set of dangers and high probability of being spotted. The only option left was...well, jump off the bridge. And humiliations aside, none of them was feeling particularly suicidal at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, heads hung low, the three contritely covered their bodies and waited for the inevitable. Hopefully the Kirijo Group could bail them out of this later. It would make the process of being handcuffed and marched into the station naked and exposed no less excruciating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop car slowly pulled up next to them. Mitsuru remembered all too well her treatment last night, and her legs began to shake ever so slightly. To their surprise and relief, the man that stepped out of the vehicle was familiar to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is unexpected.\" Officer Kurosawa said. Out of all the cops in the city, Kurosawa was seemingly the only one who had any inkling about the Dark Hour or the Shadows. He was a normal man, and thus had no way to directly investigate the phenomena or do anything about it. So instead he discreetly passed weapons and armor along to the SEES members and did his best to look the other way when their activities might otherwise have gotten the police involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can explain!\" Yukari said, covering herself and fidgeting. \"It was all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fellow SEES members swiftly grabbed her from either side and covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say a word. It will only make things worse!\" Mitsuru ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, it must be pretty serious if its also affecting you people.\" Kurosawa said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'Also affecting us'?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? Guess you kids are kinda out of the loop.\" Kurosawa said. \"Here, let's take a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I-\" Mitsuru gasped as Kurosawa cuffed one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mrs. Kirijo. You three are technically streaking, whatever the circumstances. Till we sort it out, gotta follow procedure. So, hands behind your back please.\" Kurosawa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three endured what felt like an eternity as they were each handcuffed in turn, their bodies fully exposed to the traffic. Finally, they were allowed into the confined quarters of the vehicle. The insidious magic Temptation had inflicted on the girls was once more at work here. Every inch of their bodies felt so much more aware and sensitive to the touch, making even the cool breeze on their bare skin feel like a caress along an erogenous zone. The casual skin to skin contact they were making was building up a slow state of arousal. The three could not help but blush at how easily their bodies responded to even this small amount of stimulus. At this rate they would be nothing but a pile of embarrassed, horny nerves all day long. If Temptation had his way, this would be their default state of existence for the rest of their lives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I take it none of you know about Eden Syndrome yet?\" Kurosawa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stared at him, then shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of that. Well, long story short...since about midnight last night, we've been seeing cases of a new kind of Apathy Syndrome. Last I heard, we've had 23 cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApathy Syndrome was a strange 'disease' that was striking random citizens in the city. The person afflicted remained alive, but refused to respond to anything around them. While basic, automatic functions like breathing continued, their minds showed no ability to respond to even basic life threatening stimuli like imminent danger or a need to eat. Without constant care from volunteers or family members, an AS victim would allow themselves to starve to death and remain in a stupor until they toppled over. Of course, the cause of the Syndrome was the Dark Hour- during that time Shadows would occasionally 'leak' out of certain victim's minds, apparently robbing them of all cognizant thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSEES was well aware of this. But none of them had ever heard of 'Eden Syndrome'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so far the pattern has been for young ladies between 16 and 29 who've been suffering from Apathy Syndrome have suddenly started to regain their awareness. But almost immediately, their inclination is to remove their clothes and refuse to wear any afterwards. They are aware enough to be embarrassed by their situation, yet don't seem able to put anything on. On top of that, they have periodically broken out into a variety of...ahem, sexually explicit activities while exposed to crowds of varying sizes. They continue to appear ashamed by their behavior, and yet can't seem to stop themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Mitsuru said, grimly looking at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the situation was getting worse.</span></div></div>",

Aren't you taking us to the school?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, by the book.\" Kurosawa said. \"I do try to cut you kids some slack, what with all the good you do. But roaming around naked in broad daylight? We can't just pretend it didn't happen, now can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I suppose not.\" Mitsuru said in a small voice. \"But if you've already identified this as some offshoot of Apathy Syndrome you surely can't press charges!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough. The department has standing orders to release any Eden Syndrome sufferers we identify. They're all victims, after all. But since word broke of the phenomena a whole mess of perverts and exhibitionists have hit the streets claiming to be suffering the same affect. Kirijo apparenty found some way to tell the difference...something about a particular patch of activity in one part of the brain that normal folks don't have...but it takes time to run the scan. Unfortunately, my orders are to round up all the folks running around naked until we can put of through the scan and properly figure out who has ES and who's being a deviant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That makes sense.\" Mitsuru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked at her naked compatriots. Both Mitsuru and Yukari had dejected looks, practically as lost and adrift as they had seemed after the Chairman's betrayal. It was heartbreaking, and Minako wanted desperately to do something about it. And..maybe she could?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...I know things look bad. Heck, I know things ARE bad. But...I've got a plan. We're gonna get back control and give this thing the smackdown! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dubious looks she received were not exactly what she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mina-chan....I just stripped off in front of downtown traffic! Every morning commuter on Tatsumi Port Island knows what we look like naked! My friends have pictures of me screwing myself in public on their camera phones! And I couldn't do a thing to stop any of it? WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT THAT I CAN'T?\" Yukari growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word of our late night exploits has no doubt already trickled to the Kirijo Group. Those members who aren't laughing at my predicament are no doubt offering insightful sexist commentary on how inevitable my breakdown was...being a woman with the audacity to try and run a business. I can never repair the damage this has caused, or live down what I have done. Nothing we plan will change that.\" Mitsuru said in a more despairing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked down for a moment. Then her lips pressed together and her eyes narrowed. With an air of (slightly adorable) determination, she pushed and crawled her way into their midst, until she assumed a sitting position between them, her small frame facing them and pressing in close (the journey was not helped by the handcuffs, nor the tiny electric tingle she felt whenever her skin made contact with their bodies).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...I have a plan.\" Minako said with an edge in her voice. \"I know someone who can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Yukari asked, trying not to let her indignant sullen mood wither under Minako's piercing stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to Inaba.\" Minako said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What's in Inaba? Who is this person who's going to help?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Minako paused, realizing she had no answers, then glared ever more fiercely. \"Neither of you need to worry about that. All you need to know is we are going to get through this. I have a way to make this better, to help us and everybody else who's suffering here! The leader of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad is gonna fix it all! But she still needs her team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Mitsuru stared at her, then looked away, a bit embarrassed by the stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE STILL NEEDS HER TEAM.\" Minako said in a louder voice. \"There's a way out of this. Do I look like I'm lying about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Mitsuru. The older girl let out a breath, shaking her head. She turned to Yukari, who glanced at her then away from her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Minako said gently, pulling herself in closer. \"Do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......No.\" Yukari said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you trust me?\" Minako asked softly, her face very close to Yukari's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....y-yeah.\" Yukari said, blushing intensely. Mitsuru smiled. \"To the ends of the Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Minako said, moving in and kissing her embarrassed teammates firmly on the lips, first Yukari and then Mitsuru. \"Right now, I just need you both to get through this. Endure it for one more day. Stay strong, and be ready to move when I say to. We're getting through this tonight! I'm relying on you guys as much as you are on me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. We get it! Geez.\" Yukari muttered, touching her cheek to Minako as an alternative to hugging. Mitsuru mimicked the gesture on the opposite side. \"Thanks.\" They both whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako smiled. These people...sometimes...just like a herd of lost puppies. Good thing Minako was a dog lover...and that she was willing to put up with a little biting every now and then. Of course, it definitely helped that they were hot! Humiliations aside, that was one thing Minako was relieved about. She could officially take a peek at them whenever she wanted in all their glory. None too soon, too. She'd been running low on excuses for making them slip into the High-cut Armor, and it'd been months since she dared to suggest running around the dungeons in swimwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ladies, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip into the mall was rather excruciating in its own right. Early morning shoppers stared and snickered as the three completely exposed girls were marched to the center of the complex. To their surprise, a new addition had been added. Right in front of the police station were two large cages, one empty and one full of naked women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what...?\" Mitsuru stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a local police box.\" Kurosawa said as he removed their handcuffs. (Author's note: Japan has little community police stations set up in various neighborhoods to handle little stuff like missing items, etc. Do no confuse it with a certain British time traveler's preferred conveyance). \"We aren't a jail. But Kirijo has asked to keep all the ES sufferers on the island for now, so what are ya gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those...leashes?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. ES folks seem to have a penchant for allowing random passersby to molest em if they get close enough to the bars. We started leaching em up to keep them out of the public's reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't...do that to us, will you?\" Yukari asked in mounting horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just gonna get chained up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EH???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were led into the empty cage. Along the wall that ran next to the ES sufferers were a series of manacles. To their bewilderment Kurosaw instructed each girl to place her hands and legs in one of the manacles, leaving them clamped to the wall in a roughly spread eagled pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kurosawa-san! This...this is...!\" Mitsuru tried to stammer out her complaint, but her sense of mortification was too overwhelming. Anyone from the street could see them fully exposed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ms. Kirijo. We've discovered that the Eden Syndromers tend to get...frisky and rowdy if we treat them decently. Look at this as some mild humiliation so you girls don't get it into your own heads to do something to yourselves even more humiliating. Or worse, do something dangerous to yourselves. That's my biggest concern right there. We'll get you tested as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he left them there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...he's got a point....\" Minako ventured. \"With us strapped up like this, we can't exactly do anything else to embarrass ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Came a singsong voice behind them. \"But we cannnnn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith growing alarm the three girls felt dozens of long slender arms reach up between the bars touch their exposed bodies. The cage opposite theirs was full of naked woman who had their hands free! Evidently no one thought to worry about keeping them out of reach of the other cage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suh-Suh-Soooooooo f-fear-le-lesssss leeeeader! A-any words to in-inspire usss OH! now?\" Yukari asked as she felt her ass, breasts, and inner thighs getting felt up amidst a chorus of laughs and excited cooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Noooooo.\" Minako answered, as two dozen strange horny women pinched, poked, groped and played with exposed helpless body while any passerby could stop and stare (and oh many did). \"This....This is just HUMILIATING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Noo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's words were a random jumble as they fell from her mouth. Somehow her current predicament was raising her shame to a whole new level. Her ordeal before this moment had been a nightmare, an endless parade of humiliation and exposure. And yet, for all her carnal acts and public displays her emotions had been somewhat insulated by the company of her fellow SEES girls. Every time they had touched in public she knew was a shared experience of mortification and giddy excitement. In a way it was like getting a Persona all over again- as a group they were suffering through hardships and torments that they alone could understand, and as a group they were helping one another deal with the situation. There was some comfort to be found in knowing that your naked lover was going through the same throws of embarrassment along with you...just as there was something wonderful in knowing her touch was sending thrills of pleasure through her lovers even as they pleasured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the hands stroking her intimate places were the hands of strangers. She was helpless, naked and embarrassed on public display! All along she had felt that certain shameful thrill of being the hapless toy of her recent lovers, since the three had taken turns tying one another up and playing with their bodies the night before. And yet now the feeling was so much worse (and paradoxically so much more arousing) as nameless strangers took liberties with her most intimate places, squeezing her breasts and butt and tracing their hands down her inner thigh! Their fingers refused to dip into her inner folds, however, a fact she was both relieved and intensely frustrated by. She was being mercilessly teased by women she didn't even know! Whatever cold comfort she had been able to take from touching her girls in public was gone, making her shame all the deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Her girls? What the hell? That sounded like something 'other her' would say. These were her friends! Comrades in arms! The girls who had her back in battles. The girls she knew better than anyone, the ones who had enhanced her Persona through their Arcana laced bonds. These were the girls she would go through (literal) hell for, the ones she would protect no matter what. So...okay, yeah. These were HER GIRLS. These were the ones she knew and loved and...and DAMMIT if they were going to be publically groped and humiliated SHE was the one who had the right to do the groping! Or get groped by them.... Ugh, this was embarrassing!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" came a dramatic voice in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls gasped in unison, so caught up in their humiliation they had failed to notice someone else had entered the cage. Before them stood a tall brunette with thick glasses and her hair pulled back, wearing what appeared to be a scientist's lab coat over....a french maid outfit? Mitsuru groaned to herself. In her current state, the peculiarities of the Kirijo Group were an extra embarrassment she felt ill equipped to deal with at the moment. Given the ultra secret nature of the organization coupled with the pseudo-militaristic and hyper advanced fields they dealt in...there was a severe amount of cross-pollination with their employees. Hence, how a well-educated scientist might do double time as a maid for the Kirijo household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ma'am! Vera Von Horne reporting!\" The science-maid said, offering Mitsuru and the others a lazy salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three naked girls and the small horde of molesters assembled in the adjacent cage stared at the new comer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are with the Kirijo Group.\" Mitsuru said at last. It was an unnecessary statement, but she could think of nothing else to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You don't recognize me?\" Horne asked in apparent surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...well...\" Mitsuru stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....ahem. In any event, it seems you three have contracted a severe case of Eden Syndrome! Fortunately, the Kirijo Group has developed a simple agent to diagnose that condition, so it should be a simple matter to confirm for the police that you are victim of the malady. Assuming you aren't faking.\" Von Horne said, emphasizing the last point with a sharp look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who on Earth would fake this? Why would we go around in public like this??\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Kirijo find a method so quickly?\" Mitsuru said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could all be perverts for all I know. No offense, Miss Kirijo. As for the method, let's just say they've had these little buggers on tap for awhile now.\" Horne said, producing three small sealed vials with some sort of clear liquid inside them...and something else squirming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those...shadows?\" Mitsuru asked in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh. Exnay on the adowshay, huh. But yeah. Specifically slivers harvested from larger specimens and put on ice. Outside certain environments these guys dissolve faster than dry ice. But they make really good specimens for experiments in the meantime! Which is how we figured out about the diagnosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......and just what does this entail....?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier to show you!\" Von Horne said, approaching Yukari with one of the vials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait! What are you...ACK! Get away! Stop! No! Not there!\" Yukari squeeked as the shadow sliver was carefully removed from the vial and pushed in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing?\" Mitsuru said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadows react to other shadows. So legitimate cases will keep the slivers alive, while fakers will cause them to dissolve. Simple, no?\" Von Horne said as she came towards Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Von Horne, under no circumstances will you-EEP!\" Mitsuru cried as the tiny shadow creature practically leapt up between her folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that just leaves you.\" Von Horne said, holding Minako's vial up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gulped and tried to close her eyes, but morbid curiosity forced her to keep one of them open a crack. The semi-permeable black tendril snaked into her vagina without prompting. At first it just sat that. But soon Minako felt a twitch...then another...and before long the little beast was moving all around inside her. After a few minutes of exploration, the creature started a squimy dance that made Minako gasp. An enticing feeling of pleasure was settling in, growing as the thing grew bolder. She and her girls squirmed in their bonds, helpless to do more than feel the pleasure moving through them and blush furiously for the crowd of onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really is rather loud...\" Von Horne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari turned a bit more red and began walking faster, her eyes staring at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\" Minako said under her breath, although the glare she received from Mitsuru showed she wasn't quiet enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, its a good sign. A body able to experience so many simultaneous and prolonged orgasms in a row must be very healthy and fit indeed!\" Von Horne continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you, Doctor.\" Mitsuru muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those guys were taking pictures.\" Minako lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt anything will come of it. They likely wish to have something for their personal use. While...mortifying, it is a manageable problem.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Minako's vision swam before her eyes and she stumbled. White light swirled before her eyes like an hallucination, solidfying into a playing card with a face that was black on one side and white on the other. The card turned around to reveal a Tarot Card only she could see. A familiar booming voice echoed in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOU ART I...AND I AM THOU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOU HAST ESTABLISHED A NEW BOND<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT BRINGS THEE CLOSER TO THE UNIVERSE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOU SHALT BE BLESSED WHEN CREATING PERSONAS OF THE LUST ARCANA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You have established the Complete Strangers Who Have Seen You Naked Social Link of the Lust Arcana.

Please try to stay optimistic.\" Mitsuru chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish I could.\" Minako said softly. She had always wondered if it was possible to form a social link based on celebrity status alone. This, however, was not the sort of relationship she wanted to have between herself and a devoted fanbase!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please. I'm just the messenger. I'm sorry we weren't able to coordinate on this sooner, but we had no idea where you three were let alone that you had been affected by the new Syndrome! The Kirijo group had to act quickly on the information we had at the time. We supplied all the dorms with instructions and new equipment to be used in the event that any girls from Gekkoukan became infected. Had you been there you wouldn't be in this current situation.\" Von Horne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we return to the dorms we risk being late to our classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your principal will understand.\" Horne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Minako looked at each other worriedly. Both of them were reflecting on their less than ideal relationship with the head of their school. There was already some tension between the principal and the Kirijo Group, specifically the fact that the man supposedly in charge of the high school was subordinate to the desires of the corporation and knew vaguely that far more took place in the building than he was privy to. More directly, Mitsuru had embarrassed the poor man again and again with her maturity, often upstaging him with her well delivered speeches and so on. Then there was that incident where she had scolded him like a little kid for his (albeit selfish) attempts to hide Fuuka's disappearance and the bullying surrounding it. Though Mitsuru has been in the right, it was clear from the looks the principal had given her that he was waiting for some opportunity...any opportunity to put the girl back in her place. This did not bode well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly are we even supposed to wear uniforms when we, you know, can't even stay dressed?\" Yukari asked bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll understand when you see the uniforms. In any case, I have other rounds to make, so I bid you farewell.\" Von Horne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! We can't just WALK there!\" Mitsuru snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. The Group delivered a mode of transit. You'll find it just outside.\" Von Horne chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Horne left them to puzzle that one out themselves. What they discovered was one of Mitsuru's motorcycles sitting out in front of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's it?\" Yukari asked. \"They know we're naked, right? How are we supposed to get home without ANY cover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The traditional method of riding on it, I presume.\" Mitsuru muttered. \"And yes, I believe the Kirijo Group is very much aware of our situation, and at the moment certain elements that never much cared for my father and generally hold women in small regard are no doubt enjoying subjecting me to as much humiliation as they can through indirect means.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..what do we do now?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do exactly as Minako instructed. We make it through the day. Which means....\" Mitsuru sucked in a breath, and pulled on slender leg over the motorcycle and sat on the black leather. \"...which means we grit our teeth and bear with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bare with it?\" Minako thought to herself, then shook her head. She and Yukari paused a long moment to take in the glory that was Mitsuru Kirijo, her long legs splayed across the motorcycle and back leaning forward to grip the handlebars. Her large breasts were hanging freely before her as she assumed the pose of a lover straddling and embracing a partner. The beautiful cheeks of her butt were slightly separated and pushed outward, almost like they were being presented to the two girls to grasp ahold of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing? Can we move this along, please?\" Mitsuru snapped, oblivious to how provocative her pose was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Just a sec!\" Yukari said, then turned to Minako. \"Okay...so...who gets the middle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, who gets their assets mostly covered up and who gets to display their backside to the world like Mitsuru was currently demonstrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....go ahead.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really? Thanks!\" Yukari beamed. \"You really are the best leader we could ask for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari quickly took up a position behind Mitsuru. And waited. And waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....What's taking so long??\" She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Minako said, folding her arms around Yukari and pushing herself up tightly up against her. \"I was just enjoying the sight of what I was about to glomp on to, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Yukari said, blushing. \"I knew there had to be another reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As stealthily as possible the three crept towards the door to their building, their passing marked by the soft padding of bare feet on stone and the slight jostling of their unbound breasts with every small movement. Minako risked exposing the space between her legs to carefully turn the doorknob, cringing with every little creek it made. As carefully as possible, she opened the door and ushered the others into the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Step one, complete.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what...is that...smell?\" Yukari asked, taking a moment to adjust her hands so that her arm continued to (barely) hide her pink nipples while freeing her hand so she could pinch her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells like smoke. A fire?\" Mitsuru asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....nope.\" Minako said, stifling a giggle. \"That's Fuuka. Fuuka making breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer companions blinked, then glanced at the kitchen, from which a trail of smoke did indeed waft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sad part is....I think she's getting better.

Minako, now fully taken over by her sadistic inner seductress, grabbed both girls by the hand and led them into the living area. No attempt was made to hide how naked they were, despite how much they might beg for it inside their own minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fuuuuuuuuuuka-chaaaaaaaaaaan!\" Minako sang out. \"I found some volunteers for your photoshoot!\"</span></div></div>",

The sight of her three teammates strolling through the dorm completely naked (and indeed, walking in a way that emphasized the sway of the hip and bounce of the breast) her immediate impulse was to give a small cry and dive back into the kitchen. She blinked a moment or two, then slowly pulled her head back out of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...Minako-chan! Yukari-chan! Mitsuru-senpai! Your...naked!\" She stuttered, as if hoping to inform them of an oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio laughed. \"Well, of course, Fuuka-chan. You wanted some subjects for your photo session. Well, I found some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka continued to stare. \"Your...naked! Right out in the main hallway! K-K-Ken is sleeping right above us! P-put something on before he catches you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at that. You were bold enough to have me take it off in public just a day ago, but now suddenly your all shy.\" Minako chided. \"Come on, Fuuka-chan!

I forgot how you managed to draw in those skanks that bullied you even without an evoker. Guess on some level you can read minds, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not easily. But...you all radiate wrongness!\" Fuuka said, backing into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka. Fuuka.

When you decided to abandon me the other night, you left me naked and helpless when the Dark Hour came! I got infected by the shadows, Fuuka-dear, and I've spread that on to Mitsuru and Yukari. You wouldn't BELIEVE what I've gone through. What we've all been through. And. It. Is. All. Your. Fault.\" Minako said, her red eyes glaring at Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....that...\" Fuuka said, wide eyed. \"That's a lie! Minako-chan forgave me right away for what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does that.\" Minako said, her face twisting in a scowl. \"She forgives, she listens, she gives and gives and gives. She let you talk her into stripping down, and she instantly forgave you when you said sorry. Did you ever stop to think that maybe, deep down, she's sick of it? You...you and all those damn people come to whine about your problems! You never ask what you can do for her or how she's feeling. You just take, take, TAKE!! And the bimbo is so dumb she thinks this is how it should be! She actually tries to convince herself that she enjoys solving all your problems and strengthening all your goddamn bonds. Blame it on everything that happened ten years ago- two dead parents and an emo big brother who ignored her, she got desperate. Now she think you losers are her family, and she's so very grateful for any scrap of friendship she gets tossed! Well...fuck that and fuck you! Your mine now. You are all mine! Temptation is giving the world to me! And all of you can goddamn well give me what I want from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMItsuru cleared her throat. Minako's face, contorted with rage, melted into a sickening smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Got ahead of myself there. Been feeling a little pent up. All I really wanted to mention, Fuuka, is that you made all this possible. Oh sure, I'm a little pissed. But really, I should thank you. And to show my gratitude, I'm going to put you through every humiliation we've had to suffer up until now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka cleared her throat. \"I don't think you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you've been talking, I've been gleaning information through my Persona.

And their Personas are still there, stifled and struggling, but still there. You don't represent everything about them.\" Fuuka said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. And with your own Persona you might be able to put them back in the driver's seat. Right? But Fuuka...I know everything she knows. I know all of you. Your pain. Your fears. Your darkest secrets.

Fuuka suddenly found herself surrounded by the three naked girls. Mitsuru and Yukari grabbed by her hands and pressed themselves up against either side of the girl (her arms sinking between their ample breasts). Minako smiled unnervingly as she dropped to her knees and lunged towards the dismayed girl. With alarming alacrity both of Minako's arms snaked behind Fuuka's legs and ran her nails nimbly along the back side of her ankles. With a sound half-way between a yelp and a giggle Fuuka found her body buckling underneath her. The three caught her with ease, each one pinning her hands and legs beneath them. Then their devilish work began in earnest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Mitsuru pulled her arms up and out, sitting on them while they began to tickle her neck and armpits. Fuuka gasped and began a litany of desperate pleas and protests, which fell entirely on deaf years. Minako sat on her legs, casually unbuckling her shoes and pulling off her socks despite how she fidgeted. The three were happy to torment her bare arms and feet for a little while, much to Fuuka's dismay. Then she felt the jacket of her student uniform being unzipped and pulled away from her body. She tried to resist, but unlike her three friends Fuuka had mostly been on the sidelines during their time in Tartarus. She lacked the strength and fighting experience the others had honed, and she could do little against their combined strength. Every time she tried to position her body in a way to prevent her clothing being stripped off the three would just torment her ticklish sides until she moved and the clothes were inched a little more off of her. Soon her skirt had joined her shoes and socks in a growing pile, while her jacket and shirt were unbuttoned and pulled yanked over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Fuuka-chan? Do you give up, or do I have to get serious?\" Minako asked idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...never let you win!\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Your going to make Minako sad, you know.\" Minako's other self chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie! She would never-\" Fuuka gasped as Minako ran her fingers along her sensitive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but she would. Maybe not the public humiliation bit, but the rest? Of course she wants you. Ever since she met all of you she's wanted nothing but to be as close to all of you as possible. She never dared to think sex might be included in all that. But now that the cat's out of the bag. Oh god yes! She wants to see you naked. She wants to watch you while you blush and writhe under her touch. She wants to know what you taste like.  Face it Fuuka-hun. Minako started up her own little harem here, neither of us are going to be satisfied until your a part of it.\" Minako smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's....\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still have your doubts. Check this out.\" Minako pressed her fingers against her own cheeks, which were bright red. \"This is from her. She's in my head, and she's just sooooo embarrassed that I'm telling you all this. But also excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Fuuka sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Minako said, bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one the three girls attacked the light blue underwear Fuuka wore. The bra was quickly dislodged and forced up over her head, leaving her pale breasts exposed and erect. Minako pulled the underwear off her hips. Then the three began tickling and playing with her body, pinching her nipples and running their hands down her bared flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, she's really wet down there.\" Yukari said, sounding impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Fuuka...we're going to need you if any of us are gonna survive this.\" Minako said softly, the girl squirming and quivering in front of her. \"Just say the word....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka, tears streaming down her blushing face, sucked in a breath. \"F-FINE! I give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl. And good girls get rewarded....\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one all three girls descended on Fuuka's body, their lips finding her exposed breasts and open slit. With surprising tenderness the three began suckling and kissing Fuuka's sensitive areas. In mere moments Fuuka was totally lost in the pleasure and the oncoming release as the three brought her to one orgasm after another. </span></div></div>",

And although it wasn't her fault, she still felt ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-ken-chan, w-we--\" She started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want your school uniforms, right? They delivered them this morning.\" Ken said, doing his best not to look at the naked foursome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh....yes! Yes! Let's go put them on!\" Minako said in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up.\" Ken advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat turned out to be an understatement. The new school \"uniforms\" turned out to consist of shirt like white collars with the familiar school ribbon, both tied around the neck (similar to the collar Aigis would wear when around Tartarus when there was no need to conceal her robotic parts. The other item was a pair of high heels and white socks that came up to the knees. A letter said that the girls were allowed to wear their own shoes if the basic design added at least as much to their height and curve of their bodies as the shoes (which meant only Mitsuru and her knee high spiked boots could substitute anything out). Belts and jewelry were permitted, but no concealing clothing would be allowed as such could cause the effects of Eden Syndrome to worsen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako cringed. The uniforms did NOTHING to hide their naked bodies. Indeed, the shoes only added to her general feeling of humiliation, forcing her to walk more carefully and with a sexy sway to her hips while arching the curve of her body in way that emphasized her most embarrassing parts! The collar also did nothing for her, the bow being too short to even offer a glimmer of cover for her breasts. If anything, the pieces of clothing she was being allowed to wear only reminded her all the more of how naked she was elsewhere! To make matters still worse, their backpacks laden with books and SEES equipment forced them to arch their backs, thrusting their ample chests out for all to see (the straps on the backpack also squeezed the breasts together slightly, making them thrust out and bounce even more, especially for the well-endowed Mitsuru and Yukari).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....Ken...\" Minako called. \"We...we are having a meeting after school tonight. Meet us at the building. We're going to try to solve this....umm...situation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen nodded. Then the door shut, leaving four very lovely ladies to stand naked in the cold morning air.What now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minako stared at the closed door to her dorm. Funny how she had never noticed just how solid a barrier it looked when shut and locked. Swallowing hard she turned around. She and her entourage of naked SEES students found themselves standing on the front steps of their dorm, a busy sidewalk and street in front of them. On occasion a car would pass by, usually honking its horn as if to confirm for the girls that they were indeed entirely naked and expected to make their way in such a humiliating state all the way across town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let's g-\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Fuuka said suddenly. \"We're...not really going to do this, are we? We're all naked here! This is just...some awful nightmare, isn't it? We don't actually have to stay this way, do we??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe protest seemed to paralyze the group. The others were far from used to have their secrets exposed and on display, but they were attempting to stifle their own panic as best they could and soldier on. Fuuka, of course, had had no opportunity to experience the futility of the situation. For her the embarrassment was still fresh, and her questions only served to bring back memories of their nightmarish ordeal thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Actually...perhaps...\" Mitsuru began. \"Perhaps there is something....we can spare Yamagishi some of this shame. She and I can ride my bike to school. Yes! You will take the train and we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA WHOA WHOA! Why exactly to *I* have to ride a crowded train full of perverts, huh?\" Yukari demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting we leave Fuuka-chan here to suffer that fate?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I'm suggesting you let me and her take your bike while you and Minako-chan tough it out like a good Senpai and team leader should! Sacrifice for the good of your juniors!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Don't be absurd. Its my bicycle. No one can operate it except me.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, I can.\" Minako said. \"You did give me the spare key, Mitsuru-senpai. And I do have a learners permit. I can take care of Fuuka-chan while you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not.\" Mitsuru snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just don't want to ride the train!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want access to the bike just for Fuuka's sake, I suppose!\" Mitsuru snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the longer we stand here the more time we waste and the more people see us like this!\" Minako snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is precisely why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud snapping sound tore through the small street corner. Every eye turned to see Fuuka hunched over the bike, an important looking piece of the engine cracked open in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka! What on Earth have you-\" Mitsuru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't stand to see all of my 'friends' fighting, senpai.\" Fuuka said, her voice subtly different. \"We can't leave each other behind like that! We should all suffer this humiliation together. So I decided to...heh heh...remove temptation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako balled her hands into a fist. She was more than familiar with this phenomena. \"Yeah. You got us good. Now go away. We need to take Fuuka to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I just got here...'leader'. Why would I want to leave so soon?\" Asked the thing that had taken over Fuuka, her eyes flashing with an ice cold air the real girl never displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your holding up the show. We're going to be humiliated on the train, right? That's your job, right? Temptation or whatever it is won't be happy if you don' stick to its schedule.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around.\" Fuuka snapped. Immediately (and to her own surprise) Minako obeyed. \"Bend over.\" The red eyed girl did as instructed, adopting a sensual pose that put her bottom and vagina on display while letting her breasts hang freely in front of her. \"You two, do the same pose, either side of her. Squeeze in close.\" Mitsuru and Yukari immediately assumed the same pose on either side of Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a little free advice, girls...don't ever give me orders or try to manipulate me. Little Fuuka might put up with that. I won't. I'm tired of it.\" Not-Fuuka whispered as she began to foddle the three girl's butt cheeks. \"Bullying won't get you anywhere with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deft swat, the naked blue haired girl began to spank the assembled ass cheeks in front of her. Before long all three were a rosey shade of red. A crowd was forming around the four girls. Someone was taking pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we...\" Mitsuru began, trembling with the pain and helpless frustration. \"We never bullied Yamagishi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooh Senpai. That's a lie. We both know it. You pressured her and manipulated her from the start. You needed her for your little monster hunting society. You withheld information. You pleaded. You did everything short of force her to comply. Just because she was a weak little girl that took your abuse with a smile and accepted her role like the simpering meek little thing she is doesn't mean she was blind to what you were doing to her. And just because she forgave you doesn't mean I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I tried to....we tried to make sure...\" Yukari began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother, Yukari-CHAN. You made a show of concern over the pressure they were putting on me, but you were happy to turn around and use me to hack into their little database the first chance you got. I was always more a tool than a friend to you.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not eek!\" Yukari said as she felt slender fingers slip into her inner folds and gently manipulate her clitoris. Mitsuru let out a frustrated moan as Fuuka's other hand began to play with her in a similar fashion. Minako groaned as she felt a tongue lap against her exposed sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay.\" Fuuka whispered. \"I've been bullied my whole life. Before all of you came along the closest thing I had to a friend trapped me in a supply closet and abandoned me there for hours. But we all know how that story ended. Those bitches got pulled into Tartarus by the shadows. Their little ring leader was scared into being all friendly with me from then on. That's such a rush, you know? Sooner or later all my tormentors will get what they deserve. I'll get control...and I can be a gentle mistress when I want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sure and deft fingers used to the fine art of typing and programing (aided by a surprisingly agile tongue) Fuuka very quickly brought all three girls to a panting, passionate mess as an orgasm was building up within them. And then...she stopped, leaving all three girls gasping on the edge of release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentle can be cruel in its own way, though.\" Fuuka said with a smile, casually wiping her hands on Minako's exposed ass. \"You've had some pretty big climaxes so far. I think that's enough fun for one day. You won't be cumming again until I say so. Now.....stand up. Hands at your side. No covering anything. We have a train to catch.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk from the dorms to the train station, normally a quick and uneventful affair, seemed to take an eternity for the unfortunate four. They drew stares from every person that crossed their path and the honking of cars they'd experienced in front of the dormitory never let up so long as they were in sight of the road. To make matters worse, Fuuka's return to her senses after being controlled by the perverse shadow had left the shy girl an apologetic wreck the entire journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I couldn't control my body! And the words that came out of my mouth, they... it was an exaggeration!\" Fuuka explained meekly for what felt like the thousandth time. \"Just... thoughts I have but immediately dismiss. I don't really feel so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka. Calm down.\" Yukari said in exasperation as she cut Fuuka off. \"The three of us have been there before, so we know you're telling the truth. Just take a deep breath, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka seemed to take that advice to heart, quieting down and taking slow, deep breaths. The other girls couldn't help but notice how the exercise helped accentuate Fuuka's chest as it rose and fell steadily, but did their best to keep their thoughts under control. There were far more important things to worry about after all... like their impending train ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the deal.\" Minako began as she turned to face her friends. \"We agreed to help Fuuka-chan through this to the best of our abilities. That means we try to make this ride as bearable for her as possible. I think I know how we can manage that, and it should even make things a bit easier for the rest of us too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, following Minako's plan, the group found themselves in their current situation. Fuuka stood in the center of a small triangle formed by the other three, their bodies shielding her own from view. Rather than face the crowds full frontal, Yukari, Minako, and Mitsuru all stood facing Fuuka, deciding it was better for the car full of people to see their bare asses than let them ogle everything else for the duration of the ride. This did, however, result in Fuuka's face always finding itself nuzzled between to breasts no matter where she tried to look, and the shy girl's face and occasionally her lips brushing against their nipples didn't exactly make things comfortable for the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yamagishi, please try to stay still!\" Mitsuru whispered as she held back a moan. Fuuka's lips had again run against one of the redhead's nipples as the train took a turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm trying! The car's so shaky today...\" Fuuka muttered in apology. \"Maybe I'm just used to sitting down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako realized Fuuka had a point. The ride did seem unusually bumpy today. Maybe it was just nerves and hormones doing a number on her perception, or maybe something was up with the car...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minako felt her heart skip a beat as a loud rumble rippled through the train. Her mind created a vivid image of the train grinding to a halt, the power going out and leaving the foursome in pitch darkness, trapped and helpless to do anything but pressed tightly against one another for however many hours it would take to repair. Fortunately, fate did not appear to be that cruel. Or merciful, depending on how one looked at the situation (the train was, after all, speeding them to their ultimate humiliation, to wander their school naked for all their friends, associates, and teachers to see!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess fortunately, Minako was becoming increasingly aware of three major problems with her plan. The first, as previously explained, was that the jostling train was causing no end of embarrassingly close contact between her and her girl friends. With one hand tightly gripping the hand loop intended to support standing passengers on the train, the other was devoted to helping to keep Fuuka steady during the journey. But the girl had a penchant for making contact with Minako's body in humiliatingly erotic way. Of course, she wasn't the only one. The girls were standing shoulder to shoulder and hip to hip, which meant one side of Minako's breasts, hips, legs and pressed and squeezed against the equivalent anatomy of Mitsuru on her left and Yukari on her right. Every little sway caused the girls to squeeze and press their bare skin against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second problem was related to the first. Her experience in the cab was clearly not an isolated incident, because the skin on skin contact of her teammates and loves was frankly driving Minako crazy with suppressed desire. The enslavement of their minds wasn't enough, apparently. Now the simplest of touches shared between the three was enough to induce a mild feeling of arousal. The contact they were making now had left her nipples erect and wanting attention, her inner folds sopping wet, and her mind filled with dirty thoughts. Every few moments she found herself foddling Fuuka's cute little body with her free hand, and each time found it harder to stop herself. Fuuka's own hands kept ossilating between hugging the trio for support and feeling up their intimate places. As the journey continued, Minako became aware that Fuuka's accidental contact with her (and the other girl's) sensitive breasts was becoming more prolonged and erotic- what began as an occasional brush had evolved into a brief kiss or lick which in turn became a prolonged suckle, nibble, and pull on the sensitive orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there were the other people. Packed in like sardines, pressed up against her fellow SEES members, Minako was very much aware that she was incapable of moving in any other direction without contacting some stranger (mostly middle aged buisnessmen). And while her plan made an effective bulwark against eyes and hands on many of their assets, it did nothing to save their backs and especially their butts. Minako had been subjected to a sea of lewd hands on both her cheeks since the journey began. Keeping her legs pressed tightly together had prevented any molestation of her inner folds, but she had become aware of several attempts by wandering digits to probe the inside of her butt...some had succeeded, to her white hot shame. At first she had simply been angry and embarrassed by the ordeal. But as her willpower had eroded she found the experience of endless groping and touching...almost exhilarating. Here she was, barely able to move, embarrassed beyond belief, and possibly more horny than she had ever been in her entire life. There was some strange, terrible appeal being that way forever- on display, unable to move, nothing more than the play thing to countless unknown stranger's erotic desires. Was this what Temptation wanted her to become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the ride was over and the station was blaring the name of their school. The foursome began to move, lost in a haze of shame and sexual delirium, stumbling incoherently through the crowd, out into the bright light of the morning sun. Minako wobbled forward on unsteady legs, feeling as if she had forgotten how to walk. Her day was just beginning.</span></div></div>",

Blinking she turned and gasped in surprise to see Theo standing before her, dressed in the prim and proper attire of the velvet room, his eyes politely averted and his stance waiting patiently to draw her attention. Minako's surprise quickly became embarrassed as she once again remembered her state of dress (as well as noticing that as much as Theo was attempting to look away he couldn't help but occasionally take a glance at her exposed charms). She quickly covered herself as much as possible with her hands. Theo contritely turned his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Theo? What are you doing here?\" Minako gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I was asked to deliver a message on behalf of my siblings.\" Theo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Elizabeth...and Margaret? Why didn't they come themselves? Did...did something happen to them? Did Igor hurt them last night?\" Minako asked with sudden worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt? Goodness no. My master is strict, but he is not cruel. They have indeed been disciplined. But they are perfectly healthy. Just...well...\" Theo cleared his throat. \"It is difficult to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the message?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please meet them after school in the courtyard near the Persimmon Tree. More or less the entire message.\" Theo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't Elizabeth mention this herself? She could have just called me.\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not an option. My sisters have sadly been banished from the Velvet Room for the time being. Their ability to contact you directly was largely dependent on the will of my master. Without access, they would have to make use of the mundane ways of communication you humans rely upon. And...well, as you might expect, our faculty for such devices is...limited.\" Theo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't explain why Elizabeth isn't here now....Theo, what did Igor really do to them? This makes no sense, and its starting to scare me...\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheo sighed. \"Perhaps they can explain it in person. If you will follow me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, Mitsuru, and Fuuka were watching the exchange after noticing that Minako had fallen behind. Mitsuru was watching in confusion, Yukari stared on with a mix of consternation and jealousy, and Fuuka with a growing sense of utter terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who the heck is Mr. Beefcake over there?\" Yukari hissed to Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. Another close friend of our leader, I presume.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems to get around a lot.\" Yukari said darkly. \"So how long does she expect us to stand around here completely NAKED while she chats with her little boyfriend over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her boyfriend? I was fairly certain she wasn't seeing anyone in that capacity since...well, not we lost Shinjiro. Until yesterday, of course.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Then who the heck IS he?\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's human.\" Fuuka finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Wait, what?\" Yukari and Mitsuru said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can feel his power. Even without my persona, I can sense it! He's much more dangerous than he appears to be! And...\" Fuuka pointed at a pillar near the staircase leading out of the station. \"He's not alone. There's someone here even stronger....no, two people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....That's it, I'm going over there.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that's-\" Mitsuru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The LAST time we left her by herself she got zapped by that creepy Temptation guy! I'm not just gonna stand around when there's a potential threat!\" Yukari snapped, turning her head back to glare at the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka visibly blanched and hung her head at her friend's declaration. Yukari bit her lip, remembering too late who exactly at done the 'abandoning' that began this whole nightmare. Momentarily struggling to formulate an apology, Yukari closed her eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two just go on ahead to school, okay? I'll keep an eye on Minako and we'll catch up as we can. Our leader seems to know this guy, so there's probably nothing to worry about. And if trouble breaks out I'll make sure we make it out in one piece.\" Yukari said quickly, turning her back on her two nude friends and running after her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glanced as Fuuka, who in turn watched Yukari retreat off into the distance. She shook her head. Usually, Takeba's boundless energy and ability to express her emotions so easily was a point the icy Kirijo girl admired. On the other hand, there was something to be said for tact and nuance as well. Placing a hand on Fuuka's shoulder, Mitsuru whispered. \"She doesn't mean to imply anything. None of us blame you for this. She's just being overly protective of our leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm?\" Fuuka said, breaking her intense stare placed upon Yukari and blinking at Mitsuru before blushing from head to toe. \"Oh. Yes. What she said. I'm all right. It wasn't...ummm...well, I wasn't dwelling on it or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why were you....\" Mitsuru studied the shorter girl for a moment before laughing with understanding. \"I see. Yes. I also find it difficult not to stare when she leave. Her derriere is a thing of beauty, especially in motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka nodded and blushed. \"And...she's not the only one! I just can't stop staring at...at any of you! You all look so graceful and beautiful! It makes no sense, senpai! How can I have lived with all of you for so long and only now...appreciate this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It appears that bi-sexuality and heightened promiscuity are a universal trait among victims of 'Eden's Syndrome'. And yet, what I feel...first towards Minako-chan, and now for Yukari-chan and you feels far too genuine to be implanted by a shadow. Perhaps working together for so long, routinely barring our souls as Persona, perhaps we developed these feelings on our own and Temptation has merely swept aside our inhibitions and doubts so that they could fully take root? In any case...I admit the obscene thoughts that keep entering my mind and the sight of all of you can be...distracting. And embarrassing. But the feelings themselves? I refuse to feel ashamed of them! You all have your flaws and quirks, but you are each beautiful and passionate in your own way. My...recent interest is simply a new way of appreciating that truth.\" Mitsuru mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-senpai.\" Fuuka said softly in admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go?\" Mitsuru said, offering the younger girl an arm which Fuuka happily took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...what on Earth is going on here?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theo...you are an idiot.\" Elizabeth declared, hiding what appeared to be her naked body behind the pillar of the train station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this was a foolish plan.\" Margaret said sternly, hiding behind both the pillar and her younger sister with her arms clasped against her body, likewise naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My master has decided to teach my sisters a lesson in humility. For the duration of your...curse neither Elizabeth nor Margaret is allowed to enter the Velvet Room nor adorn themselves with any form of clothing.\" Theo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still do not see why I had to suffer the same fate.\" Elizabeth said in consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's done is done, sister. We will need to find a way to...perform our duties despite the circumstances.\" Margaret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a blush? Theo, look! I think she's blushing! Could it be that our cool headed elder sister has learned the ways of human emotion at last!\" Elizabeth taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako sighed in relief and exasperation. The denizens of the Velvet Room were perfectly all right. Merely placed in a similar situation as herself and up to their usual chaotic shenanigans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. That's enough. Thank you for the message. I'm glad your both safe. Sorry for your...punishment, even if I was only tangentially responsible. I'll meet you all tonight. Oh, and Margaret?\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Margaret snapped, turning her attention away from bickering with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its kind of a lost cause trying to hide like that. People will see it all eventually. They get all kinds of little glimpses even while you try to hide it. With breasts as big as yours its pretty much impossible to hide. By the way....very nice. I'm sure your client is a lucky guy. Or girl.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret turned a scarlet hue that easily surpassed her sister's blushes. \"That's not..!..we aren't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a compliment, sister! Take it as such!\" Elizabeth said. \"Although the implication doesn't amuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to implying anything, Elizabeth. I've always thought your breasts were fantastic.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well! I withdraw my complaint.\" Elizabeth nodded with satisfaction, then slowly began to blush as if only realizing the implications of the statement in retrospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, see you later!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there you are!\" Yukari said. \"Everything all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Never better. Just making sure things are coming together.\" Minako said with a smile. The Velvet trio had vanished behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The inspiring words of love and affirmation Mitsuru had spoken gave the couple a new spur of energy and confidence as they marched towards Gekkoukan Highschool. And that new found hope lasted through a good twenty or thirty steps before reality managed to erode their convictions into dust. After passing a dozen pedestrians, all staring at her with looks of horror, lust, and contempt Fuuka moved closer to her senpai, her hand-holding becoming more like clinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mitsuru-senpai....\" She moaned in misery as the citizens of Port Island gaped at her nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right, Yamagi-gishi.\" Mitsuru said, valiantly forcing a steely calm into her words that almost hid the pit of mortification in her stomach..before her voice cracked and betrayed her real mental state. \"Just ignore them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....but...\" Fuuka said, turning red and closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their stares..don't matter...in the least.\" Mitsuru said, through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair attempted to stride down the road, looking down and refusing to meet anyone's eyes. Still, the frequent click of a camera phone or contemptuous snicker could not be entirely blocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I knew Gekkoukan had some hotties, but...just damn! What do they put in the water??\"<br>\r\n\"No argument there! But don't you feel a little bad for em? They're some of those Eden Syndrome chicks, right? They basically gotta strip off like this 24-7, right? That's gotta suck.\"<br>\r\n\"Tch. Relax man. Your overthinking it. Besides, look at em a little closer! Those gorgeous titties have their nips standing like they're begging ta be sucked! And check it out! Something's peeking out down stairs too! Those two are the center of attention and they are LUVIN it. I'll bet that's how you catch the illness to begin with. Chickas that these are the type to look down on guys who check em out but secretly get off on the attention. Closet sluts and secret exhibitionists, all of em! But see, now they have no where and nothing left to hide! Heh. Whole world knows what kind of girls they really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru and Fuuka stopped dead in their tracks. Despite their resolve, the loud back and forth easily penetrated their defenses and hit their already raw nerves. The fact that their bodies were indeed highly aroused made hearing the comments no easier. Their hands immediately attempted to hide the evidence of their lust from their audience (though by some instinct the pair kept their arms entwined even as they used them to hide their nudity...a lingering sign of mutual affection, perhaps).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates of the school loomed up before them. Taking a deep breath, Mitsuru began to cross the threshold, but suddenly found herself pushed against the brick pillar that separated the school from the rest of the city. Fuuka was pressing herself tightly against her senpai, all the while shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it! Curse or not, I can't go in there! Not like this! Not when everyone will look at me!\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamagishi....\" Mitsuru whispered. The blue haired girl's natural shyness seemed to allow her to express the emotions burning inside the red haired girl more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I feel the same way. If I had any way to prevent this...\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! I just can't! I'm going to faint! I'll die from embarrassment! I can't survive like this!!\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can and you will.\" Mitsuru said firmly. \"I will see to it. You aren't alone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka buried her face between Mitsuru's generous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamagishi...what you said before...what the other you said before...\" Mitsuru began softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! Senpai, I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be all right if you truly felt that way. Especially towards me. I was...very insistent. We needed you. I needed you. I made a promise to help my father a long time ago. I have...very driven since then. I've only lately begun to...fully consider how hard I push others with that drive. If you did resent SEES, even a little, I would not be offended. All I would ask is that you direct your ire towards me and not your fellow members. It was, after all, because of me that the group exists at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...! That's not...why are you saying this now? We're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it needs to be said and gotten out of the way.\" Mitsuru said firmly. \"The...other me acts as if...none of you matter. I don't want to any of you to believe that is true. You've done so much for us, Fuuka. You need to know we're grateful. If anyone is responsible for this disgraceful situation, it most assuredly is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai. Stop.\" Fuuka said, hugging her tightly. \"I know all of that. And this...this is the first time I've done anything really important. I don't care what that other me says. I've never been so...Its been good being able to help with something that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamagishi...\" Mitsuru whispered. \"I'm glad. But don't feel as if you have to push yourself harder to...keep up with us all. We'll walk together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Fuuka said. \"S-sorry for panicking. After being cornered in Tartarus, something as simple as...as being...shouldn't...errr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree. Facing death is one thing. Moving into a situation where we have no weapons, no power...no clothes? Being so completely vulnerable without any means to escape or fight back? This is...much worse than the Dark Hour.\" Mitsuru whispered. \"Besides, I know better than anyone how...difficult it can be providing support for the others. None of them fully realize that the psychic links work both ways. We can hear their thoughts as easily as they can hear our instructions and analysis. The frequent annoyance and little barbs...the others don't know how often we can hear them. Objectively, I know they don't mean the things we hear them think, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes...but its not their fault, either. They never had to censor their own thoughts before.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless....\" Mitsuru said. \"It was...stressful, looking them in the eye and ignoring the things they thought of me. Yukari could be especially vicious in the early days. That's just one more reason I'm grateful to you. You seem much more adept at...shouldering those comments. I found them...difficult to forgive now and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...that's...\" Fuuka blushed deeply. \"Please stop. Your the amazing ones. Your personas are so powerful and durable. All I can do is watch. I feel so pathetic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't! That's what I mean. Don't ever think for a second that your efforts are unappreciated. I am grateful to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered that last part with a strange intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In point of fact...if you still don't believe me...I think I may just have to show you....\" Mitsuru said, squeezing Fuuka's butt as she spoke. \"Mortifying as it is, this change in our status does allow for certain methods of expression where words might fail....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Fuuka gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later tonight, expect a through demonstration of my gratitude.\" Mitsuru smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you...\" Fuuka stuttered, then suddenly firmly kissed Mitsuru on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stayed locked in that intense embrace for several moments, Mitsuru moaning and growling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-or our bastard puppetmasters can force me to show you right here and now!\" Mitsuru said in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo! They can't! We're in public!\" Fuuka moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I'm sure serves as the whole point!\" Mitsuru whimpered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The usual hum of student activity and random bits of gossip taking in place fell silent as hundreds of stunned high schoolers watched as two naked girls strode through the center of the courtyard. Mitsuru and Fuuka walked without a hint of shame or modesty, making no attempt to cover themselves. Indeed, their steps were carefully paced to bring an small but noticeable bounce to their breasts and bottoms while at the same time moving their hips from side to side in a sexy fashion. Their faces, in contrast, were beat red and wide eyed, clearly dismayed at all the attention. When they reached the center of the school yard and confirmed with a quick glance that EVERY eye was on them, the pair let their backpacks slide off their shoulders and fall to the ground with a nearly simultaneous impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsu-\" Fuuka gasped even as two lips met hers in a hungry embrace. Were they really going to be forced to do this in public?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do something.\" Fuuka said even as she felt her body being felt up. \"Maybe I can...I can't summon Juno in the real world, but if I can just call up even a little bit of her power to contact Mitsuru-senpai's mind I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother.\" Came a voice from nowhere that sounded like Mitsuru's own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Fuuka asked and promptly fell down as her limbs were suddenly back under her control. There was a roar of laughter at her expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were going to try to distract me telepathically so that I would release her body. Nice try. But I've gotten rather used to humiliating the fake me by now. I can do it and hold a conversation all at once now. Are you impressed?\" Came the voice from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka quickly grabbed her backpack, used it as a shield for her modesty and sat on the ground in order to hide the rest of her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone!\" The real Mitsuru said, now slowly moving in a circle as her hands moved up and down hr body. \"This is your class president! Y-you are all likely wondering why I am standing before you...a-all of you...without my clothes!\" Mitsuru paused with a hand on her hip and the other in her hair, chest thrust out. \"A-and why I am...p-posing so shamefully for you...\" She turned again, her hands squeezing her breasts together before traveling down to her spreading legs. \"O-o-o-or why I am now p-p-playing with myself in front of you all!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of laughter and several camera flashes answered her. \"STOP THAT AT ONCE! As I was saying, there is a simple explanation! As you may know, a new form of Apathy Syndrome has emerged. Eden Syndrome is afflicting some of your fellow female students. As you may infer, it compels the individual to...expose themselves and perform a variety of disgraceful activities in public. If you see any students like myself please remember they are innocent victims of this disease and respectfully avert your eyes and go about your business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, followed by several more camera flashes. \"I SAID STOP THAT! AS PRESIDENT I AM ORDERING YOU TO PUT AWAY YOUR CAMERAS AND GO TO CLASS! I WILL EXECUTE ANYONE WHO FAILS TO COMPLY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to take the threat seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at her. Once she walked through this campus as if it were her own little kingdom, an icy queen above her little subjects. Now the little queen has lost her crown, and she's more lowly than any of her little pawns!\" The other Mitsuru whispered in Fuuka's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stop this. How much more are you going to humiliate her??\" Fuuka asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever, if Temptation is kind.\" The voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can I move now?\" Fuuka demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked your better self for a favor. Unlike the real you and the others, I don't particularly enjoy the domination we have over all of you. Even pawns deserve better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What pawns? What are you talking about?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you, of course. She's the queen, your her pawns. That's how she sees the world.\" replied the Other Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Mitsuru was bending over and deliberately giving everyone an incredible view of her ass and vagina. She unzipped her bag and to her own dismay prominently held up a two sided dildo with a snake like appearance and a great deal of flexibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until yesterday she believed this was a back massager as the box claimed. She had no idea they are called such for legal reasons. Sex toys are only the tip of the ice berg with this one. She's dangerous ignorant of the world outside her walls. Pathetic! She takes such pride in her grace and beauty yet deign to perform her infamous little executions on those who show interest! A liar and a hypocrite! But what can you expect from a Kirijo? Their legacy is built on lies and suffering. Her grandfather built a monument to his pride and sins ten years ago. They named it Tartarus. But the crimes of the Kirijos are hidden behind a dark hour no one can see. That won't do! People died, and her family grows rich and powerful! She pretends to seek redemption, but happily spreads lies to cover for her family. She's no better than the rest. So why not let her answer for her crimes? Rip away the crown. Send the Kirijo reputation down in flames. Let the prudish little slut atone for the past. Her dignity and her body are her greatest sources of pride. And pride cometh before the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding the flexible dildo in half so that both heads were pointing upward, Mitsuru proceeded to insert the instrument fully into herself to much cheering and camera work. With a gasp she flicked the switch and felt the monster vibrate within her. Looking out over the audience, Mitsuru half leapt and half hobbled to a glasses wearing student who could do nothing but stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes at once!\" Mitsuru ordered, even as she grasped his hands. With utter horror, she guided him up to her breasts, pressing the orbs into his unbelieving grip and even encouraging him to squeeze by pressing her own hands over his. She latched onto another student next to him, pulling his hand up against her ass. A cheer went up from the crowd as she gestured to everyone with her fingers to come closer. A line began to form as she was felt up by one student after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To all those she has punished for longing for her body she will now give free access. Let the punishment fit the crime. Here now is the EXECUTION of Kirijo Mitsuru. May her time as the plaything of the peasants be long and shameful! The Queen is dead! Long live the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mitsuru's litany of protests became more strangled and shocked until they pettered out into a lusty series of mewling pleas and moans (making it entirely unclear if she was begging for the student body to stop or continue). Her hands were raised behind her head, her fingers interlocked where the touched her neck. Her legs were spread as far apart as she could manage while maintaining a standing position. Her chest and butt were somehow pushing themselves in opposite directions, presenting her assets for the inspection of anyone who wished to. And to Mitsuru's display, that list was long. It seemed as if every part of her, from her luxurious breasts to her round bottom to her toned stomach. thighs, hips...everywhere hands groped, felt, played, slapped, pinched and pulled. Some gently, others painfully. The impish device she had secured inside her did not help an iota. It had awakened every sense, making her nerves alive and sensitive to another's touch. To be on display, manhandled and played with by the very students she had studiously kept clear of perversion with a few well placed threats and punishment....that was disgraceful enough! But to find this shameful, disgraceful display of wanton perversion even a little pleasant or erotic was...was...clearly Temptation had inserted these vile thoughts in her mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now she's making excuses for herself. As if Temptation can do more than awaken the naughty thoughts she already has hiding in that disgraceful mind.\" The Other Mitsuru continued to gossip inside Fuuka's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this!\" Fuuka said, experiencing embarrassment and outrage and several naughty thoughts of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. She has gone too long inflicted her twisted sense of justice and decency on the world. What makes her exempt? Her execution has only just begun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then...then I'll stop you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Ha. Heh heh heh heh! You? The meek little mouse hiding in her safety bubble of a persona, capable of nothing but hiding and intel? The fragile little waif who couldn't ride one train without burdening her comrades in nude to form a shield for her? The girl who even now is trying desperately to cover up her pale little boy, unaware that the boys behind her have been getting candid shots of her nether regions while she watched my other's humiliation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what?\" Fuuka gave a small cry of terror as she glanced behind her to find a trio of cell phones pointed at low angles on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping to her feet, Fuuka did a dance of shame as she attempted to hide all of her at once and found herself lacking the necessary number of hands. Her bouncy butt eventually became the martyr for the dignity of her chest and nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you....stop it!\" She gave a mental call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BE QUIET, PAWN!! OBEY YOUR NEW QUEEN AND LEAVE THIS ONE TO HER FATE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka took in several breaths and strode towards Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Then expect to be punished next. Not that anything you do could even be effective. As if your petty actions could even convince me to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strength that surprised everyone, Fuuka included, the blue haired girl yanked her senpai free of the grasping hands and spun her around. There was an immense GASP from the crowd as Fuuka's lips were planted firmly against Mitsuru. The stunned silence was broken moments later by sporadic cheers, taunts, and cell phone flashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....All right, pawn. I'll indulge you. Make it entertaining.\" The Other Mitsuru said with bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yamagishi???\" Mitsuru said, reeling from the sudden absence of total sensation into the singular yet more delightful sensation of a tongue exploring her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mitsuru-senpai. Its me...\" Fuuka said simply, moving in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan, no.\" Mitsuru protested, her will to protest almost entirely drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mitsuru-senpai.\" Fuuka whispered before kneeling before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka!\" Mitsuru said more desperately and loudly. \"Don't you dare! Don't...don't make me execute you!\" She screamed her old fallback threat even as she again assumed her \"inspection\" pose, displaying her gorgeous body to Fuuka. Yamagishi's newly awakened sense of lust and the close proximity gave her the sense that she was in the presence of a love goddess. And what else was she to do if not worship it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka pressed her lips firmly on Mitsuru's clit, while her small hands claimed the vibrator within her and began gently moving it in and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya-yamaGISHIIIIIII!\" Mitsuru screamed, her insides erupting and her knees grown too week to stay standing. As she stumbled, Fuuka guided her to a sitting position. Despite how her own cheeks burned, Fuuka crawled up into Mitsuru's lap, pulling one end of the two headed dildo free as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamagishi...no...so...humiliating!\" Mitsuru gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm so sorry. I don't know if this is better than what they did to you before. But...you don't...deserve...to suffer alone! And I don't need to hide behind you!\" Fuuka declared as she inserted the powerful dildo into herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair began a tight embrace, Fuuka rhythmically moving up and down the length of the instrument within her rubbing her smaller breasts against her senpai's sensitive orbs. All the while, the pair made a studious exploration of the other's mouth. If there was anyone left in the crowd who had not activated their cell phone's camera, that ended now. To all but the fools who had not charged their devices the intimate dance taking place between the two students was recorded moment by moment from roughly 200 separate angles for the delight and fascination of the assembled student body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I knew Mitsuru-senpai's body was something else...but who knew what a hot little thing that Yamagishi's been hiding all this time?\" One student spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who could tell with all those frumpy clothes she wore? The ghost-girl never did have any fashion sense.\" Another chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Lucky for her then. Way I heard it, Eden Syndrome chicks have to stay naked all the time. No more fashion disaster from her. Unless you count shoes and socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Lucky for us all, you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda surprised ghost-girl is taking the lead. Always figured Kirijo would be the one on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come up, man. Look at those two. With those tits and ass, our Student President would break Yamagishi like a twig. If she didn't smother her to death first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Yeah! Still impressed Yamagishi has so much...vigor, though. Didn't know she was into sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blushed at the commentary. In truth, she was mostly a recluse who kept to herself. But Tanaka's Sunday shopping channel kept her supplied with an array of useful and strange gadgets. Some, like her ab machine, were designed specifically to exercise her body without the actual exercise. Others....were more adult oriented and challenged her endurance in ways very much relevant to the current situation. And like the ab machine, she had occasionally found herself...stuck to the device for an extended period of time. Thankfully Natsuki had been discreet about having to extricate her. Of course, that didn't extend to reminding her of the incidents any time she felt the need to embarrass her blue haired friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now they were tentatively making their way down the length of Gekkoukan's outer wall, one hand holding their bookbags to provide some scant protection from passing drivers on the left while the other covered their breasts. The sidewalk was busy with gawking strangers, and the humiliation was so intense that at times one girl or the other just came to a dead stop, pressing their legs together and cringing in red faced dismay.But the ordeal was better than facing their assembled schoolmates, let alone the endless shame of a public orgasm. And Minako knew a short cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And if some of you are wondering why they are carrying bookbags like one would expect a japanese schoolgirl to rather than backpacks as the author stated in a previous part of this story, the answer is shut up.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Minako said at last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blinked.

It will suck, but its way better than going straight through the front.\" Minako explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our bookbags?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them here. I'll get them when you get to class.\" Minako smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sighed, and began climbing up the ladder. Minako smiled to herself. From head to foot all Yukari had on was a stylized neck collar similar to Aigis' with her school ribbon, the heart shaped choker she wore, and the combo of her brown shoes over her long black stockings with the white trim. Otherwise, there was nothing hiding her incredible body from the world, from her large bouncing breasts sporting their erect pink nipples to the well honed body from long periods of diet and working out to the truly breathtaking site of her flawless round ass gently swaying from side to side as she ascended. Minako couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you coming or are you just going to stare??\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Both, probably.\" Minako said as she began moving up the ladder, raising her head up so that she had a clear view of Yukari's nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't be a pervert!\" Yukari snapped again, glaring and blushing at Minako attention and her own inability to cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Sorry, sorry! But isn't a little late for that? Besides...no jury would convict me anyway!\" Minako said happily...and kept her eyes firmly on Yukari and the interesting way her progress made parts of her waste wiggle in a hypnotic way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez! You...you're getting as bad as Junpei! Why can't you be nice and look away like you did back on the train?\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I was supposed to look away? I thought that was just Junpei.\" Minako said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you didn't...\" Yukari muttered then grew redder. She stopped talking, but the extra loud 'clang' her foot gave each metal rung as she climbed up broadcast her disapproval. Minako snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your honor, I stand before you a humble japanese school girl. I've a simple life, homework, dog walking, shadow fighting...yes, some days are stranger than others. But whatever else I may be...I am merely human! I am capable of terrible evil, as all people are, but also a great love. Is it not within us all to feel, no, to be made to feel, nothing less than an abiding awe and fascination for the boundless beauty of nature?\" Minako began speaking as if to an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" Yukari whispered, stopping her climb and resting her forehead on one of the rungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus, I present exhibit A! This is my girlfriend...and more importantly, my girlfriend's magnificent ass! I know I am a biased observer, your honor, but if you will indulge me, I will prove today this is no mere butt! This...entity, surpasses the very laws of physics in its perfection! Time and space have no meaning as one stares into those amazing cheeks.\" Minako continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Yukari squeeled, in annoyance and a hint of amused pleasure as she began climbing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the journey consisted of Minako's 'defense', in which she strove to prove how perfect her companion's southern assets were in great detail, extolling size and shape and the small beauty mark on the left cheek. By the time they reached the top, Yukari was red from head to toe and a roiling bread of embarrassment, anger, and horniness. Minako crawled over the top herself while patomiming the judge agreeing with her exhaustive argument and declaring in fact that by law everyone in Japan would have to view her girlfriend's butt for national security. The deathglare from Yukari made her come to a sudden holt. Perhaps she had gone too far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari strode towards her naked companion, her hands rising up and grasping the small collar around Minako's neck. With an idle motion, she began to retie the ribbon winding through the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your honor...\" Yukari whispered. \"As you can see...my girlfriend is a pervert...and an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Minako protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's also funny, listens to my problems, and puts up with my occasional fits of anger. So I'm going to keep her around. Even if she keeps looking for ways to drive me to homicide.\" Yukari said, squeezing the ribbon just a tiny bit harder than necessary to emphasize the potential it doubling as a noose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her ass is also pretty great. But I've never seen it bend space and time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause before the pair began to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The duo's lighthearted moment was interrupted by the sound of the roof access door opening. Both girls panicked and ran around to the backside of the stairway entry (figuring it was the least likely place for someone to find them) and looked at each other fearfully. Putting a finger to her lips to signal for quiet, Minako carefully crawled over to the edge of the pair's hiding place and peeked around the corner. The good news was that the person that stepped into Minako's line of sight wasn't a member of faculty. The bad news was that Minako knew the student in question, and the Shadow responsible for this whole predicament in the first place was able to peer into Minako's thoughts and memories and realize that it liked what this could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow looked through Minako's eyes, examined the form of Chihiro Fushimi, and echoed one word through Minako's mind. <i>\"Prey.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her demeanor changed, Minako looked over her shoulder to Yukari, signalling for the other girl to circle around the other side of their hiding spot. Then she stood and confidently stepped out of hiding and right in front of the shy Student Council treasurer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Chihiro-chan!\" Minako greeted happily. \"What're you doing up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro had frozen in place when Minako stepped into sight. At first she'd simply been surprised to discover she wasn't alone, but then seeing both who was up here, and her blatant nudity, only served to reinforce the timid girl's shock induced paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Minako-chan?! Wh-wh-what are... why are you naked?!\" Chihiro stammered as her face quickly turned crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah, I asked you first.\" Minako teased, closing the distance between herself and Chihiro. She placed a hand on the trembling girl's shoulder and leaned in close. \"Up to something naughty where nobody would see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro was at an absolute loss for words. Noises escaped her lips, words dying half-formed. Finally, after several long moments of this, Chihiro found her voice again. \"I... M-Mitsuru-senpai and that Yamagishi girl were... probably still are... d-doing... lewd things. I... had to look away. I can't disrespect Mitsuru-senpai like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, aren't you just the most loyal little thing?\" Minako whispered, her voice dripping with honey and praise. \"But between you and me? I think Mitsuru <i>likes</i> showing off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaky step backwards signaled a return of Chihiro's motor skills. One step turned into two, and Minako simply watched as the shy girl retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have to go!\" Chihiro squeaked as she turned on her heel and ran, only to find her path blocked by Yukari. \"T-Takeba-san?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going so soon?\" Yukari asked as she blocked the doorway with her naked form. \"That's no fun! No, I think there's more to your story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liked what you saw.\" Minako added. \"You're shy and nervous around boys, but it's not because of hidden feelings or romantic nerves, is it? No, they make you nervous because you don't like them. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro could only shake her head in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor, naive Chihiro. Lying to yourself will only make your life harder than it needs to be. Come, let Yukari and me show you the truth. The truth you know deep down...\" Minako whispered, having covered the gap between herself and Chihiro once again. Her slender arms wrapped around Chihiro's waist, and her lips grazed Chihiro's ear, hot breath making the treasurer shiver.</span></div></div>",

Is it you?\" Yukari mocked from behind the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I'm...I'm not like THAT!\" Chihiro finally screamed, reaching back and punctuating her statement with a hard slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's Shadow reeled back in surprise, actually seeing stars and losing her balance in the process. Chihiro clasped her hand in horror, her eyes wide, then she turned and fled past an impressed looking Yukari. The shadow possessed girl strode to her leader's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. She's got a mean chop on her.\" Yukari said, offering Minako a hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah. Your taunting wasn't helping, by the way.\" Minako said, head still spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. What? You don't think I riled her up, do you?\" Yukari asked in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You did. And...weren't you supposed to keep her from getting away?\" Shadow Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie! My bad!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yukari-Tan....\" Minako said, an edge to her voice. \"You wouldn't...screw this up on purpose, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Now why would I do that, senpai? Who wouldn't want one more useless slut converted into your little harem. Why wouldn't I just JUMP at the chance to share you with one more slut you managed to talk out of her clothes?\" Yukari said, dropping her smile. \"Why would I be jealous that you can't figure out that you belong to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh. I see. The beta bitch forgot who her alpha is.\" Minako sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second the other Yukari had her leader pinned to the wall near the staircase, her mouth and her sex pressed hard against Minako's equivalent parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mine. Don't ever forget!\" Yukari hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" Minako moaned under the hard thrusting of her girlfriend. \"...recall you objecting to Mi-chan last night....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Have you seen that body! I'd screw that all day every day if Temptation would let me!\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So you get as many girls as you want and I get none?\" Minako jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very fair, Yukari-chan.\" Minako pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't make the rules. I just live in this psycho's brain.\" Yukari shrugged. \"Not my fault your her daddy stand in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...YES, RIGHT THERE DON'T STOP!!!...flattering!\" Minako moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Don't take it the wrong way. Little Yuki's been idolizing poor dead daddy all her life. But oh noes, he let out all the shadows! He's not the big tragic hero nobody but her believed in anymore! Oopsie, idolized image broken! Have to fill that void. May as well latch on to Mrs. Super Perfect Hero girl instead.\" Yukari said, just as the pair hit a mutual climax that brought them both to their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Like 'Mrs. Perfect' over here even knows what she's doing half the time.\" Shadow Minako said between breaths. \"You wanna know her secret? She knows how to shut up when the rest of you idiots feel like whining, and then when they ask her what she thinks she tries to come up with whatever you needy little shits want to hear most, and then pretends it was some profound insight if it impresses you. Its pretty much the same with leading you all around Tartarus. Guessing, and pretending she knows what she's doing.\" Minako sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blah blah blah. She's more insightful than you...she's giving herself credit for.\" Yukari said, bored. \"Anyway. I know why *I* like the harem. Little Yuki has as many mommy issues as daddy issues, and she chides her mommy for being a slut who has a lot of partners while deep down really wants to be exactly that kinda slut herself! But why do you insist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. Mommy and daddy issues. Dead mommy and dead daddy issues. Minako gets wonely lots, so she has to get to know everybody inside and out. She can't just have friends, all her friends got to be her besties! But she's too shy to take all her little bonds as far as they could go...even though she's a huge pervert with all kinds of messed up fantasies about her so-called friends. Makes it easy to ignore...\" Minako trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore...?\" Yukari prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. We have better things to do than pillow talk, anyway. For one, I need to figure out what to do with you and your insubordination.\" Minako said, rising to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh! Sounds exciting! What are you thinking? You going to pull a Mitsuru and use one of those double vibes on me?\" Yukari asked with a grin. \"You did smuggle one of your own in too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just like you and Mi-chan.\" Minako said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Was I that obvious? Well, if you wanna know what would really humiliate me, we could go find Junpei and give him a good show! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" Yukari said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako snickered. \"Wow. I can hear the other one in the back of my head! She didn't think we could blush! Can you believe it? Well, for your edification, dear me, we're as embarrassed as either of you are by this whole ordeal. The only difference is....we love it! We're the pervy parts of your brain. The pieces that told you to keep going whenever you had the urge to peak in on Yuka-tan's shower-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or strut around in the high cut armor in front of the boys and watch them squirm! But then again...none of us have a choice! You may have noticed some of the rules by now, me. Not allowed to wear clothes. Not allowed to reveal Temptation-sama's secrets, or one of us takes over. No skin on skin contact without getting horny. Here's another one for you, me. We have to feel ashamed. Think about it! You've been pretty much naked since the movie theater last night, right? Has it gotten any easier? Even a little? Or do still get the butterflies every moment your out in public with just your cute little ribbon and those adorable shoes and socks? Do you still panic every time someone sees you in all your glory, still hang your head and get oh so meek and try to cover up no matter how useless you know it all is? Isn't it weird? Shouldn't you be a little used to it? Shouldn't you get even a pinch less horny when you get stared at? Shouldn't you be a little less awed by your naked SEES girls than you are? Humans can adapt to anything, right? So why are you 'stuck' being all horny and humiliated all the time? Its easy. Temptation's secret rule number...whatever! 'Minako-chan and friends must always be naked, and must always feel the deepest shame and arousal from the weight of their nakedness! Always! Forever!' Neither of us can escape, Minako-chan! Every day you stay naked will be as awful and wonderful as the first day! But don't worry! Just because you'll never stop doesn't mean we won't send you to new heights every chance we get!! And speaking of which!\" Minako said, clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei?\" Yukari asked, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better! Way, way, way better!\" Minako chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we'll need our vibes! And some lube! And then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....this can't be happening!\" Mitsuru exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor Mi-chan.\" Minako whispered. \"It just keeps getting worse. Stripped in a theater, climaxing in an alley, spanked by the ex-finacee you humiliated, screwed all night by your two besties, a long naked tour through downtown, groped by strangers on the train...and groped some more by your classmates...and now this! We're just systematically sabotaging your reputation step by step, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-be quiet!\" Mitsuru retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Fuuka-chan...\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo! Don't do this!\" Fuuka whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just between us...this is totally personal! I could forgive abandoning our leader to the Dark Hour without a stitch on. I mean, if you hadn't acted like a total coward, I wouldn't even be me now! But how dare you urge her to strip for you? How dare you cast lustful eyes on MY senpai? Now its payback! Your butt belongs to me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooo!\" Fuuka moaned, prompting a hard smack from Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four found themselves in a neigh impossible position. It was only their natural flexibility through training and shadow hunting combined with a little help from Temptation's magic that it was possible at all. Mitsuru and Fuuka were stuck in a tight embrace, still scissoring like mad with the double headed dildo clasped tightly inside their inner folds. Arrayed behind them were the other girls, Yukari paired with Fuuka and Minako with Mitsuru respectively. Each held her own flexible vibrator inside herself, adjusted in such a way that it formed a lewd \"L\" with the opposite end extending out like a strap on...which was buried in the ass of her respective partner. The four moved as one, naked bodies swaying back an forth like some impossibly perverted accordion. All around them cameras flashed, videos recorded, and an endless series of laughter, snide comments, and catcalls pervaded as what felt like the entire school watched SEES' depraved orgy play out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this reminds me. Ran into Chihiro earlier. Nearly seduced her before Yukari fucked it up. But I think I got her curious at least. Maybe later other you and I can track her down and finish it properly? Bet she'll listen to her precious president and Student Council rep Minako more than just Minako!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave her out of this!\" Mitsuru snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...but its not like she isn't already involved. I mean...she's been watching us for a good seven minutes now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Mitsuru craned her head upwards, locking eyes with a wide eyed Chihiro on the roof...who quickly snatched her hand from beneath her skirt and hid it behind her back. Before Mitsuru could do more than blush, an orgasm hit her, followed swiftly by mutual ones in the other girls, each shuddering in delight as the cameras rolled...</span></div></div>",

The girls slowly gathered enough coherent thought to look up into the glowering bearded face of their portly principal. He cleared his throat loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? On your feet!\" He said in a severe tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattling an impossibly deep sense of shame and their still wobbly knees, the four timidly helped each to their feet (Minako and Yukari returned to their normal selves, apparently abandoned by their darker halves to experience this particular humiliation in person). With a prolonged amount of shuffling and trembling in embarrassment, all four stood in a row, hands covering their most shameful places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Is that how you greet your principal? Hands at your sides! Straighten your backs! Feet apart!\" The principal thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four exchanged horrified glances, then with painful reluctance let their hands fall to their sides and adjusted their stances to be on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better. Now, except for Fuuka-san here, must you three wear those...monstrosity even now?\" The Principal demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru, Minako, and Yukari all glanced down. Their large, flexible vibrators had been tucked away inside their inner folds, both heads pushed deep inside to provide twice as much stimulation in the same fashion Mitsuru had placed her toy earlier while encouraging a line of students to grope her body. Fortunately, the vibration of all three instruments was on a lower setting, but there was a noticable quiver coming from each girl's nether regions which was occasionally answered by a tiny spasm of the hip and wobble of the knees. All three girls hung their heads and blushed intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...pparently, we will be keeping them...equipped, sir.\" Mitsuru croaked out a response. \"I..assure you, our behavior and dress are not...not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been made aware of Eden Syndrom, Mrs. Kirijo. Our school is prepared to respond accordingly. I simply was not expecting students of your caliber to possess such loose morals that they would be vulnerable to the affliction!\" The Principal snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's not how it wor....\" Minako squeeked before trailing off while the Principal ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! This...'show' is clearly over! I am deeply disappointed in all of you! Get to class at once! Expect an assembly to address this issue sometime today! Now GO!\" The Principal thundered at the assembled students, most of whom had the good sense to leave as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you four...disgraceful! Absolutely disgraceful! Clean yourselves up and come to my office immediately!\" He said, glancing over them once more in utter disgust and no mercy for their dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" All four girls muttered as the Principal stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we made it.\" Minako said, without a hint of enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrrrrrrrray.\" Yukari deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...let's clean up...before these demons inside us look for new ways to torment us.\" Mitsuru said, marching up the stairs. Minako followed quickly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka began to follow as well, when she felt a tug on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Yukari whispered. \"Are you...did I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Oh, I...no! I mean...well...a...a little....\" Fuuka squirmed, a hand self consciously squeezing her butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn her. I knew it! That stupid, vindictive bitch! I hate her so much! She...I'm sorry! She's a lying, awful person! I don't think that way at all! I don't blame you for this! I swear! She's always-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you do...\" Fuuka said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...No! I swear! She's just...just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a part of you. They're all made of us. Even if its a drop of water in a sea, that drop still feels that way about me.\" Fuuka said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true! She can't be like me! She...just hates everything! I can feel it with everything she says and does! That's...that's not who I am! That...can't be me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari...its okay. You...have a right to feel that way. This...is all my fault.\" Fuuka said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Even...even if that were true, and it isn't! Even if...I don't want to blame you! I don't want to feel that way!\" Yukari said, tears forming in her eyes. \"You have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-chan...\" Fuuka said, misty eyed herself. \"I do! But...we don't always get to decide how we feel. We know that better than anyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to class. I...I want to talk about this more when we have the chance! Really talk about it. Especially your anger.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to tell you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari.\" Fuuka said, hugging the taller girl. \"Please. Its okay to be angry! I just...panicked. I...I thought she would follow me! I thought she was behind me! I was so scared of being caught, I didn't even look back! I hate what's inside me too. Because...she doesn't care. She doesn't feel guilty or concerned at all. She exactly everything I am when I'm afraid. Selfish. Petty. I don't want to be that either! I know its a selfish thing to ask. But...I want you to be honest with me. I want to hear what I've done, really done. I want to hear it so maybe you can forgive me...so maybe I can forgive myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Yukari said, returning the hug, then softly pulling back and kissing the blue haired girl. \"This is so stupid! This whole situation! I still think your wrong, too. That thing in my head. She's jealous. Of everyone. Aigis. Mitsuru. You too, Fuuka. That's why she was so angry. And that's so stupid! How can she...how can I...feel that way? You've never tried to take anything away from me. Your always the one that gives! You aren't scary! Your just...smart. Shy. A little pale, but with a way cuter body than you let on! Your Fuuka! Why would she be threatened of that? Why wouldn't she want to just...do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blushed as she felt a gentle squeeze on her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she want to hurt you?\" Yukari said, a mix of lust and guilt in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the truth is...it did hurt...a little.\" Fuuka whispered. \"But...I also felt your skin pressed up against my back, and your breasts brushing against me...you were so warm! And the way you were holding my hips, guiding me and Mitsuru-senpai in and out along with Minako-chan. It felt good. Not to mention those...things moving around. It was really tight and went and...g-good! Even when it hurt it felt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushed. \"You...liked it when I was rough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka smiled, then took in a breath. \"This is another reason we need to talk! This is the closest thing our group has had to an argument!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you-\" Yukari trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this a thing that couples do? Fight, make up, and then...umm...\" Fuuka glanced down at the sliver of the dildo visible within Yukari's naked body. With a tentative hand, she brushed the edge of the device, eliciting a gasp from the brown haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we should catch up to the others! Before...something bad happens!\" Fuuka said, turning and running, a hand covering her blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....okay...I'll give you that much. Bitch me and the real me may have ONE thing in common.\" Yukari said as she watched Fuuka's retreating backside, and imagined a myriad of ungentle things that she could do with it.</span></div></div>",

Instead, the pair found Mitsuru and Minako hidden behind one of the large pillars right in front of the entrance. Mitsuru had a pensive expression, casting weary glances this way and that, her hands trying as best they could to hide her naked body from observers (which, in consideration of her possessing the widest hips and largest breasts of any of the girls, was particularly ineffectual). Minako, on the other hand, was busy with her phone, a look of excited focus in her eyes that one almost might assume she had forgotten about her state of undress...except for her free hand hiding the space between her legs. The look was strangely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Fuuka glanced at one another as they approached. Something was up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...shouldn't we be...going inside?\" Yukari asked, unable to suppress a shudder at the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on it!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what she's talking about.\" Mitsuru whispered in response to the puzzled looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-chan!\" Minako said, looking up from her phone. \"What's your assessment of our situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...assessment of...I...we're standing naked in public!\" Fuuka said, blushing at her own comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct! Continue!\" Minako said, returning to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...have to spend the whole day like this...in class...with everyone watching...\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break it down to immediate goals!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arisato-sanan...\" Mitsuru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako...?\" Yukari began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me! Am I or am I not the leader of the SEES squad?\" Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone blinked. That was where the look was from! This was the look of a Minako on the hunt for shadows, directing her teammates and ambushing shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Mina-\" Yukari paused at her teammates strange glare. \"Sigh. Leader. What exactly are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in this situation because of Shadows, right? This is SEES business, right? So I'm making a plan of attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ari...Squad Leader.\" Mitsuru said. \"This situation is hardly the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Are school is Tartarus, right? And its teeming with...umm..entities whose notice we do not want to draw, right?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....that's...somewhat accurate.\" Mitsuru allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! Mission! Fuuka, give me an analysis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....well....our classmates already know we're...naked...and most of them already so us...in that situation earlier....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, stealth would be pointless! The enemy already knows we are here!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....yes. I suppose...that's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Therefore, what is your assessment of our tactics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....when stealth fails...we have to outrun the enemy.\" Fuuka ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Any other ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A distraction?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Minako smiled, lightly patting Fuuka on the head affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....so...our 'mission' is to create a distraction and run like hell?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. Think of it like we've drawn the Shadow's notice, but we're still trying to avoid running into other Shadows. So! Run down the halls, hide in cover when we can find it, and get to the staircase quick as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being the principal's office.\" Mitsuru said, slightly bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our senpai! I'd like you to hang back and help Fuuka keep up, since she doesn't normally have to run around in these operations. Yukari, you come with me! You watch my back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Sure. I guess if we think of it as a mission, it won't be as embarrassing, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your getting the idea! This is just like any operation, except its our dignity on the line!\" Minako said, blushing a little. \"Whatever's left of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. I'll go along with this. Its kind of clever, Minako-chan.\" Yukari said. Then sighed heavily as Minako titled her head. \"I mean LEADER. Jeez, can you try not to act that full of yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Minako said. \"I'm in charge. Your lives are in my hands, and I'm depending on my subordinates to get this mission done! Just like always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Hmph. Or maybe you just get off bossing the rest of us around.\" Yukari muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Well, there is that, too.\" Minako mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me??\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't act like that's a surprise after last night! And don't act like you don't love getting ordered around, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's eye twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnyway! Ready?\" Minako asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing a link on her phone, Minako left her phone to rest at the far end of the the entrance while directing the other girls to the opposite side. A loud moan erupted from the phone from a video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, go, go!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did you just download a video of our orgy??...its already online?!!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOVE!\" Minako snapped, encouraging her order with a sudden slap of Yukari's butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diversion proved modestly successful. The girls had no time to cover themselves, their breasts and butt cheeks bouncing freely. As per the plan, speed was favored over stealth, giving a magnificent vision of the girl's bouncing bodies, but a brief one as well. Few students had time to snap a picture, although as the girls fled down the long hallways a few managed to get some video of their passing. Humiliating, certainly, but also a little exciting. It almost felt like a game, seeing if they could get away before they drew notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming voice caused all four girls to practically crash into one another. The portly form of their Principal stood before the doors to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgraceful! Absolutely disgraceful! What do you have to say for yourselves??\" He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir....\" Mitsuru said as she tentatively rose to her feet. \"You...you know the reason for our...our...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I have no love of your shameful exposure, but our school is obligated to make accomodations for mental and physical handicaps. What I am referring to is your violation of school rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our...but...if you are overlooking our nudity, then surely the school rules about dress do not apply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course! But that still leaves the basics! Such as....running in the halls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your joking!\" Yukari snapped before wilting under his glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not! I expect all students, especially the student council president and the students of the exclusive Iwatodai dorms!\" The Principal lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just wanted to get here as quickly as possible!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concerned for your missing dignity? Understandable, but foolish! Your disorder makes such things irrelevant and impossible! And I will not tolerate the use of your illness as an excuse to act out! No, ladies...your current ordeal must be used as inspiration for your fellow Gekkoukan students! I will be the very model of a good, orderly student. If all eyes must be upon you, they will certainly nothing less than an austere example of a high school student....with or without clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very well. I apologize for our actions. May we enter your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weak! Too weak! Your apology will be sincere and polite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What...are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOW! Hands at your sides! Bend at the waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl found themselves lining up, bowing to their principle and giving a humiliated apology, various students snapping picture of their exposed butts while keeping out of sight of the principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now to your fellows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, the girls bowed to their gawking audience, their breasts swinging freely. The leers and snickers were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now, suck in your chests! Fill them with pride! Now walk, slowly and properly, the way a good student would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their utter humiliation, the girls retraced their route, now walking slowly, their hands at their sides and their breasts thrust out. Several times they performed their bow up and down the hallways, utterly undoing Minako's plot to spare them an inch of dignity and adding so much more to their humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now then, we can return to the Office. We have much to discuss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir.\" The girls said in meek unison, dying of shame.</span></div></div>",

As it happened, the majority of the discussion was taken up with the portly man's usual bluster and rambling. It was a painful experience, standing naked in front of his desk while he lectured them while the frequent footfalls and excited discussion let the girls know that their fellow students were finding infinite excuses to pass back and forth in front of the glass doors of the office to peek at the four magnificent specimens of school girl buttocks lined up in row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, I expect your absolute best during this trying time! The school will meet the needs of your...unique disabilities, but will not tolerate any slacking on your part! You must serve as examples to your fellow students, not as bastions of depravity but as active and contributing members of this campus! Any breach in protocol will be punished severely. I will communicate no less than this in the morning announcements, but I expect each of you to reiterate exactly what your circumstances are to the class and my expectations that you will nonetheless function admirably and appropriately within those circumstances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" The girls muttered, awaiting and dreading the end of his tirade and the long march to their classrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I've asked some of our students to escort you to class to ensure you are not tempted to wander off and engage in further depravity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....hardly necessary.\" Mitsuru piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree. Besides, its as much for your protection as to monitor you. I want to ensure that none of the male students become rowdy due to your lapse in morality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't a...never mind. Who do you intend to serve as an escort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would do well to ensure your safety at school and the dorms, would we not? Therefore I'll be asking your fellow residents for aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words did not register all at once. When they did sink in, all four girls drew in a slow breath of realization and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you...didn't....\" Yukari began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...this is awesome!\" Junpei said with unbridled enthusiasm as he entered the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may sound impossible, given all the girls had been through and the countless humiliating events that had occupied their time. But for every perfect stranger or nameless student who had seen them naked thus far, there was at least some tiny shred of relief to be had. At least those leering faces would only have to be endured for a moment (physically, anyway...the number of times those excited, perverted stares reappeared in their dreams or their memories as they pleasured themselves would prove immeasurable in the coming days). They never had to see or look most of those people in the eyes ever again. None of them knew a thing about the girls aside from the glimpse of their flesh and their blushes. Aside from Ken, barely anyone who knew them personally had seen them naked. Certainly no one who could bring their horror and shame to a whole new level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one until Akihiko, Aegis, and Junpei entered the room.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps there was something to all of that, Minako thought, at least if the concept of dying of shame could be taken literally. Time certainly seemed to be in no hurry to proceed in that instant. It gave her an opportunity to note the looks of dawning horror on the faces of her female teammates, their bodies in midst of the all too familiar dance of humiliation and arousal as their brains moved from the shock of exposure to the need to cover themselves. She noticed Junpei looking both delighted and dismayed, his inner pervert perhaps at war with his inner \"nice guy\" whether to look away or stare even harder. She noted that by contrast Akihiko had already lost his look of shock (as expected for the lightning reflexes of a boxer) and was now staring with a surprisingly smug yet thoughtful and piercing look and an occasional nod of satisfaction and approval. With a deepening blush, Minako recognized that look- it was the one he wore when sizing up a rival or new opponent. A little more playful than in a real battle, but he was defiantly APPRAISING them, running off some mental checklist of each of their \"stats\" and comparing his expectations to the reality. Even Aegis, of all people, was giving them an intense look, more genuinely curious than perverted but with that sudden rapped attention she saved for unexpected encounters with an aspect of humanity she had never studied before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment passed suddenly, and the office was filled with three loud screams and a rush of movement that caught Minako by surprise. Apparently while she studied the boys the other girls saw an opportunity. All three were now crowded behind her, hiding as much of their bare skin as possible while leaving HER fully exposed as the human shield!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why me?!\" Minako wailed, hiding her breasts and pussy behind the protection of her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, LEADER? Don't you want to keep your team safe?\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, I don't!\" Minako shot back, dutifully anchoring herself there despite her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. I mean...\" Junpei paused, half-heartedly hiding his gaze behind his hand. \"Just...what's going on? Is this some kind of dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scanning...negative. My internal functions confirm I am powered on and fully functional, and none of you appear to be in REM sleep at the current hour. Quarry: Minako-san. Yukari-san. Fuuka-san. Mitsuru-san. The four of you appear to have misplaced an unexpectedly high number of components of the female student uniform as well as undergarments. While my current data confirms that public nudity is acceptable in certain designated places within the city, such as the public bath, I must warn that there is a 99.6% probability that this current location is in extreme violation of public decency laws and the student dress code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Aegis.\" Mitsuru hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble, Mitsuru-san.....oh. My previous report may be in error. My bio-scans suggest that the four of you are experiencing extreme forms of the emotions shame, embarrassment, and humiliation, each at levels approxiamtely 467% higher than my last recorded peak readings, along with lesser feelings of anger and horror directed towards our male teammates. All of which is firmly in keeping with my profiles on your psyches. However, there are incongruous readings which suggest my sensors are not functioning properly. For instance, I am detecting a unexpected spike in arousal from all of four of you well over one thousand six hun-\" Aegis continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!\" Yukari squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and the spike has jumped higher still, almost as if in response to my own observations.\" Aegis continued in puzzlement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Aegis. I caught something about this on the news. Eden Syndrome. Some kind of mutation of Apathy Syndrome. Kinda surprised it could affect all of you, though.\" Akihiko noted dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko...\" Mitsuru hissed. \"Avert your gaze immediately or...or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Akihiko said with a thin smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXECUTION! An execution to end all executions!!\" Mitsuru ground out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Wasn't aware going to the principal's office like he requested was grounds for one of your 'executions'.\" Akihiko aid, unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know precisely why I-\" Mitsuru thundered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" The Principal snapped. \"You four show some decorum! Stop cowering behind one another and go to class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" The Principal thundered. \"But first, pick yourselves up, compose yourselves, and thank your fellow students for the help you are going to receive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls blanched, but slowly arranged themselves into a line, arms at their sides, shoulders pushed back and breasts thrust out, legs shoulder width apart and their inner folds clearly viable. Their erect nipples and gleaming clits peaking out were clearly visible. Arrayed in the stance of \"proper female students\", the girls one by one retrieved their bags and walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Yukari snarled on her way out, refusing to meet anyone's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-th-a-a-a-a-annnn....\" Fuuka attempted, freezing in place and trembling like a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, Fuuka-tan. You got it.\" Junpei said, taking mercy on her as she nodded in gratitude and scurried out the door, red from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will show you the full and complete measure of my gratitude to all of you.\" Mitsuru said, somehow making a show of gratitude sound like a death threat, which earned a sneer from Akihiko and a wince from Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh....th-thanks guys. This is so....so....I can't even describe it! But I know you guys will watch my back!\" Minako said, perhaps the only sincere show of gratitude from them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count on it!\" Akihiko said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...for sure!\" Junpei declared nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My psyche evaluations suggest that they will indeed provide your back with rapt attention, as well as your front, and sides.\" Aegis chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three blinked, looked at each other, then sighed. Minako fidgetted, turning redder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Probably do that too.\" Akihiko said at last. \"But we'll keep it safe while we look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako opened her mouth, closed it, and gave them all her best Fuuka impression as she ran out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei let out an enormous breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Akihiko-senpai...mind if I borrow some yen?\" He said after a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I figure if I donate enough to that shrine after school, maybe...just maybe...Chidorichii won't get mad at me for staring so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Yeah. All right. How is she, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing great! She got out of the hospital and rehab in record time! Got a little studio apartment in town a few weeks ago. Place is already freaking full of sunflowers and paintings. Not too bad for a girl who was in a freaking coma not too long ago, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy for you, Junpei. Really am. Don't envy you in this situation, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...I guess if she can bring herself back from the dead the least I can do is....uh...get through this for her! No problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Good luck with that.\"</span></div></div>",

Has my lack of clothing convinced you I pose no threat? I assure you my execution skills have not dulled despite recent circumstances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt. I just don't think your lack of clothing has dulled your sense of duty or integrity, either.\" Akihiko said. \"If your really the woman I've worked with and come to respect, I have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respect? This is what you call showing respect?\" Mitsuru growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. All four of you, to one degree or another, are in incredible shape. Even though you don't believe in my kind of training regime, each of you has kept yourselves in good shape and toned your bodies extremely well. I'm impressed. I always suspected you would all look good naked, but you far surpassed my estimations. How could I help but admire that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's eye twitched. \"Akihiko...I hope your not trying to convince me that your so ignorant of my expectations that you believe it is acceptable to stand there and stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Is there something wrong with that? If that's the case, you passed up a golden opportunity to execute me on the beach trip. I was staring then, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's absurd. We were wearing swimsuits then! I fully expected and wanted you t....I...\" Mitsuru stuttered while Akihiko raised an eyebrow.\"It was an entirely different situation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what's the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, that we're naked!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you want to execute me for my hand in you being naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! What are you even-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do admit that I had absolutely nothing to do with you showing up to school naked as the day you were born, and that I wasn't responsible for any of the depraved things you did when you got here?\" Akihiko said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...I...THE ISSUE IS THAT YOU ARE SEEING US THAT WAY!\" Mitsuru said. \"The same reason you were executed in the hot springs! You do recall that, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I remember that incident real well.\" Akihiko said, a glare forming on his face. \"So we've established I CAN look at a girl who is baring skin, under some circumstances. But not others. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously! Stop being obtuse and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. Let's get right down to it. Was it the fact that all of you were naked back then, or was the problem that we weren't supposed to be in a place were you all got naked and saw things we wouldn't have seen if we were where we were supposed to be?\" Akihiko said. \"Just to clarify that incident once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-BOTH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So, if I decided one day to take off all my clothes and walked around the dorm and ran into, say, Minako, would you want to execute me...or Minako?\" Akihiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I would execute you for such a lewd...now wait just a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, seeing someone naked is grounds for execution in some places, and BEING naked is grounds for execution in others! So, Miss Kirijo, tell me this- is a public school an appropriate venue for a respectable young woman to flaunt herself around in the nude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I...wasn't...flaunting....\" Mitsuru sputtered. \"A-and there were extenuating circumstances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extenuating circumstances? Interesting! Very interesting. By the way, did I ever mention the reason I was in the bath was because we'd lost track of time and Junpei is an idiot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey, don't drag me into this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It was Ryuji's idea, anyway.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone paused a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryu-who-ji?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Minako. It was 100% his idea.\" Akihiko nodded. \"And he failed to mention the time until it was too late to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what-\" Mitsuru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I tried to mention this, a certain Executioner cut me off with, and I quote 'Silence! I won't hear any excuses! I will EXECUTE you all!'\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't sound like that.\" Mitsuru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So apparently extenuating circumstances aren't admissible in the court of Kirijo.\" Akihiko said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...will admit...I have...occasionally been...overzealous.\" Mitsuru said, looking away from him. \"But even so...you have to realize that we are being forced to do this. Surely mental domination should....count for....oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkihiko smiled. \"Caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....what?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't know. During that whole love hotel incident, Mitusuru and I ended up in the same room. Went through that whole hypno routine like the rest of you did. The only difference is that when Mitsuru here came out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm...what happened?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say the hot springs execution looks pretty tame by comparison.\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru coughed softly to herself. \"I...v-very well. You...have made a valid point. I...suppose I will...allow your some...leeway in these circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How generous. Just one little problem. I think I made a bigger point. Like I said, under some circumstances, being naked in public is deserving of an execution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Akihiko, your not...you wouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since we've established that excuses, including mind control, aren't valid when it comes to Executions, I think its safe to say your the one who needs to get Executed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Now...just wait a moment! That's...you....you....\" Mitsuru paused, glared, then hung her head. \"Yes. That...would seem to be the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said. Woman of integrity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....you've been waiting to make this case awhile, haven't you?\" Mitsuru said, a note of resignation and a hint of admiration in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say after getting the brunt of your executions I've been keeping track of some arguments. Just in case. Its like losing to a tough opponent and thinking about how you'd beat em if you ever got the chance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well....how precisely do you intend to 'execute' me?\" Mitsuru said. Now there was almost an air of anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave that a surprise. You guys should get to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio watched Mitsuru, Fuuka, and Akihiko exit down the hallway. There was something...timid in Mitsuru. Defferential, even. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn! Wow! Go Akihiko-senpai!\" Junpei exclaimed in awe as Akihiko left with the pair of naked beauties in tow. \"Who knew he had it in him to beat the ice queen at her own game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei's excitement and joy died when he glanced at the trio still beside him. Aegis, predictably, was looking at him with her usual blank look of impassive observation. Minako and Yukari had inched away from everyone else, posing their bookbags to hide their chests, and pressed their legs together while stooping over. The pair kept fidgeting in that awkward posture, their body language begging viewers not to stare and knowing they would anyway. Minako, however, was doing a poor job at keeping herself \"hidden\", her brow frequently furrowing in thoughts that were occasionally interrupted by a blush and a readjustment of her bag to (which was periodically \"slipping\" as she became distracted and allowed her hands to lower to book ladened weight)...only to slip back into thought. Yukari, in contrast, held her precious bag over her chest firmly as if it were an iron shield defending her life. Her eyes were locked firmly on Junpei, her legs clamped tightly together to blot out the view of her unprotected lower parts. And judging by the look of humiliation fueled fury on her face, she was the only one who had heard his comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really standing there giving props for him talking his way into molesting your naked upperclassman?\" Yukari growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that! But seriously, she totally had it comin' after that whole bath thing.\" Junpei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole bath thing where you idiots tried to peek at us naked?\" Yukari thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, he just said he forget about the time. If he'd been allowed to explain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You're right! Akihiko-senpai wasn't trying to peek. THAT WAS YOUR IDEA!\" Yukari practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yeah. Uhhh...I kinda hoped you hadn't heard that part.\" Junpei said with a bit of chagrin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear if I had my hands free...right...now...\" Yukari trailed off glancing at her bookbag and back up at Junpei, both of them blushing as they were reminded of WHY she didn't have her hands free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari pressed her lips together, growing beat red and trembling. \"TURN AROUND!!\" She screamed, the force of her declaration causing her frame to 'hop' and her anatomy to leap up and down in front of Junpei's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Yeah! Sorry!\" Junpei said, whirling around and trying to act like he hadn't just burned the vision of her bouncing body into his brain forever. \"You...uh...know this is a temporary solution, right? I mean, even if I try my best all day not to look its still gonna happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Don't hand me those weak excuses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's being taking notes from Mitsuru-senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! And listen! You are going to walk down this hall, in front of us, and if I see that big round head of yours turn a centimeter more than 'straight ahead' I'm lodging this bookbag right in your eye socket! We clear?\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Crystal.\" Junpei muttered. \"Like its my fault you showed up without-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Fine. Let's go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryoji....\" Minako muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" The embarrassed pair ended their verbal sparring match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryoji wasn't there...in the hot springs. He should have been, but he wasn't...\" Minako paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...I dunno who this Ryuji guys you keep talking about is, but it was just me and Akihiko that night. You okay, Mina-chan? Aside from the whole naked thing?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Leader. Your...acting weird...and not in the usual 'embarrass myself' way...\" Yukari said. \"We scoured every inch of that bath. If there was anybody else there we would have found them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of you remember him? Ryoji Mochizuki? Transfer student? Really tall, kind of pale, dresses in black and white with an enormous scarf? Huge pervert and incredibly terrible at talking to people, especially girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth shook their head, sharing a quick glance of concern before Yukari began to glare and Junpei apologetically looked away (almost suppressing the grin on his face at the same time).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is surreal. It feels like I'm trying to remember a vivid dream. But it also feels...you...you guys go on ahead! I need to use the restroom!\" Minako said, suddenly bolting away from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait!\" Junpei and Yukari said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will follow her. Please get to class as instructed.\" Aegis said immediately, moving to pursue the brown haired girl without waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was all that about?\" Junpei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I know? You know she never talks about herself. She's always listening or asking questions, or running off to do whatever the hell she does at night. She's always happy and cheerful and never says anything about if she's worried about the mission or...or anything. She keeps her burdens to herself, and picks up everyone else's along the way.\" Yukari said, an unexpected lump of bitterness bubbling up inside her. \"You'd think that'd change when...this stuff happened! But she doesn't even talk to her lovers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt a hand on her shoulder, realizing at the same time there was water falling from her eyes. \"D-don't touch me!\" She snapped, pulling away from Junpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't...I was just trying ta...okay, look! Your naked! Your naked and your in the same school and the same class as me! And yeah, its awkward as hell! But you gotta get over it...or at least accept that I'm gonna be here interacting with you and that means I'll be seeing you! Just how it is, all right? We can't just do this crap all day!\" Junpei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Yukari muttered, viciously wiping away her tears. \"Like this isn't a big dream come true for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Fine. You wanna hear the truth? Your like, easily one of the hottest girls on campus hands down, and some of the only people who give your body any real competition all happen to have trotted along beside you in the buff this morning! And yeah, me and every other guy on the planet who has any interest in a girl has imagine this exact scenario play out since puberty! You know what else, Yuka-tan? Even with all the hiding and me looking away, I've still pretty much already seen all of you and I'm happy I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking! Correct me if I'm wrong, but basic biology says a girl doesn't get her naughty bits stiffened up like that unless she really likes it. If you know what I mean.\" Junpei smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I had a split second glimpse. And that's all it takes. Your horny as hell, and its obvious to everyone who looks at you.\" Junpei said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you...\" Yukari had no retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuka-tan...look. You got my number. I'm a perv. I like thinking about girls and how good they look, especially without much on. That's just how I work. It doesn't mean that all I'm about. Your still my friend, clothes or no clothes. I won't promise I won't give you lots of attention. But I'm not gonna hurt you, and I wanna help if you've got problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei...I...this isn't easy, okay? Can't you just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can find a line between being a complete jerk and walking on eggshells around you, okay? Its not like I'm the only one who's seen you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that! But most of them I don't know!\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Yuka-tan...none of them tried to...nobody's tried to hurt you during all this, have they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...oh. No. Nobody...I mean, we've done LOTS of things to each other, and I think half the city at this point knows what it feels like to squeeze one part of me or another! But...no. The only times anyone's tried to be...more intimate than feeling me up have all been...if I wanted them to. Wouldn't pick have the places and times its happened! But...its not anything I would have regretted doing minus the audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Good. If anybody bothers you, though, tell me, okay? They won't try it again.\" Junpei said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glanced at the boy in the baseball cap. Since the early days she had heaped scorn and derision his way. Something about him just reminded her of the men her mother would bring home. But there was more to the boy. Minako had mentioned with admiration how he had hunted down a kid taking unwanted pictures of her. He had always been headstrong, but also kind and protective. She had to admit, he was a sweetheart under the dumb jokes and outbursts. Dumb as a brick sometimes, but sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari drew in a long breath, her body still trembling with the paradoxical emotions of shame and delight as she stood before one of her oldest male friends completely naked in what was categorically the last place on Earth she wanted to be without clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Okay. I'll...try...to be less....ummm...\" She couldn't quite choke out the phrase 'bitchy'. \"less mean to you. C-can you j-just let me have a couple more minutes of peace before we get to class and....oh god...and I have to deal with EVERYBODY looking? Please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sense the smirk on his face as he adjusted his cap. \"Sure, Yuka-tan. I'll give you that much. Wish I could do more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obediently moved in front of her and started walking, deliberately keeping his eyes forward. Yukari breathed a sigh of relief. She knew it was a truly insignificant calm before the storm of the century. But at least she could enjoy a few tiny moments of modesty while they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly let out a loud, derisive snort. It was an action done totally against her will, seemingly a response to her moment of relief. Relief...at enjoying a moment without humilation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo.\" Yukari whispered. \"C-come on...not nowwww.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body moved by itself, a familiar state that made her stomach sick with expectation (and most certainly no sense of anticipation or excitement...that she'd admit to). In a few strides she'd overtaken Junpei. To their mutual shock Yukari casually made a sweeping gesture with her foot, causing Junpei to tumble backwards in surprise. Yukari winced in sympathy for Junpei and with the rising dread of some act of utter lewdness as she unwillingly turned face his sitting form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill standing, Yukari moved to a position where she was looming over Junpei, her legs spread wide apart on either side of him. Grabbing her bare breasts, Yukari blushed and moaned in agony as she bowed low, aiming her ample chest down into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuka-tan, what the hell- WHAT???\" Junpei cried as his vision was almost entirely consumed with the sight of two round, beautiful orbs of flesh capped with their pink and rigid nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei! D-d-d-don't look at me!\" Yukari begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...right.\" Junpei said, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. You've had your fun! Now just-No!\" Yukari snapped as she pushed an inch or two closer, playfully bobbing and pressing her breasts against her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei, don't you dare look!\" Yukari moaned, even as she wondered if looking was really worse than FEELING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not making this easy, Yuka-t-uhhh?\" Junpei said, interrupted by a mouth full of bare nipple. Yukari yanked her tit out immediately, her body trembling with complete humiliation and the brief electric thrill of wet lips on her sensitive place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you bitch! You cunt! You stupid, slutty, shitty, ugly, fat, dumb WHORE! I'll kill you! I swear I will! Slut! I hate you!\" Yukari growled out a litany of obsenities, her mouth the only thing she had control of at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking to you!\" Yukari whimpered in helpless frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who are you talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-myself!\" Yukari fumed. \"You shameless, worthless, dumb slutty bimbo! Just ssssssssstoppppp! Leave me alonnnnne! Bitch! Cunt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari felt her eye twitch in annoyance, then her lip curl in a malicious smile. Then she found herself turning around, bending over and sticking her rear out the way her breasts had before. With a brief back and forth she began swatting Junpei with her butt cheeks until he couldn't take it and opened his eyes. Yukari cried in dismay as she took a step back and swishing her lovely ass more slowly, with a more erotic motion. She blushed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! Stop! You stupid-OW!\" Yukari said as she suddenly curled her hip upwards to give a even more lewd display of her bottom before smacking the upper most cheek in a manner intended to look both sexy and painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Ow! Bitch! Ow! Cunt! Ow! Whore! OWW!\" Yukari continued to complain, her butt shaking and her hands slapping in retaliation. \"All right! All right! I'm sorry! You aren't a slut! Stop it! OW! Stop it! OWWWW! Fine! Stop it, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onslaught relented, yet her butt seemed frozen in place before Junpei's stunned eyes. Then she shifted her legs a little bit wider, pushed her ass just a little higher, and blushed even deeper as she realized her naked pussy was now level with Junpei's eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Please! Please! At least don't show him that! Let me keep that much....no. Oh no! Nonononono! You c- you- DON'T! PLEASE! ANYTHING BUT-OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, her fingers ignored her pleas as they sank into her inner folds. Her waiting clit shivered in delight as they made contact, knowing precisely where to touch for the best results. As she maintained her bowed, humiliating, lewd position her hand alternately played with her pussy and spread it open for Junpei, at times wiggling it slightly back and forth in a teasing fashion. But all too soon its work was completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once Yukari felt her hips bucking. As her orgasm came on, she fell to her knees, resting her forehead on the ground and positioning her nether regions up as high as she could manage as her body spasmed and jerked. Some small part of her wondered why it was that she seemed to climax so easily lately. And why she seemed unable to experience just one without more following. And why they were so powerful, and lasted for minutes at a time. The shadows must have done something to her, surely! Making her sexual experiences more...theatrical was certainly a part of their MO. Yet there was a doubt in her mind, a nagging little voice that said it was Yukari herself doing it. That being stripped, made to display herself so very naked and vulnerable, showing her body in the most shameful ways possible...maybe she just loved the experience so much her body couldn't help but react with such enthusiasm. Yukari was certain her inner tormentor knew about that doubt and loved making her dwell on the question in the midst of humiliating her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Yukari was busy showing Junpei secrets she had long vowed he would never get to see, Minako was busy with problems of her own. There was a burning question on her mind far more important than public nudity. At least that was what she kept telling herself as she ran down the hallways of her school, past shocked teacher and snickering classmates, horribly aware that she was showing them an unobstructed view of her bouncing breasts and ass cheeks. By the time she reached the rest room her face was burning hot as she felt the stares of so many on her body. Quickly she slipped into the bathroom, locking the door behind her and quickly checking the stalls to ensure no one was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavy, heart pounding and face blushing hot, Minako took a moment to catch her breath before slowly turning away from the stalls. At the other end of the room was a sink and a mirror just above it. Minako stared at her reflection, slowly walking forward. A narcissistic twinge stole over her as she stared at herself. Black shoes and white thigh high socks, ribbon tied about her neck. All the familiar touches of a school uniform, missing only the pieces most necessary for modesty. Minako looked at her cute blush and longing eyes, her large breasts capped with erect pink nipples, and her shaven bare sex plainly visible under the bright lights of the stall. This was the cute girl that her classmates had been staring at just a few minutes ago. This was the naked body that had roamed up and down the city, that so many strangers had seen and photographed in too many obscene situations to count. This was the hot, nubile form that had coaxed the sensible, level headed Mitsuru to strip out of her clothes in a public place and beg to be tasted in a filthy alley full of leering men. This was what her squad of humiliated girls could not get enough of despite all the ordeals they were suffering. This was the tool Temptation was using to take over the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stared at herself, her hands hugging her small belly. She had lost count of how many times she had been pleasured today. And yet there was something about being so utterly helpless yet so completely enthralling to everyone around her. The desire to play with herself, to feel that intensely wonderful yet embarrassing rush of pleasure...it never seemed satisfied. The more people who saw her only seemed to make the feeling worse. And it was back now, seeing herself the way so many other people had seen her, bared and ashamed and horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and closed her eyes. Not now. There were more important things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pharos.\" She whispered. \"I know your there. You came out last night. I know you don't need a dark hour to manifest. Your strong enough now. Just like Ryoji was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not crazy. What I'm remembering happened. It feels too real.\" Minako explained. \"I need answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Maybe you need some help...\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdrew an Evoker from her bag. She shivered as she pushed the fake gun between her bare breasts, aiming the chamber directly at her heart. So many times she had done this. Yet somehow the act carried a grim weight each time. She supposed it had to. If it ceased to feel, on some fundamental level, as if you were taking your own life the gun would probably fail to call the Persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and held her breath. But as she was about to press the trigger, she felt a cold hand touch her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that.\" Pharos said, smiling in his unsettling way. He had appeared on her shoulders, Minako giving up a defacto piggy back ride. As she stared up into his eyes and he down into hers, she vaguely wondered why he weighted so little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Minako said, a little nonplussed by the surreal scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....right. Umm...why are you here?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....because you called me here.\" Pharos said in his usual deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not HERE. Why are you still...here! Inside my head.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would I be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out in the world. Apprising for Nyx. Preparing for the Fall.\" Minako said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Pharos nodded, disappearing off her back and reappearing on one of the stall walls. \"That's simple. There was no need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need? No need? What does that mean?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos shrugged. \"It means that several months ago, I and Nyx became aware that humanity no longer yearned for death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blinked. \"But...that's wrong. That's all wrong! You became Ryoji! There was a death cult! I...I'm not supposed to be naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. I'm afraid I have no memory of that.\" Pharos said, staring at her with his round eyes and neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stared at him, glanced down at herself, and belatedly used her hands to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...thought the Fall was inevitable.\" Minako said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Interesting point. It would require something drastic to change humanity's yearnings that way in such a short amount of time. I suppose it would technically be possible to destroy the manifestations of humanity's desire for death before it could rouse Nyx. Or somehow seal her in slumber. But to subvert humanity's desires altogether? That would take an entity as strong as Nyx herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Temptation.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually. Temptation is strong, but not as powerful as my mistress. Or even myself, as the Appriser.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what does that mean?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had to guess, it means that Temptation itself is much like my role. A servant acting by the will of a stronger entity.\" Pharos said.</span></div></div>",

There are as many different groups of Shadows and their rulers in the world as there are different groups of people.

My advise is...to wait for them to contact you.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...I can't stay like this for seven years!\" Minako squeeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was already sending butterflies through her stomach. The demon who took control of her body had explained the 'rules' to her already. She always had to be naked. She could not speak about Temptation to anyone. Even minute contact would inspire feelings of lust between her and her enslaved friends. And by far the cruelest constraint of all...her emotions were being regulated. Just as she wasn't allowed to wear clothes, she also wasn't allowed to stop feeling humiliation! No matter how long she was forced to be naked, no matter how many days or months or years, she would feel just as crippingly embarrassed and ashamed as that first night Fuuka had abandoned her at the shrine. Every person who sees her naked would feel brand new. Every time she caught a glimpse of Mitsuru, Yukari, or Fuuka naked would fill her with that same spike of embarrassment and lust as the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that that would be her life- crushed by humiliation every morning as she went on display, subjected to lewd pleasures every night by her fellow sex slaves, on and on and on for seven years....it was too much! One day of enforced exhibition had barely begun and it was overwhelming! Repeating it hundreds of times....her mind screamed at the thought, even as a suspicious moisture was collecting between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it would be seven years. There are...patterns surrounding the lives of Persona users. Call it Fate, if you like. Usually, when a Shadow becomes too powerful a group of Persona Users will arise in response. They often assemble around a particularly powerful one, whose life comes to resemble the journey of the Tarot deck your occult teacher mentioned at one point. Choices are made, a confrontation takes place, the cycle continues.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds familiar. But I don't understand how-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one pattern. Another unfolds between groups. Sometimes Persona Users inexplicably find themselves drawn together to confront the machinations of Shadows. Sometimes older users meet the 'next generation' as it were, sometimes time itself is defied to ensure the meeting.\" Pharos continued. \"I suggest you allow such a meeting to unfold. This situation fits this second pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there....are there any other patterns we might run into?\" Minako asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...None that would be helpful.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there are others?\" Minako prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. One major one I am aware of.\" Pharos said solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Maybe we can-\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dances.\" Pharos is in a deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dances?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dances. For some....reason, Persona users have been called upon to...well, defeat shadows with the power of dance.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....makes no sense at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Nonetheless. Dance is the other pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can't just sit around waiting for someone else to help me. I mean...the humiliation is bad enough, but this shadow is clearly getting stronger! Eden Syndrome is spreading!\" Minako said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see a solution for you until you make peace with your shadow.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace with my....wait. I fight Shadows. That's what Persona Users do, right?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. But I believe you have misunderstood something. Personas and Shadows are the same thing. One is fundamentally the opposite side of the other's coin.\" Pharos said patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah! How...when did...\" Minako trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personas and Shadows are born from human thought. Shadows are those thoughts the human mind rejects, Personas are those same thoughts when the human mind accept and acknowledges them. The only difference is how the conscious mind treats the unconscious.\" Pharos explained. \"Usually a human only has a single Persona under their control. Although occasionally that Persona can evolve into another during a moment of strong conviction or epiphany. Only very rare minds can hold as many as you do.\" Pharos explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Okay...but then, if people like me accept these unconscious thoughts....why do I have a Shadow in me?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos shrugged. \"No mind can accept every dark thought it experiences. No sane mind, anyway. There are some desires that slip through the cracks. Persona Users just acknowledge enough of themselves that the core of their subconscious remains a Persona rather than a Shadow. I suspect that Temptation reached into you and woke up one of these 'minor' shadows. The entity that takes control of you was born from some unspoken, unacknowledged desire in your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....do you know what that desire was?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There are...qualities I recognize. Exhibitionist streaks, occasional hints of lust for your teammates, frustrations that you help everyone around you with their troubles and no one seems to care about your problems. But none of those are the root of this shadow. You tend to acknowledge and accept yourself far better than most people. All I can say is that wherever that seed exists within you must be buried deep. A desire so wicked or terrible that not even you could accept it.\" Pharos said. \"I'm afraid only you can find the answer to that question, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And until I do, she's going to have free reign, right?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this is a start.\" Minako said slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you..certain you want to reverse all this?\" Pharos said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....YEAH! Of course! Do you think I enjoy getting ogled by everyone?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos cocked his head, his eyes lowered to her erect nipples and budding clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Minako snapped, covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos gave an enigmatic smile, then his face fell. \"What I mean is...this world was on the path to the Fall. Events seem to have altered the course of your path. Your memories are likely a holdover from another timeline. Personas are funny things when it comes to memory. They can erase your cognition of past actions, but they can also allow you to retain knowledge of events that never actually happened. So I ask again...is the world you remember a better place than the one you are in now? I know you find this situation...troublesome. But you seem genuinely happy to be closer to your teammates than before. And the thought of you being stuck this way doesn't make me sad the way the impending Fall did. If this is the price to save the world from Nyx, should it not be paid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I don't know. I..I don't trust Temptation. I feel like it has its own plans. Like a more humiliating, sexier version of the Fall. And yeah, there's things I...some of this has been more pleasant than I would have imagined! But it still feels like giving up. If the Fall is everyone surrendering to death, then this just feels like everyone surrendering to Temptation. Just because its more pleasant doesn't make it right.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as he had prepared to declare the nature of Mitsuru's \"execution,\" she stopped him by loudly declaring her intentions to have the student body punish her.

Events were escalating quickly and the mixture of confusion and delight that took hold of the classroom the moment their much admired President stepped into the room with her stunningly beautiful body naked and on display had been immediately seized by Mitsuru. Reading her audience, using her speaking skills to mold and fire their emotions, Mitsuru had their stunned energy along with her own deep feelings of humiliation to her advantage. Her own sense of decency screamed at her that this was wrong in every way possible. A girl does not let herself be scene completely naked by her classmates! Her own inner recriminations fired her usual enthusiasm for executing recalcitrant students to an absurd level. In short, Mitsuru was coping with her immense humiliation with the thrill of execution and the pain of her punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the silence was broken by a single, gruff laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glanced behind her and saw Akihiko rise to his feet. Mitsuru shivered when she saw the smile on his face. She had often scolded him for treating his battles as if they were games. He had begun taking the fights in Tartarus more seriously lately, so the look he was wearing was not one she had seen for some time. Her execution was his new game, and he was clearly enjoying plotting out his moves slowly. It was the opposite of her whirlwind punishment. He was going to play with her, slowly and carefully, drawing out every moment and savoring it. Mitsuru shivered a second time, her hands unconsciously moving to her breasts and softly squeezing them with her back turned to the class. Not knowing his intentions was in its own way more terrifying and exciting than the endless abuse she was demanding from her schoolmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..apologize! I let my enthusiasm get the best of me. You can of course proceed with your own execution.\" Mitsuru mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for apologies.\" Akihiko said in a smooth tone. \"After all, there's really nothing you can say or do about your execution. It'll happen when I want it to, where I want it to. You won't have any warning beforehand, and you'll only know what your in for when it begins. Think of it as an inevitable, unavoidable doom you have no say in or control over. All you need to know is its coming and your helpless to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru found her herself breathless, her knees shaking and her inner folds throbbing. No one, not even the perceptive Minako, knew her better than Akihiko. And as such, no one knew just how much she valued...no, depended upon being in control. For the sake of her father and the redemption of her family she had forced herself to be disciplined and focused most of her life. No one but Akihiko knew just how deeply this situation was affecting her. Or how exciting it felt to be thrust out into a helpless, chaotic situation with no plan and no ability to protect herself. That was why he had taken her Execution, her sacred ritual of correcting and control her peers, and reversed it. He knew that her sense of conduct was too deeply ingrained for her to behave as anything but a model \"prisoner\". She was going to obey him in whatever way he demanded. Of course he was going to stretch it out! The waiting, the dreading, was all part of the game, wasn't it? The feeling was much like the times she had misbehaved at home and was made to wait for her father to come home to decide her punishment. Only much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I understand. But if you don't intend to execute me your own way, then stop interfering and allow my discipline-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you talking a little boldly? After all, this is your punishment. For someone in need of learning a lesson, you sure seem to be taking charge and taking up valuable class time. Shouldn't you be more considerate to the people you are inconveniencing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glowered at him, blushed and hung her head. \"Yes. Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now come over here.\" Akihiko said, grasping Mitsuru's arm and moving her to the teacher's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking my turn.\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the whole class needs to give you a swat on the ass. So here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just said you weren't going to execute me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I said I wasn't going to do MY execution now. You came up with this spank fest on your own. I'm just going along with your demands.\" Akihiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of dread grew deeper. Mitsuru was instructed to crawl onto the desk, staying on all fours. Her blush was intense. Her position made her look like a dog following her master's instructions. Deprived of the wall to hide her face, she was more aware of the staring classroom of gawking students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru feel a hand on her reddened ass. She winced as the hand casually rubbed her cheeks, groping each in turn. Mitsuru moaned at the contact. Sensitive as her cheeks had become, there was something very sensual in the delicate contact being made. Then she felt the hand come to rest flat on the middle of her ass, halfway between both cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Mitsuru. I'm going to be as gentle as possible. I have trouble holding back when I make physical strikes, but if I restrain myself as much as I can I think I can fulfill your demands.\" Akihiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Demands?\" Mitsuru whispered, all confidence replaced by an uncertain, meek creature few of her classmates had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....that every student in the school should come out and smack your butt. If I'm careful, I should be able to use just enough force to demonstrate how painful that would be in a single strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wait! Akihiko, no. D-don't you d-d-d-AAAAAAIIIIIEEEEEE!\" Mitsuru screamed as Akihiko let his hand fall, and suddenly her world was nothing but pain. Pain, and a now savage desire to be touch coming from her nether regions.</span></div></div>",

It took a few attempts to apply the frigid instrument to her sensitive backside. Each time she let out a cute, wincing moan before finally sighing in relief as she found the wherewithal to maintain contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Akihiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru offered him another pointed glare. \"You...are a monster.\" She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hearty laugh Akihiko gave in response caused Mitsuru to grit her teeth.

Worse, the pain in her ass was forcing her to keep her legs apart as even the slight brush of her thighs together was a small agony. This, of course, also left her completely exposed for visual inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This situation has made you truly shameless!\" Mitsuru snapped, blushing furiously. \"I had no idea you had such a loathsome side to your personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. Don't be like that.\" Akihiko said in a smooth tone. \"There's a limit to how much of a gentleman any man can be. This situation would test the limits of a saint. Which, by the way, I never claimed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really too much to ask that you not...not stand there gawking at me like some kind of...of prize horse you plan to buy? Did you really have that little respect for me?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid.\" Akihiko snapped, suddenly stepping forward until he was nerve wrackingly close to her naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd be wasting my time staring if I had NO respect for you?\" He asked in annoyance. \"You think I'd give you the time of day if you were anyone else? If one of those damn fangirls that swarm around me came down with Eden Syndrome do you really think I'd care? I don't waste my time on just anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting that staring at me is...a sign of respect?\" Mitsuru asked, very conscious of her proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm suggesting that you, Mitsuru Kirijo, are one of the only people I know who has the drive, the focus, and the skill to impress me. I'm saying that you, Minako, Fuuka, and Yukari are the only women I've ever known who are fierce and strong enough to face down adversity and hardened enough to overcome it. And yes, your also one of the most beautiful girls I've ever met. So congratulations. You are someone I can't help but pay attention to no matter what. Only someone like you would be worth staring at.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's very twisted logic.\" Mitsuru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But its the truth.\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two paused and stared at each other. Akihiko finally turned away. \"Let's get to the nurse's office. Don't want that bruise to be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru took a small step forward. To Akihiko's amusement, she could only manage small steps, her hands awkwardly keeping the cold press on her rear, causing her breasts to jutt out and bounce in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Akihiko....\" Mitsuru said at last. \"Why have you...never expressed an interest...if you were interested in me...in that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Lots of reasons. First, you were always kinda distant and mission focused. I thought I'd just get reprimanded. Or worse, you'd take offense and hit me with an execution. Not too ashamed to admit you were pretty terrifying when you wanted to be. And then there was Shinjiro. I figured if I showed interest in you, then he'd start showing interest and it'd be one more thing we'd start competing over. And that would screw up the mission. And after he left...I dunno. It just never seemed right. Then the new kids showed up and I just kinda forgot about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...heh. Look. When I said I have my limits at being a gentleman, I meant looking at you. I'm not going to do anything to you physically...heh. Spanking aside. Well, that and maybe the Execution. I'll keep my options open from there.\" Akihiko laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if...I didn't mind...anything physical?\" Mitsuru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkihiko stopped, and turned around slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting at, Kirijo?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You...must have noticed by now...that my 'execution' back there has...left me out of sorts.\" Mitsuru said, nodding to the way her nipples stuck out erect and inviting, and the soft drip of juices coming from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, what? Want me to 'help' you with that?\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I want you to do whatever you like! I...want to be touched! And I'd rather it be someone I...trust. Someone who...I can put my fate in the hands of completely. Y-you could also be cruel and...and make me s-s-stay like this...naked and h-h-horny.\" Mitsuru blushed at describing herself in such crude terms, accurate though they might be. \"I am the guilty party. My...my fate is in the hands of my executioner! I will submit to whatever you deem to be necessary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkihiko bowed his head and laughed. One hell of a day.</span></div></div>",

In the hallway ahead, a mortified looking Junpei was dutifully staring at an equally mortified naked Yukari, who was presently holding her right leg up over her head in a ballet like position, obscenely displaying her pussy for all the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei!\" Akihiko called. \"What the hell are you two still doing out here in the hall? Where's Aigis and Minako?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story....\" Junpei said, grateful for the distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men caught each other up on their morning, Yukari tentatively made her way to her naked senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mitsuru-senpai.\" Yukari said dully, her cheeks still flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Takeba.\" Mitsuru said just as dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....a nasty looking bruise you have there.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. I...attempted to enforce a large scale execution on myself, and things escalated quickly.\" Mitsuru said, averting her eyes and blushing. \"You...seemed to showing a lot of yourself to Iori just now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Other 'me' was feeling particularly bitchy just now...\" Yukari said with her own blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Mitsuru nodded, unsurprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stared at each, then Yukari leapt forward and embraced her Senpai in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi-chan, I haaate this! Hate it, hate it, hate it! Everyone I know is going to see me like this! Can't we just run off somewhere and...and make out until this whole awful day goes away??\" Yukari moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there were any chance our...alternates would permit that, I would do so in a heartbeat.\" Mitsuru responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But aren't you supposed to be the big cool senpai who has it all together and encourages us all to be studious and leads by example? You can't go around cutting school, senpai!\" Yukari said, her frazzled voice attempting a note of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru snorted at the comment. \"Today has hardly been a shining example of me being cool and collected. But yes. I intend to continue the Kirijo tradition of being a model student. I shall do nothing but make high scores on my exams and attend to the problems of our student body....I may be a sex crazed exhibitionist now, but I will be the most disciplined, perfect school girl exhibitionist I can possibly be!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari shook with laughter, then looked up at the red haired girl. \"Senpai, I'm sorry. I'm not a good person....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there's a story behind that bruise. I know you probably ended up humiliating yourself while a whole room of gawking idiots stared at you, and I know it must have been awful. And I just don't care!\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mitsuru said, bemused and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I suck! But all I can think about is how sexy you must have looked, your butt cheeks on display and bouncing with every spank! Or how you have to hold that icepack on your ass with both hands, which pretty much makes you 100% exposed and vulnerable to a frontal assault!\" Yukari said, demonstrating by grasping her senpai's breasts and squeezing the orbs. When all the reaction she received was a momentary surprise followed by a blush and a moan and a slight straightening of the back to push the beautiful mounds outward to provide easier access, Yukari gleefully began playing with the large breasts and erect nipples in ernest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...oooooh...that's all right. I'm not a good person either!\" Mitsuru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want- gasp- I want to know all the details of your experience with Junpei! I want to picture every moment when I close my eyes so I can properly gratify myself later!\" Mitsuru said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai! Are you getting off on my humiliations now!\" Yukari said in mock shock. \"Its okay. Its not like we can't comfort each other AND enjoy the story, right? How about when this day is over we take you somewhere private, tie you up, and make you give us every detail. We'll make you draw every humiliating moment out while we play with your body, and when your done we'll reward you with as many orgasms as you can handle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if your turn comes next.\" Mitsuru said, to which Yukari blushed but nodded. Continuing to play with her breasts, Yukari pressed her face into Mitsuru's clevage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Do you plan to come out of there?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! I'm just going to hide from everybody until we can wear clothes again! Sorry for the inconvience, but I'm never leaving!\" Yukari declared, her voice muffled by the fleshy lumps covering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to come out of there soon, you know.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. After all, if your hiding your face like that, you can't issue any kisses, and your senpai is suddenly in need.\" Mitsuru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari snorted, then slowly lifted her face upwards as if emerging from a sea. Her lips met the red haired beauty, and the pair shared an intense embrace, each wishing there was time to experience something more intense still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks! Can't you come to our class, at least! Its harder dealing with this crap without cool big senpai to reassure us, you know!\" Yukari whispered after reluctantly ending the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You have Minako, at least. I'm the one who won't have my silly, energetic juniors to make me smile in the middle of this!\" Mitsuru countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess if your feeling overwhelmed, just think of me and Min-chan going through the same thing and remember we'll be there soon to make you feel better. In a lot of ways.\" Yukari whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she, by the way?\" Mitsuru said, patting her lovers cheek in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know. Went off to look for a bathroom. She was....acting weird. Weird even with the whole naked slave slut thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we find her, then?\" Mitsuru asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoaxing the boys out of their conversation, the odd foursome made their way through the hallway of the school. Eventually, they found Aigis bent over a doorway, muttering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensors at maximum....working...working....confirmed. Voice and appearance have altered. Energy signature is identical. Primary threat, registered. Previous encounter....Moonlight Bridge, ten years, nine months ago. Orgia mode, activated. Objective- eliminate all shadows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's mutual shock, the robot's hands sprang to life as a pair of machine guns. With one quick motion, Aigis bashed the bathroom door of its hinges, running inside at full speed....</span></div></div>",

In my experience, persona users are the biggest threats to these entities, but most of them disdain or at worst underestimate what such individuals can accomplish. This being seems to be observant enough to understand the danger and is seeking to eliminate the threat you pose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that. I don\u2019t mean SEES though. I mean\u2026I mean WHY DO ONLY THE GIRL HAVE TO BE NAKED?? Its not fair!\u201d Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos paused, then snickered. \u201cKeep in mind that shadows of this level of power are formed from the collective unconscious. Trying to apply some sort of rational explanation for their behavior is..well, to put it simply, they are beings that embody the most irrational part of humanity. And for as long as you humans have had the notion to use skins and cloth to cover yourselves you\u2019ve nursed a hidden desire to uncover the bits on those you find attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, obviously! But\u2026but half the planet is girls! And girls want to see the boys naked, not each other!\u201d Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharos gave her a long, blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh, shut up! Yes! Fine! MOST girls don\u2019t want to see each other naked!\u201d Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suspect that it is simply this Shadow\u2019s nature to target women only. There are likely other Shadows who focus their attention purely on men. You remember that fellow at the bar? Vincent?\u201d Pharos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one who was having nightmares about towers and falling and goats and who really liked dating girls named Catherine?\u201d Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. I suspect he might be an example of one such.\u201d Pharos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could ask another question, the door to the bathroom was suddenly smashed open. Minako felt the force of the blast flow past her, causing her hair to fly in all directions and her body to jiggle in certain places. Shaking her head to clear her senses, Minako found herself staring down the barrel of Aigis\u2019 gun hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand aside, Minako.\u201d Aigis said solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi-chan?\u201d Minako whispered in confusion. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she looked over her shoulder at the impassive gaze of Pharos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinako-san. I repeat, stand aside. He is dangerous. I cannot allow you to be hurt.\u201d Aigis said evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Wait, Ai-chan! He\u2019s not dangerous!\u201d Minako said, inserting herself between Pharos and Aigis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do not understand. He is not human. He is our enemy.\u201d Aigis said, her voice a weird mix of threatening and pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I know he isn\u2019t human. But he isn\u2019t our enemy! He isn\u2019t dangerous. Not now.\u201d Minako shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe IS dangerous. He IS our enemy. I-I faced him ten years ago! He is Arcana of Death!\u201d Aigis snapped, her voice losing the mechanical precision as a strained note took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know who he is, Ai-chan.\u201d Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. Minako registered her friends standing in the doorway, but kept her eyes focused entirely on Aigis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know what he is, then you know what I have done.\u201d Aigis said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. I know who he is, and who I am. I know why you stay so close to me.\u201d Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you know why I cannot fail a second time.\u201d Aigis whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis moved, faster than lightning. It was only Minako\u2019s own instincts that kept her between the robot and her dark companion. The girl was not as fast as Aigis, but she was fast enough to remain an obstacle. She had faith that Aigis would not allow herself to harm the girl she had sworn to be with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me! Events have changed! Nyx isn\u2019t coming. He isn\u2019t going to start the Fall.\u201d Minako said, as Aigis reared in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou base that assessment on the information he has provided. He cannot be trusted. And even if it is true, so long as he lives there exists the possibility that he will bring death upon us all!\u201d Aigis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKilling him won\u2019t stop Nyx!\u201d Minako snapped, reaching out and grabbing Aigis by both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople have been calling to her this whole time! If Pharos dies, it just means that we forget the threat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease me.\u201d Aigis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me. Think about what your doing! Back then, when you fought him with all your strength, he was just one tiny piece of what they summoned in that lab! He\u2019s whole again, Ai-chan! If he wanted to hurt anyone, he could have done it already. None of us would have stood a chance. So don\u2019t you dare! I\u2019m not going to let you rip yourself apart trying to fight something you can\u2019t beat and you don\u2019t need to fight to begin with!!\u201d Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image from a lost timeline sprang into her mind. An image of a forlorn Ryoji standing over the remains of a smoking, broken form of a robot. Not this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease me.\u201d Aigis whispered again. \u201cA machine exists to fulfill a purpose. My purpose is to defeat my enemy. A machine who cannot fulfill its purpose is useless. I cannot fail again. I must atone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Minako whispered. \u201cAtone for what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not fail again. He will harm no one else. No one else will die because of him. No one else\u2026will\u2026be..alone because I have failed.\u201d Aigis hissed the words out.<br>\r\nMinako blinked. And trembled. She bit her lip, trying to hold back the tears forming in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAigis\u2026none of that night was your fault.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy function was to kill that shadow. My purpose was to contain him. Everything that was destroyed, all those who died that night- they are a product of my failure.\u201d Aigis whispered back. \u201cMinako, please let me go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAigis\u2026no one blames you\u2026\u201d Minako said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I cannot fulfill my function, I have no right to exist.\u201d Aigis insisted. \u201cIf I had not failed, your life\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT HAPPENED TO MOM AND DAD ISN\u2019T YOUR FAULT!\u201d Minako screamed, dramatically losing the battle with her tears, which flowed in rivulets down her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cause it, and you couldn\u2019t have stopped it! You did your best to help! I know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinako\u2026please\u2026let me go\u2026\u201d Aigis begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako held the robot\u2019s hands more tightly, clutching them as she pressed her body against the deadly edge of Aigis\u2019 fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you really want to do this, Ai-chan, you go through me. I saw too much pointless death that night. I won\u2019t watch anyone else get hurt, especially not for stupid reasons that aren\u2019t their fault.\u201d Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I failed\u2026I used you..I\u2026ruined your life.\u201d Aigis said, a tremor rolling through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Minako asked, tilting her head. \u201cWhat were you supposed to do, Ai-chan? You couldn\u2019t kill it. You had no way to contain it except the seal. Letting it go meant more death. And yes, there were bad days! So many! The foster homes, slowly watching my brother retreat into himself\u2026so many bad days. But am I supposed to regret meeting you? Meeting everyone? Especially when the other option was for the whole world to die ten years ago??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minako drew in a breath. \u201cAi-chan. You want atonement? You want to make up for your failure? Then please listen to the girl you met on that bridge the night the world went to hell. Please trust me. Please don\u2019t do this. Please\u2026know that whatever you had to do that night\u2026I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis stood ramrod still, staring at Minako, at her and through her. Her eyes seemed to take on a lighter shade of neon blue as her arms slowly, reluctantly fell to her sides. Minako shifted her own grasp, embracing the robot. All at once a familiar sensation crept over her, as the world seemed to slow down and her mind shifted to an inward focus. Slowly an image coalesced in the back of her mind, a Tarot Card of a winged figure carrying a rod and standing upon a solar disk. A voice rang through her mind. \u2018Thou art I.I am thou. Though shalt have our blessing when thou choosest to create a Persona of the Aeon Arcana.\u201d Phantom lights played across Minako\u2019s vision, as the warm sensation of a new Social Link wrapped itself around the fabric of her soul. She smiled even while the tears ran like a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the world, Ai-chan.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..feel strange, Minako-san.\u201d Aigis said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts okay. I don\u2019t know if I agree with you. About a machine being useless if it can\u2019t complete a goal. It doesn\u2019t matter. You aren\u2019t a machine anymore. You make your own goals now.\u201d<br>\r\nAigis hesitated, confused and drained, but slowly she raised her hands to return the other girl\u2019s embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence elapsed. One Junpei finally broke. \u201cOkay\u2026uhh\u2026so can anyone tell me just what the HELL is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sounds of typical school life drifted in from the other side- the jotting of pencils, the rustle of paper, the low murmur of student voices and the laconic drone of Mr. Ekoda punctuated by the occasional squelch of a marker on the white board. So very familiar. So very close at hand. All that was left to do was slide the door open, apologize for her lateness with a bow, and quickly take her seat. Just act normal. Simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand lifted up to move the door aside. And as it had a dozen times already, froze in midair. She felt herself trembling, felt whatever thin wall of resolve she had managed to craft for herself once more collapse into dust, and felt a tiny whimper escape her lips as her eyes gazed down at herself. Nothing was normal. Nothing was right. She was standing in the hallway of her highschool naked except for her shoes and socks! This was a nightmare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka was by her nature extremely introverted and closed off. Raised in a family of doctors who forever insisted she achieve more and be the best, Fuuka learned that nothing she did would ever be good enough to satisfy her parents. Her solution to avoid conflict was to give everything to everyone no matter the burden on herself. She had a desire to belong, a desire that allowed her to endure extremes of bullying that would have crushed or inspired retaliation in most anyone else. Part of her felt she deserved such treatment. Lately, based on the other personality that had bubbled to the surface, she wondered if she didn't also enjoy the mistreatment, that some little vindictive piece of her didn't consider herself more virtuous and superior due to the suffering others put her through. And another part wondered if some equally debased part of her didn't enjoy being abused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Fuuka was prone to isolation and suffering to fit in. Along the same lines she tried to dress as conservatively and unremarkably as possible. Ironically, her lack of fashion sense made her stand out like a sore thumb. Her inferiority complex also inspired her to hide what others would flaunt, downplaying her cute, thin curves and modestly large breasts and nicely shaped bubble butt under deliberately baggy clothes. The lack of dates in her life was a small price to pay to avoid the horror of being noticed and especially admired by other human beings! Small wonder she had panicked and hidden herself behind Yukari on the beach under Junpei's perverted commentary. It was something of a relief to know that in the company of the other SEES girls she was easily the least athletic or well endowed. All the better to deflect attention, allowing her to downplay the fact that her petite figure had more charms and curves than many (Junpei included) fully suspected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was no hiding! If anything, her lifestyle of staying indoors and covering up as much as possible when outside was now working firmly against her as her overly pale skintone made her stand out all the more among her peers. She had never been an athletic girl, but a steady diet and a range of devices conjured from the depth of Tanaka's workshop (many of which worked quite well, much to the business man's consternation) she had been able to maintain a good looking physique. Her petite size implied a level of thinness she did not truly possess, as her curvy body, bouncy bottom and especially a pair of well endowed breasts (giving no competition to her dormmates, of course, but still impressive on a girl of Fuuka's height) now proved. Worse, Fuuka's usual preference of leggings was strictly forbidden under the Eden Syndrome dress code, which meant she had to resort to a pair of regular white socks for her ensemble today. Unlike the other girls, who could claim whatever fraction of dignity they could be covering their lower thighs with boots or long stockings Fuuka was sporting more bare skin than any of her fellow nudists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who's fault is that?\u201d Fuuka asked herself, her trembling hand balling into a fist. \u201cWhat am I doing? Is this how far I can go? I...I made love to my senior in front of everyone this morning! Me! Not the other one in my head! I swore I could handle it! Not hide behind everyone on the train! Not...not run away and leave my leader and my friend cowering naked in the middle of this city! Everything...everything spiraled out of control because of what I did to her! Everyone has to...has to do this...because I was a coward! They all left for their classrooms. They all have had to endure the shock and the stares. And now I can't even take my share of that shame? The one who deserves to suffer most of all???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the momentum of her self-defacing tirade, Fuuka grabbed the door before her and slid it aside with as much force as she could muster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u2026.and immediately regretted it. The sounds within came to an immediate hault as every eye turned towards her and stared. All the bravado, all the recriminations and all the rage...everything fled from her. Fuuka was left with nothing but the overwhelming knowledge that she was indeed standing in front of her home room teacher and a room filled with her fellow students and peers while completely naked. Trembling, she at first attempted to follow through on her original plan of fake nonchalance, pretending that the situation was normal. That resolve lasted a single step into the room before she let out another whimper, took a step back, and almost fled down the hall. But with a horrible sinking feeling she realized that course was also too late. The bandaid was already ripped off. With a tentative, miserable glance at her teacher and another at her peers, Fuuka again stepped into the room. This time she brought up her bookbag and shrank down as much as possible behind it, attempting to hide her body as she tip toed fully into the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I...I...I'M SORRY FOR BEING LATE!\u201d Fuuka screamed, her whole naked body reddening, her shame forcing her to abandon any protection her book bag gave her so that it might hide her face from having to look at her gawking audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka dashed to her seat, dropping her bag and hoping to curl up into a ball in her seat. Instead, she felt herself yanked backwards by an iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Yamagishi, what in the merciful Buddha's name do you think you are doing in this classroom??\u201d Mr. Ekoda demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Ekoda, nooooo!\u201d Fuuka wailed as she was once again dragged to the front of the class, this time without any protection but her hands. The poor girl did try to cover herself all while fidgetting and whimpering. The rest of the class had recovered from their shock and were whispering and snickering at her plight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just what on earth-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEden syndrome!\u201d Fuuka wailed. \u201cI have Eden Syndrome! I have to come to class naked!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEden Syndrome? What are you...hmph. I saw a memo about this. Stay there, Yamagishi. I'll see about this...\u201d Ekoda muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral silent moments passed as Ekoda grumblingly hacked away at his laptop. Fuuka, who was covering herself in front and bending over, came to the awful realization that her butt and pussy had been exposed while she was leaning forward. She spared an anguished glance at the class. Leering faces, smirks, and disgusted looks greeted her. Her eyes settled on the pigtailed girl seated behind her own desk. Maki, a close friend of Natsuki Moriyama and a part of the gang that used to torment her. Maki was the defacto leader of said \u201cgang\u201d now that Natsuki had moved. Fuuka had no idea how to feel about her. Maki had helped lock her in the gym the night she was subsumed into Tartarus, but she had also been the first to go looking for Fuuka when she went missing. These days she seemed kinder and more understanding of Fuuka, but unlike Natsuki she had never officially apologized. And there was still a hint of playful vindictiveness every now and again. Like now. Maki was clearly relishing the way Fuuka was squirming in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is a fine mess. First virtual zombies, now naked drollops prancing around in front of everyone. A disaster of a generation. Gone entirely wrong. All right, Yamagishi. Your story appears genuine. Still, how very disappointing.\u201d Ekoda said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..I didn't CHOOSE to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe memo also says that Eden Syndrome girls are to conduct themselves with proper respect and etiquette becoming of girls attending this campus. Slouching and covering yourself like that is specifically not allowed. Assume a proper posture at once!\u201d Ekoda snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka paused, then glanced at the student body, then down at her own body. With a long, low moan of absolute humiliation Fuuka straightened up, turned to face the class, and let her arms move to her sides, squaring her shoulders and placing her feet shoulder width apart. She bit her lip and hung her head in abject shame, displaying her nudity completely uncovered and openly to her mocking classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you, man. She was outside this morning, going at it with the rest of those sluts up in the Iwatodai dorms.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFuck. Ghostgirl has way better tits than I thought she did. Ass isn't bad either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blushed, catching the whispers being spoken about her body and enforced nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's enough. Fuuka, sum up your situation so your classmates understand this shameful situation you have found yourself in.\u201d Ekoda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir...\u201d Fuuka mutter. \u201cI...Eden Syndrome is an offshoot of Apathy Syndrome. The current theory is that it draws upon a different emotional spectrum to produce a different physical response. Rather than being catatonic, my mind forces me to...stay naked no matter where I am. N-no matter how ashamed or humiliated I feel, my mind won't allow me to wear any clothes. P-please forgive my obscene behavior!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka punctuated this last part with a bow, causing her breasts to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis memo said something about additional lewd acts?\u201d Ekoda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blushed. \u201cY-yes. Eden Syndrome also causes me to perform acts of humiliation and sexuality if I have not suffered a certain level of embarrassment for an extended period. This can become extreme and unpredictable, so please help me control myself by...by...please help me by humiliating me first!\u201d Fuuka said, utterly mortified, bowing a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. What she means is that you should request MINOR acts from her that she finds embarrassing. She will apparently follow minor requests like posing for a camera or...sigh...submitting to request for groping or spankings. All of which you will do outside of classtime. This has been enough of a disruption already.\u201d Ekoda said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does she have to sleep with someone if they order her to?\u201d One of the guys spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you even think-\u201d Ekoda began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I don't.\u201d Fuuka said. \u201cI have some control over some of my actions. I won't sleep with anyone that...\u201d She blushed. \u201c..that I don't already have an interest in being with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the whole thing in front of the school? You were already hot for..what? Three other girls? All before your head got all messed up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I...I...\u201d Fuuka sputtered. \u201cThat...would appear to be the case...on some level...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class applauded, hooted and laughed as Fuuka hung her head in humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. Take your seat, Yamagishi. I will attempt to incorporate some humiliating exercises into the lesson plan to keep you calm.\u201d Ekoda said. \u201cNo surprise you ended up this way, really. Not when living under the same roof as that...woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew exactly what Mitsuru had done to execute Ekoda for his role in suppressing knowledge of Fuuka's disappearance, but it was an open secret that he resented it and by extension Fuuka herself. Fuuka cringed at the thought that he finally had a chance to get as bunch second hand revenge through humiliating her as he could ever want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka took her seat and the Ekoda finally returned to his lecture. As he became absorbed in the subject matter, Fuuka felt a light tap on her shoulder. Letting out a long suffering sigh, she turned and found herself staring at none other than Maki herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeya, Fuuka-chan.\u201d She said, all smiles and hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaki-san.\u201d Fuuka said wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I heard that you have this little problem...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat this little Eden Syndrome deal might not just cause you some embarrassment, but that you might actually NEED a little humiliation to keep things from getting even more out of hand.\u201d Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's...right.\u201d Fuuka said, swallowing hard. Why was she dreading and anticipating what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood news. I know this little bitch squad whose whole pastime and passion pretty much revolves around tormenting you!\u201d Maki whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh. Look, Fuuka. About what happened...Natsuki was the only one to step up and really apologize for it. But all of us regret what happened. Not just because everything got screwed up and went too far...or because of that freaky ghost shit afterwards. You were looking for people to hang out with, and we treated you like crap. We turned out to be really shitty friends...but like I said, maybe you could use some shitty friends right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...your asking to...bully me again?\u201d Fuuka finally asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaki nodded with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think there's a way to do that...nicely.\u201d Fuuka pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Fuuka.\u201d Maki smiled. \u201cYour such a good girl. You have no idea. There are so many ways to make you blush and give you the time of your life all at once. So many. Come on. Let us play with you. I promise you won't regret it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

What little control I'm allowed over my body disappears if I try to avoid being humiliated! I have no control or say here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Now I'm starting to feel guilty.\" Maki said, not really sounding the least bit guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't! If I can't avoid being humiliated over and over again I'd rather it be from submitting to someone I trust rather than a stranger or random circumstance. Or...someone malicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember your talking to the girl who was malicious enough to lock you inside a school for a whole night? You trust someone like that?\" Maki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust the girl who came to find me later that night.\" Fuuka said with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Came back because we thought you might have killed yourself and didn't want to get in trouble!\" Maki shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true.\" Fuuka said immediately. \"You aren't that callous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your just too damn naive for your own good.\" Maki whispered back, a touch of bitterness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not.\" Fuuka said, glancing behind her. \"I might have been. Once. But I've seen some things since then. I've learned some things about myself, too. Like how there's a voice in my head that keeps showing me the worst parts of myself and building them up because it refuses to see any worth inside me. Your like that, too, Maki. You and Natsuki both believe your so much more awful than you really are. I know the thought crossed your mind that you'd get in trouble if something happened to me. But that's not the same thing as honestly not caring if I lived or died. You aren't like that, no matter what you might think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, a flash of memory played in Fuuka's mind. It was a cold, bitter night atop a steeple of Tartarus. She remembered the pain of the shackles, cold and unyielding, clamping her to the cross with merciless force. She remembered the raw state of her emotions- helpless rage, blind terror, an overwhelming spike of grief at being USED. The worst night of her life, the night that almost broke all of them. Fuuka hugged herself a little more tightly, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with her nudity. His eyes. The hollow, uncaring, demented eyes of the Chairman, executing Mitsuru's last living family member with the same casual glee he displayed when offering up one of his insufferable jokes. Listening to Maki's recriminations was almost funny. She was as close to one who had truly abandoned any value in a human life as the Earth was to the Moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks, little miss psychoanalyst. But whatever you say, it still feels like shit. The fact you can sit there and not hate me forever almost pisses me off. Your insufferable good girl act is part of what made us pick on you in the first place, you know.\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Fuuka asked, burying her head in her hands. \"You might be in for a surprise, then. I'm not as kind or forgiving as you think. There's a part of me that really does hold a grudge for what you did. And this stupid Syndrome has let her out more than once already! If you want to know the truth, your probably in more danger than I am.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really now?\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can believe me or not. But I'll give you fair warning. She wants to punish you. If you aren't careful, you might just end up as naked as I am.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I see.\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe me?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do remember how you vanished and we all started hearing voices, right? At this point, I'd believe just about anything if it comes from you. What else you got? Will the rumors I spread come to life and try to kill me? Will my TV prophecy future murder victims on rainy nights? Maybe the Moon will turn into a giant eyeball and kill us all?\" Maki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your just being silly.\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you say part of you wants to fight back, then bring it on, ghost-girl. I don't entirely get it, but I'll do whatever it takes if it means being square with you. Plus, the bitch in me never will get enough of the cute well you get all panicky and squeelly whenever you get embarrassed. Knowing you might actually fight back (for once in your goody girl life!) just makes it more exciting! So do your worst, ghost girl. I can take it, and oh boy can I dish it out!\" Maki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka sighed heavily. \"Okay. T-then...where do we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first why don't you tell me how much you like butt sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA-AT?\" Fuuka said, realizing too late that she had broken into one of the squeels Maki adored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISS YAMAGISHI! Another outburst like that and I will happily demonstrate why the lack of the paddle has ruined your generation!\" Ekoda barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! I'm sorry, sir!\" Fuuka said hastily, red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Too easy.\" Maki beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha-what do you mean...b-butt sex?\" Fuuka stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just noticing how much you were enjoying it when that Takeba girl was giving it to you earlier.\" Maki explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...saw that?\" Fuuka said, red as a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not directly. But I saw the vid on the web earlier.\" Maki shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on the internet???\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. All over the place. Its a little annoying how scattered it all is, but worth finding.\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. We'll have to do something about that. One website where everyone can see all the glorious SEES girl smut in all its slutty grandeur should be easy enough.\" Fuuka, or rather her inner puppetmaster, whispered inside her mind, much to Fuuka's horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Maki purred. \"Stop changing the subject. You liked it up the ass, didn't you ghost girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makiiiiii....\" Fuuka moaned softly. \"I...that...it....felt good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaki beamed in truimph as Fuuka did her best to melt into her chair and hide from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww. Its okay. No reason to be embarrassed over a little thing like that. Save the embarrassment for what I'm going to make you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo.\" Fuuka whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard of a butt plug, Yamagishi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka just shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. It does exactly what it sounds like its supposed to. Even better, some of them will vibrate like a dildo. And better still, some of them can be activated remotely to do that.\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Why would...why would anyone....\" Fuuka stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaki shrugged. \"Some guys like to make their girlfriends wear one while they randomly activate it in secret. They get a kick out of watching the girl squirm all day with a big thing in her butt they can randomly torment her with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....but why would you have one?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My last boyfriend was a sadistic ba....you know what, not fucking important!

But without the lube.\" Maki declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's eyes widened. Maki shrugged. \"Didn't I tell you? Total bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka reddened, sighed, and turned around. Ekoda was writing something about Confusius on the white board, engrossed in his explanation of some hyper obscure facet of the chinese philosophy and with his back turned to the class. Trembling, Fuuka squared her shoulders, pushed her chair back while keeping her upper body anchored to her desk with her hands. Her lower body, especially her butt, was pushed out invitingly between the gap between the chair's backrest and the rest of the seat. Fuuka carefully spread her legs as far as she dared without drawing Ekoda's notice. The restrained titter in the air meant she had the rest of the class' rapt attention, most of the students having eavesdropped on her early exchanges with Maki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka closed her eyes and forced herself not to scream when the slimy, blunted tip of the monster moved in between her waiting cheeks. The instrument was generously smeared with lube, but it still took a concerted effort of Maki twisting and screwing the device back and forth while Fuuka assisted by twirling her butt cheeks from side to side in a hilarious yet provocative manner. Her face was a deep purple from shame and pain (lube or no, accepting the large creature into her rear end had not been entirely pleasant). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka set up just as Ekoda turned around. He glared at her suspiciously. \"And just what is going on with that look on your face, Yamagishi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I...\" Fuuka whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Ekoda, Fuuka needs to use the restroom. She didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to cause any more trouble, but she's been holding it in since class started.\" Maki interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEkoda twisted his face in disgust. \"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. She looks like she's been filled up to almost bursting...\" Maki said, winking at Fuuka who gave her a face of pure misery in turn while the rest of the class snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you, I don't require a detailed explanation of her condition. Very well. Yamagishi, take care of your situation  and stop disrupting class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, well take her there.\" Maki said, gesturing to the rest of her 'gang'. \"Make sure she doesn't wonder off in her weird mental state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Yes, very well. I'm certain your little group hasn't absorbed a thing from the lesson in any event. See that your back before the end of the period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Maki said, springing up and walking in front of Fuuka. Between her and the other two girls, the sight of monster sticking out of her was blocked from Ekoda. The notable limping motion she displayed while trying to walk was dismissed as her need for the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Fuuka? You having a little trouble walking?\" Maki asked when they had stepped into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka, drowning in humiliation, could  barely manage to look her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Total bitch.\" Maki said. \"Your doing really well, though. Your being a very good little ghostgirl. Maki-sama is pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blinked, blushing and lowering her eyes to hide a sudden smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. Does my little ghost like being praised by master?\" Maki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Fuuka yelped. \"Or...maybe. A little...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little. Poor Fuuka, like all the ladies of SEES, was learning a great deal about herself in the most direct and humiliating way possible. A love of being shamed and dominated was manifesting itself in all the girls, helped along by Temptation. In this case, being praised for her obedience and submission was being magnified from a mild thrill to a jolt of pure joy and contentment. All the girls would experience this to one degree or another, though Fuuka more than the rest (there was a fetish for submission hiding closer to the surface in her heart than the rest). One more tool to inspire them to crave complete subjugation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...walk down that hall, Fuuka-chan.\" Maki said, raising her camera phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're going to film me??\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Don't worry. I won't show it to everyone. Maybe. If your a good girl. But Natsuki needs to see this!\" Maki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maki, no! Don't! Not Natsuki-chan!\" Fuuka begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say about backtalk?\" Maki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka hung her head. With a long suffering sigh, she made her way down the hall, sporting an awkward motion thanks to her humiliating passenger. She had made to the stares when her world suddenly exploded. The device inside her had suddenly come alive. Halfway down the hall she yelped as the device in her rear briefly came to life. She spun around and gaped at Maki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Finger must have slipped.\" Maki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka glowered at her, turning back to her progression toward the hall's end. Periodically, she had to catch herself from stumbling or occasionally leapt from one foot to the other as Maki tormented her with turning the device off and on. Finally, she made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnnd send! Natsuki is gonna love this.\" Maki said in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka sighed to herself, out of breath and quite completely humiliated. Suddenly, she paused. With a look that gave even the self-proclaimed bitch pause, Fuuka gestured for her friend to be silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you!\" A voice echoed up from below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari?\" Fuuka whispered. Her friends should be in class by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only started remembering a little while ago.\" A second voice came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Fuuka asked, her worry deepening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point, dammit!\" Yukari cried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your making a scene.\" A third voice, Mitsuru noted dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?? All we've been doing all day is making a scene! All we CAN do is make a scene! Ever since SHE dragged us into this one after the other!\" Yukari screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari!\" Mitsuru cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I didn't want this any more than the rest of you!\" Minako shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you? DIDN'T YOU? Aren't you and the bitch inside your head really the same person? Didn't you just get through saying exactly that?\" Yukari screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair! You know its not that simple!\" Minako shot back. \"She's a broken mirror! She isn't...the real me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just who the hell even is the real you, Minako?\" Yukari said, more softly. \"How would I even know her if I saw her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what does that...even...\" Minako choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to us. That thing...that Pharos...has been with you this whole time. He's fed you cryptic warnings and hints about our enemy FOR A WHOLE YEAR. And you didn't say a word. You never do. You prod, you coax, you comfort....you TRICK every one of us to pour our stupid hearts out to you, but you never tell us a single thing in return. Where do you go at night? Who are the ones in Blue I see you with? No one but you knows because you'd never dare trust us lowly little friends...little lovers with your precious secrets. Heaven forbid! And just now? You start remembering some whole other world and what do you do? You run away from us and confront it all on your own! AEGIS ALMOST KILLED YOU AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHY! Do you...do you even know...what you mean to the rest of us? To me? Do you even know what...what it would do to me...if something happened to you? Do you even care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yu-yukari...\" Minako choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T TOUCH ME! I don't...I can't...I've given you everything, Minako. You know my past, you know what love, and hate, and what I'm afraid of most. Me, Mitsuru, Fuuka...we've all let you in. We...we were stripped bare a long time before Temptation showed up! And you know...with Temptation, I know where I stand. I'm a plaything in Its sick little game. You, Minako...I don't know what we are to you. Until I figure that out...I...just leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She watched as Yukari turned, a lithe form of grace that stabbed at her heart with every elegant curve and nubile bounce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....\" Minako choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParalyzed, caught in the same painfully slow motion with the rest of the world, Minako watched as her friend and lover fled from her like she was a thing crawling in the depths of Tartarus. She never looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuka...don't...go...\" Minako plead to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking back tears, Minako clenched her fists and started forward....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ......and felt Mitsuru's hand take a firm grip on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Give her space.\" The Kirijo girl instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Senpai...\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Every instinct is telling you to go after her, explain yourself, repair the damage. But this is a wound Yukari has to heal on her own. Your part in this is the hardest role you'll ever have to play. Wait for her and trust her to come to terms with this by herself.\" Mitsuru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what she said. What if...\" Minako trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Breath. Consider the situation. We watched you confront Aegis, naked and defenseless. For one awful instant she thought...no, we all thought that once again we were to bear witness to the death of someone we cared about more than anything in the world. That terror and your revelations simply left her reeling. And by now you know that an upset Takeba's first line of defense is harsh words and directionless anger. Her words had very little to do with what was truly hurting her. She needs you, Arisato. More than she's dared to need anyone since her father. The thought of losing you as she lost him...\" Mitsuru left the thought unfinished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai....\" Minako whispered, turning and hugging the older woman tightly. Mitsuru smiled softly as her junior let out a heavy sob on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's wrong. She so wrong. She's stronger than she thinks. You both are.\" Minako cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Am I so transparent?\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I knew it would be a shock. I just couldn't let it happen again! Aegis...I couldn't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Mitsuru whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's right. I shouldn't have kept so many secrets...\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that as if your the only one to hide things from the rest of us. You do recall I've made my share of confessions, yes?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm. And Yuka-chan didn't take them very well, either.\" Minako laughed and sniffled. \"But still....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Mitsuru paused. \"If you feel that way, Arisato, why did you hide it for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. I'm not sure anymore. At first, I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating or going crazy. Floating coffins and creepy little children don't exactly sound like something a sane person sees, after all. When I learned more about what I could do, I thought Pharos might just be another Persona hiding in my mind. But that's really just an excuse. I knew something was off all along. The way he'd always appear around the full moon...it made no sense unless he was something else altogether. I think, maybe, I was just avoiding it. I didn't want Pharos or Nyx or...even the Velvet Room to worm their way in. Not when I had finally started to...\" Minako trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Started to what, Arisato?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Mitsuru paused. \"Arisato...Minako...I should have realized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. How would you know, Senpai. I've had ten years to perfect the act. The truth? Yuka-chan...everything is the opposite of what she thinks. She doesn't need me. I need her. I need you. I need my team and my family. I need this school and all its clubs and counsel meetings. I need the city and its bookstores and theaters and late nights at the mall. I need people, Senpai. As long as I listen, hear their stories and watch them grow stronger...as long as I see life through their eyes I never have to look back. As long as I'm with you...I don't have to think about myself. I don't feel alone. Or empty. I don't have to think about what I've lost. I don't have to fall into myself the way my brother did. I won't go numb. I remember what I have now and what I care about HERE. I remember that I'm still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru regarded her a long moment, then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. Junpei and Akihiko have likely made contact with the Kirijo team by now. With any luck they will have repaired the damage to the bathroom without anyone being the wiser. Hopefully our diagnostic of Aegis will confirm your presumption of her breakthrough.\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe they'll have a potion or something that can help with your bruise.\" Minako chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru blanched. \"Yes. That as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako raced ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arisato....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will always be happy to remind you that you still live.

The sight of course did nothing to preserve either's dignity, but was fairly hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear one word from either of you.\" Mitsuru said, her voice full of menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr, right.

Uh, er, sure...\" Junpei complied, acting mostly on reflex, moving to intercept the group of businessmen and obstructing their view of the naked women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai?...\" Minako asked. Certainly, she was in no great hurry to be seen naked once again by a group of gawking strangers, but Mitsuru was panicking more in this moment than she had in the theater at the prospect of orgasming (for the first time) in front of an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akihiko!

To see me in such a disgraceful state would...would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroy any ability you had garnered to assert dominance in the board room. Your intimidation factor would be completely dead since you are no longer the furious daughter of the former CEO but now a pathetic school girl they've all seen naked and ashamed in a helpless situation. Most of them are shrewd enough business men that you can probably still run the company by reason and outlining how your ideas will make money, but it definitely puts you in an inferior role. No more brow beating and cajoling them into line.

She works so hard to maintain her own huge standards of good grades and attending to her duty as class president AND coordinatng operations with SEES and now running a huge company.

Talk to you later!\" Minako called as she, Junpei and Aegis made a sudden retreat as Mitsuru screamed after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...gonna get you for that one, you know.\" Junpei said as they rounded a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously! Really, Junpei, you don't understand girls at all. As fun as seeing my girls being humiliated is by itself, that pit of dread and anticipation I feel in the aftermath, knowing that they are embarrassed and furious and are already planning to up the ante and humiliate me even worse and that it could come at any time and its going to be SOOOOOO bad...besides, its not fair to my girls to expect them to get really emotionally invested in a big humiliating punishment if I've just been sitting around all day minding my own business. This is an equal partnership. If I don't do something naughty and mean enough to be worthy a good punishment then I'm just not holding up my end of the relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. This whole dynamic is weird. You know that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What surprises me is that I'm explaining all this to you and not once has Aegis chimed in to ask...ummm...where is Aegis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stopped, looking around the empty halls. The robot had vanished sometime during the conversation....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's Note: Buckle up people. Comedy and the sexy bits are once more taking a back seat to the FEELS because that's how my writers brain works. Sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in silence, listening to the sound of the soda can kerplunking in the dispenser and the metallic clinking of the yen plotting into the change drawer. Yukari took the coins and returned them to her bookbag. Mechanically she retrieved the drink, opening the metal cylinder and softly sipping the sugary liquid without really registering the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. Say it.\" She whispered to the air before taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nubile young girl turned to a bench near the vending machine, seating herself by pressing her bare knees up against herself, resting the soda on top of her leg and staring at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you want to.\" Yukari again said no nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you expect me to say?\" Nothing answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I fucked it up. That I drove her off. That I took the only good thing about this whole fucked up situation- being with her...being with them...and crushed it like a bug!\" Yukari snapped, taking a longer sip of her drink. \"That I'm a stupid, bitchy idiot! All the things you love telling me! Go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I'm not a charity case. And there's no fun in ripping into someone whose already kicking their own ass.\" Shadow Yukari whispered inside the young girl's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's all you ever do.\" Yukari said darkly. \"That is you, right? The part of me that glares at kids complaining about their parents because they haven't lost them? The part that said Mitsuru-senpai's dad should have been the one to die...before I got my wish? Every stupid, angry, awful thing I've ever blurted out when I was feeling hurt or scared- including all the things I said to her just now!- that's all you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why the hell would you hold back now? You've won. You've ruined my life just like we always knew you would!\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, you did all that shit by yourself. I didn't lift a finger. Second, don't be so melodramatic. This is not the first or the worst time you've gone psycho bitch on little Miss Leader-chan here. Trust me, if she was going to dump your crazy ass she would have done it way before now. And third...what the hell makes you think I want to fuck up our life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, aside from the fact you've turned me into a walking centerfold?? How about the fact that you HATE me more than anything else? I know you feel that way because its how I feel about...about these stupid temper tantrums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, brilliant deductions, little miss bare ass sherlock. Just one tiny problem. I'm not just the living embodiment of all your petty bullshit. Yeah, I inherited all the bile and envy and loathing for myself and everyone else you shoved down your subconscious throat. But I got a nice thick layer of GUILT on top of everything else. You don't just love screaming at the world, you also love feeling guilty about every last scream you make. That includes all the anger you aim at yourself, kiddo. Thanks for that, by the way. Not only does your subconscious get to loath you and all of creation beyond all reason, it also gets to feel BAD about doing it. And just as intensely. Sure do love being a walking contradiction in terms, me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its so hard on you, feel free to go back where you came from and let me put on some pants!\" Yukari spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer, me, but I'll pass. As painful as it is being the living incarnation of your irrational impulses (and sweet Buddha is that a long, exhausting list to embody!) tormenting you has been an incredibly fulfilling experience. Especially since I know exactly how to twist the situation so you'll be absolutely ashamed of yourself and even more ashamed how much you LOVE it all at once! Tell me who could do that better than I can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. But I'd be willing to find out!\" Yukari snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick burn, me, Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Look...I know you hate blurting it out like you did. Trust me, I know all too well. But this isn't the worst thing you've said while being wound up. And let's be honest- you aren't exactly wrong here. She does take on too much, she does leave her minions in the dark, and she could have gotten herself killed just now! You have a right to be scared. You have a right to demand her trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but what if she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Calls your bluff? Cuts off the relationship? Please. She's seen worse from you without flinching. And the only thing she loves more than getting all of you naked is forgiving all your stupid flaws. Its really the most annoying thing about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk about her like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Like she's human? That has to stop, Me. She makes mistakes. She isn't perfect. Honestly, the only one you've ever had a bigger hero complex for than her is the old ma-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. We're not talking about dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You ever think not talking about dad is the whole reason there was a part of you that Temptation could turn into me in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was as naked as ever, but her current body language displayed less embarrassment and more abject torment as she hugged her knees tightly against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not. Talking. About. This.\" She said, her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just going to keep hiding from it like a coward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just going to tear into him like you do everyone. You can say whatever you want about anyone else. Including me. But I won't listen to one word about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't listen to the truth, you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't listen to your bile! He saved the world! He died protecting us. He's a hero. You have no right to attack that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I have to say is how I feel. And how you feel. Everything I feel about the old bastard comes from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. That's why your afraid, right? Your thinking any mean thoughts directed towards daddy means his precious daughter betrayed him in a moment of weakness. Because we could never afford to tarnish that pristine little memory we built in our heads, could we. Without that, what on earth would we cling to for dear life instead of letting go and moving the fuck on like the rest of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Yukari screamed, trembling as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Fine. Fine. You aren't ready. Maybe I'm not either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, its more fun to mock you with the truth anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sighed. That didn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So daddy is off limits. Cool. I'd much rather talk about mommy anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glared daggers at a floor tile for a long moment. \"...what about mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Knew you'd take the bait, even though you know its a trap. I was just thinking..we should really apologize for all those things we said to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? No way. She spent years sleeping around with other men and ignoring me! What the hell do I have to apologize for?\" Yukari said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calling her a slut, for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never called her that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to her face, maybe. Not out loud. But you definitely told her. The disdain in the voice, the contempt in the body language. She knew what you thought of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what I thought of her is her own damned fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no argument there. Sleeping around with all those strange, leering, pervy men. So gross. Such a slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Y-yeah...\" Yukari stammered. \"Ummm...why do we agree on this? Where are you going with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that sex, with all those different people. Loving it so much. Remember hearing all those loud noises at night when we were still living with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not. Is there a point-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how we got leered at by that one behemoth and his pals that one time we came out of the shower in that skimpy towel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-managed to forget about that until now! Thanks for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way he convinced her to wear sluttier and sluttier outfits, too. So disgusting. Its a good thing we moved out when we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but why are you hammering on and on like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how we were afraid it would just keep on getting worse? She was acting more and more submissive, getting sluttier and sluttier. Pretty soon she was probably gonna stop wearing anything around the house at all. Remember how we were dead certain she'd just give up any pretense of respect for herself, just stop dating one guy and let herself be the play thing of as many men wanted to crash there at any time? How she would become the ultimate slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, maybe that was being unfair...I was letting myself get carried away. Not even mom would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even mom would go around totally naked and have sex with a whole harem of other partners? Yeah. Your probably right. I mean, your mom is definitely a huge, huge slut, but its not like she ever let herself be seduced by her best friends into stripping naked, right? Or let herself be totally and completely okay after one little day with getting boned silly by those same slutty friends. Or getting super turned on by all the people leering at her naked body, to the point where she's honestly wondering if being a full time sex slave for the rest of her life wouldn't be so bad after all. No way your mom would ever fall that far, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I fucking hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Its not like I had-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'I had no choice!' Is that what you want to say, me? That's so cute! It just ignores a few critical little points. First off, don't act like being puppeted around at my whim, totally helpless and vulnerable and oh so very naked, hasn't been a constant turn on since this all began! You fucking love it- its done nothing but add to your humiliation and your horniness! Second, temptation aside, the one pulling your strings is...you! I am the shadow, the true self. I am all your dirty thoughts, your pervy little dreams, your naughty fantasies, given life. So when I subject you to one humiliation after another, keep that in mind. I do it, eagerly and gleefully- because I am you, and your just a big enough slut to want all of this to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had begun to sputter, trying to form a denial and blushing all the harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. All those times you were berating mommy dearest? Sure, some of that has to do with how she was 'betraying' daddy (but we're not getting into that right now- your daddy issues are off the table by your own request). But wasn't some of it...you getting jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! No! What on Earth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all, you had to be daddy's good little girl. And good little girls definitely do not go out with lots of strange men. They don't dress sexy for them. They don't let themselves get leered at. Of course...good little girls would be offended when THEY were leered at in a towel. They definitely wouldn't sneak off to their room to touch themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I never...I...oh. Oh god!\" Yukari wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tried hard to forget that one. Also managed to forget how you started invented excuses after that day to take your showers at the weirdest times in the tiniest towels just so it would happen again. You think that's why the love hotel shadow hypnoed you into soaping up in front of Minako? It sensed how much a slut for shower you already were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushed. \"S-stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, but we still haven't talked about those late nights you spent listening to the sex...and imagining what was happening and letting your fingers do the rest...and those OTHER times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! I'm begging you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those times were the noise was too faint, so you decided to creep creep creep down to their bedroom and just slide the door open just a itty bitty bit and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop! This is too much! I don't want to remember this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course, that wasn't enough sometimes, so before you sneaked out, you'd slip off your robe and sneak around totally-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then she caught you, and your ass got the spanking of a life time, and the whole time her current date was grinning and staring, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Me, I'm just trying to explain how...we won! Mom was a slut, and we were so jealous how much fun she had being one, and now with a little help from Temptation and your better half, you finally made it! You have exceeded, in every possible way, your mom at being a total and complete slut! Your like one of those fighty cartoons Ken pretends he doesn't love- the ones where the bad guy is kicking everyone's ass but then the hero finds deep within himself the power to become a thousand times stronger. Its like that, except you've transformed into a slutty disgrace to society 1000 times more shameful than your dirty mom ever was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID SHUT UP! I'M NOT A SLUT, DAMMIT!\" Yukari said, screaming out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Slowly it dawned on Yukari that a figure was standing behind her, privy to her inner monologue and her outburst. Slowly she turned around, to see Aegis staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-aegis!\" She stammered. \"I was...I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear, Yukari-san. I will refrain from making any insinuations or comparisons regarding your behavior and that of a slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you knew she was standing there.\" Yukari thought silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You were too wound up to notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wanted me to make that outburst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucking hate you. I hate you so goddamn much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have things to do, and the robo girl probably wants to talk, soooo I'll see you later. Stay out of trouble, slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one final moment Yukari could do not but mentally scream as her counterpart laughed inside her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari Takeba was having a difficult time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just spent several moments biting back a scream, her hands balled into fists, quaking with fury at her inner self. Her heart was beating fast and hard, blood pounding through her veins. Her face was flushed with emotion- a burning red of anger, annoyance and frustration at her total inability to confront her nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face, and indeed her whole body, was a rosy shade of red from her livid emotions. Thankfully she had enough sense to reign in her rage. The struggling to calm down was hard, but she was getting herself under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the only emotion that remained painfully acute was the feeling of pure humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Wonderful. Perfect. First she catches you having a one sided argument with yourself about...about being a slut! But then on top of that she watches you have a little mental breakdown where you flail around throwing a temper tantrum!....okay, okay, breath...Aigis knows about your shadow, so she probably knows you haven't gone completely insane. She...just thinks you are a four year old throwing a fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing intensely, Yukari dared a side long glance at Aigis, who gave her a patient but otherwise unreadable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Aigis with her stupid pokerface. At least Junpei and Akihiko would smirk or give me one of those shit eating grins so I know they're spending every moment laughing at me! Who the hell knows what she's thinking? Does she think I'm dumb? Stupid? Crazy? Does she think I can't handle the stress? Does she doubt me? Or does she even care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sighed harshly. \"Okay, calm down. You know her. She's like the least judgmental person in the world. She's so non-judgmental its almost annoying! If anything she was probably just enjoying seeing you naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought brought an unwelcome mental image of the dance of rage Yukari had just done in front of her robot friend...accompanied with the unhindered jiggling of parts of her anatomy she usually kept entirely out of sight. Yukari began shaking again, her blushing growing more intense. She was acutely aware of her lack of clothes, except of course the brown shoes and black on white socks around her ankles and the humiliating white collar around her neck sporting her school ribbon. If she ever met whoever at the Kirijo Group made the \"school uniform\" for girls with Eden Syndrome she was going to strangle them. It had to be on purpose. That group had messing with the subconscious down to a literal science! So the fact that being allowed to wear these precious few items of clothing, each a very familiar part of what had been part of her normal fully clothed ensemble, only served to remind her even more how much of her old uniform was missing couldn't be a coincidence. Some sadistic little science monkey surely intended for this pornographic mockery of a school uniform to be a constant reminder that she had nothing else on! Wearing the uniform was MEANT to make her feel even more naked than she had felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glanced down at herself, her slender arms hugging her bare body. The part she hated most was just how horribly effective it was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine. Its fine. She's your friend. One of your best! You've even been to a hotspring together! She's seen this all before, right? This is way way better than getting gawked at by a bunch of strangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regretted that line of thought instantly. Images of her morning so far, filled with leering and mocking faces, burst into her mind like a dam breaking. She had been seen by so many people, so completely naked! So many eyes had seen parts of her body she had never dared to show to anyone, even those few times she had dated. And the things she had done! Dances, poses, spankings...she had played with herself in front of morning traffic! Her whole school had seen her, as naked as she had ever been, having sex in public! They had watched, leered, even touched her body! And the cameras! So many pictures, catching her acts of perversion and exposure, frozen in time forever. More people had seen her, laughed at her, and no doubt had fantasized about her than she had ever imagined possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That isn't helping anything!\" Yukari admonished uselessly as she felt her nipples stiffening and a tell tale moisture between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all because of that Temptation! She was certain of it, and clung to that certainty for dear life. The idea that she might be excited by this horrible ordeal, might actually WANT people to see her like this, humiliated and helpless and naked...that was impossible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari glanced again at Aigis, her hands now hiding her naked body and especially the incriminating signs of her arousal. She tried to mutter something, anything, as the sheer feeling of mortification set in. All she could do was squeek out a garbled apology as she scampered away, the shame overwhelming the questions coming from Aigis as she ran out of sight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aegis watched the retreating form of Yukari's naked body with a mix of fascination, pity and glee. She was striving to remain empathetic about her friend's unfortunate situation, but she could not deny the extreme level of embarrassment on display was both amusing and surprisingly cute. Oh, she intended to track down and destroy this Temptation with all due prejudice, both because of her core programming and for the sake of the humiliation he was putting her closest friends through. There was no hesitation with that imperative. The fact that she would cherish every blessed second of this curse and the way it had allowed her to fully access and appreciate the unparalleled beauty of the young female human body in such a varied number of forms was completely immaterial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she wasn't quite so callous to openly laugh at her friend's predicament. She wanted to, of course, but that would be rude. So she stifled the giggle that was threatening to escape as she gingerly followed the path her naked friend had taken (fortunately, the shock of experiencing such responses as laughter to humorous events, a decidedly human reaction foreign to her artificial mind, had somewhat dulled to a happy feeling of mild elation at the apparent breakthrough her psyche had experienced as a result of the trauma suffered in her encounter with Minako and the monstrous Shadow). She found the girl cowering behind a pillar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san?\" Aegis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aegis! Hi! Sorry! I was...I needed...I...I'm sorry! D-don't look at me!\" Yukari poked her head and bare shoulders out from behind her cover, cheeks flushed and her words a stuttering mess from sheer humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I am sorry too, Yukari-san. I had forgotten that your...condition affects your emotions as well as your ability to dress. No matter how long you spend naked in public or how many people see you in the nude your mind is unable to desensitize itself to the experience. Your sense of shame and embarrassment are as acute in this moment as the first time you were forced to display yourself with clothing.\" Aegis said in a neutral tone, trying to sound sympathetic and hopefully hiding her delight at the situation. She DID have empathy for the agony her comrades were going through. It just came with other emotions as well, some fairly contradictory to the task of showing emotional support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...Its...\" Yukari muttered, closing her eyes and biting her lip, her face burning crimson. \"Its...worse than that, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. E-every time I f-feel embarrassed about this, I can't help thinking of all the other times it happened. So it ends up being a combination of it feeling new and all of the old shame from everything that's already happened! Its like waking up from a dream or coming out of a marin karin and remembering all the stupid things I did when I wasn't thinking straight!\" Yukari squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So your new feelings of embarrassment are added to your past experiences of distress. Or to put it more simply, each time you are seen naked is in actuality MORE humiliating than the last, thanks to your past memories.\" Aegis summarized, nodding to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Yukari squeeked, the soft wail of distress both a little heartbreaking and adorable to the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to add to the misfortune, your body seems to respond to the feeling of humiliation with feelings of arousal. Each experience therefore makes you feel both more humiliated and more aroused than the last.\" Aegis continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the wor...ummm...aroused? Heh. Wh-what are you talking about, Aegis? I'm...I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san...you are aware that my design is state of the art, correct? You...realize my sensors make me aware that you are playing with yourself while we are talking?\" Aegis asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...what? WHAT?\" Yukari yelped, the fingers inside her pausing in shock....before fingering herself even more vigorously. \"You can do that! That's not fair! That's...that's cheating!! Turn it off! D-Don't look at me!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis sighed, smiling sympathetically. \"If they were not hard wired into my network, I would, Yukari-san. Unfortunately, I would have to shut down my operations entirely (which I am not willing to do) or retreat to a distance of several hundred meters before my awareness would grant you any sense of modesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo.\" Yukari wailed. \"For-forget everything you saw!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis decided not to explain that her archival functions made it impossible to delete information without a total system wipe...or that she had no intention of ever removing a second of this day or any moment to come involving the misadventures of her naked friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not mind waiting for you to finish the task at hand before we talk, Yukari-san.\" Aegis offered. \"Ah. Task at hand is not meant to be a euphemism. My apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up! I can't do something like that! Not with you...watching. Or whatever your doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you not...done so several more times already? In front of far more people than-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID SHUT UP!\" Yukari screamed, shoving her fingers in deeper. \"DON'T REMIND ME OF THAT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And NO I HAVE NOT! Not...the real me. Everytime that happened was because the other me took control and humiliated me! I could never...do something like that...on my own. Not when I know your watching me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my sensors indicate you are very close. Does it not cause further distress to cease at a juncture such as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY TO SHUT UP, DAMMIT!!\" Yukari squeeled, forcing her fingers to cease their pleasing work and dislodge from her inner folds. In the process she let out a moan of need and frustration and blushed all the harder knowing Aegis had heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, may I lend some assistance?\" Aegis asked, offering a handkerchief to the girl. \"We will need to return to class in the near future. I presume you would feel no better about the other students noticing your aroused state than with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....thanks.\" Yukari said, a slight sulk in her tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wash your hand. You may also attempt to dry yourself..elsewhere. But I believe we will need several dozen more handkerchiefs to fully dry off the accumulation in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis paused, looking at the seething face of her friend. \"Ah, apologies. I have failed to comply with your instructions to shut up. I will do so now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Yukari snapped, wiping the juices off her hand and dabbing at the 'accumulation' between her legs. \"And..thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. So...shall we?\" Aegis offered a hand. Yukari stared at it a moment, then closing her eyes and drawing in a breath, she slowly reached out and took it. With a gentle pull and a soft moan of protest, Yukari nervously took a hesitant step out from behind her wall of safety and revealed herself in all her naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis smiled, and took an unexpected step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! Hey! What are you-?\" Yukari yelped, finding herself caught in an unexpected hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have had a very long day. I thought you were perhaps in need of more than a handkerchief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr an orgasm, Aegis thought to herself with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gave a sour expression, which gradually gave way to a relieved look as she returned the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis smiled to herself, for once her mind free of distracting perversions. </span></div></div>",

Did you need to talk to me, Aegis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis sighed. Mentally pushing away any lingering feelings of affection or more lustful thoughts, she broke the embrace and took a step back, making a conscious effort to look her friend in the eye as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to apologize.\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blinked. \"Apologize? Look, if this is about the sensor stuff-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Aegis said firmly. \"I wish to apologize for causing you distress and endangering the life of our leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stared a moment, then took in a breath of her own. With a now unreadable mask on her face, she moved past the robot. \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was heavy as Yukari made her way to a bench in the student plaza. \"Sit.\" She said with a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis obeyed, studying her friend carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So...what happened scared me. I won't deny that. And when I'm scared, I tend to...well, you saw. I get angry. Its not the first time Minako has taken the brunt of it when I start to panic. So that's most of what you saw when I was shouting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet I can't condemn you for your fear or anger. I did point a weapon at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one pointed anything at anyone. You saw a shadow. You planned to kill it. Like we've always done. Minako was the one who jumped in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still an unacceptable risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aegis....\" Yukari sighed. \"Look. I don't mind talking about this with you some other time. As scared as I was, you were probably way more scared when she did that! She is the one you've been obsessing over this whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...is a complex matter. My focus on her was caused by numerous factors, many my cognizant functions had not fully recalled until earlier today. When we first met, my hardwired subroutines had her flagged as a subject of interest due to the entity I placed within her. The algorithms that simulate my feelings of guilt and shame added to the priority of that flag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilt and shame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was unable to stop that shadow. I completely altered the course of a little girl's life as a stop gap to cover my own failures. I believe what acts as my subconscious desired to stay close to her to monitor the monster sleeping within her, but also to atone in whatever capacity I could for what I had done to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...wait...is that the only reason? I thought you...you know...might like her. As a friend? Maybe more than that?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still in the process of evaluating my feelings in light of this new data. It is true. She is...important. Intensely important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Important enough not to attack your number one enemy if it meant hurting her.\" Yukari noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. I do not know when my first priority ceased to be the extermination of shadows...and that shadow most of all. But preserving her life eclipses all other functions. But as I said, what feelings I have for her are complex. Getting to know her as a person, getting to care about her, many of my feelings for her as an individual are still entangled with my feelings for her as a vessel I used to house a monster I could not defeat. They are difficult to separate. And the bits of data that approximate emotions I can say without hesitation are love for her directly are...also entangled in problematic subroutines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most genuine feelings of affection I hold for her are grounded in...those feelings I have for all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from my programmers, you are as close an approximation to....many units of relationship I can name. Friends. Family. Comrades in arms. You have overseen my growth as a person, instructed me on the ways of society, taught me more about the human mind and all the contradictions in holds. You are all...profoundly important. Minako remains important to me. Vital. But it is no longer accurate to say she alone is my highest priority. You have each, individually and collectively, shaped who I am. You have all become my highest priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oooooh. I get it. Your worried cause mom and dad had a fight, huh?\" Yukari said, a teasing note in her voice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am concerned about your relationship with one another. But while you have taught me a great deal as a parent might a child, I find that metaphor...unacceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I believe many of my feelings in regards to your naked bodies would be considered highly unacceptable and taboo if I am considered your infant in this relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Yukari blushed, then shook her head as if to banish a strange thought. \"Okay! We got off topic! My original point is...yes, I forgive you for pointing a weapon accidentally at our idiot leader when she jumped in front of you. But that's not why I'm angry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....please explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari took in a breath. \"Okay. So...so you just said that we're all your number one priority, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why you jumped in and tried to kill the shadow, right? Minako was in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I desired to make up for my past fail-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Do me a favor. Stop calling it your 'failure', okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, miss robot, the whole reason that big nasty shadow was running amuck that night was because of my dad. My dad, who even after all the crap I've learned about him and the Kirijo Group, I still think of as a hero. The guy who saved the world with his own life. Except that this shadow you fought to a stand still seems to be the most intelligent one of the ones we fought over the year. On some level, based on what Minako said, it knew its purpose and that it had to reunite, and it would have done that if it wasn't stopped. But it was stop. You did everything you could to kill it, and when you couldn't you found a way to stop it anyway. The only reason I can say my dad's a hero and not one more victim who died for no reason is because of you and your stupid 'failiure'! So you don't get to call it that, understand? No one gets to trashtalk to girl who made my best memory the truth. Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was jovial, but there was a sharp seriousness behind Yukari's smile and a deep mix of pain and happiness in her eyes. Before such a look Aegis could only nod in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I...keep getting off track. I needed to say all that, but also kinda...avoiding saying some other stuff. But...why I got so angry...\" Yukari took in another breath. \"Right. Your whole number one priority. So...for a long time, my dad was my number one priority. In a way, he still is...now more than ever. When he died, I was hurt, confused, alone...lost. When I came here, and started working with the Kirijo Group, I had a plan. Find the truth. Don't get killed, don't get conned. And do it all by myself. And that plan was going great. I was lonely, but I was determined! I didn't trust Mitsuru or Akihiko. I let myself get jealous easily. it helped keep my distance. And that's how it would have been...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until Minako-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until Minako-chan. Heh. The night I found out the truth (at least, the version the Chairman wanted me to know) I really let her have it. I said a lot of awful things about her, Mitsuru, myself. And she just let me scream until I couldn't scream anymore. And I realized. I couldn't run away. I had a Persona, I had my dad's legacy. And I had all of you idiots. And at the time, that felt like a prison sentence. I couldn't do it alone. I had to keep you guys close. Even knowing that I was pretty stubborn. It took me a long time to realize getting stuck with these losers was the best thing for me. I'm like you. They're all my number one priority. You are all my number one. Minako shoved her persistent little way into my heart and once the door was open all you came barging in behind her one after another. You totally fucked up the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I am glad we mean so much. But I still don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mad because NONE OF YOU GET IT! First I literally had to slap some sense back into Mitsuru. Then Minako trots off to confront some super shadow in her brain instead of telling us about this other timeline crap! Then you see a shadow and go charging off when we were standing right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you did not have any weapons, or the ability to call forth a persona, or even the slightest bit of protection or armor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a few health potions in my bag! Plus I have my shoes on! I could have kicked it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not seem like an effective-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have done SOMETHING. Anything. The odds were better with two of us fighting than one. Tell me I'm wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the difference is statistically insig-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me I'm wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. We're stronger together than going it alone. Obviously. And yet how is it that out of all of you, my valedictorian senpai, a super advanced AI, and the girl who seems to know more about my heart and mind than anyone else...how do I know this and all of you are clueless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....because you are precious to me, Yukari-san, I do not wish to risk seeing you hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd say that. I understand the sentiment. But I care about all of you too. So imagine how it would feel if me or Minako or any of your number one priorities went off and got into a dangerous situation and you couldn't do anything but watch! Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Didn't think so. I...I'm sorry. But you guys wormed your way in when I wanted you out. Now its too late. I...love you all. I...I'm not getting stuck on the sidelines again. I...I'm done crying over dead heroes, okay? I'm done being left behind, wondering if I could make a difference if I'd been there. We all fight together, win or lose. You don't get to leave me behind! Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, all Aegis could do was nod.</span></div></div>",

Yukari laughed softly and made a noble attempt at a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I kind of unloaded on you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did ask.\" Aegis noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess you did.\" Yukari sighed. \"You know the worst part. I'm honestly not even that angry at you for charging in. You just happen to be doing the same thing she's been doing all year. Jumping in. Taking charge of the situation. Listening to our problems, taking on our burdens along with Tartarus and Nyx and the end of the world. She can't...keep doing that to herself. She can't carry everybody's problems all the time. Its going to break her. But she keeps doing it, as if none of us are there to help her! And I just don't get it. After all this time, why can't she trust us like we all trust her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Sorry. I keep pulling us into the land of awkward silences.\" Yukari laughed softly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for apologies. I do not have advice to offer on the subject, I am afraid. These are words Minako needs to hear. I can only offer empathy.\" Aegis said, placing a hand on top of Yukari's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Yukari looked at the hand a moment. \"So maybe we should change the subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo...why don't we talk about these thoughts you've been having when you look at us naked. The ones that would qualify as incest if we were related?\" Yukari said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Yukari didn't know better, she would have sworn she heard Aegis give a small 'eep'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That subject...is no less awkward than the last!\" Aegis exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aegis...\" Yukari said, her smile growing. \"I'm sure that's true. For you! As for me, I've spent most of this little encounter either distressed or embarrassed. So now its my turn to enjoy watching you squirm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Aegis paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come oooooon! I mean...no offense, I'm just surprised you would..you know...be able to feel that way. Oggling humans doesn't exactly seem like useful programming.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. While his work is often derided in modern psychology, Dr. Freud was correct in noting that sexuality is a major part of the human mind, conscious and subconscious. My program was designed to emulate human thoughts for the sake of summoning a Persona. Useful or not, sexual desire is a part of my subroutines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this little epiphany of yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sexuality, for lack of a better term, has come into sharper focus. I have always had vague desires and emotions, and over the course of this year I have come to understand them better. My experience this morning has given me greater clarity, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of clarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...since I was activated, my program has been attempting to gather data on humans in order to construct and refine my artificial conscious. Your customs and manners have all been carefully recorded and archived. The human body has been...especially interesting, in part because I have had little chance to collect and test any data on the subject. It was...very refreshing to be able to study the different shapes and sizes of your bodies unimpeded by your clothing. Even before my...upgrades, I found each of you to be exceptionally pleasing in your own unique ways. Graceful, soft, oddly bouncing in places, and prone to odd physical changes in which pliable parts would grow strangely rigid and erect when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Aegis.\" Yukari muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Ahem. The desire to stare was overwhelming. The desire to touch, probe and test was nearly as strong. I..still have these urges. My data gathering is incomplete. But I also have a desire to touch certain areas simply for the reaction I know they will elicit. My need to stare and to explore has increased, but for reasons I think you are more familiar with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! But...umm...just to clarify here. Back when we first met, you were...a little obsessed with Minako, right? You were always breaking into her room and stuff, telling us you had to be near her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember. At the time, I did not understand the social implications behind the acts. I simply observed that it was causing tension in her and you, so I learned to suppress the urge and cease such behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were still obsessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My...high level of interest in her did not change, no. I simply grew more discreet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we're all your number one priority now, I'm guessing you must be as 'highly interested' in me as you were with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....if my attention is unwelcome I will adjust my behavior accordingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aegis could say another word Yukari had already leapt up, practically prancing to stand before the robot, arms behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Yukari said, blushing. \"Your still gathering data, right? You need more information on the human body! How can you expect to develop a healthy, complete human mind if you don't have any research data? So...so...hurry up and experiment! T-take a good look! Here's a perfect female specimen for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis practically gaped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine! More than look! Go ahead and t-touch wherever! Test me! Do whatever your computer brain likes! Do you need a better position? Do you want to check out my backside? Do whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis began to reach a tentative hand upward, meeting Yukari's eyes. With a sigh Yukari pushed her chest forward, settling her breast into the robot's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this better answer your question!\" Yukari whispered in embarrassment. \"I told you before, we're in this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAegis nodded. The next several minutes saw were on the intense collection of new data on the human body, punctuated by a series of moans, gasps, and exclamations from the test subject.</span></div></div>",

Covering herself self-consciously, the brown haired girl looked around nervously.

Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...but what if we get caught?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san, I'm not trying to be mean, but...this was your idea. The risk for me if somebody catches us is the same as it was before. I just...want you to take the same chance, okay? It'll be fine. You chose this location well, right? Just have faith in your instincts!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....ok. Okay, Minako-san. A-as soon as I'm finished, I'll...let you have the camera and get undressed...\" Fuuka said at last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna wait. And its gonna take too long if we're constantly putting our clothes back on and off every time one of us wants the camera. We'll just both be naked the whole time. Its easier, and it'll help me relax. Just take it off now, and we'll keep both sets of clothes in your bag, safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka blushed profusely. She was hoping to delay the experience of being naked in front of Minako as long as possible. But what she had said made logical sense, and it sounded fair. Blushing, Fuuka put the camera down, unbuttoned the front of her blue dress, and slowly let it fall to the ground. She had half a mind to complain when she saw Minako watching her removing her underwear, but thought better of it. The two of them would be seeing a lot more of each other before the day was over, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" she said, now completely naked, camera in hand and clothes stored in the bag. \"Usually its the photographer that gets to tell the model what she wants them to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Minako said, giving the blushing girl a little kiss on her cheek (which inspired a light full bodied flush to her skin). \"Sorry for being bossy, Fuuka-chan. And thanks for being so understanding. I'll be good from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean until its time for me to do this?\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Till then. So do your worst, Fuuka-chan! Cause I'm not holding back when that camera's mine!\" Minako exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

If she\u2019s careful enough, maybe even some private parts could show. Bad fuuka she quickly thought. She was straight, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo fuuka, where do you want me to pose? <br>\r\n\u201c Oh, uh, anywhere you want.

She now stood fully straight, arms free to her sides, instead of hunched and covering like she had been.  Even so, the red tinge in her cheeks reminded Fuuka how much she was asking of Minako.  It was time to make the most of it, while they still could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started, for real this time,\" Fuuka said, readying her camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want me?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" Fuuka said, looking at what they had to offer.  \"I think... the jungle gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako looked where Fuuka indicated.  A large cube of bars, more than twice her height.  More suitable for children, of course, but the bars were far enough apart that there was plenty of space, provided she watched her head.  However, the bars themselves were fairly thin... strategic positioning would be required.  Maybe she shouldn't have told Fuuka to go all out from the start.  \"Okay,\" she said, climbing into the structure.  \"So, should I be hanging? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climb to the second level, on this side, please,\" Fuuka instructed, making her way to the slide on the structure, and climbing up the first few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" Minako asked, turning to face Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" Fuuka said, pointing the camera at Minako.  \"Move a little to the left so that you're in the center of the square, and then spread your arms further out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako complied.  Though she felt uneasy under the camera's gaze, the sight of Fuuka naked as she was helped ease the tension.  The promise that she would have her own fun later surely helped as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lean back a little... A bit more so that the bar's in place... perfect!\" Fuuka instructed.  She couldn't believe what she was doing, but she also couldn't deny the results.  This may just work out after all!  The pose was good... there was only one thing left.  \"Now, try and put on your best prisoner face, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Prisoner' face?  What do you mean?\" Minako asked, confused yet curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The face of a condemned criminal in jail.\"  Fuuka clarified.  \"That is... um... pretend you're on Death Row, but you didn't commit the crime you were accused of.  And to make matters worse, your execution is coming up!  You could be angry, desperate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako suddenly gasped, her eyes going wide and face turning pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fear!

Minako, however, was slower to react, as she actually knew the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was Maiko, a kind and cheerful elementary-schooler who usually frequented the playground in the afternoons.  Normally, she was home with her parents at this time of day, so she was the last person Minako expected to see.  And judging from the look on Maiko's face, seeing Minako and Fuuka in nothing but their birthday suits wasn't what she was expecting either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Minako-san?\" Maiko asked, awkwardly looking away.  \"Why are you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her!?\" Fuuka squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Minako replied, quickly shuffling behind a pole and descending to ground level.  \"It's um... kinda hard to explain, Maiko-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Fuuka stuttered.  \"It's... something far too complicated for kids to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mean!\" Maiko said, insulted, turning towards Fuuka.  \"And it's not complicated!  You were taking pictures of Minako-san while she was naked, and you were also naked, which means...\" she turned back to Minako.  \"Minako-san, you never told me you had a girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?  No!  It's not like that!\" Minako stammered, her face red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka was at a loss for words, curling up into a ball in her hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah?  You're not?\" Maiko blinked.  \"Then why are you both naked?\" she thought.  \"Ah!  Are you being blackmailed?  Should I call the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" both girls shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you've been sworn to secrecy?\" Maiko gasped.  \"Don't worry, I'll go get help, just wait right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Maiko-chan, wait!\" said Minako, her words stopping Maiko before she could bolt down the path out of the playground.  \"We're not in trouble!  See, the reason we're naked is because it's an art project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  An art project?\" Maiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Minako continued.  \"Sometimes, people find artistic inspiration in other people.  And sometimes only when they are naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Maiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gulped.  She hoped she explained it clearly.  It was tough enough understanding art when Fuuka explained it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that makes sense...\" said Maiko.  \"But why are you both naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  That.\" Minako's face turned red again.  \"It's just, even though I agreed to help, I was nervous at being the only one naked, and so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... okay,\" Maiko nodded.  \"At lease you aren't in trouble.  I guess I better leave you two alone then.  Bye!\" she waved, walking back the way she came down the path to the park exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Maiko-chan!\" Minako said as she waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Maiko had left, Fuuka crept out from her hiding spot.  \"I... I... oh...\" she said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Fuuka-chan,\" said Minako.  \"She usually doesn't show up this late, so I thought it would be clear all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry,\" said Fuuka.  \"I should have known someone could show up when we least expected it.  I'm just glad she didn't call the cops on us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a good kid,\" Minako smiled.  \"Hey, how about we continue the photo shoot where we left off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- no,\" Fuuka said quickly, blushing.  \"Let's just get our clothes back, get dressed, and call it a day.  One scare like that is plenty enough for me.  Let's go get my bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they were about to do so, a sudden voice distracted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako-saaaaaan!\" Maiko cried out, quickly running towards them from the bottom of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!\" Fuuka screamed, dashing back into hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maiko-chan!?\" Minako yelped, quickly covering herself as she was unable to hide fast enough.  \"What is it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath, Maiko looked up at Minako and said-</span></div></div>",

It was just a quick monorail ride off the island and a few blocks back to the dorm, perhaps with a short stop on the way back for a snack or a short detour to the Naganaki Shrine. Minako wasn't sure why, but she felt as if the fortunes at the shrine actually improved some of her friendships, as odd as that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping on to the monorail, Minako casually leaned against one of the poles for standing passengers, relaxing against it as she waited for departure. Opting to relax a bit further, Minako quietly slipped on her headphones and fired up her MP3 player letting the music take her away. Had she not done this, however, she'd have heard the announcement over the monorail PA system warning passengers of technical issues with the passenger car doors, urging everyone to make sure they were well clear of them before they closed.

As she took in her surroundings further, she recognized the thumping beat and low lights as the signature atmosphere of Escapade, the local nightclub. This was not at all where Minako had hoped the vent deposited her. Aside from the fact that the club was busy at this hour, there was the fact that Minako wasn't necessarily old enough to be there. Sure, the club employees usually looked the other way on nights when she went to visit Mutatsu, but the old monk wasn't usually here this day of the week. Beyond that, Minako knew that some Gekkoukan students would sneak into the club using fake IDs, and the last people Minako needed seeing her like this were her schoolmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, making sure not to snag any other pieces of her dwindling wardrobe on anything while exiting the vent, Minako crawled out of the vent and onto the club floor proper. As soon as she was on her feet, Minako held her hands tightly in front of her bare crotch, scooting along the wall to keep her rear end hidden. If she could at least get to a table or a booth, she could keep the fact that she was half-naked a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, luck seemed to be on Minako's side as the vent had deposited her near an empty booth! Giving a silent prayer of thanks to whatever spirit was looking over her, Minako quickly scrambled into the booth, taking a seat against the wall, as far from the floor as she could get. The feeling of the seat cushions against her bare flesh was interesting to say the least, and made it impossible to forget just how much of her was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting against the table, trying to calm herself down, Minako tried to think of a way out of this. She couldn't just run through the club like this, not with so many people around. There wasn't anything nearby that Minako could use to cover herself with, unfortunately. Really, it seemed as if Minako would have to wait for the crowd to thin out, or... that's it! The Dark Hour would turn everyone present into coffins, and then Minako could walk right out unseen! It was a flawless plan. With this in mind, Minako scanned the walls for a clock to see how far off the Dark Hour was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10:30...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako had an hour and a half before the Dark Hour could save her.

When Minako turned to face Ken, that was all the force needed to undo the knot behind her neck, the two thin strands of fabric sliding off her neck and pulling the upper half of her apron down with them. Desperate to explain herself, Minako failed to notice her sudden exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I've been trying to explain, but people keep interrupting me!\" Minako said, happy to see that Ken at least seemed to be giving her undivided attention. \"I know it sounds crazy, but I went to take a nap on a bench, and woke up without my skirt! I tried to find a place to hide, and kinda... lost my panties and wound up in here. It's... complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako paused, hoping Ken would say something. Anything. A word of understanding, or comfort, or even doubt. Instead, the young boy continued to stare at her intently, slackjawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Ken-kun?\" Minako asked, suddenly worried about her friend's odd behavior. \"Are you okay? You're being awfully quiet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Minako realized that Ken's stare wasn't quite matching up with her face. In fact, it was aimed a bit lower. Following Ken's gaze, Minako shrieked as she discovered her fallen apron, displaying her bare chest directly to Ken's face! No wonder he hadn't said anything, the poor kid was mesmerized!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEK! K-Ken, stop looking!\" Minako screamed, clapping her arms over her chest. She couldn't believe she'd just flashed Ken, of all people! Sure, he wasn't as perverted as, say, Junpei, but he was just a kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his view of Minako's magnificent chest obstructed, Ken was slightly roused from his stupor. Still, the noises that came from his mouth didn't exactly qualify as words, but rather strangled attempts at speaking. Minako could tell she wasn't going to make any progress like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako did the first thing that came to mind: hide so she could try to fix this little problem.

The unbuttoned jacket rested loosely against the front of Minako's chest, not doing much in the way of concealing anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd amidst her intensified plight, Ken was still softly gripping her hands and waiting patiently for a response that Minako had no capability of forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, Ken... this isn't a...\" She gulped again. \"...good time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the boy in question, Ken remained blissfully ignorant at the worst of times, staring over the presence of the jacket at Minako's eyes as if it weren't even there. It might as well not have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Minako... I, I really have to know...\" Ken gripped Minako's hands tighter and tugged on her arms lightly. \"...plea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako and Ken's eyes widened simultaneously, then. As Minako's arms came up... the shoulders of the jacket were drawn out... and Minako's breasts rose into plain sight, completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I... I uh... oh, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gulped again, feeling her breasts rise heavily, their hardening peaks practically inches from Ken's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, KEN! L, let go of my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen reacted in a panic and did as asked, letting go of Minako's hands, covering for Minako in the only way he knew how...</span></div></div>",

The school day came and went just like any other, and the afternoon flew by as well in the same humdrum manner.  So humdrum, in fact, that Minako decided that it would be a good day to go to Tartarus after all.  Aside from some whining from Yukari and Junpei, there weren't any real protests from the rest of the group.  Minako couldn't really blame either of them, though, since the previous night's venture did go on a bit longer than she had hoped.  With the increased number of battles as a result, the entire rest of the battle party other than her, that is, Yukari, Junpei, and Akihiko, all became exhausted and got sick, but they had made it to another terminal thanks to that, reaching an important milestone on their journey up the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Minako sympathized with them, and probably wouldn't have minded letting them stay behind, their job was important.  Even Yukari and Junpei knew that, and the full moon was coming in just over a week.  And besides, Akihiko, despite being sick, seemed even more eager to climb the tower.  If he could pull it together, then the others should too... or was Akihiko just being reckless and delirious as a result of his cold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, either way, she was going to leave those three on standby unless she really needed their specific skills.  She wasn't heartless, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the decision made and the clock counting down, she went back to her room and set out to begin her special, secret ritual.  While she went to great lengths to keep it a secret from the others, it wasn't really all that complicated.  Despite calling it a ritual, it wasn't something so secretive and occult as conducting blood sacrifices, performing a magic chant or dance, or any of the strange things in fiction one might think of when hearing the word \"ritual\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Truly, there was nothing like the feeling of a nice hot shower before the start of the day.  It worked so well for Minako in the mornings that she just had to try in out at night as well, and she had found the results to be incredible.  After a nighttime shower, the stress and exhaustion from earlier in the day just seemed so far away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was only a couple times each week, but now it was an irreplaceable part of Minako's routine; so much so that if she didn't get her shower, things just wouldn't feel right for her.  Already anticipating the flow of the warm water along her body, she had changed down to nothing but a towel in her room and left, walking towards the bathroom door.  Not that she'd ever walk around in front of her friends dressed in so little, but she wasn't worried of anyone seeing her.  Before a mission, everyone else was always pre-occupied with getting their gear together, leaving her free to move about without being disturbed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, obviously, she was more than a little surprised when she opened the bathroom door and was greeted with the sight of an entirely naked Yukari drying herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Minako squeaked, failing to suppress her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Yukari gasped, turning around, inadvertently changing Minako's view of her from full-rear to full-frontal.  \"Minako!\" she shrieked.  \"You-? AH~ ACHOO!\" she sneezed hard, causing her to drop her towel entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Minako yelped, exiting the room and closing the door.  She turned back to the hallway.  Thankfully, no one was there, meaning they weren't heard, causing Minako to sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, revealing Yukari again, now decently covered in her towel.  \"Sorry for freaking out like that, I could've sworn I locked it,\" she said, her voice sounding somewhat off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's my fault,\" said Minako.  \"I didn't think anyone was using the shower right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't normally, especially this late, but I thought it would help with this damn cold... It's not working,\" Yukari groaned.  \"This is the third one I've taken today but I still feel so chilly and my nose is all stuffed up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... That's terrible,\" Minako said in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're having one too this close to the Dark Hour also?  Did you catch a cold too?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this, well...\" Minako said hesitantly, considering to lie but knew better to do so.  \"I actually do this every night before we go to Tartarus.  I feel... that it helps me get in the zone for our missions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, really?\"  Yukari blinked.  \"No kidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako simply nodded bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Maybe that's why you didn't get sick but the rest of us did?\" Yukari asked only somewhat-jokingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe... ha ha\" Minako shrugged, sharing a laugh with Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari then suddenly grabbed the other girl's hands. \"Hey, Minako-chan, can't you change your mind?\" she asked seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, Yukari-chan,\" Minako answered.  \"But we've already agreed to do this.  Everyone's getting ready, I can't change it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  Please!  You're our leader!\" Yukari begged.  \"A leader's gotta look out for her friends, right?  I'm literally dying over here, and Stupei apparently has it twice as bad as I do if his whining actually means anything!  You can't make us go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Akihiko-san's perfectly fine,\" Minako replied.  \"And so is the rest of the team.  So if he can do it you and Junpei can too.  I believe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!  THAT MEATHEAD!\" Yukari grumbled.  \"I'm going to give *achoo* him a piece of my mind!\" she stamped off to her room in a hurry, slamming her door in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... She didn't even realize her towel fell off halfway through the hall,\" Minako muttered, looking at the damp, pink cloth that lay abandoned in Yukari's wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really needed that shower now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to lock the door, Minako got in the shower and instantly felt at peace.  Her worries about her sick teammates flowed off of her like the water dripping down her body, unease being destroyed with each scrub of the loofa.  Everything would be fine.  Her sick friends would be on the sidelines, taking it easy while she, Mitsuru, Ken, and Koromaru would do the heavy lifting today.  And best of all, they'd finish up that block tonight and then everyone could get some well-deserved relaxation time.  It wasn't easy, but it needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling completely refreshed once again, Minako turned off the water, ready to take trouble head-on.  However, she quickly found that trouble was getting a sneak attack on her, as-</span></div></div>",

Looking at the floor, Minako didn't see the towel she expected... in fact, there was no sign of her towel anywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Minako gasped. \"Where did my towel go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould somebody have taken it while she was showering? Lost as she was in the luxurious feeling of the shower, it was possible, she supposed. Still, what could anybody seek to gain from doing something like this? Right before a mission to Tartarus really wasn't the time for a juvenile prank. Reluctantly, Minako tip-toed out of the shower and across the bathroom floor to the door. Unlocking the door, Minako peeked her head out carefully, making sure not to open the door any further than absolutely necessary. Hopefully somebody would be nearby and able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? I have a bit of a problem over here...\" Minako called out, her voice torn between wanting to avoid drawing attention to herself, but also hoping to get somebody's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Minako-chan!\" came Yukari's cheerful voice, followed quickly by the speaker in question popping into view around the door. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... did you see anybody sneak into the bathroom after me?\" Minako asked, though she had a sneaking suspicion she knew what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneak in?\" Yukari repeated, sniffling. \"I mean, what reason would anyone have to do that? Unless they wanted to steal your towel and hold you hostage or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari...\" Minako growled. \"This isn't funny!

Let me get some actual sleep any maybe get over this cold!\" Yukari snapped. \"We can't all be perfectly healthy all the time like some people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Yukari's request really so outrageous? There were plenty of other days the team could climb the tower, and still a few weeks before the next full moon. Still, if Minako let herself be blackmailed like this, it could set a nasty precedent. This was an important decision for the SEES leader and she knew it. She had to make her decision carefully...</span></div></div>",

Possible blackmailing and corruption of intent aside, if Yukari convinced her to take the night off, then they would have to climb Tartarus some other time, but if complications arose and made this all take longer and, god forbid, she herself got sick later, it would throw her other plans all out of balance!  Managing Social Links, classes, and Tartarus all at once was not easy.  Yukari only needed to worry about one of those, while Minako had to manage all three at one time!  Really, persevering for one extra night wasn't that much to ask of anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari,\" Minako said, with an edge to her voice.  \"I understand you're not feeling well, but you have abilities none of the rest of the team has.  We need you there.  I can let you rest on the sidelines until we absolutely need you.  It's the same as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same!?  Bullshit!\" Yukari screamed.  \"Even thinking of comparing my soft, warm bed to that freaky, horrible tower... there's something seriously wrong with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going, Yukari, and that's final,\" Minako said with utmost seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" Yukari said, \"If we're going, I'll just bring everyone up here for a nice little chat with our leader, who's naturally already prepared and not shivering, helpless and naked in the bathroom, all thanks to having lost her towel.  Oh wait, that's exactly what's happening right now.  I wonder what Mitsuru-senpai would think, seeing our Leader like this?\" she asked, smirking venomously and turning towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't say that she'd be very pleased with you,\" Minako answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari paused.  \"Me?  Uh, you're the one who's, well, <i>out of uniform</i> right now, in case you forgot,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Minako replied.  \"But once I tell her everything and she learns that you stole my towel and trapped me here all because you couldn't handle being on standby for an hour at most, how do you think Mitsuru would react to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghh!\" Yukari grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm naked right now, and yeah, it'll be embarrassing getting seen like this by everybody, e-especially by the guys,\" Minako stammered a little, blushing.  \"But Mitsuru's not an idiot, Yukari.  No matter what lie you tell at first, it won't take long before she realizes what really happened.  So just stop this nonsense now, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari stood still, her fists balled up at her sides.  Soon, she started to shake, and began to growl, \"Erg... grr...  ARGH!\"  Whirling around, she charged to the door and threw it open, almost smashing into Minako in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Minako gasped, too startled to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can't get you to call it off, I'll have you sleep it off!\" Yukari roared, grabbing Minako's shoulders and pushing her back towards the showers.  \"Minako?  Oh, she had a little spill during her usual shower and won't wake up for the rest of the Dark Hour, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako struggled and planted her feet, stopping Yukari's advance right in front of the stall.  \"Yukari, you're crazy!\" she grunted, grabbing at Yukari's sweater collar and turning the situation into a test of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sick!\"  Yukari yelled.  \"I need some TLC time to get better, and you're just being, oof, stubborn.  Just let it happen, it'll only be a minor concussion, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off!\" Minako shouted back.  Minako couldn't believe what was happening.  Fighting against her close comrade was something she never thought she'd be doing, let alone being wet and naked while doing it!  But now wasn't the time for thoughts, it was the time for action, and she began to focus solely on the battle.  First things first, she needed to get out of the bathroom.  She was wet, and the floor was also wet, meaning she could slip and fall at any moment.  And with Yukari in a blind rage right now, it was not an ideal battleground.  The hallway outside, however, had dry carpet and was more spacious, which would make a much better fighting arena.  It would all hinge on who won this first struggle...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukari had the advantage of surprise, clothes, and the slippery environment. She had made three serious miscalculations, however. First, her desperation to avoid Tartarus tonight was high, but so was Minako's desire to preserve her dignity and consciousness! Second, her illness naturally hampered her stamina and physical abilities, making Yukari physically weaker and less effective in her struggles. And perhaps her biggest mistake was underestimating how powerful Minako was. Although she seemed frail and naked, Minako's physical abilities were naturally enhanced by whatever Persona she chose to mask herself in. And with the full moon so close, it just so happened that Minako had spent a good portion of the previous evening fusing a potent combination of new Personas, maximizing social links and multiple fusions to obtain the most powerful entities at the highest levels she could. Her current Persona was the strongest of the lot. A little water and nudity weren't going to be enough to win this contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, despite a brief moment when it appeared Yukari might gain enough leverage to force Minako backwards, the naked girl managed maintain her footing and dragged them both out of the bathroom while grappling with Yukari's sweater and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Yukari-chan? That towel sounds nice...but I think I'd rather just wear your clothes instead! And if you don't make a fuss, I might even let you have the towel for yourself afterwards!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! Like hell!\" Yukari roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggle quickly escalated into a wrestling match, Yukari's hands soon becoming entangled in her sweater and bra while her legs were fighting madly to keep her skirt and panties from being stripped entirely off her. Angry and desperate, both girls proceeded to grasp, pin, and rub their bodies together in a manner that both would have found utterly humiliating if they took a moment to consider what their battle would look like from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it up!\" Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first! Stop it before it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! RIP! RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls paused in horror at the sound of multiple garments tearing themselves apart as Yukari's clothes and undergarments finally gave up and shredded themselves between the two wet and naked girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Both girls said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh from the horror of losing their chance for modesty, both girls slowly turned at the sound of the voice. Mitsuru Kirijo stood behind them, hands on her hips, eyes glaring down like the goddess of death itself. With a frantic shriek, both girls untangled themselves, glanced at the own nudity, frantically sought and found Yukari's pink towel, briefly dove and fought for the article before finding a small truce between them and dangling the cloth between the pair of them. It barely covered their frontal nudity and provided no defense for their exposed butts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Mitsuru's boots stomping up and down the main lobby of the SEES dorms was the only noise any of the residents could hear. The elder member of the shadow execution squad paced back and forth, her hands clasped behind her back and a stony expression of restrained fury and concentration on her face. Not far away, Yukari and Minako stood side by side, each clad in a skimpy towel (the only concession Mitsuru allowed for their dignity was that each be allowed to hide her nudity behind an individual towel rather than explain themselves while sharing one...and then only because Junpei and less obviously Akihiko kept trying to catch a glimpse of their bare backs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsuru-senp-\" Yukari began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QUIET!\" Mitsuru snapped, causing both girls to gulp and look at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing in a breath, Mitsuru said at last. \"This is beyond unacceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako dared to raise her head. \"Mitsuru-senpai, I agree completely, but if we could just get dressed before we talk about Yukari's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite the interesting assumption you are making, Minako-chan.\" Mitsuru interrupted. \"That all we have to discuss would be Yukari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well...why wouldn't it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A team member comes to let you know that they are in need of rest and rehabilitation, and you refuse their request multiple times, to the point that they are driven to blackmail and physical threats? You don't find that troubling?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Minako trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a leader, it was your responsibility to measure how hard you are pushing your team. A sick party member can easily fall prey to shadows. You know this better than anyone, yet you were willing to risk your subordinate's welfare for the sake of keeping to a schedule! Moreover, your response to Yukari's threats was to provoke her rather than call for help or otherwise gain my or Akihiko's attention to resolve the situation peacefully. Have I missed anything, team leader?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...she...but...\" Minako mumbled, before shying away from Mitsuru's glare. \"No, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari snickered, then gulped when Mitsuru turned toward her. \"I wouldn't laugh just yet, Yukari-chan. If Minako shares more of the blame than she wants to admit, it should be obvious that your behavior was unacceptable as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari looked down, then bit her lip. \"Well, if she had just listened-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what? You wouldn't have threatened to humiliate and attack your squad leader? As if either those options are remotely acceptable!\" Mitsuru snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I supposed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At a glance? Speaking to either myself or Akihiko to intervene on your behalf would have been the most effective solution. Certainly a better option than threatening to humiliate your classmate and comrade in arms like a schoolyard bully! And attacking her? The only reason I don't suspend you from this team and this school altogether for such actions is that I believe your judgment to be impaired by this illness you are suffering under!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls hung their heads in sullen anger and embarrassment. Mitsuru glanced from one to the other, sighing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what I find most troubling...most frightening...is that we have come this far and are still prone to such divisions. A squad leader should not have to fear being undercut so severely by her subordinates. A subordinate should not have to go to such lengths convince a leader of her weakness and need for rest! If something as simple as the date of our mission can divide us this much, what will happen on the night of the full moon? If you can't work together, someone will end up dead!\" Mitsuru said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly naked girls hung their heads, looking properly chastened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you apologize to one another?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair glanced at each other, sucked in a breath, and spat out. \"No! She should apologize to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru closed her eyes as the girls glared at each other. \"Very well. For the time being, I'm taking charge of Tartarus operations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still going?!?\" Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Your actions have completely overridden any regard you might be owed for your physical condition. Consider this an Execution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls gulped. Then Yukari smiled. \"Oh? So you want us to go in there without our Evokers? Isn't that reckless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mitsuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing. Its just that I MAY have hidden mine and Minako's along with her clothes, and you probably won't find were they are until after the Dark Hour is over! It was my 'plan b'.\" Yukari smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru glared a moment, then began smiling back in a way that terrified both girls. Her words justified their fears completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't say I didn't try.\" Mitsuru nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...not to spoil this moment, Mitsuru...but will that actually work? Aren't the Evokers supposed to remind of us death in order to call up our Personas?\" Akihiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. The Evoker serves as both a mystical bridge between the material and the mental realms and a tool to call forth our own fears and anxieties to break through other mental blockades to reach our true selves. The fear of death is one of our most common and deep seated emotions, and thus a useful catalyst for calling out the Persona. But we have other fears. The Kirijo Group has long speculated that it is possible to summon a Persona by exploiting other common fears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" Akihiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Public humiliation.\" Mitsuru responded. \"For example, being made to wear a collar and act like a domesticated pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harsh.\" Junpei whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did call it an Execution. It would hardly qualify if I held back.\" Mitsuru stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Put it that way, it starts sounding kinda tame. I mean, after what we went through over the hot spring....\" Junpei trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be. If either were allowed to have anything but the collar on.\" Mitsuru said evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT??\" Both girls asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you were willing to strip the other for your own purposes. Consider this your just reward. Besides which, the shame of acting like an animal alone might not be enough to summon a Persona. This is a simple insurance policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can. Now, are you certain neither of you want to make that apology?\"</span></div></div>",

As much as she knew that she had to go, she'd have loved to just stay home and avoid the crowds. Chihiro had never been a very social person, and being forced to interact with others was almost always an awkward experience. Rather than spend the day buried in her books, however, Chihiro was resolved to face the day. After all, there was a Student Council meeting today, and Chihiro would have to be there as Treasurer. As much as she didn't like being saddled with the responsibility of Treasurer, not being that great with numbers, Chihiro had learned to accept it. She was usually all but invisible during the meetings, and she even had a bit of a friend in that new girl, Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Chihiro would still have to make it through the rest of the school day. Between being called on to answer questions in class, trying to hold it together when boys tried to make conversation with her, and making sure she had everything ready for the meeting, it was going to be as troublesome of a day as any. But that was Chihiro's lot in life and she was resolved to face it head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to school was the usual affair; Chihiro would do her best to be essentially invisible, hiding her face behind her long brown hair when she worried that somebody might be looking at her. Chihiro had discovered that hiding herself seemed to deter the perverts that usually lurked on the monorail line, and she very rarely had to deal with anybody \"accidentally\" bumping into her and copping a feel. In school, however, hiding like that wouldn't work. She couldn't just hide her face and pretend to be invisible, as she was expected to carry herself well as a member of the Student Council. All she wanted was for the day to go by without incident. Unfortunately for the shy bookworm, fate had a different plan in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis poor twist of fate began-</span></div></div>",

She saw it as her own personal haven in the middle of Gekkoukan, a place where she could lose herself in the countless books it offered. Every school day would find Chihiro spending her entire lunch break in the library, her nose buried in one book or another. Most other students spent the hour in their classrooms or one of the more noise-friendly hangouts, though a few opted to study in the library. Of course the students that chose the last option were so few that Chihiro had no trouble finding an empty spot in the library to enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the book she had just finished, a fun if generic fantasy story, Chihiro stood up and thought of what to start reading next. Perhaps science-fiction, or a historical fiction, Chihiro thought as she quietly walked through the fiction section. For a few minutes Chihiro perused the books with little success. \"<i>Read it. Read it. Read it. Not my type... hmm.</i>\" Chihiro thought to herself. Finally, out of the corner of her eye, Chihiro saw a title that caught her eye. The book was too high for Chihiro to reach on her own, meaning she'd have to go grab the stepladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Chihiro was standing on top of a short stepladder, desperately reaching for the book she had seen. Even with the added height it was just barely out of Chihiro's reach. This wasn't going to deter the book lover, however, as Chihiro carefully raised herself up further, supporting herself only with her toes now, and just barely managed to get her fingers around the spine of the book. Finally! Chihiro managed to grab the book, now she could get back to reading! At least, that's what Chihiro would have liked to happen. Instead, as Chihiro silently rejoiced from her precarious position on the stepladder-</span></div></div>",

Turning in shock to try and see who was responsible, though this only succeeded in knocking her off her balance thanks to her panties now being around her ankles. Before Chihiro could tumble off the stepladder, however, she was steadied by a hand on her stomach that pushed her lightly against the bookshelf now behind her. While Chihiro would have normally been grateful, the sight of who had steadied her filled her with anything but good feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyuki Satou, Chihiro's classmate and notorious bully, was looking up at Chihiro with a mischievous look in her eyes. It was her hand that had stabilized Chihiro when she was in danger of falling, but it was her other hand that held her panties, still bunched around Chihiro's ankles. Breaking eye contact with Chihiro, Miyuki looked down at the article of clothing clutched between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute choice of panties, Fushimi.\" Miyuki complimented in a tone of voice that would normally be considered friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... you... l-let go of those!\" Chihiro squeaked, too embarrassed and uneasy to muster much else in the way of a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyuki simply smirked and put a finger to her mouth. \"Shhh. You've gotta be quiet in the library, remember? Besides, why should I let go of them? They're so cute, I just might take them and run them up a flagpole for the whole school to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! D-don't do that!\" Chihiro whispered. Even though Miyuki would still have to get the panties past Chihiro's feet, both of them knew this would be a trivial task. Miyuki was far stronger than Chihiro and wouldn't have any trouble forcing the issue; Chihiro could only hope to negotiate with her tormentor. \"Please don't do that, that's too embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sort of the point.\" Miyuki said, though she quickly tilted her head in thought. \"Though... maybe I could be convinced to change my mind. Tell you what, Fushimi: I have some ideas for things you could do in exchange for me not sharing your undies with the entire school. Sound like a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of things?\" Chihiro asked, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah.\" Miyuki tutted. \"Agree first, find out after. Now, do we have a deal, or do I have to make a run to the flagpole?\"</span></div></div>",

There was no way she'd risk Miyuki following through on her promise; having her panties put on display to the entire school was too dreadful to consider. As much as Chihiro hated to admit it, she was at the mercy of Miyuki's whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, deal.\" Chihiro whispered. \"Wh-what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, go ahead and step out of these.\" Miyuki said, pulling at Chihiro's ankles to lift her feet and pull her panties free. Once the garment was freed of Chihiro's legs, Miyuki folded the panties up and stored them in her handbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but I agreed! You said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said I wouldn't run these up the flagpole.\" Miyuki said, cutting off Chihiro's protest. \"I never said I'd give them back. Besides, these are my insurance; you don't keep your word, our deal is off and your panties go public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down in embarrassment, Chihiro stepped down from the stepladder. Unable to look her tormentor in the eye, Chihiro settled with fiddling with her hands and trying to ignore the drafty feeling under her skirt. Chihiro had never gone pantiless before, especially not in her school uniform! Knowing that a strong enough breeze or a perverted hand could reveal her most private areas had Chihiro's heart racing. Trying to put such scary thoughts out of her mind, Chihiro focused on Miyuki's words. Pacing back and forth before her, Chihiro's tormentor laid out her instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's the deal, Fushimi. It's simple, really. After school ends, you're going to meet me at Paulownia Mall. I've got some ideas for some fun things we can do there. Now, until then, be careful, okay? I wouldn't want you to accidentally flash anybody, what with you being commando and all.\" Miyuki explained, a dark smile on her face the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply nodding her head, unable to muster a verbal response, Chihiro was blissfully left alone. This reprieve was not long, however, as the lunch hour was soon ending. Chihiro would have to go through the remainder of her school day like this, and then it would be off to the mall for whatever Miyuki had planned for her.

The swish of her skirt against her newly bare flesh as she walked felt both very smooth and soft as well as embarrassing. Furthermore, Chihiro was far more aware of the flow of air as she walked, as well as just how chilly the school's air conditioning could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's okay, Chihiro.</i> the nervous girl thought to herself. <i>Nobody knows but you and that horrible bully. Just try to ignore it for now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Chihiro failed to notice, however, was the somewhat worn reading desk she passed on her way out of the library. The edge of the desktop, worn and damaged by years of student use and abuse, had places where the wood had become jagged and sharp. Chihiro just happened to pass this desk a bit too closely, her hip brushing against its edge as she passed, several threads of her skirt catching on the jagged splinters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of this new issue, Chihiro continued on her way out of the library, studiously avoiding eye contact with anybody she happened to pass. Of course, this behavior was normal for Chihiro, and nobody paid her any mind as she scurried out into the hallway. Equally unnoticed were the strands of thread trailing behind her, her skirt shrinking bit by bit as she walked further away. At first, Chihiro's skirt seemed completely normal, but the gradual deconstruction of the piece of clothing slowly became apparent. As Chihiro climbed the stairs to return to her classroom, her skirt had shortened by a few inches, exposing more of her legs than she had ever shown off at school. Suddenly, the normally-invisibly Chihiro was drawing a few looks, though she did her best to ignore them, just as she always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Chihiro had made it back to the classroom and taken her seat, her skirt had-</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as relieving as being in the library, but it was easily the next best thing. Her hands settled across her desk in a neatly folded posture as her feet settled against the floor. Then she she felt an oddly... cool sensation brushing against the skin of her thighs, just above the knee. It was the wooden sensation of her own chair, touching her own exposed legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on ear-...\" Chihiro slowly craned her head down, and she felt her face draining of color. Her skirt was halfway gone. A long trail of unwoven cloth was leading away, and in its wake, her garment had unraveled to well above her knees. It was not nearly as indecent as that Takeba girl's ridiculous outfit, but for Chihiro, it was downright obscene!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steadied her nerves with a deep breath, reached down, and tore the string off with a sharp pull. That would be the end of THAT.  She then kept her legs firmly together. Okay... so she'd have to be a little more cautious, that was all. Several girls wore mini-skirts, maybe people would assume Chihiro was following a trend.

Making her way to the front of the room, Chihiro could practically feel the classroom's eyes on her. Granted, they were watching her because she was called on by the teacher, but she couldn't help but feel it was because of her scandalously short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro gazed up at the blackboard, frowning as she saw the problem the teacher had tasked her with completing. Aside from the fact that Chihiro wasn't that great at math, despite what her position as Student Council Treasurer would lead people to believe, but the teacher had put the question on the upper half of the board. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but with her skirt so short, reaching up to work on the problem would lift the hem of Chihiro's skirt even higher. While she wouldn't be showing anything important, the idea of exposing even more of her legs was just terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't just refuse to do the problem. Rather than argue it, Chihiro carefully reached up to start working on the problem. Thankfully the equation wasn't terribly complicated, and Chihiro didn't have too much trouble figuring it out. Still, she was up there in front of the class longer than she would have liked. Furthermore, Chihiro couldn't focus on the problem completely, the back of her mind unable to stop thinking about how she was in front of her entire class with no underwear on. If it weren't for her skirt, they'd be able to see her shapely posterior! Chihiro did her best not to think about it, but it was a difficult task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a bit longer than she would have liked, Chihiro worked out the problem. As she set the chalk back down on the tray, Chihiro's nerves caught up to her, her hands shaking slightly as she stepped away from the board. Turning around to face the class, she was relieved to see nothing more than a few curious stares. It seemed that her short skirt had drawn some attention, but it hadn't caused any further trouble. Still, Chihiro was glad to be able to return to her desk, and quickly started to make her way back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Chihiro stepped off the raised floor in front of the board-</span></div></div>",

Her walk turned into a solid run, one of her hands gripping the tear in her skirt tightly to keep the damage from spreading. Quickly enough, Chihiro turned and ran into the women's restroom, turning to get a better view of her damaged skirt in the mirror. The damage was... bad. The tear was all the way up to the waistband of the skirt, a bit of the elastic peeking out from under the black fabric of her uniform. The tear, nearly an inch in width, showed off Chihiro's pale, smooth skin in start contrast to the skirt itself, making her situation that much more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is bad... this is really bad.\" Chihiro muttered to herself. \"I can't go back to class like this! I can't even finish the school day like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro wasn't exactly a seamstress, and she knew she wouldn't be able to repair the damage to her skirt without help. Still, maybe if she gave it a close look, she might be able to figure something out. So, with several deep breaths to steel herself, Chihiro carefully pulled her skirt down her legs, keeping an eye on the bathroom door in case someone else entered. The last thing Chihiro needed right now was for somebody to come in and see her standing there naked from the waist down. It was embarrassing enough that she was bottomless in school in the middle of the day, an audience would just make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her skirt in her hands, Chihiro held the damaged garment up to her face, closely inspecting the damage. There had to be something she could do to at least temporarily mend the damage. Maybe if she could get her hands on a stapler?

There just had to be -something-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chihiro pondered what to do, her situation only got worse when-</span></div></div>",

Now came the hard part: taking off her blouse. With shaking hands, Chihiro slowly unbuttoned her school blouse, her breath and heartbeat both increasing in pace with each button. Finally, with the blouse completely unbuttoned, Chihiro reluctantly slid the garment off her arms, reducing herself to nothing but her bra and glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Chihiro almost laughed at the sight of herself in the mirror. If this situation wasn't so mortifying, it would be hilarious. As it was, Chihiro was in no mood to laugh. Instead, the timid treasurer began to wrap her blouse around her hips, trying her best to make something that could be called a skirt. At first, she tried simply tying the arms around her waist, but gave up when it became apparent that whichever side the arms were tied on was completely uncovered from the sleeves down. Instead, Chihiro resigned herself to turning the blouse on its side, wrapping it lengthwise around herself and using the buttons as a haphazard fastening. This left her sleeves dangling uselessly from her \"skirt\", but it at least covered her hips and important bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she looked ridiculous, Chihiro picked up her jacket and swiftly threw it on.

Trying her best to remain inconspicuous, Chihiro carefully ran a hand across her exposed leg, trying to figure out what went wrong. The problem became obvious as Chihiro felt where her blouse's buttons should have been fastened. They should have been, but instead were completely free of the buttonholes, leaving the blouse to fall open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nooo! Why does this keep happening!?</i> Chihiro wailed internally. Clearly her blouse had objected to being used in such an unorthodox fashion. Being around her hips, rather than her torso, must have been too different and put undue strain on the buttons, and they simply couldn't hold together. This was somewhat understandable, but not at all appreciated by Chihiro, who was far more concerned with the fact that her lower half was about to become exposed all over again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chihiro wanted to get to work trying to keep her blouse together across her waist, she also didn't want to abandon the quiz. Yes, this was embarrassing, but there was also the issue of her grades. The last thing Chihiro needed was for her scores to slip because she left a quiz half finished. Still, it could very easily be argued that her current predicament far outweighed academic issues. There was also the fact that messing with her skirt might draw attention to herself. As the only one in the room not focused on the paper in front of her, Chihiro's actions would probably stand out, get the teacher curious, and then things could get even worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro had to make a choice.

The only thing on her with white thread was the blouse she was trying to fix, and this realization made Chihiro's sunken heart begin to race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did this thread come from?

If she could find the source, she could hopefully cut the thread at the source and keep that problem under control. At least... in theory. However, as her tugging confirmed, she couldn't figure out the general area of the thread's origin. Even worse, those weak tugs had still been enough to increase the length of the visible thread, meaning that she was further undoing whatever part of her blouse the thread was connected to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Keep calm, Chihiro.

Not for real, not to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, a quick pinch on her hand reaffirmed the cold truth. This was very real, and she was very exposed. The only saving grace was that the class was still working on the quiz, and Chihiro hadn't drawn any attention to herself yet. If she was quick and lucky, she could get her blouse back and at least drape it across her lap. Sure, she'd have to do more than that before she could safely stand up from her chair, but at least that would hide her naked legs and pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there the question of how to retrieve the blouse.

At least the bra covered the most important parts of her chest, after all. So, carefully, Chihiro draped her ruined jacket across her lap, planning to quickly wrap it around her hips as soon as she left her seat. With this ready, Chihiro curled up to make herself as small as possible before timidly raising her hand, hoping to get the teacher's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it wasn't long before the teacher noticed Chihiro's hand and walked up to the quiet girl's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Fushimi?\" the teacher whispered, apparently not noticing Chihiro's blatant state of undress quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I... I... I need to step out of the room. My... my uniform...\" Chihiro stammered, unable to continue speaking as her face quickly turned crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher's eyes widened as she realized Chihiro's problem. Looking around to make sure the rest of the class was still focused on their work, the teacher bent down to close the distance between herself and Chihiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fushimi, what on earth happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-i-it's a long story.\" Chihiro said, unable to make eye contact. \"I just... I just... I can't let anyone see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher put a reassuring hand on Chihiro's shoulder, though this only served to make the poor girl flinch from the contact. \"You'll be okay, Fushimi. I'll make sure everyone keeps their eyes on their work, and you can slip out. Go take care of... this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro couldn't put her relief into words, so a look of gratitude would have to suffice. The teacher walked back to the front of the room, gave Chihiro a reassuring nod, and faced the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes on your work, everyone. I don't want to see any wandering eyes, understood?\" The teacher said, putting forth an air of authority. Chihiro didn't need a signal from the teacher to know this was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the jacket around her waist tightly, Chihiro quickly slid out of her seat, wrapping the ruined garment around her shapely hips as she stood up. Not wanting to waste time, Chihiro hurried to the classroom door, sliding it open just enough to squeeze through and slip into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro knew she had to get somewhere safe. She wasn't sure where, but the hallway certainly wasn't the best place to linger. Anywhere that wasn't a classroom, that much was certain. Hopefully she could find something to restore her modesty, maybe even a replacement uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Chihiro's plans hit a snag as she and the teacher hadn't noticed-</span></div></div>",

That had been far too close. The sound of footsteps and conversation passing by the door made it very apparent that one second later and she'd have been seen. Thankful that she had avoided such embarrassment, Chihiro slid down the door, coming to rest on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of cold tile on her bare skin made Chihiro's eyes snap wide open. That wasn't right. Looking down, Chihiro gasped as she saw the entirety of her pelvis, a tuft of brown hair being the only thing even resembling cover on her lower half. Taking her hands off her hips must have been all her makeshift skirt needed to slip right off! Even worse, it was nowhere to be found! It must have fallen off in the hallway. The hallway now filled with students. All Chihiro had left was her bra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real...\" Chihiro muttered deliriously. This was too much to comprehend. She was sitting in the student council room, a place she saw regularly, with nothing to her name but a plain white bra. The only other clothing she had left was somewhere out in the hall, and that was assuming a curious student didn't pick it up. What on earth was she supposed to do now?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro knew she couldn't go into the hallway now. There were too many people. The skirt was a loss... Chihiro would have to make do with what she could find in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her odds were slim, and even if she found something, it'd likely be dubious at best, and not at all inconspicuous.

Physical activity wasn't Chihiro's strong suit, and the PE clothes she had to wear were far too skimpy for her tastes. The shirt wasn't too bad, it was pretty much a simple T-shirt, but the bloomers were what Chihiro couldn't stand. Who had decided that a pair of bloomers only slightly more modest than normal panties was proper attire for high school girls? If Chihiro ever met the person behind that decision she'd... well, she'd have strong words for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Chihiro had no say in it. PE was a required class, barring extenuating circumstances, and Chihiro wasn't about to drop out of school just because of one class. It didn't mean Chihiro didn't hate it; she swore she could practically feel the eyes of every boy in the class on her as she ran. Perhaps it was paranoia, but Chihiro didn't care; it was embarrassing and unpleasant. Unbeknownst to Chihiro, however, her unwanted attention had gained her some enemies. Several girls in Chihiro's class were jealous of the shy treasurer, convinced that her timidity was merely an act to entice boys to approach her. Had Chihiro know how they felt, she'd have done everything she could to convince them of the truth: that she really was that timid, that she hated the idea of everyone looking at her, and she'd gladly trade places with any of them if it meant she'd be left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Chihiro was unaware of their resentment, and as such she was oblivious to their plotting. The main conspirators, a group of four girls, had been planning their attack for weeks. If Chihiro wanted to be such a tease, they thought, then they'd teach her a lesson in humility. When they were done, she'd have no secrets left to tease anybody with. The day of reckoning had come, and phase one was about to begin. Phase one, of course, being-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was summer at Gekkoukan High School, and that meant swim classes. A normal class was misery enough for Chihiro, but this special time of the year made physical education an absolute nightmare. Out of everything at this school, this was the one thing she completely hated. During a normal class, the bloomers were somewhat tolerable, due predominantly to Chihiro \"accidentally\" ordering a shirt that was one size too large - large enough to offer the modesty of a skirt, yet small enough to not get in the way during the day's activities. Plus, no matter how much she may sweat, the shirt never started to cling to her and frame her form. The swim suit was nowhere near as friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a streamlined one-piece, to be fair, but that didn't make things better; in fact, it made things worse. It clung tightly to Chihiro's body, flaunting her curves for the whole class, and it only hugged her tighter once it was wet. The swim cap only exacerbated the problem, robbing her of the slight concealment offered by her hair. The only immediate benefit was the more modest bottom, which didn't show off nearly as much as the bloomers, but this comfort was fleeting. Swimming in it invariably wedged the back of it up the crack of a girl's butt, regardless of the wearer, and liberating it always showed off even more skin. Chihiro's face was almost constantly beet red out of the pool, and her posture took a hit in her efforts to hide, but these only seemed to make her stand out more, even before factoring in the other girl's apathetic expressions. Although, once in the pool, achieving whatever objective the teacher set usually blocked out all of these thoughts, and the splashing water did offer some concealment. Even a butterfly stroke was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't help matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near-instant change in disposition during these days convinced her envious enemies their belief was on the mark. Their anger bubbled over during swim class, especially since Chihiro maintained her heavily-stressed act even in the changing room. However, it was the one class in which the students were required to strip bare. This was the time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a normal day, Chihiro could hide her panties by slipping on her bloomers under the unfastened skirt, and could get her shirt on over her school blouse and wiggle out of the latter without problem. Her sock-clad feet were the only things she exposed while she was getting changed. The swimwear had no beautiful trick. She tried to find one, but there wasn't enough room to unhook and remove her bra, especially once she got the swimsuit under her blouse. A method probably existed, but the time needed would only get her a lecture, and eventually demerits. That said, she was usually exposed for no more than five seconds, even though it felt like an eternity. However, that's only when she's changing before class. After class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, shower off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly optional. The students just spent a whole period submerged in a pool. Clean as it was, the chlorine was already causing a rank smell to waft off their bodies, and they could already feel their skin getting stiff. The showers almost never saw use on a normal day - there were a few who refused to head back to class reeking of sweat and Mitsuru Kirijo got some bizarre kick out of showering after class recently, but those students could be counted on one hand; the vast majority of the students only washed their hands and face in a sink and applied a little more deodorant, and that's assuming they did anything besides change their clothes. Even with separate rooms, a swim class meant walking 50 or so steps dressed in nothing but a towel. Twice. Which was two times too many for Chihiro Fushimi, even before the other girls struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe precursor was a little mishap at the end of the class itself. While most of the group made a mad dash for the showers, one stayed behind near Chihiro. Once that was done, all she had to do was find that loose tile and give a cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nan</i>-\" Chihiro called. The cry was cut short when pool water filled her mouth. Her shadow had made sure to knock her into the pool. She made sure not to hurt the tease, only surprise her. Between the fall, the exit, and complaints to the teacher, the two of them wouldn't be getting into the showers until the rest of the class was exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Fushimi-san?\" she asked, offering a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro smiled up at her new companion, \"Just spooked, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Turning to their teacher, \"<i>Sensei</i>! When's that tile gonna be fixed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Chihiro somewhat appreciated the accident. Now that she was running late, there wouldn't be nearly as many people around when she was undressed. That means less witnesses, a straight path to the showers, no need to look around for a stall, and a straight path back to her clothes. All things considered, she'd be done at about the same time as usual, even if she did slow her pace to the changing room and shower slightly longer to ensure her savior was ahead of her the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Chihiro hadn't considered that it would mean anyone who cared to look could find her locker more easily. Garments being added to a locker stands out when every other locker is being emptied, more so since most students leave the lockers open once they're empty. But why would she think about that? The worst anyone has ever done was lock someone in the school overnight, and she didn't have those kinds of enemies, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This everything?\" the leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The locker's empty,\" another girl answered. \"She keeps everything besides her swimsuit, sneakers, and <i>uwabaki</i> in her bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third said, \"Made our job easy. All that's left are her towel and glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go!\" the leader called grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the demure persona was an act concealing a tease, some teases wouldn't go out totally bare since there's no means of teasing. They had to make this one small sacrifice if they wanted to lure Chihiro out of the changing room. They would have taken her glasses, hoping she was blind without them, but they had a thought: if she can't see where she's going, she might not go anywhere. Besides, she always brought them to the shower and left them on the shelf for the soap. That's not nearly as easy to nab as something in an unguarded locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro emerged from the shower stall clinging the damp towel tightly. From the waist up, it showed off even more than the swimsuit, but the complete absence of prying eyes made it seem like she was in her bathroom at home. She couldn't even hear the other straggler at her locker, and the only shower head dripping was the one she just used. Her eyes confirmed what her ears heard: she was totally alone. It was paradise. Right until she got to her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is the door open? Where's all my stuff? What's going on? Who would do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro's thoughts were racing. Her knees quickly grew weak, and she was getting pale all over. Wrapped up in what could be and how to prevent it, Chihiro was overlooking what already was. The bell was about to ring, flooding the halls with more students, yet a teacher was her best bet of getting out of this without anyone seeing more than this. She knew where to find the physical education teacher, at least she thought she did, but this wasn't the time for that method. Not yet, at least. If only Chihiro could recognize this detail.</span></div></div>",

With the halls about to fill with students any minute now... And a bit of a walk to the nearest solution to her troubles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis predicament would be difficult for any student, let alone Chihiro. Even as the timid girl grasped the handle of the door that would lead her out into the hallway, she had to take a moment to steady herself. The normally trivial task of pulling open the door was suddenly a herculean undertaking, and Chihiro had to focus to gather the inner fortitude necessary to take this big step. Finally, after an internal pep talk, Chihiro pulled the door open and hurried out into the hallway before she could let her nerves fail again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the first leg of Chihiro's arduous journey had begun. The one upside to Chihiro's hesitance to leave the locker room was that she had time to think about where to go next. As far as she saw it, there were two options available: a shorter journey that didn't guarantee success, and the longer journey that just... it just had to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter path would be for Chihiro to try the different rooms on the first floor. Classrooms were out of the question, but maybe, just maybe, she'd find something in one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer path would be to go down the length of the school, all the way down to the faculty room. One of the teachers was sure to help Chihiro, after all. A student in such obvious distress was something any responsible faculty member couldn't ignore! Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn either case, Chihiro would first have to travel through the atrium connecting the gymnasium and its facilities to the rest of the school. Out into the open sunlight, past the persimmon tree, and then into the school halls proper.

Rather than simply walk, the naked bookworm awkwardly shuffled along sideways, keeping her exposed backside pointed away from the other store patrons, grazing lightly against the bookshelves as she crept past. Each coarse caress of a book felt like a lecherous graze of fingertips to the nervous young woman, and she was a wreck of nerves by the time she was by the detectors in front of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, Chihiro took a moment to make absolutely sure that she was looking at the door into the women's restroom, not at all liking the idea of accidentally bolting into the wrong one. The pink blur surrounding the vaguely humanoid figure within the sign was enough to convince Chihiro that she had the right room. Now for the most difficult part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro took a deep breath and looked around once more. She couldn't make out any details, but she wanted to at least be fairly confident that nobody was looking in her direction. It seemed like she was seeing only the backs of people's heads, and that would have to be enough. Quickly, Chihiro released her grip on the books covering her front and, before they even hit the ground, dashed through the door and into the relative safety of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro's heart was pounding, convinced that someone would follow her into the bathroom any second now to confront her nudity. When nobody did, Chihiro could scarcely believe her luck. She did it! She made it here unseen! ...Now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the day, and it would be quite awhile before the shop closed for the night. There was no telling how many people would have to use the bathroom in that time, and even less telling if any of those people would be friendly or willing to help the naked girl. She was safe for now, but all it would take to change that is being caught by the wrong person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would require her to stay in the bathroom. The narrow window near the top of the bathroom offered a potential escape, or at least it looked like it. It was a bit too blurry to tell how narrow the window really was, and the only way to know if she'd fit would be to try. Was escape really worth the risk? Maybe it'd be better to just try trusting people for once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing her options, none of which were exactly great, Chihiro resolved to-</span></div></div>",

Every so often the bathroom door opened, footsteps were heard entering, the usage of a stall or merely the sink followed, then the person was gone... and Chihiro had been left petrified, unable to so much as squeak. She didn't have the nerve to draw a stranger's attention to her predicament. Girls could be cruel. If the wrong person not only knew about her situation but decided to exploit it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro shook her head to cast off the frightening mental image, her hands planted against her thighs to keep her legs from shivering more than they were. No, asking for help was off the table. She could wait, of course, but then what? She'd be locked inside the store all night unless she left. In the middle of the night. Which was akin to suicide in some areas. Again she frantically shook her head, an insistently silent 'no', while ignoring the chatter of two leaving girls that didn't help matters any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left one avenue... the window. Suddenly feeling a rush of hope, she stared over to the window. It was low enough for her to reach. She was confident she was thin enough to use it...one small benefit her petite figure allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd best of all, it likely lead out to an out-of-the-way area, one from which she could easily get home safely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro wasted no time in taking advantage of that ray of hope. The moment the bathroom door shut to confirm she was once again alone, she took action. She got to her feet, rushed out of the stall, and before anything from within or without could stop her, she grabbed onto the windowsill and began to pull herself up. In a few seconds she was climbing up, and had the window open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had to do was get away. The warm sunlight shone through, inviting her to climb through the outward opening to safety. The window even opened outward, meaning if she could get up and out, she was clear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a small amount of struggle. With some luck and the right amount of exertion, Chihiro had gotten her feet to scale the tiled wall. Soon she was pulling herself up and through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a small exhale of winded breath as she began to twist and wiggle her way through. The sight of her from outside would not be too scandalous just yet, but if someone from the bathroom were to enter, they'd get a clear view of the naked girl's bottom on full display...not a pleasant thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spurned Chihiro on, and with renewed effort, she gave a grunt and tried to manage that last sharp pull which would get her out of that unimaginably awkward situation and into freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it happened. That last bit of struggle was the clear indicator of her progress. Chihiro had succeeded, alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucceeded in...</span></div></div>",

She looked like some kind of crazy collage: her body was covered in an array of blues, whites, reds, and blacks. The paint was thicker in some places, and parts of her skin remained untouched, but that just made Chihiro look even stranger. Chihiro had never imagined herself with blue breasts before, but now she knew exactly what that looked like. She didn't even want to think of what her back must have looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't go anywhere like this!\" Chihiro said. \"I have to wash this off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro looked around the room for somewhere to wash the paint off of herself. Thankfully, the art room was equipped with a large sink, probably meant for washing brushes and easels, but perfectly serviceable for what Chihiro needed. Of course, washing all the paint off would take time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, the tarp was still cover, wet paint or no. Sure, she'd get even more paint all over herself, but that wouldn't matter so long as she kept the tarp. Her paint-covered skin would stay covered by the tarp, and Chihiro certainly didn't intend on losing it in front of people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro had to make a choice.

This posed a bit of a blessing and a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that the room was currently empty. Chihiro was... somewhat confident that the photography club didn't meet today, so she should be okay in here for the time being. Less good, however, was the lack of visibility. Even with her glasses, the low light level in the room was particularly bad for Chihiro's vision, making the poor girl just a step or two above being completely blind. Finding anything, let alone something to wear, would require close investigation of pretty much everything in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any more time, and eager to get herself covered up once more, Chihiro started to slowly search the darkroom. Holding a hand to the wall to keep her bearings, Chihiro half blindly pawed across the nearest surface, her hands finding nothing but trays full of developing fluid. Still, Chihiro wasn't about to give up hope so easily. There had to be something to use; maybe a sheet used for solid background colors, or even some loose paper if she got particularly desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlind as she was, Chihiro failed to notice the camera tripod left on the floor.

To Chihiro's left were rows of shoe lockers, as well as the main entryway to the school. The main entryway that was essentially one large glass wall... allowing anybody looking in that direction to potentially see Chihiro standing there, naked as the day she was born...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to dispel that unpleasant thought, Chihiro realized that she had to move. While there weren't any classrooms for people to walk out of in the entryway, it was still far from an ideal place to be standing naked. Looking around, straining her eyes to try and make out details through her fuzzy vision, Chihiro tried to figure out where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hallway, where Chihiro would find the faculty office, library, and nurse's office, would be a straight shot from where Chihiro was currently standing. The school store only sold small odds and ends, nothing Chihiro could use at the moment, unfortunately. But... there was one other option. The shoe lockers, while mainly meant to hold only their namesake, were commonly used by students to store other things. Maybe, if Chihiro was lucky, one of the lockers would be unlocked, and there just might be something to wear! Maybe somebody had a coat stuffed in one of those things! A coat, something Chihiro could use to cover herself up, with sleeves and a zipper and real protection! The idea almost made Chihiro weak in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Chihiro knew she didn't have too long to think about it. She had no way of knowing when the bell would ring next and flood the area with students. The last thing Chihiro wanted was to be caught in her current state when that happened.

Clearing her throat she made a declaration. \"Alright, this is the last straw, guys!\" She smacked her hand against a locker as she passed one row. \"When it's time for practice, it means we start then! Not a couple minutes later, not getting changed then, but in the pool swimming then!\" She glanced down the next row, seeing nothing. She frowned, but continued on. \"I don't want to get mean over it, and I'm willing to cut you guys some slack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuko froze. Was that the sound of a locker door being closed? She thought she could hear breathing, but with the way sound warped in the locker room made it hard to tell. Still, Yuko grinned; she was closing in on them! \"..I'll give you guys a break sometimes but the <i>whole</i> team is almost <i>always</i> late!\" Yuko pressed her back to the side of a row of lockers; she was sure they were down this row. As silently as she could, she inched forward and forward. \"It wouldn't be so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprung out, closing off one end of the alley between two banks of lockers. \"Except now you guys are trying to hide from me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Yuko now had a clear look down at who she was yelling at, all pretense of stealth dropped, she saw...</span></div></div>",

Her slow steps back turned into a full turn and sprint, or at least almost did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl to her right lunged forward as Yuko tried to turn, grabbing the arm of her jacket. Yuko was strong enough to push back, swinging her arm to slam the girl into the lockers, but unfortunately the girl held on. Yuko didn't have time to shake her off, either; the girl on her other side was about to grab her as well, and even their leader was starting to move on her now. The one she'd hit was stunned now, but would soon think to actually grab her arm instead of just her sleeve. Yuko cringed, and slipped out of her thankfully open jacket and started running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not a big loss</i>, Yuko thought. Her t-shirt was just fine, and actually even easier to run in. Not looking back, she could hear at least two sets of feet running after her, and the girl in charge shouting after her companions to catch the cornered coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance!\" Yuko called back, \"You really think you can keep up with-- oh!\" Yuko's taunting was cut short as the girl behind her, seeing how close Yuko was to the door and knowing that she wasn't fast enough to catch her properly, lunged. She wasn't quite quick enough to grab an arm or her ponytail like she had been aiming for, but as Yuko's attacker fell to the floor, her fingers were just far enough to grab hold of some fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Yuko slowed down and nearly fell forward as her shorts were yanked to the ground. Her muscular legs slid into view, as did her tight butt in tight underwear. If it wasn't already red from exertion, Yuko might have started to blush. As it was, she was forced to jump out of her shorts, only possible because the loose pant legs let her shoes free fairly easily. She sent a quick kick backwards, hitting her assailants arm, not hoping to seriously harm her but maybe enough to keep her on the ground for a little longer. Unfortunately, even as she cursed in pain, the girl on the floor did not release Yuko's shorts, forcing her to run off without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the locker room door, Yuko was struck all at once by her situation. Pants-less besides the school's thankfully vacant pool, she gasped and tugged the front of her painfully just-too-short shirt down to cover her front. Hearing the sounds of the girls behind her in the locker room, she knew she had to make a choice. Going through the main doors would take her back into the school; a humiliating prospect, as there were other clubs in the school that met at the same time as the Swim Team, but if she could just get to her locker at the front of the school! Her uniform proper was back in the locker room with her attackers, but she had a spare set of workout clothes and a spare swimsuit waiting by the glass main doors. The only problem was getting their unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other option was to head out the pool's back exit. She was less likely to encounter any other students.... because that path would take her off school grounds. Quicker, yes, but Yuko <i>really</i> didn't want to run all the way home in just her underwear and t-shirt. Not to mention she'd have to pass a few highly populated shopping centers and train stations to get there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard shoes slapping locker room tile right on the other side of the door, and Yuko knew she needed to bolt, now.

She might have been shouting and screaming, and kicking and punching, until her throat and muscles were sore, but still, nothing. Eventually, having worked up a sweat, Yuko slumped against the door in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me...\" All she wanted was a decent team practice, so what did she get? Stuck alone in a locker room for whoever knows how long! A chill ran down her spine. <i>What if I'm stuck here overnight?</i> Yuko shook the thought from her head. Things looked bad, but thinking about the worst case scenario wasn't going to help anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuko took a deep breath and pushed herself to her feet.

The one that manifests behind your back whenever you enter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one with the big glass window that says 'Break in case of emergencies'?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Well, this morning I broke it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke the Velvet Room's fourth wall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. This conversation is only happening because I have broken the fourth wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any event, having done so i have glimpsed the strand of Fate and Destiny! And they all converge on this day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! Apparently today someone chosen by Fate is going to get naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked! Without clothing! Stripped! Humiliated! Bereft of modesty! Seen in their birthday suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it!....WHY??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I suspect Fate may at times be controlled by unseen forces of various proclivities...which in this case appears to be one or several perverted individuals that should feel absolutely terrible about the ordeals they put hapless women through for their own lust and amusement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then proceeded to give a very pointed and dour look that seemed to be just staring off into space from Minako's point of view but was most certainly in fact directed towards the reader and author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worst of all, it seems Fate intends for ME to suffer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...that's....terrible.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me your pretense! I am well aware you have enjoyed seeing me in a state of undress just as much as I have enjoyed seeing you in scenarios where Fate has chosen you for humiliation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is entirely unfair! Why must I suffer such an ordeal! Surely someone else can be chosen, even at this late hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone else? Fate can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly! It isn't as if Fate has entirely run out of women to humiliate connected with your quest! True, you and your closest associates have already suffered enormously in various splinters of reality...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can still be spared! Perhaps we could instead focus on the mysterious shop keeper of the antique store who fuses personas into various weapons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's so nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or my elder sister Margaret! Even though she is just an optional boss fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...optional...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush! Or perhaps that girl from Strega! The one in white.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chidori? But hasn't she been through enough as it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is that there are still many options left for these cruel fate manipulating godlings to choose from! If we beg they will show us mercy and pick someone else to humiliate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a thunderbolt came crashing down upon the two girls (inexplicably, as they were standing in an indoor mall and besides which there were no clouds in the sky that morning), instantly disintegrating their clothes. With a look of horrified panic Minako moved to cover herself. Elizabeth gave another angry glare towards the readers before following suit. Suddenly a massive throng of onlookers marched out into the open area of the mall, maybe attracted by the noise, but really who cares? Finding the two naked girls, they immediately began snapping pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe knowing this story will be removed from the time stream the godlings will take advantage of the moment while they can and opt to humiliate us worse than usual!\" Elizabeth grumbled to herself. \"Well, two can play that game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the blonde girl pounced upon a blushing Arisato and proceeded to kiss, squeeze and play with the other's naked body with all the desperate abandon one might expect from someone who's lovemaking but be summarized in 10000 characters or less. In short it was extremely pleasurable and highly embarrassing for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor sighed to himself as he watched the scenario unfold. With a brief wave of his hand, he erased the happening from existence. Whatever happened next was up to Fate.</span></div></div>",

Every garment Elizabeth took found itself stuffed inside her purse, a wonderful accessory she would never leave the Velvet Room without. How humans got by without an extra-dimensional container like hers was a mystery to Elizabeth. After all, she only kept necessities in it- several million yen, the Persona Compendium, and a few dozen knickknacks she'd quietly collected on previous outings with Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was quite amazed at the sheer amount of clothing that Yukari owned. So much variety in her garments was dazzling, as were the many colors the clothes came in. A few garments even roused greater curiosity in Elizabeth than normal. Perhaps the young woman wouldn't notice if Elizabeth just... kept a few things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the deed was done, and all of Yukari's clothing, save her shirt and panties, were safely hidden away within Elizabeth's purse. Carefully stepping out of the room, Elizabeth silently closed the door behind her, re-locking it as she did so. Now all that was left was to find a nice place to hide and observe the girl's reaction. Elizabeth had noticed cameras throughout the building when she arrived, though she felt that they were meant to be hidden. It didn't take long for the keen-eyed woman to find her way to the control room where the camera data was fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had no experience with computers, Elizabeth managed to piece together enough knowledge to access the camera feeds. This was perfect. The enigmatic intruder could observe the fruits of her labor from the confines of this room, safe from discovery so long as nobody knew she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCycling through the cameras, Elizabeth found the camera to Yukari's room. The young woman was still sound asleep, but her stirring indicated that this would soon change. A few moments later, Yukari's eyes cracked open.

Most of Yukari's behavior she had come to expect, but what was really informative and surprising was her current behavior.  Given Yukari's earlier timidity at wandering the dorms with her towel secure, the fact that she was now boldly sprinting toward the fallen fabric while wearing nothing at all despite being surrounded by several strangers was odd.  Was the desire for coverage greater than the desire to not be seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth continued to think on this while Yukari grabbed the towel, hastily wrapped herself up in it, and ran as fast as she could to the mall entrance while holding the towel with one hand, all to the surrounding whoops of several morning shoppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth hurried along in pursuit just in time to see the towel-clad girl run out the mall entrance and into the city proper, heads turning in her wake.  \"Oh well, I was hoping to continue our fun, but it was probably about time I moved on for now.  But that is strange,\" Elizabeth said to herself.  \"Her most likely destination is back to her dorm room, but the train station is the other way.  To cross the city on foot is much longer and more arduous than taking a train, meaning that she would be outside and visible in her state for an extended period of time.  And there would be a sizable amount of people on either route...\"  Elizabeth tried to work out this obvious contradiction.  \"Oh well, I am positive she knows what's best for her,\" she shrugged, hopping back towards the train station, the dorms being her destination once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was still young, and there was still so much to do!  Namely, there were still Minako's other friends, Mitsuru and Fuuka, that Elizabeth wanted to observe.  Replaying the events with Yukari in her head, Elizabeth was brimming with excitement.  It may be too late to be able to do something like she did with Yukari, but maybe it wasn't.  Either way, she was excited to try something new with the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short while, Elizabeth was back at the dorms again.  Testing the door, she found it unlocked.  Peeking inside, she was delighted to find the lobby empty just like it was earlier.  Either everyone was still sleeping or in their rooms, or they had gone out for the day.  Either way, this was fine.  Everything would be ruined if they knew she was there, and if she had to hypnotize everyone she came across, she would lose the beauty of genuine human reactions, the entire point of her sneaking out of the Velvet Room in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping up the stairs, Elizabeth decided to make use of the camera control room again, in order to make sure whether the girls were in their rooms or not.  With the spectacular success she had with Yukari, she hoped they were, but she could always carry out an 'investigation' if they weren't.  Perhaps see the others' interesting choices in attire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Elizabeth gasped.  Thinking of the other girls' clothes only just now reminded her that Yukari's clothes were still in her bag!  Taking them may have been necessary for her observations but keeping them would be outright theft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Elizabeth rushed down the stairs to Yukari's room.  Using her key trick to enter once more, Elizabeth brought out her purse-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and stopped.  \"Where did each outfit go again?\" Elizabeth asked herself, staring at the empty closet and dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use, she was too busy scooping everything up back then to know where everything was supposed to be, and she didn't have much time before Yukari got back.  So, with a shrug, Elizabeth did the most logical thing she could think of and just dumped out all of Yukari's clothes into a giant pile in the center of the room.  Regarding the giant, crumpled heap with a satisfied smile, Elizabeth turned around to leave.  Unfortunately, in her haste, she had made quite a bit of noise in prioritizing speed over stealth, and attracted the attentions of someone nearby.  Thus, when she opened the door, Elizabeth was caught slightly off-guard as she found herself face-to-face with-</span></div></div>",

What possible business involves that huge mess?\" Fuuka asked, pointing into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned around and looked at the pile again.  <i>How to explain this?</i> she puzzled.

Wait, does that mean-\" Fuuka asked, then looked more closely at Elizabeth.  \"-You're some kind of maid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A maid?\" Elizabeth replied, recalling having heard the word from somewhere before, and thought on this for a second.  \"Well, an important part of my duties is to provide assistance and perform services to ease the burdens of whomever signs the contract.  So yes, I suppose you could consider me as 'some kind of maid.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Fuuka. \"Mitsuru-senpai actually went and hired maids for us?  I didn't think anyone would have taken Junpei-kun's suggestion seriously... I guess that also explains those odd clothes... but wait, that was done last night!  The request for your service could only have been sent just mere hours ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pride myself on fast and reliable service of the utmost quality,\" Elizabeth said slyly.  <i>And my clothes are not 'odd,' thank you very much!</i> she added in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.  Although...\" Fuuka said, leaning her head to look back over Elizabeth into the room. \"I think you might want to double-check your 'quality.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Elizabeth asked, taken aback. \"And just what is wrong with this?  All of Miss Yukari's clothes are back in her room, are they not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... but everything's all messed up,\" said Fuuka.  \"If left like that everything will get wrinkled or dusty just lying on the floor all mixed together like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, that is how Miss Yukari told me to do it,\" Elizabeth lied, with only a slight amount of hesitation.  \"She was rather insistent that she be the one to actually put everything away in their proper storage compartments.  She has a system, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess that makes sense,\" Fuuka said, looking back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth couldn't believe how well this was working.  She didn't need to use her compendium or anything.  Now, how much fun could she have with this disguise?  With the appearance of following orders, she could gather information and experiment right under Fuuka's nose! \"Now that I have finished with Miss Yukari's tasks, I am now available to help you with anything you may require, Miss Fuuka,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Wow!\" Fuuka said, surprised.  \"I'd love some help.  But there's no need to be formal, you can just call me Fuuka, all right, Elizabeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" Elizabeth nodded.  \"What would you like me to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Fuuka said, thinking it over...</span></div></div>",

Is this an alternate uniform?\" Elizabeth asked herself, holding the sleeveless top out in front of her. \"It's unlike anything Minako or her friends wear, but it does bear the same insignia as the other uniforms. Clearly this is an acceptable choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that the odd outfit in the locker was a perfectly normal thing to wear to school, Elizabeth set about changing her outfit. To start, her hat and gloves would have to go. Iconic as they were to Elizabeth's style, they simply stood out too much and would risk compromising Elizabeth's disguise as a normal student. With a level of reverence humans normally reserved for holy relics, Elizabeth set her accessory clothing down inside the locker. With that done, the elegant blonde quickly undid the fastenings of her dress, the soft blue fabric pooling around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, such a strange feeling.\" Elizabeth mused, standing there in the locker room with nothing on but her footwear and dark blue undergarments. \"I've never been so disrobed before. At least not out here in the human world. It's... a little bit exhilarating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Elizabeth knew that she couldn't stay like this. So, the mysterious woman quickly pulled on the top and shorts, looking down to examine herself. The Gekkoukan High insignia on the right breast of the shirt would make it clear that she was supposed to be a student, at least. However, Elizabeth was quite curious about who this uniform truly belonged to. The top was unusually tight around Elizabeth's chest, so much so that the girl who wore it must have been almost completely flat!

There was still plenty of time before anybody showed up, so Elizabeth didn't hesitate in whipping the shirt right off her torso, leaving nothing covering her upper half besides her bra. This changed in an instant as Elizabeth deftly reached behind her back and undid the clasp, her bra immediately going slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the garment off her arms, Elizabeth quickly deposited the garment in her bag to join her dress. For a moment, Elizabeth simply sat there as she was, her perky breasts exposed to the open air, her light pink nipples stiffening almost imperceptibly in the cool air of the classroom. -This- was certainly a new experience. Her upper body exposed, freely visible to anybody that might walk in the room. The thrill of such a risk was exhilarating to Elizabeth, the smile on her face making that plainly apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the idea of actually being seen was not quite so pleasant. So, after savoring the feel for a few more moments, Elizabeth picked up her discarded shirt once more, slipping it back over her slender frame. She certainly felt less restricted now, though the shirt was still tight. No matter, she would surely get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of sitting quietly at the desk, Elizabeth heard sounds of conversation from the classroom windows. Peering over, the Velvet Room attendant was delighted to see students arriving for school. Some came in chattering crowds, others came in small groups, others still showed up alone. The complete lack of uniformity in human group movements were interesting to Elizabeth, almost like Shadows in the seemingly chaotic way they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was still pondering this as students began to enter the classroom. It was immediately apparent that Elizabeth's presence was causing a stir; everybody who entered the room looked at the new girl curiously, intrigued by both her odd choice of clothing and her striking physical beauty, to make no mention of the fact that they had never seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth, however, was far more interested in one particular student. As Arisato entered, she immediately recognized the enigmatic girl in her classroom, her eyes betraying a mix of surprise and curiosity. Surely Arisato was just full of questions, like what Elizabeth was doing here. Elizabeth had anticipated this reaction, and had chosen her seat specifically based on the likelihood of this happening.

Elizabeth was breaking the rules by leaving the Velvet Room without Igor's permission. However, the Master was out at the moment, and what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him. Arisato didn't understand the nature of time in the Velvet Room, simply assuming that Igor was always sitting at that table, hands crossed under his long nose. In fact, Igor was a very busy man, and was often attending to matters in other places, appearing for the brief periods Minako entered the Velvet Room as needed. Assuming Arisato didn't need the Velvet Room's services today, Igor could very well be gone for hours yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... am not. But the Master doesn't have to know about this. I just wished to enjoy your world for a day.

But no, for the moment, she was going to let Fuuka prove her hypothesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you, my dear, are heading right back to your desk.\" Elizabeth's smile returned, though there was no warmth, only frost. She moved behind Fuuka and softly spurned her into motion with a hand to her exposed shoulder blade. \"Act as if you were alone on your bed, with no interruptions... or clothes... and with every intent of relaxing in the best of ways.\" Fuuka's glazed-over eyes showed no restraint. The girl merely nodded, and went on her way... though Elizabeth couldn't help but wonder. Had a spark of recognition, and sheer terror, flickered into that soft gaze of Fuuka's? Maybe her compulsion wasn't completely without flaws...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Fuuka's return, the teacher looked up... and to say she was surprised was an understatement. Unavoidably, a few students looked as well. Elizabeth's sheer beauty had turned any number of heads, but Fuuka drew even more attention. No, she was not a fraction as attractive... it was the pure surreality of the situation. The average student would sooner believe a dog could do arithmetic than that Fuuka would calmly walk into class naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there she was, not a thing on, and sitting at her desk as if nothing were the matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y, Yamagishi... you, you must leave class at once! This is.... indecent, and not how one of your standings should be acting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka didn't so much as look at the woman. She just stared off into the distance with a dreamlike expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was to relax... yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka breathed in, then out, and settled her hands across her bare thighs. The chill was nice, a tangibly comforting sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned silence gave way to rampant gossip. The girls, especially, began whispering and giggling. Their imaginations were certainly dancing, as they knew what was going through the nude girl's mind. No doubt, she was about to <i>enjoy</i> herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the worst possible time, Fuuka...</span></div></div>",

It had been ages since she'd let herself indulge herself like that... for some reason this time felt better than ever. She breathed out, letting her legs sway back and forth as she quickened the motions of her hands ever so slightly, letting her rear move forward and back in tune with her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent, everyone around Fuuka watching with transfixed stares.

Fuuka was there, very naked, and on the verge of climaxing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, aaah...\" Fuuka breathed out with a heavy sigh, clutching her thighs around her hands. She was almost there... she breathed in and out quicker, opened her eyes... and her eyes met her teacher's as she felt her fingers dampening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T, teacher... w, why are you....\" Fuuka whispered deliriously, then moved her gaze around the class, taking in the horrifying sight before her. Students... her classmates... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W, what are you all... aaaaah!\" She gasped into her own sentence, blushing as she leaned over into her desk, her breasts heaving sharply. \"O, oooh no... n, not n-...aaaah...\" Fuuka moaned audibly, and felt her hands weaken as her thighs tensed around them.  Her backside rose and settled into the desk, as Fuuka felt her moans intensifying, taking away any effort at speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, mm...n, nooooo...\" She shut her eyes, trying to block out her surroundings, and pretend none of this was happening. But it was... she felt her back straighten against the desk as she bit her lip, staring up at the ceiling as she began to sweat. Her thighs parted, her damp hands left the bare space between her moist hips, and she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah...ah....ah...\" Fuuka unconsciously traced her wet fingers across the inside of her legs, hoping no one could see the result... but it didn't matter. A student would have to be all kinds of naive to not put two and two together. Still, the painful silence went on, all eyes on Fuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a horrified teacher broke the agonizing quiet. \"Yamagichi, out of the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T, teacher... I, I-...

Oh no, she'd let her remember that incident <i>forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the moment, well... as tempting as the alternative was, she knew what the next best thing to do was.

Most strange of all, the space between her legs was accumulating a great deal of moisture, the folds slightly puffing out and quivering. She knew that humans had such reactions from time to time...outside the Velvet Room she often experienced a strange hollow feeling in her stomach that Minako had explained to be hunger (what a delightful experience satisfying that need had been...Ice Cream was the greatest invention in all the world!). This was different, but there were certain parallels...she was quite certain that her body was in need of something...intensely, desperately in need! But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka...\" Elizabeth said, her head feeling dizzy and feverish. \"Stop this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka smiled a malicious smile. \"What's wrong, Elizabeth?

Elizabeth stood by, blushing ferociously, unconsciously wiggling her hips from side to side as her pussy throbbed with need. She was feeling extremely foolish and ignorant at that moment, and that thought reminded her of her exposure not very long ago, and that reminder was only making her insides ache all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But surely you have some idea. You were watching me in class just now. You do remember that, don't you? How you tricked me into humiliating myself in front of everyone?\" Fuuka said, her face suddenly becoming a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what the humans call lust, then? I...I am aware that the need can be fulfilled with a certain application of one's fingers. Or...other objects, depending on circumstance. I...I have not studied the matter in detail. It is also difficult to observe, because the hands obscure precisely what is being accomplished...\" Elizabeth trailed off, her face flushing even more. \"I have attempted to experiment in this regard on a few occasions, but...I have had little success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka laughed at her predicament once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would...would now be an appropriate time to offer my sincere apologies for my earlier behavior?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by all means. Don't expect it to change anything, though. I'm never forgiving you for what you made me do!\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...admit to being...upset at your earlier deceptions. I...perhaps reacted more harshly than what was warranted.\" Elizabeth said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pulled a little prank, one any normal person wouldn't have fallen for, AND YOU MADE ME PLAY WITH MYSELF IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed, as much from guilt and shame as from her lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. There must be a spell in here that will let me puppet your body while keeping you aware. That should solve the problem, right? You get relief, and everyone else gets to see you!\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...begging you, Fuuka-san!\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get you off or not to humiliate you?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am in dire need of both!\" Elizabeth said, her voice breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka laughed, and again snapped her fingers. Elizabeth, to her shock, found her right hand moving of its own accord to slide between her inner folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo...step one complete. Now for step two!\" Fuuka said with glee, raising her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san!

People change.\" Fuuka said, sounding somewhat confused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuka-san!

Put down the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance!\" Fuuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That OH! is a codex NOOOO! of Personas! When I UUUUUSE! its powers, I am channeling the magic of various thousands of Personas! But YOU are not a wild card! Your M-AHHHH MIND! was never meant to use such a tool!\" Elizabeth sad, pushing herself onto her stomach in an effort to minimize her own hand's ability to stimulate her. \"You are channeling the inner selves of a thousand other people.

I will submit to-to any mundane punishment you care to inflict! But you mustn't use the book! Even without the danger TOOOOO!! yourself, you command forces you cannot fully control. OH!

Do you have any idea...what I will do to you for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....No?\" Fuuka asked, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth again kissed her on the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha??\" Fuuka said, gasping in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I underestimated you. From a distance you seemed like a perfectly meek and shy girl. I had no idea what a cunning mind was hiding behind that innocent facade! And when I chose to chastise you for your ruse, you turned the tables and laid claim to a power that would drive most of your race mad in an instant. Power is everything to me, Fuuka-san. To face a great power and be bested by it is my reason for living. That you could take my power and leave me helpless and humiliated before you...That is highly annoying. But also...impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the wide eyed girl another, longer kiss. \"Extremely impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka's cheeks were burning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I am willing to overlook these...indiscretions of yours...if you will forgive my harsh reprisals. Is this proposal acceptable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Of course. I am so sorry for what happened!\" Fuuka said, making an awkward attempt at a bow from her sitting position with one hand still between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept and offer my own apologies. Is this sufficient to fulfill the ritual of human forgiveness?\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka almost laughed, instead offering up a small moan. \"Yes. I think that is sufficient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now, I would like your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. What do you need?\" </span></div></div>",

It was...very good. But you don't know about sex, and you don't know how to masturbate. Where did you learn how to kiss?\" Fuuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Yes. I...I have been tutored in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Fuuka persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Your friend Minako...has been informative on a variety of subjects.\" Elizabeth said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Fuuka said. \"I never would have...ahem.

Pretend my womanhood is like my mouth. Kiss it, and stick your tongue down there. If...you are confused...just do...what I do.\" Fuuka said, her body turning beat red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And this will achieve our needs without 'counting' as your 'first time'?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...maybe. I'll...I'll decide later how much it 'counts'.\" Fuuka said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was about to ask another question, but found words quite impossible for her as the sensation of wet, soft lips upon a very personal area of her body forced her to catch her breath. She quickly reciprocated. </span></div></div>",

For Elizabeth, this was an entirely unexpected sensation, utterly fascinating and a bit frightening all at once. A human can bestow such a feeling upon another with nothing more than their mouth? Elizabeth's fascination grew more every single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka, meanwhile, couldn't believe what she was doing. She was stark naked, hiding in a metal cabinet in her classroom, doing something with another woman she'd only ever seen in videos before. To say the tech genius thought her first experience with oral would be different from this was an understatement. And yet she couldn't deny that it just felt so good! For someone so naive, Elizabeth was proving to be an absolute natural at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cramped space wasn't conducive to decent air circulation, and the vigorous activity of the two ladies quickly heated the small hiding place, coating the two in sweat. The sounds of their heavy, labored breaths and the slick sound of tongues against lower lips were the only sounds to be heard. Thankfully for the two naked lovelies, neither seemed to be getting particularly loud... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth and Fuuka brought each other to new levels of ecstasy, they began to unconsciously move to try and make themselves more comfortable. Fuuka's slender arms wrapped around Elizabeth's shapely hips, spreading her legs further and giving her better access. Elizabeth gladly spread her legs wider, wrapping her hips around Fuuka's head and bending her knees to lock her ankles together. Eager to return the favor to Fuuka, Elizabeth attempted to shift herself, pushing against Fuuka's backside to get better access to Fuuka's glistening sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two shifted, they immediately became aware of a severe problem. As Elizabeth bent her neck to press her face into Fuuka once more, she felt the back of her head pressed firmly against the metal wall of the cabinet. At the same time, Fuuka attempted to pull away from Elizabeth to take a quick breath, only to find her head locked firmly in place by Elizabeth's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph?!\" Fuuka cried, whatever she was trying to say muffled by Elizabeth's flesh. \"Mph mmmpph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't understand you!\" Elizabeth whispered back. \"But I think I'm stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph mph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too? This is quite a predicament... What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answer verbally, Fuuka began struggling against Elizabeth's body, trying to extricate herself from the blonde woman. Elizabeth wasn't in a much better state that Fuuka, but was at least clear-headed enough to realize that Fuuka's behavior wasn't helping anything. She had to calm the other girl down, and fast. Otherwise, someone was bound to investigate the noises and bumping coming from the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Elizabeth quietly apologized to Fuuka and-</span></div></div>",

Perfect! Everything had gone exactly as she'd planned.

It stung, and she knew she was humiliating herself further by begging for someone to do <i>that</i> to her, but she herself didn't know what she was supposed to do, and her body was telling her in no uncertain terms that it positively needed something. The laughter reminded her that she still had her private parts on full display; Elizabeth had half a mind to cover them up with her hands. The effort was too much though, and they continued their confused wandering over her body. Whatever came next, Elizabeth realized with a pang of embarrassment, was going to happen in full sight of the whole class- a conclusion punctuated by the flash of a camera phone.

She felt more than a little bit conflicted about one of Minako's close friends approaching her right now, but mostly she felt grateful that Fuuka was going to end this for her when no one else would. Maybe there would even be a way to take care of her with some dignity... though probably not, Elizabeth thought with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka sauntered up to Elizabeth and knelt down next to her, relishing the power she had over the squirming girl. \"Thank you,\" Elizabeth whispered. \"Please, do it quickly! I m...must! Unh...\" Fuuka chuckled haughtily. One thing was for sure- whatever she was going to do, it wouldn't be quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth gasped as she felt Fuuka's touch on her skin. It was just a single finger, only making the slightest bit of contact. Gently, very gently, her finger started tracing little circles around Elizabeth's genitals, occasionally making a detour down then back up the inside of her thigh, but always avoiding touching her pussy directly. Fuuka delighted in the way Elizabeth arched her back and bit her lip in a mixture of frustration and arousal. The spell had been strong- she was positively dying for Fuuka to stop teasing her. She even tried to shift her hips around to make Fuuka's finger touch her pussy, but each time Fuuka's finger darted out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Elizabeth finally gasped. \"I-I can't... if you don't touch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch it?\" Fuuka asked slyly. \"Oh... you mean like this?\" More gently than ever before, Fuuka gave Elizabeth's protruding clitoris the tiniest prod with her finger. Elizabeth's whole body shuddered, and she moaned heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss! More... do that more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka gave another little prod. \"Yes? Like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's body gave another spasm, and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Fuuka pondered. </span></div></div>",

She resumed her previous pattern of tracing little circles around it with one of her fingers- it was clearly working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan of dismay came from Elizabeth. \"Nooo... please, you must stop! Your... your finger is making it worse!\" But Fuuka ignored her. Though the tracing was light, Elizabeth felt every bit of it, amplified by its proximity to her pussy. Around and around she felt it moving, so close that it felt as though it must be about to touch her pussy. The finger would never move any closer or farther away, though. Every moment she wished that Fuuka's finger would slide just a little bit this way or that way, maybe even by mistake, and every moment she was disappointed. Elizabeth could stand it no longer. \"N-nevermind... If you won't touch it, then I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down, anticipating a long-awaited relief. Her hand was intercepted before it could get there, though. Fuuka was holding it firmly and tutting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah. You asked for this, and now we're going to do it my way. And I think for interfering, I'm going to make you wait some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth gave an anguished moan. Her hand was almost there! She couldn't wait any longer, she was about to explode NOW! But waiting was exactly what she was forced to do. She was miserably horny, with no idea how far away the end of her ordeal might be, and every circle Fuuka's finger traced was more unbearable than the last. Meanwhile, Fuuka was in no hurry to put a stop to Elizabeth's denial. She was quite enjoying the challenge of getting her finger as close as possible without really touching, and Elizabeth's lustful reactions were endlessly amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, Fuuka knew she could still step things up a notch. She had some powerful magic at her disposal, and she was itching to use it. So Fuuka...</span></div></div>",

The jet blasted against Toriumi's chair, which carried the force into her, knocking her on her back and soaking her in the process.

She had her hands back! Tossing the chair off of herself, Toriumi took a second to take a few deep breaths.

After all, with her hands back, she could actually grab things and put on new clothing once she found it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one problem that Toriumi hadn't accounted for.

But, as Toriumi allowed herself to smile for a brief moment, she knew she no longer hand to worry about that. It would be a simple matter to push herself up to a standing position, with both of her hands unencumbered by things like clingy furniture. Taking a deep breath, she braced her legs to push herself up, giving herself slightly more modesty; she was still bottomless, with a fairly clear view of a tuft of brown hair, but at least she wasn't in a spread-eagle pratfall position anymore. Flexing her fingers slightly in celebration, Toriumi placed her palms squarely against the bathroom tile, and propelled herself to her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>sssssshriiiip</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SMACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, son of a-- what now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or at least, she tried to. Instead what happened was, after the initial thrust upwards, there was a tug from somewhere around her upper back. Apparently her jacket had caught on something; at least, the all too familiar sound of tearing fabric seemed to indicate so. Not enough to tear the fairly thick garment off, but enough to keep her from getting up, and enough to bring her bare butt smacking back onto the cold, wet bathroom tile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Toriumi muttered, \"sure. Let's tear everything off! Why don't I just march back in and teach class stark naked!\" Toriumi barked a short laugh, before lying back against the drain tired and defeated. <i>\"Maybe that'd get them to pay attention,\"</i> she mused, <i>\"a little full frontal!\"</i> Isako spent a few more seconds still on the tile, before sighing. She knew she had to try again; she couldn't let the frustration allow her to make things even worse. As much as it pained her, she might have to undo her jacket and slip out entirely. It might take a while, but maybe she could come back to it once she was on her feet. She could just brute force her way up, but her panties had already suffered from that method. Either way, the class period wouldn't last forever. Forget about grading quizzes-- anyone who stopped into the bathroom in that time was going to get an eyeful if she didn't move soon!</span></div></div>",

Someone was at the door, but who? Toriumi knew she hadn't made plans to have anybody over, and it was a bit late for a surprise visit. Then it dawned on her; pizza. She hadn't felt like cooking dinner and instead ordered out, and it must have just slipped her mind as she sat at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Toriumi called, standing up from her computer desk. \"Just give me a second to find my wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere in the world had she put it?! It wasn't on her desk, or the kitchen counter. She hadn't left it in her purse. The doorbell rang once more, this buzz a bit longer than the first. The deliver boy must have been getting impatient. Well, he'd just have to wait a second, assuming he wanted to get the money for her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" Toriumi said. Her wallet had managed to fall between the cabinet by her front door and the wall, forcing the woman to lie against the floor and grope blindly for it. After a few seconds of uncomfortable reaching, Toriumi felt her fingers close around the wallet, quickly pulling it back out and standing up. Money ready, Toriumi opened her door and greeted... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...? I know I wasn't imagining things.\" Toriumi mused. \"Ugh. Don't tell me he gave up already. Maybe if I run I can catch up to him before he leaves with my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would mean running after the delivery boy in her current state of dress. A shirt and panties was fine enough if she was just standing behind her own door, but it was a bit less acceptable for running out and into her apartment complex proper. The last thing the teacher needed was a curious neighbor peeking their head open and catching a glimpse of her underwear. A sudden gnaw of hunger reminded Toriumi that she <i>was</i> hungry and looking forward to that food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd just be a quick run. She could catch up, pay for her food, and get back into her apartment before anybody was any wiser. Stepping out and closing the door behind her, Toriumi quickly jogged for the front of the complex.

She wiped the sweat from her brow, the taste of 'liquid courage' in her mouth becoming sticky and stale in the sudden change of temperature. Worst of all was between her legs; the garment she was wearing was fine for an evening of sitting on her rear, but not so much for running down several flights of stairs. Add to that the heat and humidity, and the fact that the rear that Toriumi had planned to spend the evening sitting on was... somewhat smaller, at the time of the panties' purchase, and the result Toriumi was left with was a sweaty, uncomfortable, wedging sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All the more reason to get inside,</i> Toriumi thought, turning the door knob, and walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd bumping straight into the wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- Oh, of all the times to stick...\" The door had been finicky from the day Toriumi had moved in, but it had never outright locked.

It was reckless, completely irresponsible and potentially humiliating, but... the part of her mind calling for instant comfort was slowly winning favor.

Still, it was high enough that simply standing on tip-toes wasn't going to cut it. Well, Toriumi wasn't the sort of person to give up so easily! She'd get up to that window and back into her apartment without anyone even knowing she left the apartment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud scraping of the mostly-full trashcan as Toriumi pulled it over to the wall was not something she had considered in her plan to go undetected.

The cold of the sink against her chest was waking her up a little, a sharp contrast from the heat outside, heat still radiating against her ass as it hung outside her window. She took a deep breathe, anger welling up as the pain subsided. Tonight was a wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No food, no friend online...\" Toriumi propped herself up on her arms, preparing herself for a little more exertion, \"I had to run outside with no pants, I had to root around with a garbage can to get back in here. And what do I get for it?!\" Toriumi grunted as she tried pulling herself forward, to no avail. \"A bruised tailbone, and everything below it hanging out the window like a picture in a frame!\" She tried pushing herself upwards, but the window seemed locked into its position. Muttered curses and complaints grew louder and angrier as the trapped teacher swung her legs and strained her arms, just to get back into her own apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Isako: all her shouting and struggling accomplished was...</span></div></div>",

What's worse, her attempts caused her to shimmy her hips and swing her legs, the already precariously clinging undergarment sliding lower and lower the more she moved.

As she froze, terrified of lowering them any further, they finally fell off her foot, landing with a softly metallic thud onto the lid of the trashcan below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriumi stayed frozen, wincing as she heard the garment's unfortunate landing. At this point, she was more tired than anything, but the idea of anyone walking into the alley and seeing her made her fold her legs, feet positioned to hopefully block any hypothetical person's view. She was getting desperate now, desperate not to be seen and desperate to get out of her predicament and back into her apartment. She'd wasted too much time and now, too much cover, trying to do anything, and now she'd have to make a better effort to fix things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was no way her plan wouldn't be at least a little bit uncomfortable...</span></div></div>",

Twisting back and forth, she tried to pull herself through, only to make no progress.

It was a little grody, sure, but better than having them fall in. She wobbled slightly as she balanced one leg, then another to slip them on, still dazed a bit from her fall. As uncomfortable as they had been, and still were to some extent, Toriumi was happy to be wearing anything after her fall. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half of her shirt hung out from the window. Toriumi had no way to open it from down in the alley, and her sore backside was discouraging her from jumping for it again. Plus, the window had shut tight on her and kept her trapped- even with the soap (the soap that was currently soaking into the waistband of her underwear...) she had no doubt that her shirt was stuck until she could get the window open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, when all was said and done, left her with very few options. The door was locked, the window was stuck, she'd lost her shirt; all she had was a pair of panties, dish soap all down her back, and an arm clamped tight over a pair of pert breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright, Isako,\" Toriumi said to herself, \"maybe you can... wait for someone to come home, and slip in after them?\" Toriumi paused for a minute, before slumping against the brick wall of her apartment. \"Oh, who am I kidding? There's no good way out of this...\" She scrunched her face up, before lashing out and kicking the trashcan--- and devolved into cursing and hoping on one foot as she cradled the foot that she'd slammed into metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is someone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriumi froze. The sound of shifting trash and shrill swearing was hardly stealthy, and now someone at the entrance of the alleyway had heard her! She couldn't be found like this- she had to forget her pain and hesitance and figure something out, fast!</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In this story, you will guide the path of one of the female characters of Persona 3 as she experiences the most embarrassing day of her life. Through some series of events, the beauty in question finds herself stripped completely naked and far from safety and concealment. As her journey to restore her modesty and preserve her dignity goes on, you will decide just how successful she will be. Be as merciless as you please, with a few key exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic rules:<br>\r\nNO rape, gore, vore, scat, shrinking, growing, transformation, or the like.<br>\r\nAs with my other stories, if the lady in question finds some way to cover herself, it should be sacrificed or lost within a few chapters; their road is a long one, and it certainly won't be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief rundown of the ladies in question. (For an idea of how they look, do an image search of their name, you'll likely find plenty of suitable images.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari Takeba- Your typical high school girl. She's energetic, friendly, popular, and athletic. She's stubborn and headstrong, and this nature can cause her to not think her plans through all the way. As a member of the school archery team, she's got sharp eyes and steady nerves... most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru Kirijo- A living definition of excellence, Mitsuru has it all. President of the Student Council, heiress to a multinational corporation, top of her class, and the calm and collected mind of a CEO. While she exceeds in all these areas and more, she severely lacks in street smarts, and is fairly aloof about social matters that would be normal among people in her age group. As a symbol of lust and jealousy of many in the school, plenty of people have their eyes on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka Yamagishi- Timid and meek, Fuuka is about as opposite Mitsuru as one can get. Generally quiet, but very kind and gentle, Fuuka is no stranger to being picked on by other girls in her class. While she doesn't boast, she might be as sharp as Mitsuru, at least when it comes to electronics and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako Arisato- The female choice for the main character, her personality is largely the player's to mold. In general, she appears to possess a cheery attitude and is very good at making friends. The odds of anybody having a grudge against her are low; if she offends anybody, it's more than likely on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis- A humanoid robot, she is technically naked most of the time as it is. While she isn't a candidate to be stripped, she may find herself involved in the stories of one of the other girls, either aiding or hindering them, perhaps without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining choices, the female Social Links, are too numerous to fully list and explain here. That will be up to those who begin their chapters.</td>",
