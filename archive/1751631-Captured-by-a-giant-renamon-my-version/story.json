He is wise for his age and he did not like his parents fighting. Rather than waiting for them to stop fighting, he gathered his things from the foster home and left in the dead of night without telling anyone. He does not like fighting or arguing and peace was what he liked after going into a forest with a clear mind. He is very smart and a hard worker, but he cries in his sleep because his parents were stupid for fighting over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same forest as ryan was a fox who was watching him since he first entered the forest and she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is young, but determined to get the job done and wise for his age.\" she said looking at him<br>\r\n\"I wonder why he cries at night during the rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is able to change her size at will and have a human form as well, but she has not revealed her human form to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could use some place better than the forest and I can help him.\" she said as she decided to meet with the boy</span></div></div>",

They could only watch in horror and await whatever their captor would soon do to them. The giant cat bent down so that her massive face was only inches away from Renamon, and smiled cheerfully. She then extended her tongue and began to playfully lick Renamon's face. Renamon's fur was left a complete wreck. She then moved her head over to her other paw and did the same thing with Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had had her fun, the colossal cat released her captives. She then stood up on her hind legs and proceeded to shrink down to human size. When she had reached the same size as Renamon, she giggled cutely and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! My name's Gatomon! Nice to meetcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached out her paw to shake hands with Renamon. Both Ryan and Renamon were still shocked from all that had happened in such a short time, and simply stood there baffled.

I don't think that that's the issue here, Miss Gatomon. You just showed up out of nowhere, pinned us down, licked us like we were gonna be your dinner, and now you're offering us a handshake?! I'm sorry, but do you mind explaining what part of that is normal at all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon's smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that was just a little game... I didn't mean anything by it... Are you angry at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose if you didn't mean any harm to us, then I think that we can forgive you... Right Renamon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon reached out and grabbed Gatomon's paw to return her handshake. Smiling at her, she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I guess so... And besides, it's not like you did anything<i> too</i> serious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's cheerful smile then turned into a devious smirk.

Gatomon soon stood up, and rubbed her back to ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... Jeez Renamon, what the heck was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That</i> was for completely ruining my fur! It takes forever to get it all straightened out... But now that I've gotten that out of my system, you're forgiven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Well, thanks I guess... So, we're friends now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I don't see any reason not to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ryan chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Gatomon, are you gonna be living with us in Renamon's cave now or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's up to Renamon...

Instead of being a cat, the digimon that emerged was a beautiful female angel with 8 shimmering white wings, a long pink ribbon encircling her body, and a silver helmet covering the top half of her face.

She took aim at Renamon in this position: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs28/i/2008/057/a/e/AN08___Angewomon_Redo_by_tiikay.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs28/i/2008/0...</a> and fired at her. Renamon wasn't fast enough to avoid the arrow of light, and it struck her right in the chest. The arrow pierce through her and she fell to the ground. The arrow of light then vanished from the unconscious Renamon's chest without even leaving a wound. Angewomon slowly floated back down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan looked up at her beautiful form in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Miss Angewomon?

Looking back to Ryan, she spoke in a gentle feminine voice that was fitting of an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, kid... She'll be fine. She just needs a bit of rest is all. I'm quite impressed that a rookie level digimon was able to best my champion form though. This girl has quite some talent for battling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngewomon carried Renamon into the cave, and Ryan followed close behind her. She located a bed and laid Renamon down on it. Minutes later, Renamon awoke. Looking over at Angewomon with a smirk, she accepted her defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I suppose you win... You're free to stay here now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thank you Renamon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I must say, I'm impressed! I've never been defeated in battle before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed with you as well. You're only a rookie level digimon, but you overpowered my champion level form with such ease. Not to mention how quickly you recovered! You have quite a bit of talent, Renamon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I do train quite hard... Well, my home is now your home, so make yourself at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Angewomon! You're free to stay! So, are you going to change back to Gatomon now?\" Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous smirk spread across Angewomon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Does this form make you feel nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan begins to blush furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Ummm... Maybe just a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Oh Ryan, you are absolutely adorable! ____________.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think that I should turn back to Gatomon for now to recharge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then a flash of light as Angewomon reverted back to her earlier form. Being the size of a common cat again, she immediately used her powers to grow back to the same size as Renamon and Ryan. Ryan looked at her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just take a nap as Angewomon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ryan, it's not that simple. Staying in my digivolved form takes a lot of energy to maintain. I'm only able to hold it for about a day at most, but I usually prefer to change back before I run out of energy. That way I can still turn into Angewomon again in case there's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see... Well, now that you mention it, it is getting kinda late... I think that we should go to sleep soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree... I may not be drained from digivolving, but I still need to rest a bit more after that beating you gave me as Angewomon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you ever want a rematch, you know where to find me!\" Gatomon said with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever kid, you just caught me off guard is all. I didn't expect you to be able to digivolve, but now that I know what to expect, things won't go the same way next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon then walked off to her room of the cave in a huff. Gatomon giggled a bit before crawling off to her section as well. Ryan simply sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I don't need to worry about getting bored... There's never a dull moment with those two around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then repeated the other two and headed off to his room. It was the smallest room of the cave, mainly due to the fact that he didn't need any more room than that. He couldn't grow like the other two could, so for him, this room was more than enough to satisfy him.

The trio got up and walked to the entrance to be greeted by yet another digimon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one wasn't animal-like like Gaomon and Renamon. Instead she had the appearance of a mermaid, bar the fact that she had legs instead of a tail fin like most mermaids did. She had<span class=\"cteal\"> teal</span> colored skin, and had slightly <span class=\"cgreen\">darker teal</span> fins on the sides of both her head and her waist. She had a marking under her left eye that looked like long black eyelashes, and the tips of her bare feet were the same <span class=\"cgreen\">teal</span> shade as her fins. She wore a<span class=\"clblue\"> light blue</span> suit of 'armor' and a helmet with<span class=\"cblue\"> blue</span> trim around the edges, and red jewels were placed in the wrists, knees, and helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who can't imagine her, she looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th09.deviantart.net/fs48/PRE/i/2009/176/6/7/Legendary_Warrior_of_Water_by_Seigi_X_Paladin.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th09.deviantart.net/fs48/PRE/i/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio stared at this new fish-girl standing before them, she simply smiled and waved at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya! I'm Ranamon, and you must be Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed toward Ryan and winked as she said that. Ryan looked shocked, and the two digi-girls stepped in front of him in defensive stances,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know Ryan's name?!\" Renamon barked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what do you want with him?!\" Gatomon continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon just giggled and walked forward unintimidated. Renamon reacted swiftly and threw a punch at the mermaid digimon's face, but Ranamon's reflexes were just as sharp. She caught Renamon's fist in midair and grinned at her, she then lowered Renamon's fist back to her side. Ranamon the started wagging her finger at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh... Is that any way to treat the partner of your friend over there? I think that you girls should just cool off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers, Ranamon made a pair of rain clouds appear over the two digi-girl's heads before hitting them with a light drizzle. The duo was left with their fur soaked, and Ranamon couldn't help but giggle at them. Gatomon was about to lunge at Ranamon in anger when Renamon put her arm out to stop her. The dripping cat looked up at her with a very irritated expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives, Renamon?! Let me go and clobber that overconfident fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Gatomon! Aren't you at all interested in what she just said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! What did you mean by 'my partner'?\" Ryan chimed in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose you wouldn't know yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon then pulled out a small cellphone-like device on a necklace that was tucked into her 'armor'. She then took the necklace off and handed it to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your digivice. It will allow you to stay in contact with all three of us digimon here, as well as a few other functions that I'll get into later. From now on, I'll be living alongside you three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking the digivice back from Ryan, Ranamon held it in her hand and began her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, this digivice serves as a communicator. Like I said before, it will allow you to keep in contact with all three of us. It's synched to the data signatures of your partner digimon, so you can talk to any of us whenever you want no matter where you are. This is just the most basic function, though. There are a couple more useful functions built in as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon then pressed a red button below the screen on the device, and the display of a typical cellphone screen shifted to a high-tech display. It showered three images, one of each of the digigirls, and had a line with several arrows pointing off from from it in a branching pattern flowing out from each image. The arrows pointed to several silhouettes of various shapes and sizes, but one of Gatomon's arrows was pointing toward an image of Angewomon. Ranamon pointed at this image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second, and arguably most important, function of the digivice is to allow you to control the digivolutions of your partners at any given point. If any of us are able to digivolve, the silhouette of the form we can become will be filled in. After that, you just has to touch the image on the screen to trigger a digivolution. Here, try it out by making Gatomon into an angel again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon then tossed the cellphone device to Ryan, who caught it and pressed the image of Angewomon on the screen. The cocoon of light that appeared the first time she digivolved appeared again, but this time it was green instead of blue. When it faded away, Angewomon was back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! I'm Angewomon again! But... Something is weird... Why don't I feel tired at all?\" Usually I start to feel the strain of this form's power right after digivolving. But I feel as energetic as I do in Gatomon form...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because when you digivolve this way, your energy is amplified by the digivice's power. As such, you can stay in this form for much longer; you might as well say that this thing removes the time limit on your stronger forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Awesome! I love this form, but I never get to really enjoy it! Now I can stay like this as long as I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It's really more of 'as long as Ryan wants you to be in that form'. He's got the digivice, and he's the only one who an use it, so he can control what forms we're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan simply stared at Ranamon amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that I can change you any time I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. But I would highly suggest that you keep us in our standard forms under ordinary circumstances and refrain from using advanced forms for a long period of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! Why?!\" Angewomon complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, although it's incredibly rare, there have been cases where a digimon staying in their stronger forms longer than usual will lose control of their own bodies and go berserk. If you aren't used to maintaining that form for longer than a day, issues could occur if you suddenly use it for a full week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... So much for that idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Angewomon! As long as you build up your stamina in that form, you'll eventually be able to manage it for extended periods of time just as safely as your Gatomon form! Just be sure to take it slow, and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! So if I just take it an hour at a time, I'll be able to stay like this for months on end eventually?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! It will take a lot of work to get to that point, but if you're dedicated enough to do it, then it's possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurray! I can't wait to get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon smiled and placed her hand on Angewomon's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold you horses, girl! I still haven't explained the final function yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... Sorry... Please go ahead then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, as I'm sure you know, the digital world and this world are separate dimensions. The final function of a digivice is to open a portal between these two dimensions. This way, you can travel from one world to the other at will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... This thing seems really amazing for something so small...\" Ryan said as he stared at the small cellphone-like device in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! So, what do you wanna do now Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan thought about this for a bit before deciding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing Ryan's response, Ranamon simply giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ryan, you aren't <i>required</i> to enter the tournament if you don't want to... But you have no idea how huge an honor it is to be selected for this! Only 32 kids worldwide are chosen to become digimon tamers and enter! You were selected because there's something special about you, Ryan. You could potentially be one of the greatest digimon tamers in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan stared at Ranamon in shock. Renamon and Gatomon were equally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that? How do you know that Ryan is special? How does he have this potential?\" Renamon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, Renamon, both of his parents had significant interaction with digimon before he was born. Ryan's parents both became very close to one particular digimon; they became friends with you, Renamon. As such, digimon taming is in his genes. And it looks like the fate of his parents has lead <i>him</i> to you as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon was getting suspicious of the new 'guest'. She lunged at Ranamon and held her razor sharp claw right under the mermaid's neck. Ranamon was unfazed, and simply stared the cat digimon in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone here sure is feisty. Is there something that you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I want to know how you know so much about Ryan! Where do you get your information?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not the one who gathered the information. My superiors gave me a complete file on his history, as well as his family background and anything else that would be helpful. I honestly don't know where they get their information, but I've been assigned to serve as Ryan's partner should he accept the invitation to the tournament. I guarantee you that I have no ill intention in coming here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon lowered her claw and backed off, feeling more or less satisfied with the mermaid's answer. Being an angelic digimon, she was able to sense when someone was lying. Ranamon was telling her the truth, so there was no reason to be suspicious for now. Just then, Ryan spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, Ranamon. I've already got Renamon and Gatomon... Why would they send you to be my partner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's actually quite simple. The tournament is in a 3 on 3 format, with each tamer pitting their team against their opponent's. For tamers who don't have enough digimon to satisfy this condition, the hosts of the tournament will provide an additional partner to the participants. It's held in a bracket style, so if you can defeat six opponents and come out on top, you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean that you'll be leaving me after the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. My superiors are quite generous. Since many digimon would have become friends with their human partners, they will be allowed the choice of staying with them after the battles are over or returning to the organization again. It really doesn't make sense to tear up a friendship after it's already formed, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no... I guess not... I have one more question, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? If it's rather or not I intend to stay with you, I will. I've honestly been interested in you ever sense I read your file, and I'd love to get to know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ranamon, but I was really just wondering if you were able to change size like these two can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? Well of course I can! That's actually a pretty common ability among us digimon. It's just a simple matter of reconfiguring the data that makes up our bodies into a larger file size. In theory, we could also shrink with the same method, but why would anyone want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone has their own preferences I guess. I personally like the size I'm at just fine, but to each their own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... So Ryan, what's your decision? Will you and your friends here come with me and enter the Digiworld Grand Championship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me. They're the ones who'll have to be fighting in this thing. What do you think girls? Do you wanna enter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and Gatomn looked at each other and thought about the offer for a minute before nodding in agreement. They then responded in unison:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought we were going to enter the tournament!\" Gatomon said anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, didn't Ranamon say it was held in the digital world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,<i> and</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck do we even <i>get</i> to the digital world?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Ranamon needs to explain this before we can go anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them looked at their new partner in anticipation. Ranamon simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy one, Ryan. All you have to do is hit the center button on your digivice and it'll open a portal for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was surprised that the tiny cellphone device he held was able to do such a thing, but he listened to Ranamon and pressed the button. In an instant, Ryan and the others saw a massive blue vortex appear before them. Ranamon simply giggled and jumped into it. The others stared at it for a moment before Gatomon stepped toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on guys! Last one in is a rotten sardine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energetic cat then lept through the portal just as Ranamon had. Renamon simply sighed before growing to 15 feet tall. She then picked up Ryan and prepared to enter the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ryan, we can be rotten sardines together...\" she joked before jumping in after the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew through a blue tunnel for several minutes, and Renamon shrank back to normal as they waited to reach their destination. When the four friends emerged from the portal, they looked around in confusion. They were all expecting to wind up in some futuristic city, but instead they were in the middle of a jungle! All eyes quickly turned to Ranamon once again. She simply looked at them confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we in a jungle?! Aren't we supposed to be in the tournament zone?!\" Gatomon said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know what went wrong! Ryan, let me see your digivice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan handed her the device, and after taking a moment to examine the screen, Ranamon let out a groan before facepalming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stupid superiors set your digivice to the wrong destination code! The point where we enter the digital world is<i> supposed </i>to be Cyber City, the central hub of the digital world's society. But<i> this thing</i> is set to send us to the Wi-fi Jungle! We're at least a full 2 day's worth of walking away from the tournament site!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" all three of them said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And to make matters worse, the tournament is only 3 days away! We <i>should</i> have been able to use that time to get some training in at the tournament preparation facility, but now we're gonna be using it just to get to the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon plopped down on her rear and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is just great! How do we get there <i>now</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one thing to do, Gatomon. We've got to start walking.\" Renamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, come on! There <i>has</i> to be a better way!

They were walking around in the same jungle that Ryan and his Digimon were in. This man was a laid back and calm. He was 21 years old and had an calm demeanor. He had three loyal Digimon that were traveling with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilamon: who is possibly his most loyal to him. He calls her Susana, as she reminds him of a sweetheart back in the human world. Susana and Nate had met two years ago, and as far as he could remember, she has helped him through thick and thin since he discovered the new world. Their relationship has been built on a bond forged on trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcomon and Gaomon are Nate's other companions, who he met a year ago. They both are considered to have a brotherly like relationship with their tamer. Falcomon acts of a wisdom brother who reminds the group to stick together and not to get too high or low on themselves. He keeps the group tight-knit and together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Gaomon, he keeps the groups sprits up by fighting or simply cheering them on. He is considered to be the engine that roars, if he isn't fighting the good fight, he will be a force in most situations. Gaomon is basically the will of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to test our skills.\" Nate said, as he sat up. \"We're going to enter the tournament. I think our experiences will allow us to surprise a few people.\" Nate then was drinking from a water canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not.\" Falcomon said. \"You're right Nathan. I believe we all have a shot to win over some people, and maybe the whole thing. I believe that we'll do our best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Gaomon pitched in. \"Look for us to own the competition! We're the best team there is! No one can stop us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down you two.\" Susana said. \"We're there to have fun. Besides, this can go a long way in our development. Although, you two must be able to reach your mega levels soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then stood up. He looked at his digivice and looked at Falcomon. He gave him a slight nod and went ahead and evolved Falcomon into Peckmon. Peckmon looked around and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we head to the arena then.\" Peckmon said. \"I'm sure my jumps should be able to launch us into the arena. And plenty of space on my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Nate said. \"I'm sure we'll run into someone who might want to hitch a ride with us to the tournament. Susana, Gaomon, let's roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group started to travel through the jungle. Gaomon and Susana rested, while Nate was still awake. He was prepared for this tournament; even if he didn't win, he was looking forward to the challenge for battling new opponents. He continued to drink from his canteen. 'This is like a second family. These guys are more than just creatures, but my friends. Susana, you've always been there for me even in my darkest moments. You remind me of <i><b>her.</b></i> Ever since she went missing, my heart has been heavy, but you fill me with hope that I will find her again. Thanks Susana. You're like a sister to me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate!\" Peckmon said. \"I see a boy and three digimon ahead, you think they need help getting to the tourney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a feeling. Let's get to them and ask if they need help getting there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've lost someone dear to me. Someone special. A sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to be since I was living in the forest when Renamon came to see me. My parents both met her so I had to find her and see about finding my real parents. I had to run from foster parents, i couldn't stand it there and they were trying to send people after me so they can bring me 'home'.\" Ryan explained. \"Renamon is like family to me and Gatomon with Ranamon might be apart of it soon enough.\" he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded. \"That's good to hear. Life can deal us a cruel hand at times. I'm glad you could find digimon that can act like a family to you. My team over there is like a second family to me as well. Susana, Gaomon and Falcomon are my digital family you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to find the people we are looking for together?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we could work together well.\" Nate said. \"Hopefully they are in one piece.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad wouldn't let them get hurt. he is a fighter and a protector.\" Ryan said confident in his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father sounds like a good man.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He cares for mom, my aunt, Renamon and some other people.\" Ryan said nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we get going then?\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that dad had a dark side of himself and a strange power of an armored animal.\" Ryan said before nodding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I need to see about my team's teamwork.\" he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl I'm looking for, her dad died while doing research here in the digital world. He had a lot of passion for the study for Digimon. She shares his passion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she could be my sister figure?\" Ryan asked. \"She sounds like fun.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded. \"I'm sure she can. She's a lot of fun to be around. Very bubbly personality. It's been five years since I've seen her. But I'm sure she still has her lovely charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be my brother.\" Ryan said smiling at the thought of having more of a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had a slight smile. \"Well, it'd be nice to have a brother away from home that's human as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask about your family and parents?\" Ryan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my mother is back home in our world. She's been a huge part of my life and has played the role of shaping myself as a person. My father sadly died before I could meet him. He was a police officer and was gunned down by thugs. So I grew up with out a father figure, so I'm learning how to become a man on my own. I'm an only child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to do my family proud. After I graduated High School, I moved to an apartment not too far from my mother so I can watch over her at times, while living on my own. My sweetheart inspired me to forge a relationship between Digimon and Humans. I hope to find her and accomplish our mission together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan gave Nate a brotherly hug before patting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help after I find my real parents.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Bud.\" Nate said. \"I appreciate the kindness. And that would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get going.\" Ryan said before walking to Peckmon and jumping on between Renamon and Ranamon with Gatomon in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ok, ryan?\" Renamon asked looking at him seeing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, just getting a new friend and brother.\" Ryan said and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother? You look nothing alike.\" Gatomon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brother figure.\" Ranamon said smiling before hugging Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon hugged Ryan as well and Gatomon did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brother figure.\" Ranamon said smiling before hugging ryan as Renamon hugged ryan as well and gatomon did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate walked over to Peckmon. \"He's a good kid.

I also plan to push my plan to involve others in the assistance of bridging the Human-Digimon relations.

They are entering the Tournament as well.\" Nate said, and then drinking from his canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Gaomon said. \"Really? Well. I guess it's fine. I mean, who knows, maybe we'll face them in the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid seems to be wise for his age.\" Susana said. \"Any reason for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been though a lot; a lot no kid his age should encounter.\" Nate said. \"But he's strong, and pure. Not sure I know much more beyond that. But you two must treat him like he's apart of the gang. I know you guys will welcome him with open arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" The two digimon said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded, and looked back at Ryan as he was conversing with his Digimon. He noticed the family like feeling that Ryan and his Digimon were sharing. Ryan looked very happy and at home with them and Nate could tell. He felt as if the kid and him could both reach and succeed their goals. Who knew, maybe their lost ones were together. Nate then had a brief vision of <i><b>her</b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick scene of him and her looking at her computer screen, and him learning about his first Digimon, Augmon. He remembered how she described it to him and that's when he first become interested in Digimon. Her calm green eyes and her dirty blonde hair made Nate feel very peaceful, and he felt that he was in utter bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Peckmon cried out. \"Brace yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate snapped back to reality and turned around. \"Everyone, grab hold of Peckmon and don't let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeckmon dashed and went for a long jump, soaring though the air in a long distance. The arena was not too far, as Peckmon and the crew landed inside the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone alright?\" Nate said, calmly drinking his canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries.\" Ryan said. \"We're fine over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Nate said. \"You all ready to get this started? It's going to be a fun time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew hopped down from Peckmon, and Peckmon reverted back to Falcomon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work getting us here,\" Nate said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Nate, it was my pleasure.\" Falcomon replied, high fiving his tamer.</span></div></div>",

There are barracks for the contestants, training fields, a pool, a game room, and a fully equip gym. The lobby is the first room when they walked in and there is a registration desk. Both teams walked up to the desk to see the secretary on the phone talking with someone and she told them that they have to wait a moment. They were waiting for the secretary to get off the phone. Renamon put Ryan on her shoulder so he could see the secretary. After a moment, the secretary put the phone back on the hook. Nate looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Competition will be interesting' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you registering for the tournament?\" the secretary asked Nate not seeing Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all of them on your team?\" she asked still not looking at Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I only have three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did my favorite nephew come by for the tournament?\" asked a certain general with peppered red raid walking over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him.\" the secretary said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here.\" Ryan said scaring the secretary and getting a laugh from the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done a good job, Ranamon.\" the general said and said digimon nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate watched. \"I'm guessing you two know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan looked at him and nodded. Nate nodded and started to drink from his canteen once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the owner of the diner in my town when dad was working there and I think mom did two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't related by blood, but I call her my aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded once again. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General, Ryan was given the wrong destination code and ended up in the Wi-Fi Jungle.\" Ranamon said and Ryan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me. I'm going to see about getting him the right code before the end of the tournament.\" she said before giving Ryan a hug and peck on the cheek. She looked at renamon before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would be proud of you watching him.\" she said to her before walking away to deal with the issue ranamon gave her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which digimon are on your teams?\" the secretary asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaomon, Falcomon and Susana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" Susana cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this Susana is what type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lalamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon, Gatomon, Ranamon are mine.\" Ryan said and the secretary nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see your digivices and they will get you registered.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate handed his Digivice to the Secretary. Ryan did the same still slightly confused by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Have to get ranamon to explain it to me.~ ryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put them in the machine before a ding went off and they were done. (same method of ash in pok\u00e9mon getting registered)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another renamon, you kid need to watch out for the team that has two renamon and a wizardmon.\" she warned him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate took his Digivice. \"Almost show time guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan narrowed his eyes. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the tamer was going to come the person that has the last renamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason why?\" Nate said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tamer wants to be the next kain who was able to become a renamon since his team was all renamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan started to growl. Nate noticed the reaction by Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can be like my father.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tamer sounds like an ass.\" gatomon said before she was bopped on the head by renamon for her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon took ryan and lead him to the barracks. Renamon noticed something and saw a faint shadow of an armored dragon or tiger over ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hopefully the berserker side doesn't come out.~ she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think if a tamer had other motives, you guys would look into that situation.\" Nate said as he walked away with his Digimon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary told renamon and gatomon something else before they caught up to nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be sharing the same room.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded. \"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I  know those two renamon and the wizardmon, then they are my sisters and gatomon's old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planning on catching up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know each other, wouldn't you want to catch up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sight problem with that.\" the voice of the general came form of her leaning on a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the tamer sees ryan with the renamon, then he will target him for sure, but ryan isn't ready yet for a full battle and he is like his father.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure he isn\u2019t endangering lives here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he is, then ryan will stop him if he has to tap into the power that his father gave him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned away. \"Well. I'm not saying you guys aren't doing your job. But you should be careful on letting things escalate that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she means.\" Renamon had a flashback to when kain was fighting a myotismon in his armored form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kain was in a life and death situation or was knocked so hard that the berserker side came out to fight back my sister argent.\" renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing that to ryan will either bring the armored form or the berserker side out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate cracked his knuckles and looked at the sky. \"Well. Looks like it will be a grand event either way. Despite the circumstances...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be an exhibition match before the first round after the three days are up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded. \"Anything else we should know before we take our leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three missing people are together in hiding after the third one vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a hidden rule when three different types of the same digimon are on two different teams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate clinched his fist. \"Alright then....Gaomon and Falcomon. You head to the room with Ryan's crew. Susana. You're coming with me. Any last words about the tournament or anything should be aware of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I know anything more, I\u2019ll let ryan know or send you a message on your digivice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan will need some help with training and learning how to use a three digimon team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help him like I did with kain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm General Salen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded once more. \"General Salen, Name's Nate. I'm sure we\u2019ll talk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you and your team to watch over ryan like renamon the other two on his team are doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He traveled with us and sees us as his second family. And especially at a time like this; he'll need a mentor, someone he can look to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So rest your head, General. You won't lose sleep. I will look out for the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded offering a rare smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep trying to find those three for you and the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned to the General. \"Much appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked at Susana then back at the rest of the group. \"We'll return.\" The two walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general nodded before walking back to her office trying to find the kid's parents and new sister for his brother. The four digimon went to the room ranamon and ryan were in.</span></div></div>",

Nate refilled his canteen with water and had Susana purify the water. He then started to do a mini workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind Nate?\" Susana said. \"Although you seem to do this when somethings on your mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was doing some push-ups on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Nate said. \"You know me. I need sometime to think about things right now. Most importantly, the fact that we may be able to find <i><b>her</b></i> is my key goal.\" He then sat up and rested for ten seconds, drinking some of his water and then jumping and doing high knees. \"I will find her. It's been too long. For her mother, it'd mean the world, and I made a promise to find her, even if she isn't alive. The best I can do is to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you too love each other so much.\" Susana said. \"You seem like you've always done what you can for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded, and went into his bag and revealed his staff, which was shown to extendable to a long length. Then he went in between two sets of trees and stuck his staff in the middle to use as a pull up bar. He then got some wrap to tie around his palms, and grabbed on to the staff and continued to workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too are like her, my friend. Kind and Sweet. Before I met Falcomon and Gaomon, you protected me and walked me through the Digital World. You're my first friend here, and every time I'm here you make me feel like I'm apart of the place. For that your friendship in invaluable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then flipped over and then used his legs to pull up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for the most part, I'm fine. Just working out eases my mind and body. And you know how I am about my workouts. If not back in the human world, then it must be done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then pulled himself back down to the ground. \"If there's trouble to be had at this tournament, be ready. I know we're all here for fun and competition, but I'm concerned about Ryan. He seems to have a power that can possibly be dangerous, and if this tamer tries anything; we wait until the time is right to intervene. Gaomon will be a bit antsy, as usual, but you and Falcomon know to wait. I just want everything to go smoothly as possible. But in the event it doesn't, be ready. The kid is important. His family situation is a tough one; and I want to give him some stability in his life. A kid his age should be carefree and not stressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate used his canteen to get some water on his face to get rid of sweat and wrote in a small notepad to track his reps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be sore in the morning.\" Susana said. \"And we don't need you to be hampered by anything when it's time for the real thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like Falcomon, Susana.\" Nate slightly laughed. \"I'll be fine. If the room we're staying has showers, then I'm taking two. It won't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had mostly a lean built figure, about 6'1. Has toned arms mostly, but all round fit body. His hair was a low cut, black. He had facial hair, goatee. Nate then proceeded to put on a shirt over his muscle tee he was training in, wearing sweats as well. He also put on a red cap his father used to wear when they went to watch their favorite football team. Nate looked at the sky, and had all his things packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun is setting. I think we've spent enough time here for now.\" Nate said, pulling the bag over his shoulder. \"Let's head back.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad. Where.....are.......you?\" He said in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaomon looked over. \"He's having a bad dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me.\" He said more in his sleep before renamon picked them up and laid Ryan on top of her with gatomon on her keeping him sandwiched between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay ryan. We'll find them.\" Renamon said in his ear. The shaking almost stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaomon if you want to rest, then don't wait up on me.\" Falcomon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Ryan fights the tamer, it will be one of his honor and no one can help him.\" Renamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon moved over so ranamon could be with them calming Ryan down from the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Falcomon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaomon was already sleeping on a bed.

I know you four will care for him like I do as a family.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be things Ryan has to do on his own, but he will know that we will be there to help him.\" She added before drifting to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nate knocked on the door of the room and Falcomon let him and Susana in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back.\" Susana said quietly, assuming everyone was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate looked around. \"Everyone seems to be resting. Any news Falcomon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan's Renamon is counting on us. It seems like it\u2019s important to everyone we've talked to today to protect Ryan.\" Falcomon said. \"It's best we try to assist him and treat him as family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded and then sat his bag down. \"You guys get some rest. I'm going to sleep in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best be careful Nate.\" Falcomon said. \"We're in here if you need us. But rest well and see you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusana went into her own bed, as well as Falcomon. As for Nate, he decided to climb up to the roof of the room building. He lay down on his back and looked at the moon in deep thought. 'I'll be seeing you soon. Just hold on for me. Hold on for your mom. Hold on for us.' Nate then shut his eyes. 'Just hold on and we're going home...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Ryan bolted up breathing hard looking around already know his partners are trying to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird dream turned almost a nightmare.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" renamon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something, but Nate has to be here.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is on the roof.\" renamon said sensing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcomon also awakened. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw something in my dream and someone needs to get him.\" Ryan said calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. One moment.\" Falcomon went to get Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon walked over to Susana and gaomon to wake them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcomon came over to Nate who was silently sleeping on the roof. \"Nate....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Falcomon?\" Nate said his eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're needed.\" Falcomon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate stood up and slid down the roof. Falcomon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There a problem?\" Nate looked around. \"Everyone's awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a weird dream that turned to an almost nightmare.\" Ryan said sitting on gatomon's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw something there.\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, and your sweetheart\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate eyes widened. \"Your mom and dad, I understand, I'm not sure how'd you see her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then turned away from the group. \"That's just impossible. She's been missing for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They saved her from a digimon and went into hiding. She knows that you are looking for her and will do the best she can for you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Nate said, still turned away. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are either in the real world or here in the digital world. I do not know yet.

I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I never had dreams like that before I meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange.\" Nate said. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan let go before walking back to his bed and gatomon put him on renamon before getting on top of him while ranamon gets the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can go back to sleep yet\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time.\" Nate said. \"Everyone sleeps differently for many reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something else was weird and it came from dad.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Berserker side.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was about being able to be renamon like he was and he knows that I can beat that tamer that has renamon's sister and gatomon's old friend.\" he explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon, wolf, and tiger.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of those was dad's armored beast form\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more about your family. You guys seem to be different than the normal human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan chuckled. \"Mom is the only real normal human in the family and her parents hated my dad. I don't know why, but they seemed to love me despite being his son.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted to raise me for them, but didn't get the chance because of my foster parents and I couldn't let them get in trouble for me so I went straight for the forest I know renamon lived and tried to find her.\" he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Nate said, leaning his back against the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad had a dream about renamon and mom she had a different meeting with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed the family house is always tied to renamon no matter who lives there and I was living there before they left. so in a way I was bound to see renamon in a matter of time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are close.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon is like a second mother to me and ranamon is like an aunt, but gatomon is alike a sister.\" he said getting smiles from his team and they hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty cool.\" Nate smiled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt salen is in charge of the house while I\u2019m away looking for my parents and those fosters can't do anything with me with them.\" ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to show how much my team means to me, but I don't know how.\" ryan said finally getting sleepy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a kiss from his team on his forehead and cheeks before passing out to dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.\" Susana said. \"Cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded. \"He'll learn how to show his appreciation for you guys. He has a lot of heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might show up as we in our giant forms, but ranamon might need some convincing.\" renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. If that's how he wants to show it, so be it.\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susana, can you grow like us?\" renamon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Susana replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try tomorrow when ryan is training with us and Nate.\" gatomon said before they went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Susana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were quiet and peaceful in the room. Nate left the room and returned to the roof to rest. Ryan kissed gatomon on the cheek and the same on his other two team members in his sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate had woken up, the sun beaming on his face, and hopped down from the roof. He had a rested well and was thinking about his sweetheart. '<i><b>Samantha</b></i>...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was also concerned with the fact that there might be trouble as him and his partners was only here to have fun. Although he could handle himself, he didn't want to have to deal with any mess. Nate quietly opened the door to the room that he and the others were sharing. Everyone seemed to be asleep. Nate went into the shower, and finally cleaned up the stink that was on him. He grabbed his Digivice and his bag, leaving right out. He was dressed in jeans, tied a bandana around his forehead, and wore a muscle tee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate eventually found himself in the main center of the tournament site. Being hungry, he decided to sit outside of the tournament center and eat his food he had packed for himself, which consisted of a few peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, some granola bars, with his canteen having water inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far from where Nate was sitting, there were three tamers, and apparently they weren't having a civil conversation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back!\" A girl cried. \"I need that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what, besides, we've seen your Digimon and they look weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you don't need your Digivice, so along little girl, you're really just a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate quickly packed his things and ran over to the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" Nate said. \"There a problem going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, those two jerks took my Digivice and are playing catch with it!\" The girl cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys looked up and down at Nate, almost like they were scouting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you guys better give the girl her Digivice back.\" Nate said. \"She looks like she did nothing to you, and you guys seem like punks; preying on the weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you going to do it?\" One of the boys said, him wearing a cap backwards. \"We took it because she doesn't have a chance in this tournament. Her Digimon are weak, like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the other boy, who had glasses, and jet black hair was holding the Digivice. \"We're doing her a favor, so back off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate cracked his knuckles and sighed. \"I guarantee, you guys will regret this, keep it up. It doesn't matter that her Digimon are weak. Maybe she'd be able to do the impossible and win the whole thing. Anything could happen. So I'm going to tell you guys again... Give her her Digivice back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate quickly jumped at the boy with glasses, and punched him in stomach, after that he followed it up to a roundhouse kick to the face. The other boy went for a strike, but Nate leaned out the way and grabbed his arm, then using his free arm to elbow him in the face, knocking that boy out. The boy in the glasses was trying to make a run for it, but Nate caught him and started to apply a triangle hold on the boy's right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the Digivice, unless you want a broken arm.\" Nate said, applying more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Ok!\" The boy said, letting go of the girl's Digivice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate then proceeded to knock the other boy out, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Nate said, getting the Digivice and handing it to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" the girl said, \"My name is Lori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how old are you Nate?\" Lori asked. \"Showed some awesome skills out there! I'm 16, and I've been a tamer for two years now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 19.\" Nate said. \"Brazilian Ju-Justu. I've been practicing it for three years. You going to be ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lori said, appreciative of Nate's actions. \"I'll see you around Nate!\" Lori ran back to the tournament site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate waved Lori off, and then noticed General Salen coming to investigate the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate?\" General said. \"What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two boys tried to steal that girl's Digivice.\" Nate said, starting to walk back to his personal training spot near the creek. \"I took care of the problem. I'm sure you guys will be able to ask them why they got knocked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate continued to walk off, while Salen looked puzzled and started to call for a team to retrieve the two boys. </span></div></div>",

Zack seemed to think for a while, he looked up at Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir and seemed to get an idea. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have and idea, but you might not like it.\" He said to Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it?\" Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir asked,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could go inside you and stop whatever is hurting you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What!? But that's- Argh!\" Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir was cut off by more pain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your psychic powers can protect me, don't worry I'll be fine.\" Zack argued,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, just be careful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey I'll go with you!\" Ryan said as he jumped next to Zack,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ryan absolutely not!\" Renamon said,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Renamon, come on. I'm sure he would help if you were the one hurting. I want to help.\" Ryan countered,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, but I'm going with you.\" Renamon said as she shrunk to the same size as Ryan and Zack.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What about me?\" Gatomon asked,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You stay out here and make sure nothing happens to Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir.\" Ryan said,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, well everyone get on my hand.\" Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir said as she lowered her hand. Ryan, Zack, and Renamon all climbed on and Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir lifted them up to her mouth. She then stuck her tongue out onto her hand and the group walked onto it. Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir then retracted it back into her mouth. The group for some reason had no problem seeing, they guessed it was because of Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir's psychic powers aiding them. Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir then tilted her head back and swallowed gently. The three friends slid down her throat and landed in her stomach with a plop. The walls all around were pulsing and Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir's heartbeat could be heard throughout the chamber.</span></div></div>",

Ryan was just able to jump out of the way and he pulled out his swords. Ryan charged forward, dogging through fields of tentacles as he went towards the creature.

Ryan fell down and landed on the squishy floor. All around him were giant villi that were sucking up nutrients. Suddenly, one of the tendrals grabbed him and he was sucked into Renamon's blood stream. Inside, there were red blood cells flying by and Ryan jumped up and grabbed a hold of one of them. Ryan held on tight as the cell continued along its path. Up ahead he heard an ominously familiar sound almost like.. \"The heart.\" Ryan said as he looked ahead and saw a massive open chamber. The cell flew inside and the pressure inside began to build. Ryan held on to the cell for dear life and was launched forward at such extreme speeds that he blacked out. When he awoke he was surrounded by wrinkled pink tissue. He stood up and looked around, he was inside Renamon's brain. He then saw something strange, a strange man in a white cloak was holding up his hands and absorbing some kind of strength from Renamon's brain. \"Hey you! What do you think you're doing?\" Ryan yelled as he pulled out the two pistols.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well if it isn't the little goody two shoes Ryan. I've been expecting you.\" he said as he drew out a massive two handed sword. \"I should've known that the parasite wouldn't be enough to stop you. I guess if you want something done, you do it yourself.\" he said as he charged Ryan. Ryan began firing multiple shots at the mysterious man who simply blocked them. Ryan put away the pistols away and pulled out the swords. He blocked the man's attacks but he was beginning to get pushed back. Soon the man knocked him to the floor and pointed his sword at him. \"Give up, Renamon's strength shall fuel my powers for another million years. Once I'm done with her I will dispose of what's left!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No!\" Ryan cried as he jumped forward and delivered a flury of attacks.

He walked around her brain thinking and he found something that looks like a control panel. There is a hologram of her and he was studying the panel before he did something he would regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Looks like I can change how her body looks with this panel.~ he thought and he noticed a book next to the panel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to read the book as she continued to grow and her head is out of the cave so next is her chest and stomach. The book was on how to change her body as he could see it, but the first he did was slowing her growth speed so he has more time to read the book. It explains how to slow her growth down to a reasonable speed while she is sleeping and he set it at 5 feet per minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe I can show her how beautiful she looks in my eyes.~ he thought reading more of the book<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can change anything about her, but he was only thinking on making her look more beautiful after she stops grows or he can stop her grow before she is too big to fit into her cave. Speaking of that, her chest was in the mouth of the cave and it passed through without a hitch or pressing against the rock in the rock mouth. He left the book open on the page he was reading about how to make her chest bigger, but he never had a perverted thought about her since he is a gentleman despite being raised by an idiot drunk foster father and the mother watched until she got too busy. He touched her chest on the hologram and he turned the hologram to see on her side. He kept them soft and firm before lowering the sensitivity so it won\u2019t be easy for her to moan, but he increased the softness so they would feel like pillows and increased the firmness a little. He noticed that there slider bars and he adjusted the slider bars so the hologram had perfect round \u201cpillows\u201d by following the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hopefully she could understand why I did this and not have to make me do the default settings.~ he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~She may think I\u2019m one of those idiot perverts.~ he thought as an after thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe widen the hologram chest by a foot before adjusting the center slider bar to increase the size of her chest and the book explains the size of the chest is in letters; meaning a is the smallest and it gets bigger with each letter size. Her tail passed the mouth of the cave so her butt will soon follow her tail and that just leaves her legs and feet. There was a small shift and he looked around to see what caused it. It seems that her hips are a little too big and got stuck in the mouth of the cave. He looked at the growth speed and he slowed it down to a foot per minute and hoped her hips could get unstuck without him shrinking them down. Some time passed and there was another small shift before he knew that she is not stuck so he went to resume the growth speed to 5 feet per minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~The slider says that her size is a D and I know she can make them look even bigger in her giant form, but-~ he thought as her legs were about half way out of the cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the slider for her size and moved it to the right towards E, F, and G sizes as the hologram showed the chest getting bigger. He noticed that he can give her an hourglass figure and he linked the chest and butt of the hologram before settling it on I. The rest of her legs and feet are out of the cave so she can finish her growth spurt without destroying their home. He finished reading the book seeing that she could ask him to change her figure to something that she would rather have instead of having an hourglass figure. He turned the dial that controls her fur hiding her chest to where it\u2019s covering all of her chest and he pushed the button to make the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRenamon, I\u2019m doing this for you so you can see how beautiful you\u2019re to me.\u201d Ryan said as the changes started to happen as she continue to grow to her full height<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she finished growing to her full height on her side, but he thought that she might not want to be that tall. He brought her size down to half of her full height and looked to see if she could change her body on her own or not in the book, but he decided to wait for her to wake up and see her new body.</span></div></div>",

It was soft like a giant pillow and he remember that he made them that soft and lowered the sensitivity so renamon wouldn\u2019t moan. He started his trek up the mountain and he might could use the fur trees to help him climb up the mountain. It took another hour for him to get near the top and it was a bit unstable, but his idea of using the fur trees was a good idea. Soon he made it to the top and his feet were sinking into the ground a little, but he jumped up and laid down catching his breath. He felt the ground form around him as he was sinking into the ground. After he finished resting, he stood up and looked to see the rest of the yellow wood forest. He turned to see the real forest that he has been living in only coming up to the top of her chest since she is laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis view is amazing.\u201d Ryan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not talking about me?\u201d she joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing too.\u201d He said and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a hand and gently pushed him, which caused him to stumble; he jumped to stop stumbling, but he fell back and off the mountain. She felt him hit the other mountain and bounce off that one. Basically, he bounced between the two mountains until he reached the valley between them and then she pressed the mountains together to trap him inside the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun.\u201d He said smiling from the ride<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to shrink down to her former giant size and pulled him out so he could see that they were heading back to the cave.</span></div></div>",

She then grew to her giant form, picked up the two of them, and walked into her cave with Ryan following close behind. Renamon set the two of them down on her massive bed. \"How long do you think it will take them to wake up?\" Renamon asked. Her question was soon answered when the Gard\u00c3\u00a8voir began to stir.

After she was in her giant form, she looked down at him with a kind smile and he smiled back before deciding to run up her leg and vanished again; but reappearing on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were her.\u201d Ryan said sitting close to the base of her neck and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see me when you were at the lake?\u201d she asked as she noticed that he was carrying his pack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed something in a tree and I think I saw a pair of ice blue eyes looking at me.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have the herbs and berries you used for the stew?\u201d she asked and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have everything in my pack except for the meat and I have my bow.\u201d He said before she started to walk toward her own cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll eat the meat on the way to the cave since I will have food for us to eat when we get there and I can use the herbs that you have collected.\u201d She said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. I was wondering when they were coming to find me and try to get me to come with them.\u201d He said as he was leaning against her neck while sitting on her shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the rest of the meat as they were heading to her cave and his new home. He felt at peace laying his head, neck and back to the side of her neck; but he was thinking if he had any parents that loved him. She was watching where she was going and looking at him to check on him after awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I wonder if he knows about his real parents are not his foster parents, but a different pair.~ she thought before seeing that her cave is within range<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for them to get to the cave, but it was long since she was in her giant form. She looked at him and he was sleeping against her neck. She smiled before walking into her cave and walked to the bed so she could put him on the hand-made pillow. She returned to normal sized and teleporting to him so she could least make him feel comfortable. She took off his shoes and shirt before placing them on the bedside table and look through his pack for any clothes that he could sleep in, but she couldn\u2019t find anything in his pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Looks like he was wearing the only set of clothes that he has on and they look like they need to be clean and patched up.~ she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~He looks like he needs a bath.~ she thought as she grew back to her giant form who picked him up with his shoes and shirt brought his body over to a waterfall basin with a small island in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put him on the island before taking the rest of his clothes off and put them on the grass. She kindly smiled before teleporting to get things to clean him with like soap, shampoo, and some other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I have to get him some clothes to sleep in.~ ren thought as she returned to her normal form and started to wash him so he can be clean<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe washed his hair first to get the dirt out and cleaned his hair in the waterfall before washing his body and inspecting for injuries. During her inspection, she noticed some muscle on him that was well toned and calyces on his hands from doing hard work. She looked at his back and noticed there were some old scars that healed, but this has gotten her curious to what made him get the scars on his back. She placed her paw on his back and closed her eyes; a faint glow around the scars appeared and they vanished before she open her eyes. Soon she got back to cleaning him and she was done before picking him up to dry him in a towel that is soft like her fur and like the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for taking my old pain away.\u201d Ryan said in his sleep and she was just surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you asleep while I was cleaning you up?\u201d she asked him and he smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little, but I felt the pain of the scars being taken away and I thought it was something that one of my old friends said.\u201d Ryan said as he opened his eyes to see her drying him off in a towel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be wearing this towel until I can get your clothes clean and patched up.\u201d She said and he smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you look everywhere in my pack?\u201d he asked and she nodded, but he shook his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have another set of clothes and it\u2019s in the pack.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him his pack and he pulled out a set of pajamas and a shirt to sleep in with some other clothes to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere were they?\u201d she asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn plain sight.\u201d He said with a small smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished with the towel and put him on the bed before growing to a quarter of her giant form to get started on cleaning and patching up his other set of clothes while he is getting ready to sleep, but she has some place special for him to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Someone that cares for you takes the pain away.~ ryan thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Maybe he is my son and kain is the father, but I don\u2019t know how that could be.~ ren thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon ren was done with the patch work on his clothes and went to put his clothes close to the basin where she cleaned him so his clothes can be clean. She grew to her giant form and picked him up before laying on the bed ready to sleep for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a good place for you to sleep.\u201d She said as she lowered him to her chest and drop him a few feet from the ground. She placed him between her breasts and he was blushing as she was making sure that he was safe there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you put me here?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo make sure that I know that you are safe and you can sleep well in there.\u201d She said and he still had a faint blush before he laid down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard her heartbeat since he was close to her heart and he started to fall asleep and ren did the same after making sure that he is safe. He did feel safe around her and he is having a dream about her and kain with ash, but something is happening ren and ash were hugging him as kain was showing him his armored beast form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\u201dBoth of you should be proud of him.\u201d~ ash said as kain and ren blushed, but they nodded with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\u201dI wonder what he has from me.\u201d~ ren said as she looked at ryan\u2019s young form in her hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\u201dI\u2019m glad that salen agreed to watch over him if anything were to happen to us.\u201d~ kain said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~\u201dI\u2019m his aunt or his second mother since kain and I are like brother and sister or he loves me like he loves you.\u201d~ ash said as kain looked away before returning to his human form<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung ryan started to move in his mother\u2019s arms before opening his eyes for her to see her ice blue eye looking back at her. Soon he started to see some other things related to them, but he is happy to be sleeping with his giant mother and he started to cry in his sleep.</span></div></div>",

Each one had a look of surprise on their faces. Ryan quickly picked himself up and helped her up as well. \"Hi, I'm Ryan Morgan, and you are?\" <br>\r\n\"Alice Morgan. Hey, I think I know you. Didn't your parents get divorced?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I couldn't stand their constant fighting over me any more, so I left,\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"Were their names, um, let me see here...Oh yeah, Tracy and Michael?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"They're my parents too, so that would make us like siblings,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Well I never thought I had a sister, but I guess that makes two of us,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan decided to stop moping around in the forest and went back home with his sister.
