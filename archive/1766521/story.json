            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maggie knew the family was going to be gone for a week. She was on her own with food she knew her mom had prepared in advance plus more that she could cook herself. Plus her Dad had slipped her a hundred dollar bill \"just in case you need something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hungry but knew she as n no danger of starving. But she resented her sister's suggestion tht she might gsi weight and her mom's parting word of caution - \"be careful, you don't want to use up all that I've prepared in two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to her ridiculous of course - she'd always been naturally slender, able to burn off anything that she ate.  But there was that embarrassing button popping incident - but Johnny had texted her twice without mentioning it. Either he was a complete gentleman or hadn't even noticed. Perhaps sh had grown a size or so. but at her age that was to be expected, she rationalized.  She liked eating and wasn't about to change over one button and a few remsarks.  At least not this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew there were surplus pancakes in the freezer along with eggs and cheese plus avocados in the refrigerator.  Defiantly she made an omelette while three pancakes were heating in the microwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting fat,\" she declared to herself as she enjoyed her breakfast. \"Just filling out a bit. I know i need a size larger bra and maybe I'll get a new outfit or two plus  dress for the dance as well with the money dad left. There won't be any more embarrassing moments and there's certainly no need to be even thinking about dieting, at lest not this week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie went to the mall and bought the clothes as she planned, a little surprised to see that she'd stepped up from a size four to an eight but still not very upset. She'was wearing one of her new Capris and putting the remaining packages into her car when she was startled to see Johnny a few lanes over waving at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" he greeted her as he approached.  \"Shopping I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I needed a new dress for the dance in two weeks - I hope you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be gorgeous as always,\" he replied, not mentioning hat he knew very well that she'd probably added twenty pounds in the last ear, which he felt suited her nicely. \"Its after 2:00 - have you had lunch already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no,\" Maggie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I. I was planning to have something in the food court.  Have time to join me?\" Johnny offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie realized that it had been over four hours since breakfast and she was getting hungry. The depression and stress induced binges of the past week had stretched her stomach. In addition she wanted to be with Johnny. So, after about two seconds of indecision, she smiled and nodded her assent.  They each had a custom crafted burger with fries and soda while conversing easily.  After about 45 minutes Johnny suggested that they polish off lunch with a treat from the food court's cobbler shoppe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Maggie hesitated. She wanted the treat but heard her sister's taunting in the back of her mind.  Pushing it aside she bit her lip and said, \"well, I maybe shouldn't but it does sound good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny ambled off and soon returned with two luscious fresh peach cobblers with vanilla ice cream and caramel, pecans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is delicious,\" she acknowledged. \"Have you had them here before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twice. Its a special treat for special people - which is what I want you to feel like,\" he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's mental state soared, all thoughts about weight banished to the furthest corner of her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she answered,\" \"I appreciate that! You really know how to lift a girl's spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny just grinned humbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie drove home with a freshly stuffed belly and happy thoughts. Johnny was also happy, knowing that he'd been correct about Maggie,Her recent eight gsin wasn't an illusion.  He'd finally found a girl willing to let her appetite loose and he intended to let it roam.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her shopping trip had made her finally aware that her metabolism might be changing. She now knew that she wasn\u2019t immune from gaining weight as she\u2019d always assumed. She sensed that this could doom her cheer-leading career, but was aware that it was coming to a close anyway. At the moment, as she put away her newly purchased larger sized clothes, she was wasn\u2019t really concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was intelligent with great grades academically, but when it came to physical activity she tended to be on the lazy side, with her only real activity having been cheer-leading. Maggie came from a cheer-leading family; both her mom and her grandma before that had been cheerleaders. Even though Maggie really wasn't into cheer-leading, she felt like she had an obligation to do it, to make her mom and grandma proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Maggie realized, she was evolving a somewhat curvy body. This was unlike most cheerleaders, who had six packs, Maggie had always had a little bit of a belly - not big, or fat, just soft. She had inherited wide hips and slightly thick thighs from her mom, and a big bubble butt from her grandma and aunt. Her body was now sporting B-cup breasts, developing into a nice pear shape, unlike the other skin-and-bones or hourglass cheerleaders. Essentially Maggie was quickly adapting to being cool with it, especially since she had a penchant for indulging her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new larger clothes packed away Maggie went to play on her computer. In actuality, Maggie had little in common with the cheerleaders- she was a closet dork, and loved things like video games, comic books, and anime. She checked her email and noted a message from a fellow cheerleader, Sawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnderstand you\u2019re home alone this week What about a girls\u2019 night dinner with Savannah Chris and I?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavannah and Chris were also members of the cheer-leading squad, much more dedicated to weight watching than Maggie. But on occasion, about once a month, all four would let their guards down and have a \u201cno calorie counting allowed\u201d joint dinner, each one bringing a course. Usually it was tied together with a sleepover which involved even more food. They had done this at Maggie\u2019s sever limes, which was pasrt of the basis of the concern of Maggie\u2019s mom and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u201cSure\u201d </i>Maggie replied. <i> \u201cWhat about tomorrow night? I have a casserole my mom left \u2013 Chris can do the salad and drinks, you do dessert and Savannah the rolls and some veggies.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer called Chris and Savannah, who were expecting her to relay Maggie\u2019s response. Both agreed to their assignments, Chris noting that Maggie recently seemed to be doing more than just a monthly binge night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sawyer agreed. \u201cSince cheer leading season stopped she\u2019s gained a bit. I\u2019ve wondered if she\u2019s noticed, but bringing it up could ruin or friendship. I suggest we not say anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh definitely,\u201d \u2018Chris replied. \u201cAnd to be honest I\u2019ve picked up a few myself, so I\u2018ve nothing to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie of course was oblivious to this critique and contentedly played on line video games for the next few hours. When it came time for supper she was glad not to have to be concerned about the remarks of her sister or reproachful eye of her mom. Without hesitation she popped a double portion of Stouffer\u2019s Ketchup-Glazed meatloaf in gravy with mashed potatoes into the microwave.  Experience had taught her the truth of a reviewer\u2019s comments, \u201cgreat taste but child sized portions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up from supper she watched some game shows on television for an hour, grazing on a large bag of chips with dip in the process. Thoughts about Johnny kept crossing her mind. She\u2019d wanted to be closer to him for two years and now she\u2019d both shared a meal and had a dance coming up. Getting bored, she went back to her computer after ladling out a large bowl of ice-cream for dessert. There she was surprised to have an email from Johnny:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGreat running into you today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be permissible to made you a dinner Tuesday if I supply he ingredients?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuggested menu: homemade chicken fried steak with potatoes and green beans with a store bought pie (flavor of your choice) for dessert?<br>\r\n\u201cJ\u201d<i></i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Trying to spoil someone you barely know?\u201d</i>  Maggie replied coyly. <i>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve nothing else for that night so, why not?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled as he read and confirmed. He was confident that his culinary skills would result in an easy 2000 calories boost to his new girlfriend. And she would enjoy every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Maggie finished off the last couple of pre-frozen pancakes with some eggs, beef patty, cut watermelon pieces and coffee, then did the laundry before watching more television. Lunch was a bowl of grapes with a pair of grilled cheese sandwiches and tea, followed by a nap in anticipation of the evening. Before the arrival of her friends she slipped into one of her newly purchased outfits and smiled at her figure in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly normal cheerleader style, but definitely not beyond curvy,\u201d she reassured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer was the first to arrive, followed by Chris and Savannah together. Maggie already had the table set and the casserole heating in the oven, game boxes with Farkle and Phase 10 set off to the side. Sawyer noted the freshness and good taste of Maggie\u2019s wardrobe but also the filling out of her face and chin. Maggie, she noted, had definitely put on some serious pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls attacked their meals with zest as though they hadn\u2019t eaten all day.  But Sawyer noted that Maggie\u2019s self-served portions seemed a little more generous than the others. Chris halfway into the meal suggested that it would be nice to have another dinner and invite guys. Maggie, thinking of Johnny, immediately suggested Friday night, to which the others agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both Sawyer and Maggie\u2019s surprise it was Savannah who later that night, after two hours of games, suggested ordering in pizza. Since she was paying the others assented and the foursome wound up the evening polishing off two large pizzas plus sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning Maggie awakened to the aroma of something from the kitchen. It was Savannah, preparing breakfast burritos using a combination of fried eggs, ground hamburger and refried beans topped with melted cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Inquired a confused Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy treat for allowing me the chance to let loose and eat for a change,\u201d explained Savannah. \u201cI\u2019ll reimburse you for the food but I thought it would be better than coffee and toast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, uh, sure,\u201d replied Maggie, not wanting to disclose that unlike the others coffee and toast wasn\u2019t her usual; breakfast of choice anyway. \u201cThanks \u2013 it smells great and forget about reimbursing anything. My mom would have had us have breakfast if she were here, so what\u2019s the difference if you changed the menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Sawyer soon joined them and the four cheerleaders on break chatted until ten before breaking up. Maggie then cleaned up and decided to go easy on lunch in light of Johnny preparing supper. She played on the computer to kill time for a while, then had a microwaved Marie Callendar pot pie before taking a nap, not noting that it had had 620 calories on top of the 850 consumed for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the afternoon Maggie rose and made sure the kitchen was in good order for Johnny.  An amateur but decent cook herself she wondered how good he would turn out to be. He arrived just before five o\u2019clock and asked to be shown about the kitchen. He then invited her to watch him and chat or look at tv for an hour.  She decided to watch him and chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next sixty minutes he played Gordon Ramsey as he simultaneously juggled the main entr\u00e9e and two side dishes, ignoring the store bought pie he had stashed in the refrigerator \u2013 hopefully without Maggie noticing. Actually she had, but played ignorant. She noted with fascination that he tried to clean used utensils as he went along, thereby minimizing clean-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking Maggie for having pre-set the dining table Johnny around 5:50 set out a salad with organic ranch dressing from Trader Joe's and rolls, inviting Maggie to start in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for a roll but said she\u2019d wait on the salad for him. He smiled as the first roll quickly became a second. Within minutes of the 6:00 scheduled time he delivered both entrees to the table and delivered a blessing on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie, who had yet to even take a bite of the main meal. was impressed. She wondered what the rest of the evening would bring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>[Compliments to Cato, whose descriptions of Maggie and her boyfriend in another branch of this story inspired parts of this chapter]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Maggie knew Johnny primarily thought of her as the school's head cheerleader, with curly red and black hair that came down to just past her shoulders and beautiful baby blue eyes that seemed to read your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her position not from ambition to cheer or even be a stereotypical queen bee, but by diligent practice and kindness towards teammates, traits that made her the natural leader.  This was despite a slight belly and he beginnings of a pear shaped butt that was firm yet jiggly at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as her thighs had filled in. her butt expanded and her breasts grown towards a C cup this last semester this image in the mirror is what Maggie recalled, and she was happy to have used to draw Johnny\u2019s attention. To her he was a comparably intelligent, tall, black-haired white guy with warm brown eyes she\u2019d liked at a distance but who had always seemed preoccupied and disinterested until the encounter last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie had no idea what had triggered his sudden dance invitation and now a second meal but she was thoroughly enjoying it. She could, for this week at least, be herself without comments from her sister and Mom, She was just enough of a rebel to go along with whatever the more athletic appearing Johnny wanted to do related to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Maggie didn't know was that, although Johnny was a leader in two clubs, he did not have a totally fulfilling social life. This was because in his heart Johnny had always had a thing for full figured girls but the ones he knew couldn\u2019t embrace his liking them. But Maggie he perceived was different.  He was also aware of her cavalier eating habits, he consequences of which had been showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Maggie\u2019s sister and mom Johnny had noticed, but with a different reaction. He envisioned her gaining 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 pounds with a supportive boyfriend. By chance he\u2019d been at Porky\u2019s Buffet checking out portly diners when he\u2019d overhead the exchange between Maggie, Amy and their Mom. After seeing Maggie\u2019s reaction, including the defiant additional plate and the button popping incident, was when he decided it was time to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at her house as the chicken fried steak sizzled in its gravy Johnny commented \u201cIt will take a few minutes to cool down \u2013 meanwhile how is the salad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually (munch, chew) this is my first forkful,\u201d Maggie replied with her mouth half full. \u201cTastes like you\u2019ve included boysenberries and raisins \u2013 very good, and healthy too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlong with sliced mushrooms, two kinds of lettuce, shredded carrots and some other stuff,\u201c Johnny replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it\u2019s a mix from Trader Joe\u2019s market, but I\u2019m glad you like it, he continued, not mentioning the croutons or calorie rich dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow (munch, chew) did a guy your age get so involved with cooking,\u201d she inquired while continuing to devour the salad along with the last of her second buttered roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith both parents working and food shows on TV it just seemed the thing to do rather than having take-out or macaroni every night,\u201d Johnny answered. \u201cIt started with simple stuff like meatloaves and casseroles, then grew from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie offered Johnny her plate and he served her one of the four steaks still sizzling the pan, then added a generous helping of mashed potatoes and a side of Brussel sprouts. Maggie added butter to the potatoes and cut into the steak, pronouncing it superb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled as he took a similar portion for himself. Things were going just as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it this is a little fancier than you expected,\u201d he asked as she finished off the last of her first serving of mashed potatoes and scooped out a second helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, from a guy our age, yeah. But I cook too \u2013 unlike some cheerleaders,\u201d she commented putting anther large bite into her mouth.  \u201cWe (munch, chew) had a girl\u2019s night yesterday and I could tell I was getting the look over because of gaining a few pounds this year, like it\u2019s some huge deal. I\u2019m glad my Dad isn\u2019t like my sister and mom, always implying I\u2019m growing out of things. He says what I choose to eat is up to me and keeps them at bay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m 100% with your dad. Your figure and your clothes match up just fine and I think you look great,\u201d Johnny responded as Maggie moved the second piece of chicken fried steak onto her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie suddenly paused halfway through her second helping and looked at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder whether I should as you something\u201d she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d Johnny replied as he cut the last chicken fried steak piece in two and took half for himself along with some more mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn Friday all four of us girls are preparing a meal here and inviting fur guys. I think you\u2019d be a great one to have with me.\u201d Maggie offered.<br>\r\n\u201cInvitation accepted \u2013 would you be able to share any help on the cooking?\u201d Johnny replied. \u201cI\u2019m really good at fried chicken and lasagna. Or we could do Walhalla pasta. I also know some great foreign dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your lasagna is a good as this steak I would definitely like to have some, although not this moment,\u201d she exclaimed rubbing her belly. \u201cbut what is Walhalla pasta?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an off the menu specialty at most Outback steakhouses \u2013 I got the recipe off the Internet.,\u201d answered Johnny. \u201cTook four tries to get it really right. It\u2019s basically chicken alfredo with vegetables plus peppers, Parmesan cheese and either fettuccine noodles or penne pasta, but the rich sauce is what makes the difference. It uses thick whipping cream combined with the peppers for a taste you can\u2019t believe!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie, her mouth now empty after her second helping, found her taste buds salivating from the description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy then I might have room,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIs it difficult to make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you have the ingredients \u2013 but for eight people it might be pricey, at least $40-50. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sharing the cost \u2013 $25 a couple, so that would work. But I want to help you and learn,\u201d Maggie answered, her eyes surveyimg the last of the steak and potatoes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJohnny caught her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, then I\u2019ll do it.  Meanwhile if you have room for the left overs I\u2019ll clean up \u2013 or we can put them in the refrigerator,\u201d he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, I\u2019m so full already - but they\u2019re just dabs. No point in saving scraps. If you\u2019ll give me another glass, I guess I can manage handing them. You have really proved yourself a cook\u201d she answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled, thinking of the chocolate silk pie in the refrigerator for later and knowing Maggie had already ingested around 1600 calories. As he washed off the dishes and loaded the dishwasher she contentedly finished off the last of his efforts, after which they retired to the living room to watch reruns on Netflix.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on a large slice of the pie with a glass of milk would for the evening add another 650 calories \u2013 and three more would remain for the next day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jonathan Westmore, Johnny to his classmates, awoke on Wednesday around 8:00 to find a text message from Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the great evening but can I treat you to breakfast? I need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him his dinner companion of the prior evening, Maggie, had been wrestling since early dawn with three views. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was her view of herself naked in the mirror. She\u2019d finally taken time to study the changes in her body. Despite two slight torso bulges, which with a few more thousand calories would easily become love handles, and obviously thickened thighs she wasn\u2019t repelled by her naked image. She thought she wore her new weight well, especially her slightly increased bust. She wasn\u2019t aware of the thin layer of developing fat on her back or the jiggle from her softening rump when walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was the view with her new clothes on, which she agreed with Johnny complimented her figure just fine. She was softer but far from becoming a fat girl (at least in her own view). There was none of the visible rolls and discomfort from wearing ill-fitting or undersize garments that she\u2019d seen some struggle with. She still resented the insinuations of her mom and sister that implied otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third view concerned about her older clothes. Around 5:00 she\u2019d arisen and tried getting into her old cheerleading outfit. She both felt and looked like a stuffed sausage. Next she tried two of her older slacks and found she couldn\u2019t put them even past her thighs; two others were very tight and impossible to clasp shut.  The few others she could get on, but she could tell she would in public having to constantly pull at and adjust. She might not be thinking of herself as fat, but had to acknowledge that former clothes were definitely now too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had that felt comfortable was the dress for the dance, two freshly purchased slacks and a matching top. Either she persuaded her parents to spring for a new wardrobe or she had very little to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in this context that she wanted to talk with Johnny. He understood and didn\u2019t condemn her new found appetite as she knew her co-cheerleaders would. But he was enabling her to make choices that frightened her and, at least after Friday or the dance at the latest, she felt she needed to tell him that she had to stop indulging \u2013 even though inside she didn\u2019t want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that\u2019s what she intended to say to him at breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny returned her message. They decided to meet at a local diner which had a $5.49 special for breakfast \u2013 large muffin, eggs any style and a choice of turkey sausage or bacon. After ordering Johnny listened patiently as Maggie laid out details of the dilemma that was tormenting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd,\u201d she concluded,\u201d that\u2019s why, after the dance, next week I\u2019m going to have to stop eating so much. I hope it doesn\u2019t destroy the memories of what we\u2019ve been sharing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was quiet. He had a secret which he knew would give her a different option, but was hesitant to share it.  Finally, he asked. \u201clet me ask you to consider some \u201coutside the box\u201d thinking \u2013 OK&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?,\u201d Maggie asked as she finished her savory and oversize blueberry muffin slathered with fresh butter. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you heard of random acts of kindness?\u201d Johnny inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Someone who can do good does it spontaneously \u2013 no recognition or thought of reward.\u201d Maggie answered \u201c\u201cor assignment of credit. It\u2019s as much as possible done anonymously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a dollar bill on you?\u201d Johnny continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I told you I was paying for breakfast,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you lay it on the table? \u201cHe asked as her as he reached into his own pocket.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, OK,\u201d she said as she complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid a lotto scratcher next to it.  \u201cThat\u2019s a $2 ticket \u2013 but it\u2019s also a winner, worth $1000. It can only be redeemed by day even though I bought it at night. The convenience store doesn\u2019t carry that much cash in the evening. If you let me sell half of it to you for a dollar it means you have $500. Would that take care of the wardrobe upgrade?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but \u2026\u201d she stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me finish\u201d Johnny interrupted. \u201cit\u2019s not for me to force you into making a choice.  Like your Dad says that\u2019s up to you. You now have a viable set of options \u2013 try losing weight so that your old wardrobe fits or please yourself and get a new one, telling your mom and friends that cheerleading is no longer the focus of your life. Which one is it that you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t I get the new wardrobe anyway and then try out dieting?\u201d Maggie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an option as well,\u201d Johnny affirmed. \u201cI care about you too much to let you be boxed in on something when it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie stared at the ticket and dollar bill for a full minute while Johnny held his peace.  Then she pushed the dollar his way.  \u201cOK, but you\u2019ll need to cash it alone. I won\u2019t be eighteen for two more months. And there\u2019s one condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d he asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you left pie at my place. Now you have to let me share supper with you tonight so that I can give your piece. The entr\u00e9e will be my version of meatloaf with macaroni and cheese,\u201d Maggie declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d replied Johnny with a sense of relief. \u201c6:00?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c6:00. Now, let\u2019s get that ticket cashed. I\u2019ve got shopping to do and a dinner to prepare.\u201d Maggie declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 10:00 Maggie was fully into a three hour shopping spree, climaxed by a 800+ calorie rolled lamb pita at a Mediterranean style restaurant in the mall food court. Then it was home to pack, cook supper and take a brief nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny arrived on time at 6:00 Maggie was happy and ready to share the evening with him. He\u2019d expected meatloaf and macaroni with cheese but not as a single entr\u00e9e.  Maggie, using an online recipe, had the mac and cheese in the middle of two meat portions, sandwich style. Following Johnny\u2019s pattern of the night before she also has peas on the side plus a Cesar salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was impressed, both by the menu and the fact that she served herself as well as him a generous second helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, \u201c she remarked, noticing his enjoyment. \u201cI can cook and like eating, but my mom doesn\u2019t always like the calorie count of my choices\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny decided to remain impartial, simply reaffirming his appreciation of her culinary abilities. They spent a quiet evening together, climaxed by dispatch of the remainder of the chocolate silk pie.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Credit to myself for part of the story below, based on a scenario included as part of a chapter I contributed to in another interactive story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie arose Thursday to an anticipated savory breakfast. It she knew would include a turkey sausage burrito from Whole Foods and an oversized blueberry muffin. With butter it was over 700 calories. Of course she never looked such information up, instead electing as usual to simply please her palette. She was thinking of Johnny and had little thought about her three friends and their situations, but would likely have been surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine Overton earlier in the week had spoken with Sawyer Evans. She\u2019d acknowledged that she too had noticed Maggie\u2019s gain. She had then dismissively minimized it by noting that she\u2019d \u201cadded a few\u201d herself. It was also Chris who was second only to Maggie in enjoying Savannah\u2019s breakfast surprise \u2013 and it had also been her idea to have the ladies\u2019 choice dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Sawyer not been so fixated on the change in Maggie she might have noticed the full reason for Chris\u2019s statement - Chris and Savannah Maxwell were to differing degrees in denial. They had similarly become larger \u2013 just not as much as Maggie, but definitely a few pounds bigger. Like Maggie they no longer felt as conscribed by the constant reminders from their school cheerleading coach and neither had parents hung up on their eating habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was the more honest. She was fully aware of the amount of her own gain; she also knew the cause. Savannah, on the other hand was not. Chris and Savannah were best friends, making Chris privy to Savannah\u2019s sweet tooth and penchant for snack foods and pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince cheerleading season was over Chris knew that Savannah had even home-baked brownies and turnovers, even though they\u2019d been made mainly for her boyfriend Jim Roberts. But the real temptation came from Savannah\u2019s mom, who found that if she made treats such as bakery tarts and bear claws or boxes of mini-donuts available they were likely to disappear. And it didn\u2019t really matter to Mrs. Maxwell that Savannah\u2019s chubby younger sister Annette had access to the treats as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to snacking Savannah had been eating meals family style as well, resulting in a five-pound gain compared to Chris\u2019s nine. This actually was a positive for her mom, who at times wondered if her cheerleader daughter was borderline anorexic. Both Savannah and Chris were each a few inches shorter than Maggie. The new weight was for the most part focused on their bellies, which were becoming become noticeably softer.<br>\r\nChris knew her extra pounds had begun with an eventful discussion with her mom six months before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, we need to talk,\" her mom had declared in a serious tone that immediately caught her daughter\u2019s attention.  \"I've got a problem and you I hope can help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had taken a deep breath and then relaxed, \"What's wrong, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been given a nice promotion with a big raise. That part is great, but it\u2019s going to mean longer hours. I'm going to have delegate - and that includes asking you for more help in cooking around here,\u201d her mom had declared, \u201cbut you can be rewarded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201c asked her daughter. \u201cWhat all is involved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll get to plan the meals, shop for the food, and then cook them,\u201d her mom answered. \u201cIt will teach you a lot and, since it\u2019s such a responsibility I'll be giving you $100 per week - half of which you can spend and the other half you can put in a savings account. The alternatives are to hire someone or order out. I'd rather not do either. Do you think you can help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris\u2019s quick mind raced. She\u2019d prepared her own breakfast scores of times and helped with dinner \u2013 she knew she could do it. But this would mean full responsibility for her siblings as well. But $50 extra per week plus a savings account? She loved her mom, knew they needed the added income and felt up to the challenge <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn cooking for five Chris had consciously tried not to overeat, but it seemed a pound or so had shown up each month anyway. Fortunately, her boyfriend, Roger Stoneman, was supportive rather than critical - even helping with shopping and angling to be invited over (which occurred about once a week). Jim Roberts had much the same attitude toward Savannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris that morning was at Savannah\u2019s as the two were planning to attend a matinee. Around noon Annette announced that she was making hot dogs to go with some potato salad in the refrigerator for lunch and offered to make extra ones for her cheerleader sister and her friend.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d chirped Savannah. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving for at least an hour or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later both Chris and Savannah had two loaded hot dogs plus a generous serving of potato salad and a large handful of chips. Annette went back to her room with a similar meal which she would eat while on line. Chris appreciated the hospitality but couldn\u2019t help but note that although Annette was three years younger she appeared heavier than herself or her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Savannah acknowledged, as she took a bite of her own dog. \u201cShe\u2019s got an appetite and grazes a lot. She really doesn\u2019t care about her big belly or how wide her hips look.  Mom isn\u2019t exactly small either you know \u2013 and our Dad seems to like it. I\u2019m not bothered about it either \u2013 who knows, I could get bigger someday too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shrugged and quietly ate her own lunch. But somehow she wasn\u2019t surprised when abut a hour later Annette emerged from her room again and offered to get them ice cream for dessert.  Both turned down the invitation, noting that it was time to head for the movie.  As they were leaving she noticed Annette in the kitchen opening the refrigerator freezer door. The truth of Savannah\u2019s statement was apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sawyer\u2019s steady date, Charles Harris, who felt differently. He\u2019d been the one to first point out Maggie\u2019s gain to Sawyer. She was already a tad fat phobic because of her mom\u2019s remarks and attitude. Although she hadn\u2019t gained a pound herself, Charles made it clear that he felt the need to agree with her mom and remind her to be careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer in part understood his concern and made allowance for his somewhat controlling attitude. At one level she shared it (witness what was happening with her teammates).

Neither did she have significant back fat that ripped when she reached up nor did she have jiggling in her thighs or hips.

Everyone thought they were sisters seperated at birth. \"Hey Maggie!\" said Sawyer. \"We noticed you weren't eating anything, so we thought you hadn't gotten anything yet. Want to come and eat with us then have a sleepover later?\" continued Savannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looked at her mom. Her mom sighed, then said, \"Sure. Me and Abby are leaving. We'll drop your stuff at...?\" asked Maggie's mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My house.\" Chris said. Maggie smiled, hugged her mom, then walked over the her friends table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the watchful eye of her mother, Maggie ate a steak, then went to the desert line and downed a huge bowl of ice cream, 5 brownies, and finally, 3 cups of Dr. Pepper. Sawyer, Chris, and Savannah had 3 plates of food in that time, and they gossiped about Johnny, the boy Maggie had a crush on, disliked teachers, homework, etc., then Savannah asked, \"Hey Maggie, ready to go?\" Maggie nodded, and all 4 girls stood up, with Maggie in the lead. Maggie took 2 steps, when <b>POP</b>! The button on her jeans flew off. Looking back and seeing no one noticing, she shrugged it off to the massive amounts of food she consumed, knowing she wouldn't gain any weight as a cheerleader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into a taxi, the 4 girls got to Chris' house at 9:04 and went upstairs to watch a movie. At 12:00, at the end of the second movie, Sawyer went downstairs to make popcorn and Savannah ordered 4 pizzas, all 4 double-stuffed cheese with a cheese crust. Maggie asked, \"Why 4?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris replied, \"We each order our own pizza and eat it throughout the night. We don't eat it all at once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that makes sense.\" Maggie said, as she popped in Avatar. About 20 minutes later, the pizzas arrived. \"I'll get them!\" said Maggie, and she walked down stairs. her stuffed belly swung from side to side, but it wasn't noticeable to anyone, including Maggie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened, the pizza guy handed her the pizzas. She placed them on the stairs, then handed him $25. The guy reached out with her change but dropped it by mistake. \"Oops! My bad!\" exclaimed the pizza guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No big deal.\" Maggie said, and bent over to grab the money. Suddenly, her pants ripped, right across the butt. Maggie's face flushed as she grabbed the money, covered the rip, and squeaked out, \"Thank you.\" to the pizza guy. The pizza guy left, grinning at the sight of Maggie's pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie sat down and texted her mom, asking, \"Where r u?\" her mom texted her back immediately, saying, \"Srry. Coming. 4got u were there.\" Maggie texted back, asking, \"What did u bring 4 me?\" Her mom said, \"Sweatpants, tank top, change of clothes 4 2morrow. Y?\" \"No reson. Bye.\" Maggie texted back. Maggie closed her phone, then set off up the stairs with the pizzas. Walking into the bedroom, Maggie handed each girl a pizza and grabbed herself a bowl of popcorn. They resumed watching the movie, gossiping and eating pizza and popcorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 1:00 am, her mom knocked on the door. Careful to make sure the girls didn't see her ripped pants, she went downstairs to greet her mom. They hugged, Maggie grabbed her bag, and her mom left. Quickly, Maggie took off her jeans and replaced them with the sweatpants, then replaced her shirt with the loose fitting one. Placing the excess in the bag, Maggie went back upstairs. at 3:00 am, Avatar was over, and the girls were all asleep. Each had varying amounts of pizza left, except Maggie. Maggie had polished it all off, and her popcorn as well. The next morning...</span></div></div>",

After an hour had passed, Chris had had 4 servings, Sawyer had 2, and Savannah had had 6, and was rubbing her belly from the stuffed feeling she had.

Sawyer opened it, glanced sadly at Maggie, and said, \"You have to go, Maggie. Your mom is here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie sighed, hugged her 3 friends, then walked out the door.

They were an anti-stereotypical couple: Maggie was head cheerleader, Jason was the head of the Computer, Video Game Making, and Yearbook clubs. However, Jason was athletic.

Just going on a date with my hot boyfriend.\" replied Maggie. Jason laughed. They got into Jason's car and drove to Mr. Porky's All-You-Can-Eat Buffet. Jason paid the man in front $20 for both of them, and told Maggie to find somewhere to sit. Maggie, delighted by Jason's politeness, found a corner booth. Jason returned carrying 2 trays. One had a Mountain Dew, 2 chicken wings, a small mound of mashed potatoes, a burger, and a mound of rice. Jason set this down and slid into the booth right next to Maggie, that tray in front of him. He placed the other tray in front of Maggie. Maggie gasped at the sight of so much food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jason said regretfully. \"I didn't know what kind of food you liked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looked at the tray, and said, \"It's okay. I don't have to finish it all.\" (BTW, Maggie is a little bit of a ditz sometimes.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up and said, \"Well... the management wants to make sure every penny is well spent, so diners have to eat whatever they take. Maggie gasped, then sighed, resigned to the Herculean task in front of her. You see, Maggie's tray had a glass of Dr. Pepper, 3 burritoes, 3 hard tacos, a large bowl of rice, a large bowl of mashed potatoes smothered in gravy, a 3rd bowl loaded with black beans, 6 spicy chicken wings, a cheeseburger, and another bowl, this one filled with chocolate ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie started with the rice. Slowly but surely, she increased her pace until the rice was gone. Setting that bowl aside, she pulled in the potatoes and started eating. The flavors exploded in her mouth, the gravy/butter blend smothering the potatoes showing her a new path of taste. After quickly wolfing that down, she ate the bowl of beans, then the tacos. Everything was so good, she couldn't even believe it. Following the tacos, she dipped her chicken wings in the left over gravy and polished them off. The bean burritos came next, and as she finished the third one, she unbuckled her belt and drank the Mountain Dew. Finally, Maggie ate the bowl of ice cream, which surprisingly hadn't melted yet. Maggie was rubbing her stomach and looked up to see Jason returning to the table.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts plumpen, her bra straining to contain the squishy flesh. Maggie didn't notice her pants ripping as her thighs and ass began to expand, but she finally did as she attempted to rise out of the chair, the chair moving with her. She sat back down, making a moaning noise. Her shirt had also been ripped slightly, around her breasts. Because her boobs stuck out, it caused her belly to have more room to grow, and grow it did. It made gurgling noises, and Maggie curiously patted her round middle. It was soft and squishy, and she felt a tingling between her legs as she pressed against her gut.<br>\r\nShe tried to squeeze out of the chair again, but noticed something..</span></div></div>",

'Well if I can't get out of the chair I might as well start to eat all this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie started in on more of the donuts, chowing them down in big bites. Each one was as fattening as the first. The fat started piling on her butt, belly and boobs. As her wide rear expanded the chair started to creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie only had two donuts left and she was holding one in each hand. As she bit into the first one the gooey center leaked out and the chocolate frosting wiped her upper lip leaving a treat for later. The gooey center landed in between her growing thighs. As she started to eat the last doughnut the creaking of the chair got louder. The wood was splitting, but Maggie kept eating. Finally when she was all done the chair split in two freeing her from it's grasp. The hit the floor with her cushioned behind, sending ripples through her newly thickened body. Maggie was oblivious as to how the chair had broken, but took it as a sign from the note that she more she ate the more freedom she was allowed. Actually it was just a coincidence that the donuts where so fattening that her heavier bum was able to split the thing in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie started to wonder why she was here. Last night with her boyfriend had been a little weird, but he wouldn't have trapped her in a house full of food would he? Maybe she was on one of those reality game shows, and this was part of the game? She didn't have any clue, but could only take her adventure one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne scenario that didn't come to mind was that maybe some one was watching her last night, someone that watched her stuff herself last night and thought that she had potential. Someone that followed her home, and took her in the middle of the night when she was in a daze from over eating. But who knows? Maggie would find out eventually, she had already started to eat the other treats that were in abundance in the kitchen seeing it as her only way to leave.</span></div></div>",

Once upstairs Maggie stripped down and found a new set of clothes worthy of her larger body. They were a little bit more revealing than she was used to, but she didn't really have much of a choice. The shorts were a little too short and showed off quite a lot of her newly thickened legs. Also the neck line on her top was quite low, revealing a bit too much for Maggie's liking.

What could I possibly need? I have all the food I can eat...\" she trailed off. She thought about looking around the house again, but decided to just eat the contents of the fridge. When she opened it, something strange happened, there was a gust of warm air. She looked inside and found five large pizzas, and they were kept hot! She started eating slice after slice, it was delicious! She ate the first pizza and sighed, eyeing the next pie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie finished the last slice, she was sitting on the floor, her shorts gone and her shirt only hiding her boobs.

Her fleshed out body jiggling as it hung freely in the air. She decided to open the third refrigerator, now that she had eaten donuts, cake, and pizza, she wondered what was in store for her. The chill chest was full of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pudding?\" Maggie said puzzled. She shrugged and grabbed all four massive containers bringing them into the living room. She flipped on the TV and flipped the lid off the first container of pudding. Inside lie a massive load of chocolate pudding. She started eating big spoonfuls of the pudding as she turned her attention to the TV. She instinctively turned the channel to 25, a station she watched a lot of at home, but there it wasn't food network. Maggie had seen some food network, but didn't recognize any of these shows. The first one was called \"Cake war\" where four women faced off to make a massive cake and then eat the whole thing. Those who finished last didn't move on to the next round, and each round the cakes got bigger and bigger. Next up was a more informational show, teaching the viewers at home how to bake. The hostess was quite a wide women, and everything she made seemed incredibly fattening. She even had her own catch phrase 'The more butter the better!' She was constantly eating as she cooked, and finished the show by consuming the rest of everything she had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was doing her own consuming though. She scooped through each of the containers of pudding, going through chocolate to vanilla and then strawberry and back to chocolate. When Maggie went back into the kitchen to clean up and get more to eat she discovered a new note. \"Congratulations, you've unlocked a new channel on the TV, as well as wardrobe privileges. More advanced wardrobes will become available after you eat more. Your next reward comes after you finish eating this whole freezer full of food.\" Maggie pulled open the freezer to reveal cartons and cartons of ice cream. There were also a few chilled pies, as well as ice cream cakes and frozen treats.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had finished the carton by the time the pie was just the right warmth for eating, and she quickly devoured it. She continued this process of eating icecream and hot pies until the pies ran out, then she switched to the other frozen treats between cartons. Eventually, she finished all the ice cream, much to her dismay: it was the best she had ever had! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all gone already? Oh well, at least I'll get something out of it...\" Maggie thought as she threw away the last carton. Just then, there were several loud clicks from the back of the house, and from the sides. Maggie waddled her learned shaped self to the back of the house first to see what the noise was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was delighted to find that the windows on the back of the house had been opened! They revealed a fenced in back yard of a moderate size and beyond the tall wooden dance were very tall trees as well as a clear blue sky. She tried the door and it opened, allowing her a breeze of cool fresh air, which made her nipples hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door and went back inside to look out the other windows. On one side, she saw the fence again and the tree line over it, but in the other, she didn't see the fence, and could see the tree line only a few yards away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to open the window but it wouldn't budge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair! Let me see freedom but not give it to me?\" Maggie said as she turned around and returned to the kitchen. She saw a note on a door:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see your freedom, but there is still good to be eaten! More food equals more freedoms and luxuries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you...\" She mumbled as she opened the door and tried to enter, which she was cut short by her hips, so she turned side ways and was able to squeeze through. What she found when she turned on the lights was a pantry! A pantry full all sorts of name brand fattening snacks and chips and popcorn! She picked up a box of cosmic brownies and quickly tore into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my favorite!\" She mumbled to herself as she devoured the whole box in minutes. But then she thought, \"Maybe I could break that window and just climb out to freedom...\"</span></div></div>",

All the snacks tasted amazing, and she just couldn\u2019t or want to stop herself. She ate until the pantry was emptied and all that was left were wrappers and boxes. Maggie licked her finger, since they had become covered in chocolate, as well as the corners of her mouth were also covered. She proceeded to rub her clean, but sticky, fingers on her streched out shirt. With all the input of calories Maggie's clothing had started to become laughably small and ill fitting, yet she cleaned off her paws on the lightly colored tightly stretched fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie brushed aside the mess she had made on the floor on her way out of the pantry. The doorway was looking even smaller than before, but again she turned squeezing her butt and belly through rather than try and get her wide hips to press through the narrow opening. She was met with more resistance this time, especially with how much fuller her stomach was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally popping out of the small doorway, her whole body jiggled as it slowly came to rest. The idea of freedom had not escaped Maggie\u2019s ambition, so she waddled over to the locked window, and started to bang on it, testing its strength. Sadly it was a lot tougher than she gave it credit for, and quickly she grew tired of pounding on it with her extremely flabby heavy arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated she retired back to her central hub, the kitchen, this time finding a new note. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love all these goodies? Don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t run out, eat as much as you\u2019d like. Don\u2019t forget about all the special TV channels you have and your bedroom retreat upstairs. Enjoy a soak in your tub to unlock more rewards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie decided to check up stairs, and maybe take a dip in the tub if it would lead to more clues for her, she was determined to find out what was happening, or escape as soon as possible. But she really did want to know who was behind all of this, how they were making it all happen, and why she had to eat so much, it was making her so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie slowly made her way upstairs, something that had become such a hard task at her increased size and weight. She went into the master bedroom where she had woken up this morning, and noticed the door to the attached bathroom was now open. She sauntered over, opening the door further to reveal the large scale luxurious bathroom. The place looked really nice, with a marble countertop sink, stone work tile shower, and a hot tub style bath nestled on the side. Of course this house wouldn\u2019t be complete without the room fully stocked with food, so the whole room was filled with chocolates. The counter had bowls filled with chocolate candies, there were little chocolate treats lining the tub and any flat surface that would hold them. But the big eye catcher was that the tub looked to be full of melted chocolate as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie poked a finger into the liquid chocolate, popping it into her mouth afterwards. She learned that it truely was melted chocolate, but also that it was creamy and delicious and also quite warm and enjoyable. \u2018I guess this is the bath the note had mentioned, might as well get in.\u2019 All the food themed things were starting to not phase Maggie, she was starting to expect them. Maggie stripped, allowing her new girth to finally be freed and be fully exposed to fresh air for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looked over at her reflection in the mirror, noticing she looked about 3 times her normal size. She was kinda appalled she had gotten so big, but at this point had given into the fact that her captor was making her fat for a reason and it didn\u2019t seem there was anything she could do about that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie popped a few of the chocolate lying around in her mouth before placing one of her chunky legs into the tub. It quickly disappeared into the dark chocolate, as the smooth mixture looked like it was eating her as her leg sunk in further. Maggie slowly lowered herself in, the chocolate rising all around her. As her massive bulk entered the space the level of the chocolate rose to accommodate the volume of her body. Finally her wide booty had hit the bottom and she was now resting in the tub, the chocolate coming right up to her chubby chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something totally new for Maggie so she took a moment to test it. She took one arm completely out of the tub, and it remained covered in gooey chocolate as some of it dripped down, back into the tub. Finally she cupped her hands bringing a small amount up to her mouth, which she easily drank down. \u201cHmmm.\u201d She moaned at the taste of the delicious chocolate. Maggie didn\u2019t stop there, she took another handful, and then another. The chocolate tasted fabulous and she just couldn\u2019t get enough. She did anything to assist getting the chocolate from the tub into her mouth. She eventually just sunk her mouth down and started slurping it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the tub started to disappear. The level of the chocolate was going down, and because of that her naked body started to become exposed again, like an archaeological dig uncovering dinosaur bones. But now instead of creamy pink flesh one would see creamy chocolate covered flesh. This didn\u2019t stop Maggie though, she continued to drink the warm chocolate until she having to lick the sides of the tub because there was none left. At this point she felt full enough to throw in the towel, and her belly looked bigger than ever with all of that chocolate in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYummm, that was good.\u201d Maggie cooed to herself. At this point she carefully rose from the tub, making sure not to slip on the chocolate that still coated her feet and the tub. She was able to get out with no issue, and headed over to the stand up shower. Turning it on she was able to get some warm water to clean off her completely covered body. She tried off and found a change of clothes. She went back to the bathroom to try and clean the tub which was still covered in chocolate. She thought she could just turn on the warm water, fill it up and it was pretty much clean it self. But when she turned the knob more chocolate gushed out! \u2018No wonder it was so easy to fill before. Well at least I know I can do that again pretty easily.\u2019 Maggie thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie waddled back down stairs, she had done what the note had said so she now expected a prize. What she found was...</span></div></div>",

You need to finish ALL the chocolate before you get that particular prize, which is really more of a side thing. If you want to progress more towards freedom, there's another task you need to do. Inside the garage is a few smokers, you are to eat all their contents and then you shall become closer to your freedom!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Maggie thought as she rubbed her stuffed belly, \"I'll finish the tub later, right now I'll deal with those smokers.\" She wandered around the house before hearing another click from a door she had previously found to be locked. She opened the door and found several wood smokers all connected by pipes to the ceiling. She waddled somewhat quickly over to the garage door and could see out to the driveway! She could see out to the street and parts of the frontward. Again, the heavy woods were visible on the other side of the street. Maggie returned her gaze to the smokers and opened the first of the ten smokers and out slid a whole turkey! \"What? A whole turkey? After all I've eaten? And I'm still going to have to eat what's in al the other ones...\" Feeling she had no other options, Maggie started eating the turkey. It was warm, but not to hot to eat, it was perfectly juice and tender. Maggie slowly proceeded to eat that turkey, then a ham, a roast, a chicken, and a rack of robs. Then a whole other set of those meats in the other five smokers. As she finished, she rubbed her painfully stuffed belly, and waddled into the kitchen to find a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've finished that meal! Congratulations! I now ask that you go to the master suite and rest for the night, your reward will come in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie set the note back down and looked at the stairs, she flipped the note over:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you sleep anywhere else, this prize will be nullified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looked at the note and then the stairs, her stomach grumbled and she rubbed it slightly.

She waddled over to the tub and looked the faucet, she didn't exactly want to bathe in the chocolate this time as she was tired and wanted to do this quickly. She found that the faucet had a detachable nozzle and she quickly placed it in her mouth and turned both the knobs all the way open. She was greeted with a torrent of warm chocolatey goodness. She quickly started gulping it down, not wanting any to spill out of her mouth. As eh gulped and gulped, she felt it's warmth spread throughout her and start fattening her. Her body started swelling, her gigantic booty spreading out farther behind her and her hips widening at her flanks as her thighs thickened to as big around as she was tall. Her belly rolls thickened and spread downward, reaching her thighs and creating a sexy apron for her. Her breasts spread to either side of her belly as the grew rounder and fuller. Her arms thickened as the finished the last bit of the chocolate as it stopped flowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heard a soft ding from behind her. She turned around and waddled her fatter form out through the master bedroom to the hallway where, instead of stairs, she was greeted with a elevator. on the door was a note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations! You've drunk all the chocolate out of the tub! You've been rewarded with a lift so you don't burn any precious fat climbing up and down the stairs.\" The note read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's something\" Maggie thought as she turned her girthy body around and returned to the master suite, her hips just barely brushing against either side of the door frame as eh entered through. She climbed on the bed, expecting it to groan under her weight, which surprisingly, it didn't. Her breasts were just a few inches away from the bedding as she crawled on all fours to the head of the bed and laid herself down, her breasts falling to either of her as her bottom spread beneath her. She slowly drifted to sleep as she rubbed her fat curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, her reward became clear, it was:</span></div></div>",

Now she was standing the the kitchen she was getting to know all too well, with the numerous refrigerators and also acting as the center of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately noticed that the kitchen was stocked for breakfast, and of course accompanied by another note. \"Good morning Maggie, I thought you would enjoy a little breakfast.\" Maggie looked down at the humomgus tits and super sized belly. Her stomach was actually churning at the thought of more food, like it now had a mind of its own. Maggie had to be past the 400lb mark now, especially after all that chocolate she enjoyed last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy this breakfast feast.\" The more finished. Maggie pulled up what looked like a new, more reinforced and roomier chair, up to the table. She was able to easily sit her extremely widened rear in the seat, and start eating plate after plate of food. There were more donuts, which she enjoyed, plenty of danishes, a pile of pop tarts, and also a big plate of bacon and other breakfast meats. Maggie quickly chomped the whole meal down , enjoying every bite as it filled her massive gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done she wiped her mouth of all the grease and crumbs, and struggled a little bit to lift herself from the chair. \"Ok where's my prize?\" Maggie said aloud, assuming someone could hear her this whole time. But her question was met with only silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated Maggie decided to check out how moving the bedroom down stairs had effected the house. Her master bath was still attached to the  bedroom, and she still had access to the garage. The pantry off the kitchen had been restocked, so Maggie grabbed a box of cosmic brownies to take with her, which she quickly finished the whole box. Everything looked pretty much the same, so she decided to take the lift upstairs to see what was in place of the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the lift tool her up stairs, Maggie mindlessly rubbing her huge gut, that had gotten bigger than she could ever have imagined.

She drew close to the wall, peering at it intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" she thought to herself. She had to know, so, she stuck out her tongue and licked the wall. \"Oh yes!\" she exclaimed as the wall tasted like white chocolate! She started pulling off pieces of the wall and swallowing them as quickly as she could, she went up as high as she could reach and down to the dark chocolate molding along the floor, which  she found was some sort of peanut brittle, resembling hardwood. As she ate her way along the floor, her breasts and belly dragging as she crawled, she reached the bed. She tasted the bedding and found it was made of liquorice. Shes tarted eating one corner of the sheets and started on the next when she had finished that. She continued forward into the mattress and found it was made of cotton candy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she ate a trench through that she came to the other wall, she ate her way up the wall (with increasing difficulty, as her body was weighing her down) and to the large window above the bed.

She looked to the left down the hall and saw the door to the backyard, to her right was the living room and the front door. Knowing she had opened the back door already, she tried it first. The door opened and the cool air breezed over her. She stepped outside, not caring about her nakedness, and surveyed the yard, it was fairly large, with a six-foot privacy fence made of wood. She waddled over and pushed on the fence slightly. <i>Too sturdy to push over...</i> Maggie searched the length of the fence for a gate or any defect, anything that seemed like an opening. She found a gate that had a fairly sturdy-looking lock on it, she jostled the gate a bit and it didn't budge. Maggie reached for the top of the fence and tried pulling on the boards, putting all of her massive weight into it, she managed to pry off the board, falling to the ground. As she landed with a thud, and lots of jiggling, she rejoiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Actual progress towards my freedom!\" Maggie exclaimed as she rolled over, got up on her knees and then back to her feet. She reached for a second board and pulled on it with the same results, falling down again. After a few boards, Maggie was starting to get very tired. \"Whew, maybe I should take a break and get a snack?\" she thought out loud. <i>No, that would be bad. I might not be able to get out if I go back in. </i> She wiped the sweat from her brow and pulled on the eighth board, this time catching herself before falling over. Eyeing the hole, she tried to squeeze through, but found the hole was still too small. She slid back out and stood in front of the hole, sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so much more work than I thought it would be...\"</span></div></div>",

Better than being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled down stairs, her whole body jiggling. The smells from the kitchen delighted her nostrils. She wished she had been repulsed, but even she couldn't deny part of her was excited to fill her massively grown tummy. Sitting down at the head of the table in a new specially reinforced bench seat, Maggie picked up a donut, one that looked similar to the first thing she ate at that fattening house. In three bites it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job honey!\" Her mom cheered. Maggie figured her parents must have been forced to try and look happy about this arrangement. \"Jason's on his way over.\" Maggie's mom informed her, as she continued to eat anything within reach. \"Don't worry, he knows all about this as well. He has to take you out to fattening and filling meals at all times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie continued to eat, but was feeling dead inside. She though that once she got away from that house that would be the end of it. Now with all this, there was no chance at losing all this poundage. How far was this monster going to take this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of feasting, Jason arrived. She could here him rushing into the house. \"Maggie!\" He shouted as he entered the kitchen getting his first look at her. Normally she would have gotten up and given her boyfriend a hug, but that would have taken longer than normal. Jason threw his arms around her neck from the side, giving her the best hug he could. \"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I'm sure you mom told you that he's got me wrapped up in this too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason I don't want you to be effected by this. I want you to dump me so at least you can be free.\" Maggie had given this some thought after her mother told her what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't break up with you, it's one of the rules. Plus I don't want you to have to go through this alone. I'm the only one at school who knows what's going on. Sadly I do have to ask if you want to go out and get some food though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just refuse! I'll refuse to go out with you, I'll refuse to eat all the food my parents give to me! I can beat this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do that though, the man with hurt your family and mine. I know it's a big ask, but I think we just have to go along with this for now. So what do you say, in the mood for some BBQ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie felt more defeated than ever. She was even pissed at the thought that BBQ sounded pretty good right about now. She wondered if she should just give in to all of this at eat it up and be fat. Part of her really wanted to figure out what was really going on here though. Why was she chosen? How did this guy have so much money to keep her fat? What was the point of all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than her hungry, she was driven for answers, and she was going to find them.</span></div></div>",

Maggie was so embarrassed it had come to this, but her mind was suddenly distracted when she pick up the menu. Their serve came by quickly and Jason took care of the ordering. To Maggie it sounded like he was reading the menu off item for item. Maggie was shocked by the amount of food ordered, but also kinda excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appetizers came out first, and Maggie was quick to pick them clean. Then the main courses started showing up in droves. Racks of ribs, cuts of steak, sweet bbq chicken breasts, smoked meats, plus plenty of sides.

Jason spent the whole time making sure Maggie always had something within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all the plates were empty, and Maggie could only look on in the destruction she had left in her wake. She had stuffed her face for an entire hour. The staff came and cleared all the empty plates before returning with a course of dessert. Maggie didn't want to continue, but she had to admit that the desserts were a nice palette cleanser from all that smokey and tangy BBQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason helped her up and back to the car. Despite her full stomach, her entire body jiggled with each step. \"See that wasn't so bad.\" Jason said as they started to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was such a pig.

Want to see this through with you.\" Jason, hiding his true feelings that he loved her and her fat body. He knew Maggie wasn't quite ready to accept that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her at home, Maggie waddled inside to find her parents with plenty of food prepared for her. \"Honey why don't you have a seat in the living room, dad and I have made some cookies and brownies for you.\" Maggie just shrugged as she knew there was no getting out of it.</span></div></div>",
