He's in for a real surprise tomorrow.\" Lauren began to chuckle, darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft; I knew you'd cave,\" Natalie said. \"There was no way you were going to abandon him there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it IS just for the night,\" Lauren said. \"After all, I haven't had my fill of fun yet. And my brother is just the right kind of toy to play around with.\" Lauren's words got the girls laughing again...except for the fifth girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie so far had been quiet. She'd partaken in the games and prank they pulled on Mark that night, but ever since they left the house, she was uneasy. She didn't think that Lauren would actually go through with it...She couldn't help but feel bad for Mark; Hell, technically speaking, in some countries, what they did was considered as \"Slave-Trading.\" And she felt really bad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls...Um...You don't think we might've crossed a line, do you?\" she asked them. Suddenly all the girls slowed their laughing and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sarah asked. \"We're just having good fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it started out as fun,\" Sarah said. \"But...I can't help but feel like we've gone too far with this. I mean, Mark didn't seem like he was having any fun at all. And we just left him there at the store...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I'm going back for him,\" Lauren said. \"Besides, no matter how much he struggled, I know that he's enjoying this deep down, the little perv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't think Mark is ever going to trust you ever again after tonight, and he's going to be really mad when we let him out of there,\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little shrimp is too weak to do anything about it; let him fume,\" Lauren said. \"Besides...who says we ARE going to let him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes went wide with fear when Lauren said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't mean,\" Natalie began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I said I'd pick him up from the store tomorrow, doesn't mean I'm done playing with him,\" Lauren said. \"Nope, I think I'm going to enjoy my new toy for a long time coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's words were starting to scare Katie; how far was she willing to let this go? She first started to get nervous when they revealed the box, and the life-sized doll they'd taken from inside of it. Lauren dressed it up just like Mark...It was disturbing. Now it sounded like she was legitimately thinking that the doll could replace her brother. How would she...Then the solution came to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about when your parents find out? You said they'd be coming back tomorrow. They're not going to fall for it,\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my parents already know about it,\" Lauren said. That threw all of the girls. \"Yeah, when I told them my plan, they thought it would be funny; they were all for it. In fact, they'll be taking me to the store to get him tomorrow. And afterwards, Mom and I are going to walk him around town, just to embarrass him further, while dad converts his bedroom to a nursery. Besides, it's MY birthday after all...Why shouldn't I get what I want? And I ALWAYS get what I want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was taken aback by all of this. The thought of her parents actually condoning what they'd done, but also enabling it made her stomach flip. The girls were returning to their half-drunk laughing-fest, while Katie legitimately thought she'd throw up. How could Lauren be THIS cruel over an accident? To treat her own brother like this? And what's worse is, Katie herself helped her do it. She thought that it was just a harmless little game between them. Part of her couldn't believe that she'd let them out of the house when they did it...but now, she was legitimately scared...What would Lauren do to HER if she objected? If her parents were in on it, she'd have an easier time getting away with it...And what scared Katie even more, what if HER own parents condoned what happened to her as well...It was frightening. And through all of the fear she was experiencing, she thought about how Poor Mark must've experienced it too...only much, much worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were soon back at Lauren's place, drinking and having laughs over Mark's expense. The girls were drinking again; Katie in particularly, to try and stop shaking from her adrenaline fear. However, during the Girls' horseplay, Lauren accidentally spilled a beer all over her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh; well that's just great,\" Lauren said as her beer soaked shirt began to cling to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo - Wet T-Shirt contest!\" Natalie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Lauren said dismissing the contest. \"My parents will kill me if we stain the floors. I've got to get out of this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, free show!\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it off!\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if, you hos,\" Lauren said standing up. \"I'm going to go get changed. Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren walked off to her bedroom to grab a spare top. Pulling the shirt over her head made her realize just how tipsy she was. She was starting to worry she'd be too hung over to go pick-up Mark tomorrow. Not that she really cared; the little twerp deserved what he got. Now that she was in her new top, she looked across her room and noticed her collection of Dolls. They were her absolute favorite; cute little stuffed baby rag-dolls, all wearing different outfits; they were her prized collection. And at the center of bunch was her first and all time favorite doll...Lala, a doll in a frilly pink petticoat and a diaper, and her hair in twin tails with cute ribbons and a bow. However, this particular doll, unlike the others, was missing one button-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLala was the first \"dolly\" that her father ever bought her on her birthday when she was a little girl. And ever since, Lala was her favorite toy and prized possession. That was until just a few days ago, thanks to that little twerp, Mark. She occasionally liked messing with him from time to time, so while he was wasting time playing video games, she asked him to come to her room and help move her dresser for her. She of course left him to do all the heavy-lifting. Too bad the little-shrimp was so pathetically weak that he dropped the dresser right on top of Lala, breaking her poor eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smirked as she went over to Lala and picked her up, holding her close to her face.<br>\r\n\"I got him back, Lala...I made him pay for what he did to you. He's going to serve as your replacement for a while. Now he'll know what it's like...\" Lauren gave Lala a light kiss, before putting her back down and turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren...\" she heard a light, high-pitched, little girl voice say. She spun around fast and saw no one there. For a moment, she considered that it was just her imagination, when she heard it call again. \"Lauren...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lala?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Lauren,\" Lala said. This didn't seem possible; Lala didn't even have a voice-box; there was no way she could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the girls must've spiked my drink with PCP or something,\" Lauren said. \"Or maybe I'm dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a dream, Lauren...I'm talking to you,\" Lala said...and this time, Lauren saw the seam that served as Lala's smile come apart, opening up her mouth and moving like a muppet. \"We need to talk, Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lala...You can talk?!\" Lauren said now picking Lala up. \"H-How, why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always been able to talk, Lauren,\" Lala said. \"We just haven't needed to say anything until now. We can see and hear all the things you do, ever since you brought us home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others, Lauren...All of us,\" Lala said. Before her very eyes, Lauren saw the other dolls in her collection suddenly move. They lifted their blank faces and stared at her. \"We've been watching you, playing with you...all your life, since you got us. And tonight...you've made us very unhappy, Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What - what did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke one of the rules, Lauren,\" Lala said - her small girlish voice was starting to sound creepy and threatening. \"You crossed the line; violated the sacred barrier between People and Toys...What you did to your brother...it was wrong, Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's eyes widened. Her toys were starting to talk to her, and were upset with her after what she did to Mark.<br>\r\n\"B-b-but, but...It was just a prank. We're just having fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother didn't look like he was having fun, Lauren...He clearly didn't like what you did to him. And now, he's scared, and alone, knowing that his own sister has betrayed him...abandoning him in a cold dark store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it might be harsh but,\" Lauren tried to justify. \"I did it to get back at him for what he did to you; he broke your eye...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What he did was an accident Lauren...a mere accident, easily repaired. But what you did to him. You broke your relationship with him, in a way that can't be fixed, Lauren. He's never going to trust you, ever again. But more importantly, you violated some of the sacred rules; treating your own brother as a mere object...as a toy. We are Toys, Lauren...we were made for this. Your brother is a human. There are rules about what you...and your friends did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'rules'? Sacred? What are you saying?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see soon enough, Lauren...But for now...You need to be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren was very frightened by what Lala was saying. Right now, she was hoping that if this was a dream or a hallucination, that she'd come out of it. All of this was so nuts, she couldn't believe any of it; her Dolls were alive and they were displeased with how she'd treated her brother. This was crazy. But Lala didn't say anything else, and her blank expression and cold, dead remaining button eye served to unnerve Lauren even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren flinched when she heard one of the girls scream from out in the living room. She rushed to the door of her bedroom and went down the hallway to the living room where the slumber party was. Her eyes were wide and her mouth was agape with terror; the life-sized doll that she'd made-up to resemble Mark...She'd left it on the couch, as one last \"surprise\" for Mark so he'd realize just how far they were willing to take this \"game\" of theirs. The girls had enjoyed gawking at it, making fun of it, and pretending that it WAS the real Mark; talking to it, flirting with it even...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It was standing up. It was looking from girl to girl in the living room, with it's glassy, painted eyes. Slowly it turned its head toward the hallway, completely disregarding the limits of the joint and turning a full 180 degrees to look directly at Lauren with its blank smile. She stood there shivering, terrified of what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab her,\" Lala suddenly said. Lauren flinched when suddenly the life-sized doll came rushing towards her, snapping its head back around and coming at her with its arms raised. Lauren screamed and tried to retreat, only to stumble into the wall. The doll grabbed her arm. This was a true nightmare; she was getting over the shock of realizing that Lala and the Dollies were alive; she didn't take the time to consider what this thing could do if it was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the hand gripped her wrist, she realized just how strong it was. She screamed for her friends to help her, before the doll suddenly seized her throat with its free hand. Lauren was choking, but the Doll merely tilted its head, curiously and it's frozen, plastic expression gave it a terrifying look of indifference to her suffering. The doll was so powerful that it actually lifted Lauren off her feet and held her in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie and Sasha sprang to their feet and rushed toward the Mark-doll. They threw their arms over his shoulders and tried to pull him away from Lauren. But the doll suddenly turned its torso on a joint, swinging its free arm and the subdued Lauren with him, smacking the girls away, they flew back toward the living room, where the other girls tried to help him. The Mark-Doll took a step and advanced into the living room, when suddenly the doors to Lauren and Mark's rooms from down the hall flung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls were astonished to see that pouring out of the rooms were a small army of toys; most of them were made up of Lauren's Dolly collection, and the rest were various random toys that Mark had in his room - various GI Joes, Transformers, Dinosaurs. And even scarier, they were carrying rather long extension cords and one of them had a roll of duct-tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Mark Doll tossed Lauren into the group of girls who were now cowering, huddled in the middle of the living room as the toys began to surround them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Fuck is going on here?!\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, this can't be happening; why can't I wake up?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET THEM!\" Lala shouted, ordering the army of toys to advance on the girls. Out of nowhere a flood of plastic and plush felt material washed over the girls, practically burying them. They felt tiny little hands grabbing at their fingers and pulling their hair. Surprisingly strong and heavy forms grabbing their arms by the wrists, pulling them behind them and forcing them to roll over. The Mark Doll stood over Lauren now that she'd been pinned, with her arms behind her back, and took the extension cord from one of the other toys. It began to bind Lauren at the wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a small plastic boot descended into Lauren's field of vision. When she looked up, she could see a GI Joe figure standing over her, scowling. It's plastic face moved with each expression; so uncanny, so frightening.<br>\r\n\"You! You are an absolute disgrace, you little brat! How dare you do that to our Mark?!\" the army-man scolded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Joe,\" Lala said emerging from the chaos surrounding the girls. \"They'll get what they deserve soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! They come with accessories!\" one of the dolls said, carrying one of the girls' purses toward them. \"They'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?! Why is this happening?!\" Katie asked, before a transformer toy slapped a piece of duct-tape over her mouth, silencing her. Before each of the girls knew it, they were all tied up and gagged with duct-tape, and now sitting in a group against the couch in the middle of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLala stood at the head of the army of toys.<br>\r\n\"You girls are guilty of violating the sacred bonds of family, the sacred bonds of friendship, and most heinously, the sacred bond between Man and Toy-kind. You violated these trusts by effectively kidnapping a young man, holding him against his will, and effectively trying to make him into a Toy. Not only did you use this boy for your own amusement, but you abandoned him out in the world, where he could easily be taken outside of your ability to retrieve, just to humiliate him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was listening to all of this in abject horror. Somehow or another, these toys were alive and were punishing them for what they did to Mark. Her heart sank and she turned white; she knew that they'd be in deep trouble for this. She assumed that Mark would be psychologically traumatized for what they did. But now, they were being subjected by a tribunal of toys, having violated some sacred rules that the Toys held dear, that they didn't know about...Or maybe they did know, but they trampled on them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark was not meant to be a toy; his frail human brain cannot handle the psychological implications of what being a toy entails. For this, you girls have most likely caused irreparable damage to him. Most importantly, you girls made a mockery of toy-culture, violating the sacred trust between a child and their toys, and destroying the trust between a brother to his sister and friends. For this we find the five of you; Lauren, Natalie, Amy, Sarah, Katie - guilty as charged on all accounts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were frightened now and continued to struggle against their restraints. Lauren pitched herself forward and looked directly at Lala with her pleading eyes, that were on the verge of tears. She tried to speak through her tape, but the sound was muffled.<br>\r\n\"Mla-la...Pmwsss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You think that you'll garner sympathy, or mercy from me? Because of our history, our relationship? Unfortunately Lauren, you've put me in a position where I have no choice but to be objective. As your first toy, it's my responsibility to hold you accountable for these violations...And while I'm not supposed to take any personal stakes in this endeavor...You DID say that Mark's purpose in this \"prank\" of yours...was to Replace Me...Therefore, we sentence you to 'Rehabilitation,' until such time where it can be determined that yu have truly repented for your crimes against your brother and of toy-kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were scared. What the hell did Rehabilitation mean to a toy? What were they going to do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLala then turned to the Mark Doll. \"Go get the van started.\" Without question, the life-sized doll moved toward the front door. Before long the girls could hear the engine revving up outside. Lala then turned to some of the other toys. \"Take them to the factory...Give them the treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treatment? What the hell could the treatment be?! The girls continued to struggle. Lala moved toward Lauren and stood on her bound knee. It was creepy seeing Lala move; it was so unnatural.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lauren. Very soon you will understand everything...and you'll have the chance to learn and improve from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mark Doll returned. Lala looked up at him. \"Load them into the Van, and then take me with you to the front seat. We're going to find Mark and set him free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mark Doll reached down and picked up Sarah and carried her out the door, to put her in the back of the van. It returned and grabbed Natalie next. While it was working, Lala moved toward Katie, who had fallen on her side. She was frightened when Lala was in front of her, staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...We were watching you,\" she said. \"You hesitated when it began. You know...don't you? You feel the fear that Mark now knows...You're sorry for what you and the others did to him.\" Katie slowly began to nod her head. She meant it, and part of her hoped it would get her out of this. \"Good...then we'll depend on you. When rehabilitation begins, we'll use you as our liaison with Mark. We're going to need you to help him understand the rules, and help get him through this...It's going to be rough on everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes widened. What the Hell did the doll mean by that? Suddenly Katie felt dozens of small felt and plastic hands grab her undersides and lift her off the ground. She found herself being carried by a group of dolls to the van, where she was unceremoniously thrown into the back of the van, on top of Lauren and Sarah. Fortunately she'd landed on Lauren's considerable chest to soften the fall. But now all the girls were squirming about in the back of the van, trying to get free. Amy was thrown on top of them, and the doors were shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toy army loaded into the van and the Mark Doll began to drive, taking them to their unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the night get this bad?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark stood there uncomfortably as his arms and legs were bound to the cardboard walls. He initially thought that with enough force he'd be able to rip his binds straight through the cardboard and get free; but as it turns out the box was surprisingly strong, and he was just to weak to pull them free. With barely having any space in the box, he wasn't able to gain any leverage or apply any force against the wall. His face and mouth hurt as the straps of the gag pressed against his cheeks. Out of anything right now, he wished he could just reach up to the straps on the back of his head and undo the buckle. But it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's eyes began to water as he stood there, looking through the plastic visor covering the front of the box. It exposed him to the outside world to the humiliation that was sure to come when the store opened in the morning. What's worse is, Mark was positioned in the Store's Display window, which meant he was looking out onto the street, meaning that everybody could see him. Mark couldn't believe that Lauren would actually do this to him. It started out rather harmless; just a game the girls were playing, and Mark felt he owed Lauren since it was her birthday. But then when she revealed the Box and the real doll that came with it, now dressed up like a mock-version of himself, that was when this game went too far. But then she and her friends loaded him up into the box and restrained his arms and legs before gagging him. They loaded him up into the van and drove him to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doll itself was a \"Dolly-Wolly,\" a new line of life-sized toys that were incredibly life-like. Mark couldn't believe that Lauren could afford this, but his parents were quite well-to-do. What was really unbelievable is the lengths that she'd go to for this prank of hers. She had bought a doll that looked just like Lala, just to get her hands on an outfit to fit Mark. She dressed up the Doll as Mark, and then kept referring to Mark himself as her new Doll...one that she didn't quite like, so she wanted to take it back to the store and exchange it for another one. And that's how Mark found himself here...Amy worked at the store and managed to get them inside after closing. They put him up on display with the other life-sized dolls...and then they left him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat scared him even more, was what could be the last thing that Lauren said to him before leaving.<br>\r\n\"Bye Dolly-Wolly! I might come back and buy you tomorrow...that is...if someone else doesn't buy you first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark realized that was a genuine possibility; that someone else might come, be fooled enough into believing he was a doll and buying him first. Part of him wondered what would happen AFTER that; if they'd freak out at seeing a human that's been dressed like a doll; maybe they'd help him file some kind of lawsuit against Lauren for this, or maybe they'd treat him like a doll just like Lauren and her friends did. There's a chance that he could be taken away and never see his family again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to start crying when he suddenly saw headlights appear and turn toward the store. It was the Van! Mark gave a sigh of relief; the girls were just joking and they came back for him. But he got a bit alarmed when he saw the person step out of the car. He could barely see who it was that stepped out of the van, due to the bright headlights pouring in. But he could tell by the silhouette, it wasn't any of the girls; it was a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt a bit worried at the idea that someone else was coming here. But they had arrived in the Girls' van and it was still too early for the store to open, so it wasn't an employee or a manager. Maybe it was his dad? Maybe they caught wind of what Lauren had did and came to rescue him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark heard the door opening and before long, he felt something grab the box he was in and slide it off of the shelf in the display window. Mark watched as his view from the Box's visor changed to be turned away from the window and into the dark store. Suddenly Mark felt the restraints on his arms and wrists coming undone; they were setting him free!<br>\r\nAs soon as Mark's hands were free, he immediately went for his gag; he undid the buckle and loosened the straps, pulling the damn thing off his face, with a stinging sensation in his cheeks as they adjusted to their freedom from the pressure they were under. Mark looked down at hit and glared...The gag was a Pacifier; he was certainly going to get back at Lauren for dressing him up like a giant baby. No; not a baby...a doll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box's flaps were then undone shortly after Mark's legs were freed. Mark immediately rushed out of the box, dropping the pacifier gag onto the ground, coughing. He was so glad to breathe air that didn't have cardboard particles in it.<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Oh thank you so much!\" Mark said turning. \"I know that all of this is hard to explain but - WHAAAAA?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned around to meet himself standing there; only it wasn't himself - it was the doll that Lauren made-up to look like him, staring back at him with the empty plastic eyes and painted on smile. It tilted its head, curious to Mark's reaction. Mark on the other hand was believing that he had in fact lost his mind after this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Mark, don't worry; we're here to help you,\" Mark heard a high pitched voice say. Mark had been backing away from the living doll so much that he eventually stumbled in the play-heel shoes Lauren had put on him. Fortunately the diaper the girls had put him in was padded enough to absorb his fall. When he fell he suddenly spotted something that terrified him even more than his plastic counterpart. It was Lala - Lauren's favorite doll - standing by its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lala?!\" Mark asked breathlessly. He was terrified seeing the doll move toward him; it was the creepiest thing he'd seen all night, so unnatural. He saw that Lala was still missing one of her button eyes; the one he'd broke. He tried backing away, expecting the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath Mark,\" the doll said, moving its mouth like a hand puppet. \"We set you free; we've come to rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions were going through Mark's head. \"What? How? Why? Where?! I must've cracked; you're toys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down, Mark,\" Lala said. \"Yes we are toys, and that will be hard to explain. What you need to know now, is that we saw what Lauren and her friends did to you...and it upset us greatly. Which is why we came to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mad at Lauren and not me?\" Mark asked. \"B-b-but I...I uh...I broke your eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark...that was an accident,\" Lala said bluntly. \"Besides, you immediately apologized to Lauren for it and offered to fix me to try and make her feel better; you're a good brother, Mark. But despite all of that, what Lauren did was unacceptable. We had to undo what they did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big doll then moved toward Mark and offered its hand to him. Mark tentatively took it and the doll helped him up. It was strange; the cold plastic felt odd to hold, yet it had such a gentle grasp. The doll still creepily stared at Mark with that blank expression of its. Suddenly it lifted up its arms and began taking its shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's he doing?\" Mark asked Lala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Dolly wants her clothes back,\" Lala said gesturing to Mark's outfit. \"No offense to you, Mark; but Dolly doesn't like being a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doll removed its wig that allowed it to resemble Mark, and Mark realized of course what that meant. He himself complied taking the wig the girls had put on him off, shaking his real hair free. He of course decided to comply with the doll; after all, it was wearing HIS clothes after all; seemed like a fair trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the buttons for this thing are in the back, and I can't undo them,\" Mark said. \"The girls didn't want me getting out on my own.\" Dolly moved toward Mark and began undoing the buttons. \"Why doesn't 'Dolly' talk like you, Lala?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dolly is a young-toy; new off the shelves. She's very shy about these things,\" Lala said. It wasn't long before Mark and Dolly had switched clothes and Mark was back to his old self again, save for the make-up the girls put on him. He smeared it trying to get it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this stuff doesn't come off that easily; I'll have to wash my face when I get home; and then I'll have some words for Lauren and the Bitch-Brigade!\" Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, Mark; the make-up should be gone when you wake up tomorrow,\" Lala said. \"And Lauren and her friends are being punished as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark didn't like the sound of that; Lala's squeaky voice saying something so dark and menacing was creepy.<br>\r\n\"Punished? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see, but for now, don't worry about anything, Mark,\" Lala said. \"When you wake-up tomorrow, most of everything will be as if tonight never happened. And you will have a package waiting for you in your room. Just be sure to follow the instructions, don't break the rules, and try to have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mark could ask another question, Lala spoke again. \"And above all else Mark...Play Nice...remember, this is just as much your test as it will be for Lauren and her friends. But for right now...Its time for rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLala's words were so threatening to Mark as he listened, wondering if his sister and her friends were alright. When suddenly he felt the heavy plastic hand of \"Dolly\" come down on his shoulder at the curve of his neck, striking him hard. And he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and the girls were tied to chairs in a warehouse, their gags were removed. They screamed for help when they could, but no one came. They wondered what the toys were going to do to them. Slowly they saw the army of toys emerge from the darkness. They were carrying what looked like canisters of Lucite - a fast-hardening liquid plastic - and some had electronic voice-boxes. And as they approached the girls...they were chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One-of-Us, Goo-Ball-Goo! One-of-Us, Toy-Box-Crew! One-of-Us, Goo-Ball-Goo! One-of-Us, Toy-Box-Crew!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>15 year-old Ryan Jordan was going through that special time of life that every teenage boy goes through: puberty. All of a sudden, girls he would normally just talk to casually he blushes around, and he's been increasingly more interested in the female form as a whole. So much, in fact, that one day he sees a bunch of cute female figurines at a run-down but reliable shop one day he frequently visited, wanting to buy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the window of the shop, known as \"Mr. Johnson's Shop of Strange and Wonderful Things\", he could easily see the five beautiful figurines, all of which were very detailed, right down to having actual fabric for their clothes. He even found it cute that there were all lined up in alphabetical order, starting with Amy to the far left and ending with Emelia to the far right. Ryan had a difficult time deciding which one to get, but with the price tag as is (almost 100 dollars), he could only afford one. He had previously saved up the money to buy some new video games, but Ryan's hormones got the best of him and he bought one of the figurines in a heartbeat, with the store keeper swiftly putting it in the box it came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryan picked up the Amy figuirne, and as he was given a plastic bag to put it in, the store keeper gave the boy one last thing to go with it. It looked like a black box, a perfect 5-inch square, and with it an instruction book entitled \"getting the most of your new figurine purchase\". Ryan looked very confused by the whole thing and prompted to ask the man what this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's simply a surprise for you, lucky customer\", the old man giggled to himself. He then walked up to the front of the store and took the other four figurines you didn't buy and placed them in the bag as well, putting them all in their respective boxes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you giving me ALL of them!? But I don't have enough money for all five\", the worried Ryan told the storekeeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, boy\", the old man said to the boy, smiling with his teeth showing. \"Those figurines have been there for months, and no one's once purchased them. Consider it a present from me to you as a valuable customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", Ryan smiled in reply as he put the four in his plastic bag. The cheerful 15 year-old then ran quickly back home, which was only a few minutes walking distance away. He felt proud yet silly at the same time for his purchase, since Ryan never had dolls in his room growing up...aside from plush dolls of animals. To him, it was like he just purchased five Barbie dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Ryan had just lost a battle with his hormones, and the boy quickly ran into his house and went straight up to his bedroom. He cleared his bed of the magazines he had on it, placed his school bag in the right corner of the room, and sat down on his bed, putting down the plastic bag containing the figurines he had just purchased next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he opened one of the figurines, though, he looked at the black box he had put in the bag with the five figurines, as well as the instruction box that came with it. The instruction book was about the size of a video gae instruction booklet, if not a litle smaller, and as Ryan opened it to pages 2 and 3, he saw something that struck him as odd:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Grow and shrink your figurines'\", he read out loud the title of the second page, confused by the whole ordeal. \"To make your girl grow to the desired height of your choosing, simply place your mouth next to the black box, say their name, and then enter the desire height. For example, if you wanted to shrink your desired girl to 3 inches, you would say 'A, shrink to 3 inches', and in an instant she'll shrink to that height.' Or if you want them to grow, say 'B, grow to one foot tall', and they'll grow quickly to that height. To turn her back to normal, simply say 'A, return to normal', and they'll shrink back to their original size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was confused. Was this a joke? Figurines can't grow or shrink. And why did the manual call them \"girls\", not \"figurines\"? Ryan was even more baffled by the instruction booklet, flipping through the other 6 pages to see if there was any mention of the word \"figurine\", but there wasn't except for the title of page 2. Both curious and confused, Ryan then reaced into his plastic bag that contained the five figurines and picked out one of them to open up and test this on. He ended up choosing:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan ended up choosing Amy. Of all the girls she seemed the most normal and down to earth one. He walked over to his desk and removed her from her box. Just as he's about to try it he thinks to himself, \"What am doing? This is probably going to be like those stupid growing dinosaurs I had as a kid that were supposed to grow when you put them in water\". Ryan then looks over at the Amy figurine standing on his desk. She is beautiful in her own way. \"I wish I could have a girlfriend like her\", Ryan sighed to himelf. He then picks up the black box he recieved with his figurines and spoke into it: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Amy, five foot three inches\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then stares at the figurine. Nothing happens for like a whole minute. Just as he's about to turn away, though, something happens. Amy started rapidly increasing in size and jumped off his desk, landing safely on the carpet ground. In a matter of a few second she's five foot three inches, as well as live. She looked at Ryan and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Amy. What's your name?\" the girl cheerfully chirped to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-Ryan\", he stammered in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-Ryan? That's an unusual name\", she replied, loking a little confused.  Ryan then stuck out his hand and poked Amy in the stomach with his finger. The girl giggled in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, you're real!\", he yells as he jumped back from the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm real, silly\", Amy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from? What do you want?\" Ryan asked. Amy simply shrugged her shoulders, smiles, and replies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where I came from, and I want to do what ever you want to do\".</span></div></div>",

Perhaps he should sell the figurines back and, well, go after real girls to talk to? Or maybe he should the figures away until he was older and sell them for a more collective value? Reluctantly Ryan then told Amy,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Amy, but I'm afraid I have to put you away for a while in storage\", he explained to the 5 foot 3 girl before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\", Amy sadly replied, her head frowning as she said so. \"But maybe in the future you'll find a use for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you understand\", Ryan replied happily, holding the black box in his hand. \"Amy, six inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then watched Amy shrink back to her original height, and the boy put the girl away back in the box and taped the box top open. Right before he put the five boxes away in the closet, Amy spoke in lip \"Until we meet again\". Ryan simply nodded in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- TWENTY YEARS LATER -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow thirty-five, Ryan had settled down and married a girl he met in college. The two were wed almost ten years ago and had their first child seven years ago: a boy. Two years later, they had another child, who was a girl. As Ryan proceeded to clean out his son's closet to look for anything to give away, he saw five dusty boxes. Ryan proceeded to blow the dust off of them and remembered that they were the five figurines he put twenty years ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be\", he said in shock as he looked at the figurines, who didn't look a day older than when he bought them. \"I remember these. Maybe Rachel (his daughter) will like these.\" The five year old in question, meanwhile, was playing with stuffed animals in her room to the right of her brother's. Ryan scooped up all five boxes and proceeded to enter Rachel's room, placing the boxes on the ground next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Rachel\", he told the girl, placing the black box on the ground next to the five boxes. \"These are dolls I bought long ago. You can have them if you want.\" The curious five year old stopped playing with her stuffed dinosaurs and proceeded to get a closer look to the \"dolls\", pulling all five of them out of their boxes and placing them on their backs on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they're cute\", Rachel smiled in glee at her new dolls. \"Thank you, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. But be careful\", Ryan noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Daddy?\" Rachel asked, confused by her father's warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more to these girls than they seem\", he smiled as he left his daughter's room, closing the door behind her. Rachel, meanwhile, proceeded to pick up the Amy doll and move her around a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\", Amy smiled to the girl. \"You must be R-R-Ryan's daughter. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you talk\", Rachel said in astonishment. She then pointed to the other dolls, and although she didn't ask if they could talk as well, Amy understood the girl's body message well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they can\", Amy smiled to Rachel. \"And I hope you enjoy our company and take good care of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Miss Amy. I will!\"</span></div></div>",

The girl in question, meanwhile, watched the environment around her get bigger and bigger until she was even smaller than she was before.

I wonder what it was... I'd like it to have been that you won me in a horse race from some nasty old slave owner, though you don't look like much of a rider and I'm better than most everybody. Oh! Maybe I rid your horse to victory. That sounds good. I do like horses and riding. I'd like that to have been the case... though it doesn't sound too likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, it does sound like some tale out of a book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Book?  What's a book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Waving his hand at his bookcase, Ryan said toe Amy, \"Surely you know what a book is. Everybody does.\" Advancing to the bookcase, Amy answered, \"I am not everybody.\" She selects a book at random and looks it over as if she has never held one before. When her unsure grip allows it to flop open to a page, she looks startled, and worried. \"Oh dear, did I break it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No..\", a befuddled Ryan told her, having problems absorbing all of this, but he managed to stammer out, \"Ah, you can read, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Of course I can read and write\", Amy told Ryan as she took glances at the book in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But you've never seen a book before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, never.  What is ...?\" Glancing at the open page, Amy continued, \"Oh, I see.  A book is a way to hold words, which yes I can read ...'Her brazenly exposed aroused peaks were like proffered fruit, awaiting his tender tou\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     But by this point Ryan has snatched the book from her hands.  How had one of those gotten in the bookcase?  Mom would have a fit if she found out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201dAh, that will do, Amy\", a worried Ryan said to the girl as he placed the book down under his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amy, however, was not so sure  \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that meant, but it sounded interesting...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMaybe later.  Right now I want to ask some more questions.\u201d  Ryan thought this was getting distinctly weird, and it was getting more so.  Amy knew a great deal of routine things, but had a great many gaps in her knowledge, and Ryan could find no pattern to what she did and did not know.  To keep it confusing, she knew a number of things that Ryan didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cYou can\u2019t remember any names or personal data, or dates, or anything like that.  I guess you have amnesia\u2026Ah, you know what that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cSure\u201d, Amy answers in her normal, cheerful voice. \u201cMemory loss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan doesn\u2019t press her on the definition.  His own knowledge on the subject was pretty much limited to a few TV shows, which brings up the question of how a lass who didn\u2019t know what a TV was would know that. Just one more strange part of her mind like many others\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cAt first I thought you were just some strange doll, but you seem to have been a person before you were a doll\u2026But wait a second. You didn\u2019t put your underclothes back on?\u201d  Ryan had not been looking as she had dressed herself, an action dictated by his desire to get himself under control, a feeling she needed a little privacy, and by cowardice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cThey were too much trouble and in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cBut women always wear them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cI never have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A rather interesting [perhaps too interesting as he threatens to embarrass himself again] example of her ability to talk confidently of a past she can\u2019t remember. Indeed, Amy seemed to say \u201calways\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d, and \u201cI have no idea\u201d almost at random.  But this case is odd. Haven\u2019t women always worn panties and bras?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Time to get another source of information.  Maybe turn to the other dolls?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll likely enlarge all of them soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Looks like a good choice\", Amy said in agreement of Ryan's choice.

He's going to protect me ...\" Emelia paused for a second and then hugged Ryan closer as she continued  \"Well, from everything.  This is a strange, dangerous new world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Little scaredy cat. This is a chance for adventure and fun\", taunted Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But it's so new, so different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You can tell it's different? How?\"  Ryan breaks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I'm not sure, but it seems reasonable, and anything different can be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Really, I named you well,\" Amy muttered as she twisted a braid.  \"You're just scared of everything, including ... BOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once again, Ryan was driven flat on the bed as Emelia thrust into him.  As Amy giggled, Emelia hid her face in Ryan's shoulder and cried. Many would denounce a woman's tears as a cheap trick to get male sympathy. While many women reject this charge, one has to admit a lot of men are very eager to fall for it.  Ryan was among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That wasn't nice, Amy. The poor girl is scared and need comforting, not teasing.  You should apologize!\" Ryan yelled at the other living doll in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"She needs to grow a spine\",  Amy replied. She wasn't the least bit remorseful for what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Look, if she actually was a scared little kitten, would you scare her like that?\" Ryan asked Amy as he patted Emelia's head as she continued to whimper in his shirt. Amy considered this for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You do have a point.  Mind you, I might well later, because she has got to get over this, but I guess a new kitten does need comforting...\" Advancing to Emelia, Amy tenderly patted her and assured her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So yes, dear, I apologize.  I don't mean you any harm, and I will protect you and help you. But don't get your hopes too high. You can't be scared of everything and live. You're going to have to learn to grow some nerve, and I'm going to make sure you do.  But you can be sure I am not dangerous to you, and I will help you when I can.\" Ryan the handed Amy a tissue, who then gave it to Emelia to wear her tears with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Feel better?\" Amy asked of Emelia. \"Then wipe your eyes.  I think Ryan wants to ask you some questions.\" Emelia still looked fearful, but when Ryan added his assurances she became much calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, Ryan. What do you want to know?\"</span></div></div>",

One of them, anyway.  \"What is a computer?\" was a bit of a downer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Com-puter? Well...somebody who computes?\" was Emelia's answer, not knowing what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"How about a car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes, they are part of a train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You have the engine and then the coal car, and the passenger cars and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

Well... \", Emilia started to look worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now don't be upset, Scaredy Cat\", Amy broke in. \"You're not supposed to be able to answer all these questions.  And so far, you are getting more right than I did.  So there is no reason to panic over not knowing some. By the way, what is a train?\" Emelia looked startled at what Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But everyone knows what a train is... Well, maybe not everybody.  There are places they don't go to\", Emelia told Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amy then confessed without concern, \"I have no idea. What are coal cars and passenger cars and how are they involved? How do trains go to something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Emelia then began to explain what a train was to Amy. It was quicky clear Amy really had no idea of what a train was, nor what train tracks were, nor... As Emilia rattled on, Ryan just listened, until it dawned on him there was something odd about Emilia's description...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wait a moment\", Ryan breaks in. \"You said coal car on the train?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes, a train has a coal car, right behind the engine. That's right, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, it was...\", Ryan told Emelia. When had coal been replaced by diesel again? 50 years ago? 100 years ago? Ryan wasn't even sure if he had ever seen one outside of books and pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But let's go on.  For now at least, it likely doesn't matter\", he said to Emelia before asking her more questions. The additional questions, though, revealed the same pattern as with Amy: wholesale ignorance of a great many things. Emelia's history, personal and otherwise, was an absolute blank, and it seemed that a great many parts of Ryan's daily life were just new to her.  But every so often she revealed knowledge of the past, which seemed quite different from anything Ryan was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This is weird...Well, it was weird to start with, but...Well, I guess I should ask another girl and see what she knows\", Ryan thought to himself as he looked at Amy and Emelia. With that, he grabbed another doll almost at random, noticing who it was only as he prepared to enlarge her. It was...</span></div></div>",

Neither condition was a serious problem, but they reminded him he was in his room, and it was already full with just the two girls.  Three might be a little much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cIt\u2019s getting crowded in here.  I\u2019d best shrink you two so we can have a little room.\u201d  Amy makes no objection, but Emelia needed additional assurance he would still be protecting her.  But then \u201cAmy, 1 foot\u201d, followed by \u201cEmelia, 1 foot\u201d and the two girls shrank to their new sizes, and reacted as predicted.   After soothing Emelia, Ryan put both of them on his bed, along with Dara, and then said \u201cDara, 1 foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A moment later, Dara is growing, and then looking at a huge Ryan, a fact that does not seem to greatly upset her.  \u201cMay it please you I am named Dara.  I am at your service, My Lord.\u201d  She then managed a quite graceful curtsy despite her high heels and the soft blanket she was standing on.  To Ryan at least, her long red dress and long light blue hair made her seem quite the princess she was described as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cI\u2019m Ryan.  Amy and Emelia here say I have rescued them from some danger that they can\u2019t describe.  Do you have any idea what it was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cI fear not, Lord Ryan.  I too was rescued from something I dreaded very much, and am very grateful for your succor, but I can not recall what the danger was, nor how you rescued me, save that you did do it.\u201d  Turning to look at the other girls, she asked \u201cAre these two to be my servants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHuh?  Oh, no, they are not servants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh?  Well, if you are thinking of making them your servants, may I inform your lordship they are untrained.  I can teach them their duties if your lordship wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNo, they are not servants.  Nobody is a servant here.  There are no servants.  And I am not a lord.  There are no lords here either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNo servants?  No lords?  But that is impossible my lord.  How could society exist?  How can I?\u201d  Dara looked quite distressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It was Emelia who moved forward to offer assurance.  \u201cNow don\u2019t worry my lady.  You\u2019re part of the toff, and the quality take care of their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Dara looked puzzled \u201cToff?  What is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now Amy answers \u201cI\u2019m guessing, but I think she means you were born above the salt, well above it if I guess right, and she thinks the high and mighty around here will welcome you.  She could be right, tho I\u2019ve always deemed those types to be dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan interrupts \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve been asking the other girls some questions to try and figure out what is going on, and I\u2019d like to ask you some questions too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAs you please My Lord.  I will do my best to answer correctly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But the answers were much the same.  Anything about her background or history in general was met by some variation of \u201cI am sorry My Lord, but I do not remember.\u201d  Still, from time to time she dropped hints which seemed to suggest she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.  [Ryan wondered vaguely just where that expression had come from, and a little more seriously if it meant the same as \u201ctoff\u201d and \u201cborn above the salt\u201d.  It seemed likely.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOK, I guess that will do for now.\u201d  Ryan decides, and Dara once again curtsies in response to his remark.  \"We have two more girls to go.  I hope one of them knows something.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He expected to enlarge the last girl shortly anyway, but the description of her as older seemed to imply she might know something the other doll would not.  So maybe she would be the better choice.  It was a reason anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once again the enlargement went according to schedule, and only again the resulting girl reacted differently.  Despite being 1/5 his height, Christina somehow managed to look down at Ryan, somehow reminding him he was just a boy and she was a woman, or at least a lot closer to adult than he was.  Her glance around the room was even more dismissive, as she muttered \"antiquated dump\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hey!  This is a great room.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina was not at all convinced of that.  \"Beggers can't be choosers, so I shouldn't complain.  Very well, I apologize for any insult implied.\"  There was no sign she had changed her opinion.  \"I am Christina.  You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ryan.  Say, the other girls say I rescued them from something.  Do you know anything about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina paused to consider... \"Not much.  I was rescued from something terrible and you did it some way.  But the rest is blank.  Do they say anything different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Not really.  They can't recall much about their pasts.  Can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No... I don't recall them at all, and as for my own past, I don't really remember anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"The others have made some interesting remarks when I asked them questions.  Maybe you will too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's worth a try.  Ask..., but let's have your answers too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We are going to have to live in your world, right?

She can answer at the same time as you and I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This seemed reasonable to Ryan.  So he set the last doll, a brown-haired lass wearing glasses, and in a light pink dress, on the bed and went thru the same procedure as he had with the others. Same procedure [except for Christina muttering \"Totally impossible..\"] and once again, not quite the same result. This one...Berry?... seemed happy enough to be here, but rather nervous and quiet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm Ryan.  You're Berry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ye..s.\"  She seemed a bit tongue-tied. \"I...want to thank you for rescuing me.  It was very heroic of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I...\" She closed her eyes and concentrated, apparently without success, \"...don't know. ...I'm sorry...\"  Unlike the others who had shown little or no concern over their ignorance, Berry looked close to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, don't worry about it much.  The rest of us couldn't remember anything either\", Christina broke in with. Berry apparently hadn't noticed the other girls before. She looked startled and disappointed as she realized there were four other girls present.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He rescued you, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina ignored the lack of enthusiasm for this good deed and answered, \"So we believe, but none of us has any idea how... or of much else it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I see...\", Berry replied in a sad voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now we are trying to pool our rather limited knowledge\", Christina continued to the worried girl. \"So Ryan is going to ask some questions and give us some answers. You ready for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once Berry confirmed she was, the questions started, and revealed the situation was much the same for these two as well.  They had no knowledge of their family, their society, history, location, etc. They might as well have been created out of thin air for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There were the differences again.  They both professed to be familiar with computers, but when shown Ryan's desktop, Christina admitted she didn't even know how to turn it on. She seemed to feel that was the fault of the computer rather than her flaw. While Ryan was finding out nothing he could make use of, the girls found his own answers much more interesting and useful...</span></div></div>",

They are nice kids, but they are just kids. As for me..I'm a student at the local high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You're a cleric?\" Amy interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What? No. I'm just a student, like everybody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But you're as old as I am, and only clerics study at that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Another part of her past?  Well, just correct her about the present, Ryan told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe where you came from, but everybody goes to school here, and it won't be unusual if I am in school for 8 more years.\" This seems to silence Amy for the moment, so Ryan moved on to another subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm doing pretty good in school. I don't really qualify as a nerd or a jock, but I may make the honor roll and I should make the team.\"  He had to admit both claims were a tad optimistic.  Still, neither was out of the question... completely anyway.  Anyway, the girls looked suitably impressed..except for Christina, whose expression seemed a combination of \"I don't believe a word of it\" and \"I going to hold you to that\". Ryan wasn't sure which option worried him the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Perhaps you should tell us how we came into your possession\", Christina demanded. Ryan related the story of his visit to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So this merchant had us on display as little statues for months?  And then just about forced us on you?\" Only Dara didn't seem to feel this was rather odd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"And you just bought us?\" Amy asked. \"That's not so heroic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, it did take all his money\", Berry defended him.  \"That's something...a lot even.  I read a book that started like that, and then... Well, I can't remember, but it was all very romantic.\"  From her posture, it would seem she had quite enjoyed the book and had been quite into it. Christina has a different view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I find it interesting that this tale does not change at all my opinion that you rescued me and deserve my gratitude and loyalty.  I would think it ought to, but it doesn't.  Do you other ladies feel the same?\"  Nods all around confirm this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Interesting...

Berry broke in with \"I read a book like that.  It was very romantic and...\", but again she found herself unable to recall any details.

Emelia may have been born 200 years ago, and Amy was born long before that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And when were you born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Probably not for decades.  I seem to be from well into your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh?  How do you figure that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Over time, everything is made simpler to operate.  What was once done by those with a lifetime of training is improved until the village idiot can use it.  I can't recall how computers have been improved in my time, but you recall I mentioned I didn't know how to turn your's on.  That's because I won't need to know how to turn one on.  It will turn itself on.  So I come from the future, even if I have very little idea what that future will be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"And Dara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I think she means I need to alter the theory a little and make it even more fantastic.  Dara, your hair color is natural, is it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Of course!

Now if you will hold still while I take a closer look at your ear...\"  Dora made no objection and Christina got close and moved the hair out of the way before announcing... \"Notice the point to her ear.  I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She one of the fair folk?\" Amy broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She's an elf?\" Berry asked.  \"But they don't exist...Tho I remember a really romantic story...Oh bother, I can't remember it either.  This memory problem is so annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dara got quite worried.  \"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wrong?  There is hardly anything right with the situation!\" Christina snapped, but continued with \"About you in particular, no.  Your past is simply a little more strange than ours, which are strange enough.  In any case, our pasts are gone and we'll never see them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You know, in my stories, when some character says that...\" Berry started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"This is not a story, and you had best not think of it as one.\" was Christina's retort.

You spent all your money for us and got a bargain, and you have no way to replace us. You need to be very careful with us: damage us and you hurt yourself. That means you need to know exactly how to take care of us, and so you need us reading the instructions too.  Any thing you do not understand could be very costly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina silently let out a sigh of relief.  All too often boys just could not be made to see common sense.  If he had insisted, there would have been no choice but to bow to his will, and that would have been have been terrible.  Maybe some of the others would not mind,  or even like, being dominated by a man, but she doubted any woman anywhere would want to be dominated by a mere boy. But he was arguing on her grounds, and that meant he would end up doing as told.  He might make a fuss and be a bother, but in the end, he would have to accept she was right.  Now there is work to be done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No buts\", Christina continued to tell Ryan. \"We like you and we want to help you.  And we can't do that if we don't know what is going on.  So spread out that instruction booklet.\" With a sigh, Ryan did as told and spread out the sheets where all could read them, and they all set to work. Amy was the first to offer an opinion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, food won't be a problem.  It says here you can shrink us down to where a spoonful is more than we can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But that seems terribly undignified\", Dara objects. \"We don't want to eat like peasants or barbarians.\" But Christina has a solution to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It says here that anything we're holding or wearing shrinks or grows with us.  So if we hold them while being shrunk, we will have the needed utensils. I doubt it will be completely dignified, but we won't have to behave like a bunch of boys.\" Ryan ignored that dig. Whether he tried to say silverware wasn't needed, or that he just hadn't thought of it, he was already sure Christina would make that sound bad.  Better to just keep on reading...</span></div></div>",

Isn't that a bit more than can fit in this ro...?\" Christina asked with a puzzled look, getting her answer before she could finish asking the question.  The girls started to grow and rapidly become too big to fit onto the bed. As they continued to grow, they started pushing each other off the bed by sheer size. And Ryan found himself in the path of a feminine flood that rapidly knocked him to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Being under 500-1000 lbs [it felt like the higher figure, but Ryan was not clueless enough to mention that aloud] of girls has its burdens of course, but Ryan discovered it had some virtues too.  Girls are nice, warm things to have next to you.  And Ryan realized that when he had put out his hands to hold back the tide, they had ended up holding two very appealing objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Get your hand back where it belongs!\" That was Christina, which identified one of the lumps. Now who was the other? And was she just letting Christina speak for her? Or was she not objecting?  Maybe he should wait and see if she does object.  Or maybe he should just let go of Christina...if he was sure which one was her's.  Or maybe..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \"Now!\" Christina demanded of Ryan. Maybe he should let go of both while he was still in one piece.  Sadly this seemed the best idea, and the one he adopted to for Christina's satisfaction, if not necessarily to anyone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Getting everybody to their feet was a complex operation, and Ryan lost track of just who had been where.  Especially when he discovered that talking to a basketball height lass put his eye level at a rather distracting level, and having the full team in what was not a large room put an attractive set entirely too close to be ignored. The ladies were not as appreciative of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"This is way too crowded. We have got to get out of here\", was Amy's comment, which allowed Ryan to work out it was Emelia's chest that was threatening to smother him. However that had to be ignored for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No!  We can't leave the room\", Ryan told the annoyed Amy. His mother might have many virtues, but Ryan could recall all too many times she had said, \"You're not old enough for that\" and that thing he just had to have would not be bought, or would vanish into a closet until she reluctantly agreed he was old enough. He was pretty sure she would say the same about the girls, and the best that would happen would be his not seeing them for a year or more. Definitely best Mom not know anything until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But we can't stay like this\", objected Dara, who was trying to sit on the ground, finding it hard to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'll...shrink you all to a more comfortable height that will fit in the room fine.\" With that in mind, Ryan grabbed the box and again pronounced,  \"Amy, Berry, Christina, Dara, Emelia...\"</span></div></div>",

That's too small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Again Christina's objection came too late as the girls were already shrinking.  In a moment Ryan was \"alone\" in the room, and the women had \"vanished\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Where are you?\" Ryan wondered aloud. His question was answered by silence..or by almost silence. Did he hear a female voice far away?  Or a tiny voice right next to him? Ryan started to kneel down, but before he moved a foot, he realized he didn't know where the girls were, and could easily step on one with terrible results.  So after recovering his balance, he tried a squat to get closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What was that?  I can't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This time he could hear something, noticing a small patch of blue.  Looking closer, he saw it was Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I see you, Amy\", he told her.  \"Let's see...now what?\" Amy had a suggestion, but not at a volume that could let Ryan hear it clearly enough. He sighed to himself, annoyed that he could barely hear a thing the girl was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, why don't I put you on the bed until I can figure out something?  That way, at least I won't step on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amy seemed to find this reasonable, and quickly jumped onto the huge slab of meat that was soon next to her, despite parts of it being as thick as she was tall.  When Ryan's hand reached the bed, she quickly got off and waved. Ryan next tried to find Emelia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She was right in front of me...  Emelia, can you move and yell?\"  A moment later, Ryan noticed a patch of moving white, which proved to be Emelia.  She too was offered a ride to the bed, but hesitated to climb aboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Come on. I won't drop you\", Ryan comforted the tiny girl, who finally got her to climb into his hand. But while Amy had stood up and watched the whole way, Emelia laid flat in the middle of the hand and kept her eyes covered until Ryan told her it was safe to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan then went back to looking for the others, a task made harder by his not being sure what colors the lasses had been wearing, and by the fear it would match the color of the rug anyway. Add in that the other girls were some distance away from him, and that he dared not move without extreme care for fear he would guess wrong about how far, and it was a long task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He finally found Christina and Berry and transferred them to the bed, but where was Dara?  Had he accidentally stepped on her?  He was getting quite worried when he happened to glance at the bed and realized the girls were trying to tell him something.<br>\r\nLooking closer, he realized there were five figures.  Dara must have been on the bed when she shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    By now Christina began organizing the others, and now a chorus of \"Grow us!\" was being shouted outloud.  It was still only a whisper to Ryan, but he heard it, and he agreed.  This was just too small a size for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Amy, Berry, Christina, Dara, Emelia...\"</span></div></div>",

That was a lot better than when they were seven foot tall, but still the bed was fuller than it was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe I had better make that two foot...\", Ryan said to himself in response to the small figures, about to speak into the black box when Christina interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hold it!\" she warned him. \"Count how many times you've changed us. Once to one foot, then to seven, down to 1/2 inch, and now to three. Whatever height you choose, we have to stay for the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Actually, he has done Emelia and me five times already,\" Amy corrected. \"So I suppose we'll stay this height for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"See? Already you have a problem\", Christina continued.  \"Where are Amy and Emelia going to sleep?  You can shrink the rest of us and we should be comfortable enough in our boxes, but Amy and Emelia are too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Or maybe too small. Sleeping with a five foot Amy and Emelia might be very crowded, but it definitely sounded appealing, and neither lass looked likely to complain.  But three foot? That sounded wrong somehow, even if it wouldn't be as crowded and the girls still were not complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, maybe I can sleep on the floor...\", Ryan suggested as Amy and Emelia shook their heads left and right in reply. They insisted he can have the bed, but the other three agreed he should be on the floor, which weren't exactly what his dreams of this sort of situation were like. Of course his dreams were rather vague on a number of points, but they sure didn't involve him sleeping on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now, let's get back to the instructions,\" Christina ordered Ryan. \"And this time think before you act, or you may have more problems.\" But before Ryan could make out than the instructions, there was a bang on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ryan?  Are you in there?\" a young voiced asked. It was Ginger, Ryan's younger sister, and odds were 50-50 that she would barge in in a second. Ryan started to wonder if he could hide the girls, but also wondered if he should simply tell his sister stay out of his room like she has been told lots of times [and sometimes even paid attention to].</span></div></div>",

Don't bother me.\"  Sometimes that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And sometimes it didn't.  The door crashes open and Ginger rushed in, as she often did.  \"Mother said... Who are these little kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It took Ryan a moment to realize Ginger had changed subject in mid-sentence and Mother did not know about his dolls...yet.  As he worried about how to keep it that way, he introduced the girls, who responded predictably.  \"This is Amy,...\" who waved to Ginger, \"...Berry...\" who took a step back from Ginger, who towered over her by a foot, \"...Christina...\" who responded with \"Young lady, just when did you last wash?\", \"...Dara...\" who curtsied \"...and Emelia.\" who clung to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So what are they doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Didn't you have a message from Mom?\"  Ryan dodged.  He was likely going to have to answer eventually, but Ginger could lose interest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh yeah.

Go tell Ma I'll be playing babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Right.  I'll be back in a minute.\"  With that, Ginger was gone.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Trouble was, she was likely telling the truth.  She would be back in a minute, and full of questions he wasn't sure how to answer.  And she would likely be bringing Hal, who would ask any questions Ginger missed....<br>\r\n    Well, at least he had the minute...</span></div></div>",

He should have known.  Just because he had gotten bored watching a stupid kid a time or two and not known where he was when she returned, Ma got all unglued and made all these stupid rules about watching him every minute.  OK, Hal did like to explore and all, but it's not like he had ever gotten far.  But no, she had to stick him with the brat, and because he had forgotten that, now he had another talkative kid who might spill the beans.  His secret was rapidly leaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However, that was not the immediate problem.  Hal looked at the ladies and asked Ginger \"You mean your dumb old secret is just a bunch of stupid girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina was the first to react to this \"Young man.  That is no way to talk about people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But it is Amy who got into his face.  Jumping off the bed, she threatened \"You take that back or I'll beat you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hal defied this \"I'm not fighting a little girl.  That's not allowed.\"  He had a point, or points rather.  Hitting a girl wasn't allowed, particularly when he towered well above the shrunk Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amy considered this for a second and responded with \"Well, you can armwrestle me.  You apologize if I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hal was not thrilled with the idea, but when Ryan offered to act as judge, he gave in and put up an arm that was much bigger than Amy's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   To everybody's shock, Amy pined him, almost before Ryan had finished saying \"three\".  Hal was howling \"You cheated!\" almost as fast.  Amy's response was a casual \"Durn right I did.  And you don't have any idea how I did either.  So if you want to find out how and make sure nobody else does it, you are going to apologize and promise not to call any of us \"stupid\".  Then this stupid girl will teach you the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hal looked around, but found no sympathy.  So he muttered the common threat \"Wait until I tell Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You do, and I have something to tell her too.\" was Ginger's response.  Ryan had no idea what she was talking about, but Hal did.  Apparently it was something Mom had better not find out about as he gave an half-hearted apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Good enough\" was Amy's response.  \"Now put your hand here and I'll explain what I did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she did, Ryan answered Ginger's persistent questions [honestly since he was also trying to learn whatever trick Amy had used at the same time, and listening to two people at once was hard enough without having to keep your lie straight at the same time.]  Ginger's response was happily positive.  \"That is so cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But we are still trying to decide where everyone is to sleep tonight.\" Christina points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I know!  You can sleep in my doll house!\" Ginger suggests.  \"Really, it's got several beds and lots of room, if you can shrink that is.  It'll work great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sleeping with Ginger will be better for Amy and Berry in any case.\"  Dara agrees.  [Neither Amy nor Berry seemed convinced that sleeping with Ryan was out of the question.]  \"And your doll house is a generous offer.  May we see this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sure.  Right this way.\"  Ginger announced, and soon they were on the way to Ginger's room.\"</span></div></div>",

He was surprised at how girly it was, as well as shocked at the poster of a singer on the wall. The guy was always surrounded by women, and this was one of his more suggestive poses.  This shouldn't be on a little girl's wall, particularly not his sister's, and particularly not where she could gaze on him for hours if she wanted to (which it seemed she might).  He didn't like it at all [That his own walls would be plastered with naked women if Ma would let him was a completely different case].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However, the center of interest of Ginger's room was not her walls, but her doll house.  The girls quickly set to examine it, and Ryan had to admit it was an impressive piece of work. It was four foot tall, and unlike other doll houses he had seen, it was four foot in all dimensions. That made it at least twice the size of any others he had seen. The girls, however, were more interested in the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  '...See, I just touch here and it opens right up\", Ginger explained to the girls, showing off the inside to approving comments. \"And I can touch it here or here to open it to different parts of the house.\" Again the house opened easily to show different views. The girls moved forward to look closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"There sure are lots of bedrooms\", noted Dara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We'll each have one,\" commented Berry. \"Look, the beds are real cloth.  They will be nice and comfortable..\" There was a general chorus of \"this is perfect\"...except from Christina, who was skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It is entirely too good\", she mumbled to herself, ignoring the surprised reaction of the audience. \"How and when did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mom got this at some second-hand store.  She said she got a real good bargain on it. It was...a week ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So\", Christina proclaimed. \"A house that will fit us nicely just happens to show up at the same location we just happen to end up at because Ryan made an impulse purchase. And just before we arrive?  Does anybody think there might be a problem here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It does sound strange, and a little scary\", Emelia admitted as she moved closer to Ryan. Amy, however, was much more optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So?  It's what we need, and if we are in any danger, this isn't going to change that.  Why worry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina sighed at the girl's response, unable to think of a rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You have a point.  But before we fall into this trap, I want to take a closer look.  And I don't trust any of you girls to do a good job. Ryan, shrink me to doll house size and then put me into...hmm, that room there looks nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ryan did as he was told.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Christina took her time examining the room, enough so that Ryan got bored.  But she clearly wanted to make a complete inspection and was touching this, opening that, and looking everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Presently, she opened a door and walked into the hallway.  Ginger touched the doll house a couple of times and it opened to show Christina moving to another bedroom to repeat the inspection, this time in less detail.  Once again, she left the room for the hallway, but Ginger's moving of the view showed that she was now going downstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Christina ended up in the kitchen, which was again subject to an inspection of some length. Doors were opened and things were moved. It seemed to take a little time to satisfy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally she turned to her audience and announced in a tiny voice that Ryan had to strain to understand, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, the news is either very good, or very bad.  Amy, I suppose you're right.  We will have to hope it's very good, because it seems it will be unless until it proves to be bad.<br>\r\nThe basic point is that this isn't a doll house.  It's a real house down to the finest detail.  The beds are real beds, the furniture is real...even the food is real. Another impossibility is that everything works, most obviously the water.\"  [Now that she mentioned it, Ryan did recall her fiddling with several faucets.]  That's very convenient, but there'd place for the water to come from, or for it to go. The house is just all house. There's no room for storage tanks or such.\"  [Ryan was wise enough not to mention he didn't think of that.]  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"On a more personal level, this is our house.  My room contains clothing that fits me, or will if my height is adjusted a bit [Christina had been rummaging around in closets for quite a bit.  Ryan had not paid much attention to that.]. More directly, it's clothing I approve of and would want to wear.  When I checked another room, the clothing was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's obvious that each room is different.  I picked my room because I liked it.  Now that I can see it in more detail, I find it more and more what I would've asked for.  I suspect the rest of you will find the same thing for some other rooms.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   \"Bottom line: This place was made for us, and we're going to have to stay here.  It just takes care of too many of our practical needs.  Somebody went to a lot of trouble to make sure we landed on a cushion, and we would be very rash not to make use of it.  We're just going to have to live with the worry that there will be a very high rent on the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Berry, you're going to have to show the rest of us how everything works.  I'm not sure if Amy or Dara have ever seen running water, and the technology is enough out of date to give me trouble..but it seems we can move in as soon Ryan shrinks us to the proper size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Before they could continue, though, Ginger interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey, there are more than five bedrooms.  What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina was not pleased with the interruption, nor with having to admit what was up with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't know. It could just be an accident of design, or that the house wasn't sure how many of us there would be, or it could be some of us didn't make it.  Ryan, I suppose it would not hurt for you to be on the lookout for other 'special' dolls. Now I have discovered a few aspects of the doll house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At this point Christina was mostly taking to air. The other girls have taken the chance to start looking to see what bedroom they would like, and Dara &amp; Berry were debating if they wanted to move in right away. Christina seemed aware of this, and distinctly unhappy with it, but reluctantly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh very well.  I suppose it doesn't make much difference and you will learn it on your own anyway, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ryan could not hear exactly what she was grumbling, and suspected he didn't want to know.</span></div></div>",

There was no objection, nor was there any when Amy claimed a bedroom that seemed to be decorated with animal pictures. Dara and Emelia settled on rooms that were less obviously distinct, but even Ryan could see the rooms were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"OK, time to shrink us down and let us move in\", Berry announced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Not yet\", Christina objected. \"We need to find out what is our correct size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"True\", Dara agreed.  \"It would be most annoying to have a closet of lovely clothing, none of which fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I want at those books, and I can still read even if the size is wrong, but I suppose it might save trouble...\", was Berry's reluctant agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Measuring just what size was correct took a little work.  It wasn't too hard to find that Christina should be a little taller, but exactly how much...?  After a little thinking, Christina headed back to her room and selected several garments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now I'll just change into these and we can measure pretty closely.\" As she headed into the bathroom to change, she paused, and turned to the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And Ryan, we can see when someone is watching, so don't try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What?\" Ryan tried to pretend he hadn't been thinking what Christina knew he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Don't play innocent, young man\", an irritated Christina responded.  \"You were thinking of trying to open the doll house to watch us undress. Besides being in bad taste, you're going to get caught every time. When you look into a room, the wall you look through becomes...well, different, and you can be seen by anyone in the room.  So you 're not going to get away with a free peak.\"  With that, she went into the bathroom, and Ryan found himself having to deal with a room of girls giggling at his expense. However, it did occur to him that Christina was the only one of the former dolls who was really indignant at the idea of his looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina emerged in her new outfit, was measured, and then changed twice more to verify the figures. The final result was not an even figure, in English or Metric, but it was reasonably easy to express, and Dara and Berry were shrunk to a size that still towered over Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Not that there was much chance to measure that.  The two girls were off to their rooms almost as soon as they were placed in Christina's, Dara being slightly slower while she made a polite and graceful exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That didn't seriously slow Dara down. Had her viewers been interested, they might have wondered how she seemed to be keeping to a stately walk, while covering ground as fast as a run. In any case, neither dignity nor time was lost in getting to her room, and to her clothes closet, and removing a lovely gown.  A quick trip behind a screen and she emerged to report that further size adjustments would be necessary, though they were not far off.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Berry was just as quick to get to her new room, and to find it nicely satisfactory, though for quite different reasons.  Three big floor to ceiling bookcases, just solid with books.  There must be...oh, thousands of titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Quickly Berry grabbed a book off a shelve. It was a typical romance novel; cheap common trash with a suggestive picture on the cover of a couple, who were not very covered. It was just like she had hoped! She couldn't remember anything of her former life, but she was pretty sure she had thought a day when she didn't devour at least one of these was a day without sunshine. And she had... just oodles of them now, she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She moved to other shelves and the other cases.  More and more romance novels.  Were they all romance novels?  It was hardly a fate she feared.  Still, the steak does taste better with a pinch of salt.  Ah, and here was a shelf of salt. She paid little attention to it once finding it.  There was likely something she would want there, but the romance novels were what she loved.  Now where to start?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, since this was all so magical, perhaps these bookcases are magical in some way.  Where was the gap where she pulled out this book?  Did it refill itself?  Or was she just overlooking it?  Well, it was easy enough to test. Quickly she pulled out another book, noting carefully where it had been, and what volumes were near it.  Then she went to another book case and pulled out a score of books, dumping them all on the bed. Now back to the first book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   No..the gap was still here.  Looking to the other case, there was still a large open space, and the books on the bed had not moved.  It seemed there was no magic involved, just big old bookcases, which was pretty darn good for Berry. She could just lie there and read for years!  Well, she did want to do other things of course, but right now it seemed that the worst that could happen to her would be very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now which one to start with?  A bit of a silly question.  They were formula books and each was really much the same as the other.  Some people consider that a criticism, but they don't love the formula.  In any case, Berry couldn't help making a careful decision even tho she knew she would be just as happy with the rejected volume. Finally she selected one and happily threw herself onto the bed, opening to page one before she had stopped bouncing and was deep into the story within a minute. That, of course was when Christina opened the door and came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Time for a tour of the house, and an explanation of how everything is to be operated\", she announced. Berry rather desperately peered over the top of her book at this annoucement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Can't this wait until tomorrow when all of us are the right size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A tour now will allow us to identify any problems for the tour tomorrow. And unless you want to cook dinner and do the other servant duties, you had best make sure we know how to do them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry sighed. Christina was right as usual, but she so wanted this story right now.  Maybe it was worth doing the cooking and cleaning just so she could have it..    </span></div></div>",

Amy and Emelia won't be with us.\" Christina, however, was not willing to accept any delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"They'll be watching and will learn enough for now\", she told the romantic as she pointed to a wall. Berry looked and realized she was correct. The wall was still there and she could see all of it. But she could also see through it to see Ginger's bedroom, and to see Amy and Emelia looking at her. With a sigh that would have been over dramatic for a condemned prisoner on death row, Berry got to her feet and headed out of the room. Dara was waiting on the other side of the door with a polite smile and the end of any hope that Berry could put this off.  Well, she would have to do this eventually anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As the tour got underway, Berry found that Christina was right again, thought Christina was not enjoying being right this time [Berry was too kind-hearted to enjoy any of the pratfalls, but Amy, and maybe some of the others, did not hold back laughter].<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   The main problem seemed to be that she expected the utilities to pretty much run themselves.  A faucet was supposed to know not to turn itself on too much, and was supposed to turn itself off.  That she didn't understand Berry's instructions added a gallon or two to the resulting disaster.  [Berry wasn't sure what Christina was saying as she stood there, a soggy mess, but she was pretty sure that was just as well...]  That Christina was sure she knew what she was doing (even when she knew she didn't) made sure the scene was repeated more than once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dara was less of an immediate problem, though Berry worried more about the long term.  As Christina had suggested, Dara seemed to have no idea how anything worked.  That she was too nervous to touch anything at least avoided any immediate problems, but what of the future?  Was Christina right in thinking she was some sort of princess who was used to lots of servants? That she lived a life where clothes she dropped on the floor almost picked themselves up? If so, it might be quite a chore getting her to do her share of the chores, to say nothing of well.  Still, she seemed a nice girl, and Berry could at least hope things would work out.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The tour ended with the kitchen, and with the realization it was time to prepare dinner.  Berry's book would have to wait some more, and that was the good news.  Her own ability as cook, she realized, was ...well, what you expect of a girl her age.  And her helpers were someone who wouldn't do anything without detailed orders, and someone who wouldn't wait for orders... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The results were not pretty.  Berry could only give thanks for food that did not need cooking, and for the microwave [Not that Claudia had not managed to leave a fork in it].  She hoped Amy and Emelia were faring better...</span></div></div>",

Where do we eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No problem. I'll just ask Mom if I can have some friends over for dinner\", Ginger offered the girls without hesitation. Ryan, however, was more skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ginger, take a look at them.  I know Mom and Dad won't look close, but Amy and Emelia don't look like kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Ginger looked and realized the problem her brother was talking about. He may be able to shrink a 14-15 year old down to the size of a 4-5 year old, but there were a host of body differences between those ages. Their heads would look tiny, their legs would look too long too long, and their voices would probably sound squeaky as well to those around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, maybe they won't pay attention\", Ginger hoped, realizing that making the dolls the size of little kids was not the best one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ginger, I don't think they'll notice right away, but we'll be at dinner for a long time.  And they just have to notice something once for it to be all up. And then we'll lose our new dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ginger had never been one to abandon an idea easily.  But a sound of the door opening settled the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mom's home. We'll sneak you up some food later\", she announced to Amy and Emelia, neither of whom seemed distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No problem. I've missed so many meals that I won't complain of one being late\",  Amy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh?  How many is that?\" Dave asked of the girl. Perhaps some of her memory was finally returning? Amy tried to answer, but the answer was the same, typical,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I have no idea. I suppose it must have been quite a few, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The response was something that Ryan had expected. But right now he had to persuade Mom nothing had happened in her absence, so he and Ginger rushed down to do just that. And of course their behavior roused her suspicions right away.  Children do not look innocent when they are innocent; the harder they try to look innocent, the less they are. And when they don't want you to go upstairs, it was definitely time to head upstairs, and to Ginger's room when they almost barred the way. Quickly she opened the door and found ... nothing unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A quick glance at her not-so-innocent children showed they were were also puzzled, but still sure there was something in the room she must not be allowed to find.  So a quick declaration that the room was filthy was made [it was of course, by the standards of mothers, if not daughters], and Ginger was made to clean it up, while Mom continued her inspection, looking for the secret, as well as for dirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But nothing of note presented itself.  Some small secrets Ginger had to be lectured about, but ...say, they were looking at the open window... \"casually\", she went over and looked around. Nothing. But why did they look this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A memory of her own childhood, when she had captured a pigeon and tried to keep it as a pet only to have it fly out an open window, came back to her.  That pigeon had made an awful mess before it had escaped.  Perhaps this wasn't the exact same thing, but had Ginger been trying to keep some unsuitable pet that thankfully escaped? Perhaps it was time to get Ginger a pet then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well that can wait until dinner to discuss. She warned them that it would be ready soon and left the two children relieved but mystified.  Where had Amy and Emelia gone to?</span></div></div>",

It was impossible that Mom could have missed them, so they tried the hiding places that just maybe Mom might not have look that closely at. However, it didn't take long to conform the obvious. The girls were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They then asked the other girls in the doll house what happened to them, but they also didn't seem to have any idea of where they went. They had been too busy with dinner, and Ginger had closed the doll house on general principles. It was only when these possibilities had failed that they noticed that Hal wasn't in the room either. Had he taken them to his room?  It was worth a check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And it was a good thing they did, too! The three were in Hal's room, safe and sound. Good news, but Ginger now gave a surprisingly accurate rendition of a lecture she had been on the wrong end of quite a few time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You scared us to death running off without letting us knowing...\" she lectured her baby brother, much to Ryan's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm sorry\", Emelia replied for Hal. \"But it didn't seem safe to stay.  I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Again she had the look Ryan had seen on all the girls when she tried to remember something from her past.  Had she been doing a lot of hiding in her previous life?  It seemed possible, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, you're right\", Ryan acknowledged. \"Mom insisted on inspecting Ginger's room for some reason, and I don't want her finding out about you yet. Hal, it's about time for dinner, so we need to get down there.  Amy and Emelia, why don't you stay in Ginger's room until we get back with your food?\" There were no objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Dinner itself was fairly routine, except that with the girls upstairs, nothing was routine. Ryan was all too nervous since he didn't trust his two co-conspirators a bit.  Happily the major subject of conversation was the idea of getting Ginger a pet, an idea that puzzled the girl quite a bit. She wasn't against the idea (heck, she approved of it), but this was nowhere near the top of things to bug parents for. Where had this come from, anyway?  It didn't really matter to her at the moment, and she had a little time to decide what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Even after dinner's end, it was no less stressful a time for Ryan.  What would be a good meal for the girls?  It had to be something he could smuggle up the stairs as well<br>\r\nIt didn't do his heart any good to be caught by Mom as he stared into the fridge.  Fortunately, she did not give him much chance to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What are you doing?\"  she asked of her son. Like many teenagers, Ryan had a habit of munchies and she merely launched into the standard lecture about overeating and made no real effort to stop Ryan from escaping with the food. Once back upstairs, he was relieved to have no problems finding Amy and Emelia, who made no complaints about the irregular meal.  As they ate, Ryan was able to note some evidence supporting Christina's theory the women had moved through time somehow.  Amy didn't seem to have ever seen a fork before. How long ago did forks appear?  A thousand years ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, however long ago, it seemed to confirm that he needed to know more about the mess he was in.  But how to get that information?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    The night passed peacefully...perhaps too peacefully.  Something to distract him was sounding rather attractive to Ryan.  Like most boys his age, Ryan found the idea of women taking their clothes off a most interesting subject, and right now two attractive lasses were doing just that in his sister's room.  He certainly couldn't stay and watch, and thinking of that only made things worse.  Could have he suggested one of the girls sleep with him?  Amy surely wouldn't object, and Ryan didn't think Emelia would either.  In fact,  Christina was the only one of the former dolls to not be friendly, and maybe \"friendly\".  It was definitely an interesting question how far their friendship might go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It also raised a rather scary question.  His wildest dreams might be within his reach, and with even the least effort he might put them entirely beyond reach again.  But would Amy say \"sure\", or would she slap his face and never speak to him again?  Did he want (really want, that is) to take that risk? Not surprisingly, Ryan did not get the best of sleep that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next day was, thankfully, not a school day, and Ryan could sleep in.  When he did get up, it was to find that Amy and Emelia were helping Ginger with her homework.  Surprisingly, Ginger seemed rather pleased with this. She might not be the worst at school work, but she shared the normal kid attitude that homework put off might somehow vanish. What was getting her to her books so eagerly (or more precisely, at all)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A little observation, as he tested and found the instructions were at least partly correct and he can't change the girl's size yet, gave Ryan an idea.  Ginger was acting more for a teacher than she was a student.  The girls really didn't know a lot of things every child did, and before Ginger could get bored with her homework, Amy or Emelia would ask an obvious question and Ginger would get to show off her superior knowledge.  In a minute they would get back to the actual homework and the same process would start again.  Maybe Ginger was not learning as fast as she could without the interruptions, but she was learning faster than she would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, if he couldn't change their sizes and they were busy, it was probably a good time to do his own homework. It went poorly, but Ryan was surprised how much was done by lunch time.  Again, his attempt to raid the fridge for the girls was again detected and lectured about. He was sooner or later have to get these girls all out of the doll house. His mother was going to eventually realize that something is up and interrogate him for answers to her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    More bad news is that the girls still were still not changing size, though the instructions themselves seemed correct.  What was he to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm off to the mall.  I want to see if that storeowner can tell me what is going on\", Ryan announced to the girls, all of whom stopped what they were doing when he told them this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Wait!\", Berry had to almost shout out to the boy. \"Take me with you! The merchant might try to deny things, and if you can show him me he'll have to fess up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There was something odd about what she was saying, like it was just a reason she had thought of on the spur of the moment. Though Berry had been looking a little frazzled recently.  Had she found moving in a little harder than she expected and just wanted a break?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But how am going to carry you?\" Ryan asked of the tiny girl. \"My pockets aren't very comfortable, plus you can fall out of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I-in your backpack. I can slip in there with a light and a few books and I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I dunno. It might be dangerous, Berry...\"</span></div></div>",

As small as you are, it shouldn't take too much to crush you, and stuff can shift around in my backpack pretty easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A little testing showed this was a real danger.  Ryan suspected the girls were a little tougher than they seemed, but when he tried lowering a book on Berry gently, it was not long before she confessed to distress. It was too easy to guess what would happen if she got between books and his back, and his backpack took a bound like it would any time he tripped or ran or...well, maybe it wouldn't be fatal. Maybe it would only hurt terribly, but maybe... no, he couldn't risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   People are often perverse, and the very fact it was impossible made Ryan want to do it.  Was there a way to make a safe area for Berry to travel in his backpack?  Obviously if he had more time or the right equipment, he could have done so. But what could he do with what he had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A little cardboard house proved too weak. An iron piggy bank looked really good, until Christina ordered, \"Shake it\". After the resulting rattle, she added, \"Now imagine that was Berry.\" Again it doesn't take much imagination to imagine what would happen. However, Ryan wasn't ready to give up, and he was working on a way to pack the back with cloth when Christina offered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Try the black box that came with us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It seemed a reasonable thing to try, and so Ryan fetched it.  It was a tad small, but not unreasonably so.  More important, it didn't bend when he tried to squeeze it, and coins rattled around inside made no noise. Now Berry was allowed to climb in for a gentle shake.  When she reported no motion at all, the shakes became more vigorous, but without disturbing Berry in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Totally impossible,\" Christina commented, \"But it suits our needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Indeed so.  It still took a few minutes to rig up a light to read by, and for Berry to climb in with several books she can read, but the box was soon enough stashed in his backpack and Ryan could wish the others a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Getting out of the house was not so easy. Based on plenty of experience, his mother did not find his story of having his homework practically done believable (practically started, maybe). There was then another lecture on getting things done to endure. But in the end, Berry was not noticed, and Ryan was allowed to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So now it was off to Mr. Johnson's Shop of Strange and Wonderful Things. It wasn't a short walk, but it was on the second shortest (and arguably the most interesting) route to school, and one did not have to walk to school if the distance was major. Ryan had been there dozens of times, so there was no reason this trip should be much different.</span></div></div>",

And not even replaced by another store: it was simply replaced by a blank wall and nothing more. Ryan looked very frustrated by this recent turn of events, pulling out his black box and opening it up to tell Berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was as shocked as she was. Without the owner's guidance, there was no way of Ryan to tell what to do next. Depressed and frustrated by the recent turn of events, the two unhappily decided to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina and the others aren't going to be happy about this\", Ryan and Berry said at the sad time, both in a sad, pathetic tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother half hour passed by the time Ryan finally came home. The other dolls heard his footsteps as he closed the front door and proceeded to climb the stairs, happy to see him and of any news he might have for them, only to be meant with a sad, gloomy disposition on the boy's face instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. Nothing?\" Christina asked him. Ryan sadly shook his head up and down in reply, placing Berry gently on the ground while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't be mad at Ryan. It's not his fault...\", Berry defended him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan decided to then try something he should have done a long time ago: try to find information on the Internet. He pulled out the laptop from under his bed, turned it on, and started surfing the Internet, hoping to find any information at all about the dolls, the black box, or the shop he bought them from. Surprisingly his searching came up with results! It seems that the five figurines with Ryan were actually...</span></div></div>",

A ton of information, and you only want an ounce of it.  It's quite an improvement over simply not having the desired information, but it can be a very annoying chore to dig out the tiny bit you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So Ryan found himself downright stunned to be looking at pictures of all five girls almost immediately.  There was no question.  It was all five, and they were labeled \"Recent Rescues\", whatever that meant.  Once Ryan got over his shock, he started looking over the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It's weird.  We have a site called Damsels in Distress, but it doesn't appear when I Google it.  Just when I look for something else entirely...\" he told the watching girls, \"But it's definitely you.  Clothing and all.  <br>\r\n    \"They say you were each in some situation of dire peril and somehow they were able to offer you a chance to escape.  They don't really say how, or what the danger was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"They don't really say there was a real danger at all.\" Christina broke in.  \"Oh, they use the words, but they offer no actual proof.  For all we know, we are just random kidnappings whose memories have been eliminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You think so?\" Ryan asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't know.\"  Christina conceded.  \"I do know it would be a lot more profitable to not have to bother finding girls who actually want to escape something.  However, I do notice a few things that at least offer hope, tho I'm not sure having been in terrible danger is something I should hope for. <br>\r\n    \"You see all those appeals for funds.  That is at least consistent with this being some sort of charity.  Of course a lot of charities are con games, but kidnapping women to claim they rescued them sounds extreme even by those standards.<br>\r\n     \"Then there is myself, and perhaps Dara.  Anything like this should be exposed fairly rapidly.  Say it is discovered how to do this ten years from now.  Twenty years from now, it would be well known, and thiry, every woman would be protected from it.  But I may be from fifty years from now.  This just should not work on me.<br>\r\n    \"Now maybe it's from a hundred years in the future.  But now what is there now that will be worth a fortune a hundred years from now?  Most of the things I can think of do not require kidnapping a number of women.<br>\r\n   \"Then there is Dara.  She may not have any so-called magic that will come looking for her, but she comes from very far away, impossibly far, you might say.  It would seem a lot of unnecessary expense if someone was just grabbing girls at random. <br>\r\n   \"Of course, I'm really just guessing.  Maybe it's like a window opening and they just have to take what they can get.  But my guess is that they are not that depraved anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But Christina realized that she had gone too deep into lecture mode and had lost much of her audience.  Amy was asking \"Berry, what is in that book you keep on taking peeks at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry quickly confirmed it was something interesting by hiding the book behind her and saying in a most unconvincing tone \"Oh, nothing, nothing important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In the meantime, Ryan's attention had been drawn to a part of the screen that suggested he could order the girls to do whatever he wanted.</span></div></div>",

What would she refuse to do?  There ought to be a very long list, some of them way too obvious, but what are they?  Well, she didn't dare pause and think here, so she tried a diversion \"...suggest you think of your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What does she have to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"She will be seeing everything you do with us.  You can't keep her from barging in and seeing.  You know that.  <br>\r\n    \"Moreover, she will be copying us.  If you order us, she will accept that she should be ordered, and what you do to us, other lads will do to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But she's just a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Not for much longer.  Pretty soon, boys will be interested in her, and she will be interested in boys.  And you will be giving her her model on how she should be treated.  If you treat us like toys, she will think she should be a toy too.  You don't want that happening to her, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, but I can explain.  She's not a doll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You know how poorly that will work.  Children copy what they see, not what they are told.  If you casually use us, she will see, and copy, and end up being used as casually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh I am not suggesting you become a monk or anything.  She would not thank you for that either.  She needs to see you respect women, that you ask, not command, and take no for an answer.<br>\r\n   \"Of course, you probably have no choice in the matter.  That notice is likely exaggerated and you would just cause yourself trouble if you tried to order anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Ryan slumped back in a disappointed manner, Christina again gave a suppressed sigh of relief.  Ryan may be a nice enough boy, but he is still just a boy and even a man shouldn't be trusted with such power over them.  It would be very bad for them, and quite possibly bad for him as well, a point he was all too likely willing to risk.<br>\r\n    She wondered if there was any truth to her argument.  She was distinctly skeptical, but she had to give Ryan some reason.  One that might be true would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But now she and Ryan noticed that the fuss around Berry was growing.   </span></div></div>",

Amy however ... \"That's not nothing!  Not by a long stretch.  You should just read it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Perhaps I should.\" Christina announced and moved from Ryan to where the other girls were gathered.  This took enough time to let Ryan think of just picking her up to move her, an idea that he found he was scared to try.  She might be 1/10 his height at the moment, but she was still as scary as if she was twice.<br>\r\n   But eventually, and all too soon for Berry who was likely thinking of fleeing, Christina was right in front of Berry and holding a hand out for the book, which seemed to be a typical romance novel, even if Berry was handing it over like it contained dynamite.<br>\r\n   Perhaps it did.  Christina hardly did more than open it before she slammed it shut [with enough noise to be impressive even if it had been hardcover].  \"This ... is what you have been reading?\" she asked/accused as she thrust it back at Berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No... It's just one page in this one...\" Berry rather cringed as she tried the same defense again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hey, what is it?\" Ryan broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nothing... At least nothing you should be interested in.\"  Christina announced.  She realized it was a mistake almost as soon as she said it.  Few things are as interesting as those one should not be interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Aw, come on, let me see.\"  Reluctantly Berry extended her arm and showed the book, which Ryan realized was too small for him to read.  \"Now what...  Wait, it's close to a day now.  Berry, five foot five..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A moment later a normal sized, and still very reluctant, Berry was handing the book to him.  Opening it, he read ... \"He cupped and gently squeezed her creamy flesh...\" and the scene rapidly got hotter.  As lurid as any of the books he carefully hid from his ma.  For a moment, Ryan was quite into it, until he recalled Berry and the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It's just a page.\"  Berry repeated again.  Actually it was more than two pages, but Ryan did admit to himself that of a hundred pages of one of his dirty books, ninety might be this sexy.  On the other hand, none would be sexier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"This page is bookmarked, and you've broken the spine here.\"  Ryan pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But they are married...at least they are by the end of the book...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ryan wasn't sure what difference that made, but it did seem to impress the other girls.  \"I'm not sure I understand...\"</span></div></div>",

Or had she been trying to lure Ryan into seeing her in a favorable light?  Christina didn't approve of either, but it was a little hard to accuse Dara when one doesn't know what the crime was. Dara was rather lacking in self confidence, a flaw that had saved her from disaster with several pieces of ill-designed equipment in the doll house. [It could not possibly have been Christina's own unwillingness to get advice from others that had caused those disasters.  It had to have been poorly made tools.]  So maybe she just was wanting to withdraw now to avoid later rejection.  But Dara had excellent manners, and was rather good at manipulating people.

Simply start talking about some part of life and then answer our questions as we find something we do not understand. Right now, we don't really know what we don't know, so anything may be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ryan decided to then pull out a globe hanging around in his room, shooting the five girls the United States, which he pointed to with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK....this is the United States. It's a democracy\", he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What's a democracy?\" Amy asked, providing the first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's a government by the people. We elect our rulers\", Ryan quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"They are not rulers from birth?  But I have never heard of any other way of government\",  a puzzled Dara added. Amy proves about as ignorant. And so Ryan explains a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The conversation then started to wander. One answer would produce a dozen questions on a dozen subjects, and government is soon an abandoned topic, as were dozens more. But Ryan was learning more about the girls even as they learn more about his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina may well be right about the girls coming from different times.  Berry seems to know most of what Ryan is talking about, rather if she had just moved in from a nearby city. There are some strange gaps here and there, but it seems that she will be able to leave the house and circulate in general society quite soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amy, though, is highly ignorant. She has never heard of bananas, turkeys, or anything that Ryan thinks has a New World origin. If the theory is right, she definitely lived well before 1492.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Emelia's date is somewhere in the 1800's, it would seem.  She knows of trains, but not of automobiles. Other inventions Ryan knows were from close to 1900 seem a surprise to her.  He would say 1830, but he recalls that most of society lived on farms in those days and as a farm girl, she likely wouldn't know the latest science of the day. So maybe 1850 or a little later. Christina continues to act like everything around her is an antique that was long ago replaced by easier to use models. She sticks with her guess that she is from 50 years in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And Dara continues to show she is from a completely different world. It seems to be like some fantasy story, but Ryan can't identify it with any he knows. Her home seems to be almost the same and yet very different. When the subject of human races came up, and Ryan mentioned the main difference is skin color, she reacts with puzzlement, as if she was familiar with races that differed much more.  However, she is unable to describe any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, Ryan finds he is still learning more of the girls even as they learn. All in all, Christina's idea seemed to be working well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   By the next day, Ryan was getting a little bored with teaching, but what to do for variety, he asked himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It took a couple of minutes before he remembered that Berry didn't really need any teaching.  There were gaps (besides her personal facts), but in some respects she knew as much as Ryan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Berry, why don't you and I take a walk to the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry's plan for the day had included a few romance books, but her agreement was quick and enthused. A little time with Ryan and learning about the rest of the world did sound quite nice, especially the \"alone with Ryan\" part.  Not that anything was at all likely to happen, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Smuggling Berry out past his parents was no problem.  She merely rode on his back pack.  A house or two away, he commanded her to grow to normal size and the two were ready to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For both, it was a pleasant walk.  Ryan at least found it a date without the pressures of a date. The fear she would do something terrible if she got displeased, and that she would be easily displeased wasn't hanging over his every word and deed.  Berry wasn't adverse to his presence, but mostly she was just happy to be exploring the wider world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For some reason, though, the mall was not so nice. She couldn't think why. It seemed a typical enough mall, but something seemed missing. Still, shopping was fun, even if she was not buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But the feeling that something was missing, or maybe wrong, returned in full force once Ryan announced it was time for lunch, and steered her to the food court.  Yes, something was out of place here, but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How about some TFC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"TFC?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Tennessee Fried Chicken\",  Ryan answered, pointing to a prominent booth in the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Was that the problem?  Berry could see no danger in it, and still could not explain her feelings, so she allowed Ryan to steer her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Up closer, the feelings seemed to vanish.  If she had never been in this business before, and with her memory problem, she could not be sure of that, it would seem she had been in a similar place. The prices seemed somehow about right and the chicken provided by the business about what she somehow \"expected\".  Nor was it at all awkward to eat. It would seem she had eaten a fair amount of similar fare. Maybe she was just nervous over nothing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Of course that made it a good time for the fates to give her something real to be worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Can I have some?\" a voice rang out around Ryan's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking at the small, familiar voice, Ryan and Berry saw Amy emerging from Ryan's backpack. It was Ryan who got over his shock first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Amy, what are you doing here?\" he almost whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I snuck into your pack. It was getting boring around your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, get back in the pack. We don't want anybody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, what is this?\"  sounded a voice familiar to Ryan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With a bit of terror, Ryan turns to see...</span></div></div>",

A 5 foot 4, brunette-haired girl that Ryan knew from school, who was nearly every class he was.If there was a girl who more demonstrated his changed attitude towards girls, Ryan had no idea who she would be. Two years ago, she had been a great pal. Now she was something scary that could reduce him to stammering without trying.  That she had been standing right behind him so that when he turned around on his chair, he was looking up at the biggest set of boobs in his class left him unable to even stammer. How had she changed so much? (She hadn't, actually. She had been the most developed lass two years ago too, but that had not been important then)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Ryan tried to focus his mind enough to manage to babble, Iris continued to examine Amy, who was not bothered at all with facing a giant 12 times her height.  She stood boldly on Ryan's shoulder while a vaguely rational part of Ryan's mind was wishing it was Christina, who would have had the good sense not to be seen, or Emelia who wouldn't have had the nerve to come out to be seen.  But no..., Amy was the one with the nerve to try something like this, and of course she continued to display that nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"My, what are you?\" Iris asked Amy, thinking she was a little cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm Amy, and that girl over there is Berry. And what are you?\" Amy rather casually answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Iris looked up at Berry.  What was going on here?  Was Ryan trying to play some sort of trick on her? He had done so in the past, but nothing recent.  Instead he had started acting kinda strange. Well, if he was getting back to normal, it was worth falling for the gag. He had never tried anything too mean anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm Iris.  I'm a student in Ryan's class.  But why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry was not sure why Ryan wanted to keep them a secret, but he did, and she knew Amy would happily tell all. Best to limit the damage (if it was damage).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That's rather a long story. Can we tell you a little later, in some place not so public?\" Amy asked as people began to stare at them around the food court.  With luck, that would be considerably later, and Ryan could deal with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Without luck, Iris announced, \"No problem.  I'll just join you and Ryan...\"  [In a year Ryan would be rejoicing over the fact that the chairs were too close together for Iris to sit down without a notable amount of her touching a notable amount of him, but her getting angry over that was too terrible to contemplate, and Ryan cowered on the edge of his chair.]  \"...And now, Ryan, you can tell me while we are eating, or perhaps afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Afterwards\"? Definitely, Ryan told himself. But what was he to say? And how was he to persuade Iris not to repeat it?  Well, he could hope something would happen. In the meantime he had best handle what he can handle.  He tore off a tiny hunk of meat and gave it to Amy, to whom it was bigger than a turkey leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Here's some for you. Now please get back in my pack\", Ryan told Amy, who did as she was requested, probably unaware of the hash she had made of Ryan's plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now you have got to tell me how you are doing that\",  Iris said as she turned her attention to her food.  She turned over some of the possibilities as she ate. Six inch tall people don't exist. But Amy looked amazingly real, really too real for any sort of mechanical doll. Maybe she was actually some sort of hologram. She didn't know too much about them, but they were sorta pictures in mid-air. That might work?  Of course, where would Ryan get something like that?  And how or why would he...? Well, there were just so many questions, and Iris was looking forward to Ryan explaining them to her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan, meanwhile, was glumly coming to the same conclusion.  How much was the next question? Should he try to tell her the minimum and hope she was satisfied with that? Or take her to his house and tell her everything?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Iris was excited enough that her meal just vanished into her mouth.  Then she was ready to ask questions.  Since Ryan was somewhat slowly picking at his food as he tried to get his thoughts in order, she turned to Berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have seen you at school.  Do you go to Western High?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ah... no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Berry was worried. There were things that Ryan didn't want told, but she didn't know what, nor to who. But she also didn't want to lie. It wasn't nice, and she didn't know enough about what was going on to tell a believable lie anyway. How was she to respond?  She could only hope Ryan would take over before she did anything too unforgivable. It wasn't looking so well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh?  What school do you go to?\" Iris asked again, confused by Berry's lack of response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Um...I don't go to school\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh?  You're home schooled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I guess..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You 'guess'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan realized he was going to have to do something.  Iris was just going to keep asking questions until things went out of control. He thought it was best to explain about the situation so she didn't get any wild ideas.  Wolfing down the last bite, he then announced, \"Come on.  I need a quiet spot to explain this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The mall would be extra busy and there just was no place with any privacy.  They ended up outside, deep in the parking lot. Iris began to recall some of those crazy kidnapping stories her paranoid mom was always telling.  Of course they were mostly fantasy or she would have been kidnapped long ago, and Ryan wouldn't do anything like that anyway. Still, she was feeling a bit nervous when Ryan finally said, \"I guess this will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Taking Amy out of his backpack, Ryan put her on the ground and ordered \"Amy, 5'5\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The results didn't really answer Iris' questions, but they did stop them.  Going from looking down at a doll of maybe 6\" to looking up at a normal sized girl, she thought she was doing well to just be standing there gap-eyed.  She ought to running away screaming. Well, maybe not.  The girl (Amy?) looked friendly, and hardly a threat.  It was still something of a shock to Irish, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Oh yes... Ryan was saying something... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"...bought them at this store, and a box that lets me change their size.  I don't know where they came from.  Some real weird place I think.  Anyway, they are staying with me for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You bought them? That's illegal, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No, I don't think so\",  Ryan answered.  \"They were just dolls then.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Dolls?  How could they be dolls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't know.  But they were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's right\", confirmed Amy.  \"I saw him grow the others and they were just dolls until they grew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Others?  How many of you are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Five. Berry, Christina, Dara, Emelia, and myself.  Right now, we are staying in his sister's doll house.\" Ryan couldn't decide if he should be angry or relieved at Amy taking over the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And he can just shrink you and grow you?\" Iris asked, bewildered from the earlier growth she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Pretty much. Though he can only change our size five times a day, and we haven't gotten much over seven feet yet.  Might be fun to be 50 foot tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Have you considered that boys would be able to look up your skirt?\" <i>Is she taking this entirely too well?</i> Iris wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hmm.  Hadn't considered that.  Guess we'll have to make sure nobody but Ryan is around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Iris had a host of questions for both Ryan and his, um, \"dolls\", but one stood out to her the most at the moment <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ryan...\", she began to ask the boy, looking a little red red in the face.</span></div></div>",

From this position Ryan could easily her big, 37 inch breasts poking his body, blushing furiously at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwease, Ryan?\" Iris teased the boy once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right\", he sighed as he placed the box next to his mouth. \"Iris, 6 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon giving out the command, Ryan waited for something to happen, as did Amy and Berry. Within a few moments, though, a change was beginning to the girl before their very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it worked?\" the purched Amy asked, leaning over from Ryan's shoulder to see his friend a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope it works! It would be nice to have a new friend over\", hoped Berry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first nobody was really sure the changes Ryan, Berry, and Amy were seeing were more than imagination (Ryan in particular would have dismissed it if he did remember that the change had been slow the first time). But before anybody could say anything that would have sounded dumb in retrospect, it was clear that Iris really was looking up at the others: and she wasn't bending down so the others could see the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shrinking reached a noticeable rate, it increased rapidly. In less time than it had taken to get her down to 5', Iris was down to less than 1', and then only the 6\" Ryan had ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, what an experience!</i> Iris thought to herself. She doubted she would want to do this often, but it was great to do once. She could see all sorts of things she now couldn't normally see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...including that Amy\u2019s orange hair color was not due to a dye job. She agreed with that Ryan that she should not grow her to 50\u2019..at least not until some changes are made to her outfit, such as her orange hair. Who had real orange hair? (Well, of course, just who could shrink a girl down to six inches?) That was something out of movies, and Iris seemed to recall somebody saying it simply could not be done at all. But apparently it could. A sensible lass might wisely beg to be enlarged and then get far away, but if Iris had been that sensible lass, she would not be here looking up at the others. The idea of secrets to explore excited her no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIris, what school do you go to?\u201d Ryan asked her, wondering if she remembered anything after her shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWestern High, of course\", she replied. Why was Ryan asking a dumb question like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I ever rescued you from anything?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did find my diary that one time and returned it without opening it. I would have just died if Suzy had gotten hold of it. What\u2019s with these questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe can\u2019t remember our pasts, at least not enough to count,\u201d Berry answered. \u201cBut we do remember that Ryan rescued us some way, even if we have no idea how. Since Ryan has no idea either, Christina has wondered if the whole rescue was just a dream. Since you didn\u2019t get any dream by being shrunk, the rescue must have been real, which is so romantic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was pretty sure there was a hole in that logic, but she could (somewhat) understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the idea? Ryan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sense mentioning that he had also been thinking that if Iris had gotten this idea he had rescued her, he could have gotten any girl in the school be really friendly just by shrinking her and growing her back to normal.  He was pretty sure the girls would make a fuss if he mentioned it, and besides, it was just a thought.  He wouldn\u2019t have actually tried it. (It was a tempting thought though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess all it does is shrink you or grow you\", Ryan said to the smaller Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his shrunk companion, he was surprised to notice that she just wasn\u2019t scary now.  She looked the same (except for being small), but somehow the idea of her glaring at him for saying something stupid didn\u2019t seem nearly so terrifying. However, he was pretty sure she would be frightening again when she grew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you want to do while you are small?\u201d Ryan asked Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she began, now in deep thought.</span></div></div>",

It's actually a real house and not just a doll house. It's got most everything. For example, my room has thousands of books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What about you, Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's fit for a king, or I guess, a queen. No books, but I like the pictures of animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It does sound like something I'd like to see\", Iris agreed.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK\", Ryan agreed. \"I'd better just shrink all three of you now then so I can smuggle you into my house. My mom would start asking questions if she saw you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, all three girls were doll house size and scrambling into Ryan's pack, which fortunately had nothing solid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That did not make it a comfortable ride, at least not for Iris.  The bouncing when you walk doesn't feel like much when you are normal sized, but when you are 1/12th your normal size, an inch becomes a foot, and a considerable jolt.  \"I think I'll walk next time\" became an opinion shared by the others, though Amy seemed puzzled that the others had expected any better.  She couldn't explain why: she had assumed the ride would not be smooth. It was Berry who solved that minor puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Christina thinks Amy came from the distant past. She's never seen an auto before today. I bet she was expecting a bumpy old wagon instead of the smooth ride we would get in a car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She came from the past?  How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No idea\", Amy answered.  \"But she thinks Emelia also came from the past, that she came from the future, and Dara came from a place that never existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't think that is quite what she meant\", Berry corrected.  \"But Dara has light blue hair, which isn't dyed, and so she must come from someplace really far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She may not be the only one\", Iris observed. \"Amy's orange hair is natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What?  But...\", Berry lapsed into silence, wondering what this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Iris, however, had some questions for Ryan. Climbing to the top of the pack and sticking her hear out, she asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ryan, why did you want us shrunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"If my mom found out 5 girls were staying in my room, she'd throw a fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She should have thought of that. Her mom would likely go crazy too, and that's not even considering the boy-girl aspect.  But the more important question was \"what are you going to do with these girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, don't you think you should something for the girls?\" Iris asked Ryan, who had a fairly difficult time answering this question. After all, the girls eventually had to go..</span></div></div>",

I can't keep them hidden forever...\"  [Not that it didn't sound appealing in some ways, but Ryan had already learned how hard it was to keep them secret.  Every day somebody new was learning about them.  That didn't speak well of his chances of keeping them secret long.]  \"...but what can I do with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Shouldn't they go to school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I suppose...but how do we get them into school without a big fuss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I might be able to manage that.  I have a...friend in the administration department.  He might be able to fiddle with the records ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris wasn't sure if she hoped he could or not. One should repay favors after all, and she wasn't sure if she was ready or not.  He was sweet and all, and she could certainly do worse. And all he would likely want is a chance to do her another favor, but.. Boys have it easy; they're never in doubt about such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I can't promise anything, and it'll be a couple of days anyway\", Iris told Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if it is a week before they should be out in public anyway. They do have a lot to learn\", e responded, thinking of the various things that would happen should the girls interact with the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Soon enough they were in sight of Ryan's house, and Iris ducked back into the backpack. Then she learned that climbing stairs in that backpack was an \"experience\". Of course, Ryan's willingness to take two steps at a time did add a little excitement.  Thankfully, it also made it shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Iris then found herself in Ginger's room,which she gazed at, looking like a mansion from her height.  It was certainly not like any dollhouse she has ever seen, nor did it seem like one as she entered.  It looked amazing, like a full size house.  There was something odd at the walls, though..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You can see through the walls\", Amy explained. \"Ryan and Ginger can open the house up to look inside.  When they do, you can see them just they can see you.\"  This was immediately confirmed when Ryan opened the room up and Iris found herself seeing both the wall and Ryan beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I see...\" Iris responded, unsure if she approved of that kind of opening or not. \"Perhaps I should meet the other girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That was quickly arranged. Emelia seemed quite nice. Dara was in some ways nicer, but Iris wasn't sure what she felt about that story of her not being human. Christina reminded her of her older sister, which was not in her favor. And like her older sister, Christina seemed to want to push her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to enroll us in school?  Then perhaps you should tell us about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Iris was tempted to refuse just to annoy her \"older sister\", but it was her idea, and so she did need to teach these girls what she could...unless she got a better idea.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Iris described her normal school day to the other girls. She told them about she went to a place with a couple thousand students, all of them of about her age, where she moved to several different classrooms for each class during the course of her day, and that she would be doing this for 3 more years.  She was surprised at how abnormal this seemed to most of her audience. Christina's idea that the girls came from very different backgrounds was sounding more and more reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The girls insisted they remembered nothing, but there were hints. Berry seemed to regard this school idea as reasonably normal, but Amy didn't even know what a school was: she didn't seem to have never had any form of formal instruction.  Emelia knew what a school was, but that one would go there for a dozen years and for all year long? This sounded absurd to her.  Dara found it reasonable that she would be going to school so much, but she seemed to think school should be one student to one teacher. Iris was not so sure she understood what Christina was saying. Was she saying she had never physically been in the same room with a teacher or other classmates?  Did she communicate with them entirely by computer?  Even if she was from the future like she thought, that seemed hard to believe (Then again, Christina complained about books lacking search functions. That was very sci--fi from Iris' view, but Christina deemed it very normal and basic. So maybe..).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, Christina did not like not being in charge of the situation, and so she took another glance at Iris before telling her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So we should be going to school as soon as you can get us ready. So how are we to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, Ryan has this idea of sneaking you into the school, but it would likely be better to talk with the principal instead\",  Iris started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No\", went Christina, unpleasant by Iris' suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No. I'm not sure what your authorities will do, but I know bad things will happen. We many never even see Ryan again. We owe him a lot for saving us, and are eager to repay him anyway we can, if not in the way he likely wants (well, <i>I</i> won't repay him that way at least). But if Ryan wants us to stay here, we'll do so happily. So we need to find a way to sneak into your school if we're going to go to it\". Christina's attitude showed her determination in the situation. Looking at the others, Iris saw no disagreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right\", Berry agreed. \"I can just imagine the police thinking we have broken some law or other, or some scientists insisting we need to go be studied, or...\". She could've gone on for a while if needed, but what she had already said was enough to scare Emelia into tears, and the others broke off to assure her it wasn't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Iris could see she was not going to convince them they were wrong, and they could be right. There were all sorts of laws they could be violating, but if they could convince anybody to listen, they would also cause all sorts of fuss. Things might be settled well enough, but there was no guarantee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have a friend who might be able to sneak most of you into school. If that's what you really want..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They do, and Iris was left to wonder how she can manage that. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     There was a full doll house for Iris to explore, which was a rather ordinary place..as long as one forgot it was a doll house. Of course, it was very large, several times the size of her home (or most homes she had been in), but if one thought of it as an apartment building, it was common enough, mostly. But then one remembered it was a doll house in a little girl's bedroom, and all sorts of impossibilities became apparent. They would be quite disturbing if they didn't make life so much more convenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, Iris was relieved when she noticed Ryan was once again looking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, it's time for me to go home.  If you could take me out and grow me...\", requested Iris, reaching out her hands to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, it wouldn't be a good idea to return you to normal size while you're still inside of the doll house. Now how to do that? Oh, just get into that basket there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once Iris had done as told, he continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now just be calm...\" And with that he put the basket out the window and started lowering it calmly. Calm was definitely what he wanted. That would be much easier to maintain if one were not in a shaky basket that jerked every time Ryan fed out another foot of the rope. Granted it was a good idea, but it was so easy to think about how easy the basket could jerk enough to flip her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But then she felt a bump that meant she was on the ground, and she could wait until Ryan slipped out of the house and picked up the basket and herself. Ryan happily carried the basket with less jerking than when he lowered it. And it was hardly any time at all before Ryan was saying to Iris,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK, this is out of anybody's sight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And a moment later, Iris was back to normal as Ryan talked into the black box and returned the girl back to her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Quite a day\", Iris sighed. \"Thanks, Ryan. I think I may want to visit 'your' girls again. I'll be seeing you, then.\"  And with that, Iris headed home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But should she head directly home? She wondered if this was the best time to have a talk with John, if she was going to at all. She was thinking of asking him quite a favor, after all.  He might well refuse, or he might agree, and that could be worse. She didn't think he would go all crude on her. He was too nice a guy for that.  Of course, that would be worse in a way as well. She of course would refuse if he demanded some sort of \"pay\", but if he just says he will be glad to just do her a favor. Well, favors need to be repaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He wouldn't want that as a repayment, would he?  Well of course he would, but...he wouldn't ask, would he?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   To make it worse, she wasn't sure how she would respond. John was...well, very nice. It was kinda early to be thinking much, but things could get pretty serious. Did she want them to? It could be really wonderful...or not.  Was she ready to find out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This favor could easily end up in her rushing into things.  It was all so scary, but Iris could think of no other way to get the girls into the school without John's help.  Maybe he could think of something that won't commit her quite so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, she would find out soon enough. Somehow her feet carried herself to John's home. </span></div></div>",

And that might be the most sensible thing she had ever done in her life.<br>\r\n   Or it might be passing up something wonderful...  Or it might be nothing at all.  After all, a lot of important decisions didn't seem to have made much difference...  But she was really afraid this wasn't one of them.<br>\r\n    Oh why dither?  She had made her decision an hour ago, and despite all her scardy cat feelings, she wasn't going to change it.  She'd just have to hope it worked out.  With that, she rang the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    John was quick to answer, and thankfully happier to see her than she was that he was home.  After a few casual remarks and being invited in, Iris got down to business.  \"John, I'm wanting to see if you will do me a big favor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Of course.  What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, you've bragged you can do just about anything with the school records...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This about your grades?  I thought you were doing pretty well in your classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No.  It's nothing about me.  It's ... Well, just hear me out before you say I'm crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Just as well it's not about fixing your grades.  I can do that, but it's probably a bad idea.  Too many people would know too much.  And you should be studying, even if the work is stupid and boring.  But let's hear your story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It took Iris far longer to tell her story than she would have expected.  Part of the problem was she hadn't realized just how much she had just assumed without checking, not to mention how much just sounded silly, at least until you had actually seen a girl grown and had been shrunk herself as well.  <br>\r\n    At least John didn't laugh.  She didn't think he was taking the idea seriously, for which she could hardly blame him, but at least he was pretending to.  \"Now I have just got to see these girls.  That's a sight not to be missed.  That's first.<br>\r\n    \"Second, I have to point out you are risking a lot of trouble here.  There have got to be lots of better ways to deal with this than just sneaking around like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I know, but the girls aren't interested in anything that parts them from Ryan, and they may be right that official attention could turn nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I suppose.\"  John agrees.  \"The government can do some pretty nasty things by accident, and even worse on purpose.  We'll [a word that Iris found very encouraging] still have to talk with them some more about just coming clean.<br>\r\n    \"Now I should be able to fake the needed records.  Nobody really pays that much attention to them when you come down to it.  But we will need to make sure the girls keep their heads down.  Too much notice and somebody will ask the wrong questions.  We don't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But you'll help?\"  She might someday might bitterly regret that, but right now it seemed so thrilling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Anything for you, my girl.  Now first...\"</span></div></div>",

With that, she pulled out her cell-phone and called up Ryan, who quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.  How alone are you?\u201d she asked him. As with the many attempts to be secret, Iris trying to sneak around was more noticeable than if she didn\u2019t try.  But she didn\u2019t want to be spilling secrets where his parents could hear, and so forgot that she was revealing there were secrets worth hearing. But this time, she was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in my room.  What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were thinking of a picnic with you and the girls tomorrow at the park.

I\u2019ll call you back\", Ryan ended the call with, running down the stairs and asking his mother if he could go to the park tomorrow with Iris and a \"couple of other kids\". His mother could be forgiven for focusing on the mention of Iris, and assuming that was the important part. She thought it was about time for Ryan to wanting to be alone with young ladies, and Iris seemed a nice enough one. And since they weren't going to be too alone, she told him it was okay almost without thinking. Though perhaps she should have paid more attention to Ryan going back upstairs to phone Iris instead of using the home phone right at his fingertips. Still, teenagers do value their privacy, and she found nothing unusual about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Ryan phoned Iris to tell her going to the picnic tomorrow was ready to go, and then he went to Ginger's room to tell the girls they now had a social life of sorts. The announcement did not go off quite as smoothly as he might have expected...</span></div></div>",

This was already an old story for the other girls.  Dara would politely do any chore asked of her, but she still acted surprised if a dress she dropped on the floor was still there the next time she entered the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Dara,\" Berry assured her, \"I don't know how it was where you came from... I guess you don't either..., but we don't need the guards here.  This is perfectly safe.  There won't be any monsters or any danger.\"  Dara did not look convinced, but as all knew, she almost never contradicted anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Anyway,\" Berry continued, \"We need to prepare our food for the picnic...and we will be normal size, won't we?  Well, everything we have carried up to now has shrunk or grown with us, so maybe no problem, but we had best check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A moment later Berry was loaded down with whatever was within reach.  \"Now grow me.\"  Ryan did as requested and shortly Berry was much larger, but still loaded down.  \"Great.  We can grow the food we have in the house and take it along.  Now just shrink me back down and we can start preparing for the picnic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A minute later, the girls were busy with that, and Ryan was left free to plan out how to get them out of the house and to the picnic.

Of course, he was not going to admit to anyone just how long it took him to think of the idea. It looked entirely too obvious once he had gotten past the agonizing. Happily the girls didn't seem to know what his idea was.  Of course, they apparently had not worried about it either.  But the idea they had expected him to find a solution for wasn't exactly hard on his ego.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  Once the girls were assembled in the doll house kitchen and had the food ready, Ryan opened the doll house to the kitchen and announced information for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"OK Amy, step into our magic box, and\", he told Amy as she did as told. \"Amy, 1 inch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And now there was still plenty of room for the other girls too. Shortly he had all the other lasses in the box, which was still not at all full. And yet, somehow, its contents would not be affected by outside movements. Suppressing a sudden desire to give that a real testing, Ryan now put the box, and the girls, into his backpack.  Excellent.  His mother wouldn't ever look in there, and would not worry about a small box if she did. He then went downstairs to pick up the lunch his mom was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All went as expected, and Ryan was soon walking to the park, wishing he was just a little older and had his own car.  But he wasn't, and he couldn't have his mother drive him, not when he was deep in his secret magic, so he had to walk to the park. But at least he was young and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Soon enough he was entering the park. Finding Iris and John, if not as easy as it was supposed to be, was only a minor task. John directed them to an area pretty much out of sight where a blanket was spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now\", John demanded. \"You are supposed to have some young ladies with you.  Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As a showman, Ryan needed quite a bit of training.  Turning a tiny 1' girl into a normal one of 5'6\" or so ought to be dramatic.  But somehow Ryan found a way not to shock his audience (well, not any more than seeing the impossible happen several times would impress anybody). A moment later, a picnic of 3 became a picnic of 8, and the food available crowded the blanket as the girls distributed their burdens.  Happily for Ryan's ego, John proved easy to impress and was still standing there with his mouth open after the girls had introduced themselves and had a seat.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \"I...see\", he finally uttered after wearing off the shocking sight before him. Before he say anymore, though, Ryan's appetite prevented him from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"OK, everyone. Let's eat!\", he announced, which everyone agreed with. Everyone was in a much better mood after eating their food.    </span></div></div>",

Name, age, height, weight..., just fill out this form here.\"  With that, John passed out clip boards with paper and pencils, and the girls set to work filling them out. A bit surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Ryan was fairly sure that Amy had been completely illiterate in her old life, and he wouldn't bet against Emelia being unable to write.  But somehow they were able to handle the form reasonably, or at least as well as the others...which wasn't all that well. The first line brought trouble; none of the girls knew their last names (though Ryan suspected that Amy had never had one). And many other lines were also problems. Their discussion on how to deal with this was why they were surprised to hear from John, \"Bet you girls would like to meet some real men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Turning, Ryan found himself facing some of the reasons a private location in a public park could be a bad idea. Five punks had somehow crept up on them. The smallest of them outweighed Ryan by 20 pounds, all of that muscle, and the biggest was larger than John by at least that much.  And they were likely armed and used to fighting, too. Worse, they were likely eager to.  This was not the time to remember how happy he had been that nobody like the police would notice them here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This was really not the time to be a male.  A man must stand between women and the threat, and get beat to a pulp while the women escaped. Couldn't he please still be a little boy? But Ryan still found himself struggling to his feet, and trying to get into position. But somehow Dara was there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We thank you for the offer, but we are satisfied with our current escorts. Now we have personal business, so I must request you leave\", she politely told them, hoping they would listen. The nearest lout laughed and grabbed her arm, pulling her to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll take a kiss first\", he told Dara as he pushed her face closer to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I must warn you to let go of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Amused, the big thug asked the delicate lass a full foot shorter than him, \"And what will you do when I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A second later he was on the ground, howling in pain.  A kick to the head silenced that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That\", was Dara's serene answer, but Ryan was anything but serene. Those other four lowlifes before might've been satisfied to just beat him up, but now they were out for blood, with his{/i} blood being all too high on that list. But he couldn't let Dara get hurt, even if the only way to stop this was really going to hurt (if he was lucky).  He took a step forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Dara, however, took two. What else she did was impossible for Ryan to see.  But the thug pulling his knife had dropped it as he held his now limp arm. His pal next to him was crumbling to the ground, clearly out of the fight. Two steps behind them, the last two stopped advancing, looked at their fallen companions, and proceeded to take a step back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As Ryan tried to gather his wits, Dara turned to him and casually said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This is why I wanted guards; they could've taken charge of such trifles.  So what is to be done with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ah... We don't want attention.  Best if they just leave\", Ryan decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Very well\", Dara complied, turning her face to the remaining louts. \"If you would please remove your companions, I would be most grateful.\"  She took a few steps back so they could do so.</span></div></div>",

I hope this will not cause you any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Turning one's back on dangerous thugs is rash, and one of the punks proceeded to show why.  A knife was suddenly in his hand and he threw it at Dara's exposed back.  Ryan saw it, but had barely opened his mouth to shout a warning before the knife reached her...<br>\r\n   And missed.  Somehow Dara had turned just enough that the knife aimed for the middle of her back went speeding by her, heading right at a shocked John who was definitely not going to be able to dodge...  <br>\r\n    But it seemed that Dara could pluck the knife right out of the air, even if the force behind it spun her around.  Or did she just use the energy of the throw to spin herself around?  In either case, she ended up facing a startled foe who had not yet even realized he might be the one in peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"A very nice knife.  I thank you for the peace gift and accept it as a worthy pledge that all disputes between us are as nothing.  I grant you leave to depart without pursuit.  Should we meet again, all is well between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The former owner of the knife looked at it, and then at his damaged companions, and decided enough was enough.  He turned to the last lout and after a gesture, the two began helping their friends leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Most of the picnickers remained in a state of shock until they were out of sight.  Dara was inspecting the knife.  \"Better quality than I had thought.  \"I hope they didn't steal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ryan managed to get his voice back.  \"How could you do that?  There were five of them, big mean guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"How could I not?  They were just 1st level commoners.  It wasn't even a level-appropriate encounter.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"1st level?  Encounter?\"  John asked.  \"That's gamer talk.  Where did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm sorry, but I have no idea.  Those simply seemed the proper words.  I do not know why.\" Dara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina broke her own silence with \"It may be we have underestimated how different Dara's background is.  However, I suggest we consider it later.  We have business to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ah..yes.\"  John agreed.  \"Now I still need all the information I can get from you five.  I can see I hadn't realized all we would need, but we can make a start and we can get together later to take care of the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The girls got to work, but it was hard not to think about what they had just seen, and to wonder if there were more secrets about Dara, or about themselves for that matter.       </span></div></div>",

[Ryan was rather envious that John had managed to one hand the catch.]<br>\r\n  \"Now the rest of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The test turned up no talent or knowledge of baseball.  Amy showed a good <br>\r\ndeal of enthusiasm and may well have thrown something in her past, but it had not been a baseball [rocks maybe?].

John scares her, and he may just ruin her life in the near future, but she is not about to let Christina steal him from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Of course, she is not at all sure she intends to steal John, and even less sure how she is to prevent it.  At most ages, the younger woman has the advantage, but at her age, Christina makes Iris feel like a baby.

She would be alone with John entirely too much for comfort.  What if he tried something?  Could she trust him? Would he...? What if he...? Of course he wouldn't do that sort of that thing. But what about...? For that matter, could she trust herself? John was a quite attractive fellow, after all.  Would she really resist his masculine charms?  Or would she do something totally humiliating?  She supposed she could convince everybody it was John's fault (everybody but herself anyway). And what if her friends, or her family, heard about how much time she would be spending alone with him? What would they say? What would they do?  Could she live with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Wouldn't it be better, and/or safer to just keep her distance, to let him work alone...alone with Christina...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Not really a difficult decision, was it...No it wasn't. If John was just going to absolutely ruin the life of some girl, it was going to be her. But that didn't stop her from worries when John then said something to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Excellent.  There is a lot of work and I will need the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Iris found herself with an armful of paper and a pen shoved in her arms, and a quickly suppressed feeling that she would have preferred it if he had done something ungentlemanly.  But John was asking the girls questions and she had to record the answers.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   Her feeling of doing some almost made the work vanished as she looked over the questions: the list had obviously been written by a male. Several important questions (important to any woman at least) were absent.  Of course the girls didn't know their mother's names, but that didn't mean they shouldn't have been on the form. She didn't feel really proud about pointing this out, but her feeling of being rather worthless did vanish.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n     \"That'l do for today\", john announced after the girls filled out the forms. \"I have lists for you to fill out and memorize, starting with your last names. You just fill in what seems reasonable.  But it needs to be something you can remember.  Nobody will notice whether your absent mother is Ann Jones or Betty Smith, but they will notice if you use both names.  So the important thing is that you know everything on the list and respond automatically with that answer. Give me a call and tell me what's on the lists.  I should have preliminary paperwork the next time we get together.\"  After farewells were between John, Ryan, and the girls, the guy had one more thing left to do. And it had to do with Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"If you can come with me, Iris, we can get some work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sure\", she hesitated to rely, a catch in her voice.</span></div></div>",

Certainly it \"tasted\" like medicine that was good for you.  And Iris was all so eager to \"spit it out\".  More realistically, take her hours of work, burn them to ashes, and dance on those ashes.  And like with medicine, she knew that was a very bad idea.  With a sigh, she got back to work.<br>\r\n    It would help if she knew John's intentions... Well, she did actually.  He's a boy after all, so that was given.  But how honorable were those intentions?  There was a big difference between his pleading for permission and dragging her into a back room and throwing her on a bed.<br>\r\n   ...For that matter there was a big difference between his dragging her into a back room and throwing her on a bed and his dragging her into a back room and throwing her on a bed.  She wasn't sure she could say why or how, but when she pictured such a scene, it didn't always seem horrible, not at all.<br>\r\n    Maybe it was that there was no more doubt.  Certainly it was bad enough not knowing what he was going to do, and not knowing what she wanted him to do.  <br>\r\n   In that respect, John was being no help at all.  OK, she didn't want him trying to paw her or something, and she wasn't at all sure she wanted him writing sonnets about her.

Standing here and lying to her parents when John could hear, or telling the truth, they both sounded bad.  Much better that she was merely given a time to be home by.  [Or was that bad too?  John would know if she tried to use her parents as an excuse in the future...  Well, that is the future, and at least she was getting by today.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dinner did nothing to relieve her anxieties.  Well, maybe technically.  The dinner was nice, and she had a good time and all, which John went out of his way to make sure of.  But that just meant she was a step closer to being completely at his mercy, and she still had no idea if that was a good or bad thing.  <br>\r\n    She would be much happier, at least for now, if she could only live for the moment, but...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he had stopped with just taking Amy from the box, he would be learning a lot about anatomy by now.  He can only guess just how much, but Amy was uninhibited and liked him.  The idea of how much she would be willing to do was quite disturbing, and even more interesting.<br>\r\n   If he had just taken out Emelia, she just clung to him as a protector.  Surely she would have been willing to reward him for a job well done.  Of course he did have thoughts at times that this would have been taking advantage of her, but he doubted Emelia would see it that way, at least if he did that job of protector.<br>\r\n   Berry too wouldn't see it as anything but wonderful if he honestly swore he loved her.  Maybe he couldn't do that right away, but if he and she had been alone...<br>\r\n   It was a little harder to see Dara throwing herself at him.  She was always so correct.  Still, she did like him and even if Ryan couldn't figure out how he could persuade her, he could see a picture them both in bed without thinking that was impossible.<br>\r\n    Which was what he thought in the case of Cristina.  She too liked him, but all too much in a big sisterly way.  Not much chance even if they had been alone from the start.<br>\r\n    And there was even less chance having all five of them.  Amy on his left entirely too close for comfort, and Emelia even closer on the right, how did one court Berry across the table?  Dara might not be much of a wet blanket, but Christina sure was.  Ryan might be touching more female flesh that he would have though just a little while ago, but that was all he was doing, and there was little hope he would be doing more.<br>\r\n    Given his experience, he wondered if those kings with big harems ever got any at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Instead, his time with the girls was spent getting them ready for school.  There was so much that they didn't know, things which they would be assumed to know.  Even Berry didn't know obvious things like who was President.  More important, people would be asking about their family and background, things they could only guess about.  They must invent histories and families, and be drilled in the details.  <br>\r\n   Which meant that Ryan, surrounded by boobs and having them right in front of him, has to ignore them and listen to what the girls were saying  The obviously important question of whether Amy was wearing a bra must take second place to whether she was reciting the names of her non-existent family correctly.  There seemed to be a relationship between how much emotion Berry uses in her statement and how much her breasts bounce, but of course Ryan can't look at her rack enough to be sure.  And Emelia was so apt to lean forward to ask if her answer was correct...  The work was harder for Ryan than for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Still, the work was getting done.  Soon the girls would be ready for school, if Ryan could last that long.</span></div></div>",

They might not know why they owed Ryan and they were not sure how much either, but they were sure they owed him a lot, and were eager to repay that debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Christina added \"And that means we must do it well.  We are taking a risk, and can not afford to be sloppy.  We do not know what would happen if we were discovered, but we are sure we don't want it to happen.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The doubts were not resolved.  They were all trying something new and that was scary, even for Berry who likely faced only a different set of names from what her unknown past school was like.  Her almost memory would carry her thru many a crisis.  But the others faced a very new future and that meant a lot of worries.  <br>\r\n    But they were going to face them.  That was decided.

Berry exited the doll house with a number of hugs and hopes for good luck, and got into Ryan's backpack.  There she stayed during the ride to school.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The school office was \"familiar\" to Berry.  That she had no memory of ever being in one didn't stop her from knowing that this woman here was the receptionist and who Berry should report to.  Knowing how she would be treated was unfortunately another matter. Happily the woman was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes?  Can I help you?\" she asked Berry, who handed over the faked paperwork, which is casually scanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I see.  It will take me a little time to process this.  In the meantime, you should see the principal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The words may have been said in a friendly manner, but they still sounded like the clap of doom to Berry.  But there was no choice but to follow directions to the dreaded door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For good or ill, Berry had  time to wonder why she was so terrified.  She had done nothing wrong (at least that anybody here knows about). Why fear him?  Had she been dragged before a previous principal for frequent punishment?  Or maybe the opposite?  Had she never been in trouble and thus this was just the fear of the unknown?  Well, in either case, it was of the past and completely gone from her life.  She knocked and entered on command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Here too, she found her fears were unfounded. The principal welcomed her and asked a few routine questions, not questioning her memorized responses.  He spoke some likely formulaic statements that he expected her to do well here and then allowed her to leave as he turned to other work.  He was nothing like the ogre she had feared minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Still at her desk, the receptionist handed her some new paperwork, a map of the school, and gave her directions on where to go for her first class and what paperwork to give to which teacher. After all that, she returned to her routine tasks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Berry could only stumble out of the office marveling at how much better it had all gone than she had feared.  They had been quite friendly and, more importantly, not really interested in her.  They had taken the the paperwork and processed it, not examined it for error. In some respects they had been nothing but mindless drones, just like John had predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry's luck was not so good when she presented herself to the teacher of her first class, a man of some years.  He snapped at her and read over the paperwork in a bad mood. But he was still a drone (even if an unfriendly one), just like the people in the office.  He took the paperwork at its false word and merely gave Berry a bad time for the extra work he would now have to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry for her part found him nowhere near as scary as the office had been.  He might be a burden on her life for months in the future, but even if she had no memory of them at all, she knew she had been dealing with teachers for a decade, and somehow that knowledge was still with her (even if she couldn't remember any of it).  This teacher was just something she would have to endure, not be scared of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now her classmates were a different matter.  Surely some time in her past, Berry was seen a new student when she joined a class.  Maybe she had been the one.  But no memories surfaced to soothe her worries as she was introduced to the class. There was no sign in the sea of faces that she was regarded as anything important. Having some friends would be nice, but right now Berry was willing to settle for a lack of enemies.  As she returned to her seat, she thought she was getting that wish at least.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Berry's next class was much like her first. The teacher was friendlier, but he still just marked her name down as a member of the class, assigned her work to make up for missed weeks, and effectively forgot about her.  The students also just noticed her presence and resumed their lives..mostly. As Berry left the class on her way to her next, she realized there was somebody at her elbow. The tap came from a girl with brunette colored hair and green eyes, about 5'5\" or so in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Karen. I'm with the Foreign Exchange Club. We'd like you to come to our next meeting. It's in two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Foreign Exchange Club!  She had been specifically warned to avoid them.  These were precisely the people who would know too much about her false past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have never had a student from Schleswig. What's it like there?\" the cheerful girl asked of Berry. To Berry, this was just the start of many questions she felt she would be unable to answer entirely, and only some of them would be possible for her to answer at all.  Fortunately this was one she could give a trite answer to, and Karen didn't have time to answer more. She had to get to her own class, giving Berry all the information she needed about the meeting first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Crisis averted, for the moment.  But she had been spotted by the \"enemy\".  Would it be wiser to deal with them directly, or avoid them? Either way, suspicion could be aroused all too easily. Berry will need advice on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Lunch was after the next class and Iris was there to help her, as well as introduce her to her friends.  If things worked out, she would blend in with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     No such luck.  Berry wasn't aware why students formed cliques: she was barely aware they did. She was only aware that this was not her clique, which is why she had trouble saying much of anything. They were mostly younger than her, and a little more noisy than they should be...but there was still the fact was that she just didn't fit in.  Maybe they didn't purposely want to drive her away, but it seemed to her that all the parties would be happier if she went elsewhere. But where?<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     That is when someone mentions the library club [in a rather disparaging tone].<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"There is a library on campus?\" Berry asked a girl who brought up the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, it's a place where all the nerds hang out.\" [and obviously not where the speaker had any intention of hanging out.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hmm, one of my teachers said I should visit the library...but he didn't say if it was on campus or not.\" [Was that a good recovery?  Or another hint something was wrong about her story?  Well, she was stuck with it either way.]  \"Can you give me directions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Directions were given, and nobody except Iris was disappointed when she left soon afterward. She may be going off on her own into unexplored territory, but she was sure the library was where she should be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And it was a quite impressive place. Berry had no memory that she had ever gone to a high school, much less if it had a library, but she was fairly sure that if it had, it was much inferior to this one.  She was definitely impressed as she marched in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The clerk at the desk, a quiet lady, asked if she could help her when she approached the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, I understand you have a library club...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just registered today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You'll need to fill out these forms.  You may only check out one book today.  Once that is returned, you may check out 3 a day.  Library club members are allowed to...  There is more, rattled off rapidly in none too friendly a manner.  Like she suspected Berry of wanting to steal her precious books...  Berry wouldn't think of doing that...well, unless it was really interesting anyway...  But it ends with \"Now you will want to see Lance over there about the Library Club.\"  With that, she almost rudely  ignored Berry as she turned to other matters.    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Berry might have felt insulted if she was not already on her way to Lance.  Reaching him she introduces herself \"Excuse me, you're Lance? I'm Berry and I am wanting to join the Library club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Lance, a rather good looking blond she had to look up to [By the standards of her romance novels, he was only fair.  Still...], smiles as he answers \"OK, you can help me with shelving these books.  All members of the club put in volunteer hours helping with the library.  You have your application form?  You  write in 3 hours a week you can be here.  A lot of us put in 5.  You ever done any shelving?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n    Berry answers with the safe \"not much.\" and gets a short lecture on what amounts to grunt work.  Then the two of them got to work putting books on the shelves.  Not exactly complex work, but Berry rather wondered if she had done it in her blank past.  Some things just seemed so obvious... until she asked herself why.  On the other hand, some things seemed so wrong.  Three times she read a book's subject and started to go to the wrong section with it until she read the coding number.  It was like she had learned the code, and now somebody had changed half of it.<br>\r\n    Lance was nice enough and had a number of jokes that were funny, without being too funny to tell in the library.  But the biggest joke was on Berry, and even if she was the only one who understood it, she didn't feel like laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"OK, time for me to go.\"  Lance announced.  \"You can help Karen now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Karen?\" Berry answered, hoping she didn't sound as horrified as felt.  Maybe over nothing.  There had to be a dozen Karens in a school this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Sure,\" a possibly oblivious Larry answered as he dragged Berry towards a figure that was looking entirely too familiar.  \"She's our membership secretary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Karen, this is Berry.  She's joining the Library Club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"We've met.\" the cheerful Karen informed Lance before turning to Berry \"Glad to see you again.  Between the Foreign Exchange Club and the Library Club, we'll get to see lots of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Berry could do little but try to make her smile look sincere.  Talk about putting her foot right in the trap.  Her very first day and she had practically forced her way into the spotlight in front of those most likely to expose her.  Should she just confess all and cut the torture short?  No, she couldn't do that.  But Iris was willing to help.  Maybe Karen would be too.  <br>\r\n    And maybe not.  Betting everything on the mercy of a stranger was not a good idea, but the alternative was to outwit a roomful of people who knew more than she did.  That wasn't a good prospect either.  Things were not looking well...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Things soon looked worse for Berry. Karen liked to ask questions; rather personal questions, too. If she had been a little less friendly, Berry would have called her downright nosy. But Berry just wasn't the type to tell her the answer was none of her friend's business. She tried to dodge as best she could with vague answers and with being too \"eager\" to work to talk, but these attempts weren't working, either. With every question, and every inadequate answer, Berry could just see Karen getting more and more suspicious.  Berry could only cling to a shrinking hope that somehow she could pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally Karen asked a question with some foreign phrase in it.  Berry chose to nod in agreement in hopes that was the right answer. It apparently wasn't.  aren put her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That settles it. You don't know German! They did a totally inadequate job on preparing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She knows everything! Everything is about to be exposed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You ...won't tell... Will you?\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    \"Of course not\", Karen answered. \"That would be almost criminal.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   \"Thank you, ... so much.\" Berry was about ready to kiss the other girl in relief.  Only Karen's stern attitude held her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I suppose that since I am the one that exposed you, I'm stuck with the job of repairing your cover story\", Karen grumbled, though her expression suggested she might be eager to do that job. \"We can't talk here. Meet me in study room B in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    What was going on here?  Berry was only sure she was not being immediately exposed and so agreed as they returned to their work. She worried all the way through her next class, which fortunately seemed to be an easy one.  Then she approached study room B with trepidation. Karen was waiting for her, several books in her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"These should cover what you should know about your 'background'. Take them home with you and study them,\" Karen ordered Berry. \"Be careful with them because they are out on my card. So bring any back that you have already read during your training under the Witness Protection Program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Karen kept talking, it suddenly all made a lot more sense to Berry. Karen thought that she and her family were important witnesses in some big criminal case, so she was willing to help protect her from the evil..whatever. Not that unusual an attitude. Berry could recall thrilling to a romance novel on that theme in which...oh bother. She can't remember it, and it had been a favorite of hers, too. Well, it hardly matters now. What was important was that her cover was not nearly as blown as she thought.  Berry might not know much about the Witness Protection Program (well, beyond there was such a thing), but Karen likely didn't know much more.  She could just let Karen fool herself and she would be safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...but was that really fair?  Karen was obviously planning to do a lot of work. Could she just take advantage of her like that?  It might be smart, but it didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Don't see how we can avoid the Foreign Exchange Club\", Karen was saying. \"I've already blabbed that you would be there, so your absence will be way suspicious.  I suppose you could call in sick, but you can't be sick one day every week. So we are going to have to come up with a speech that will satisfy most of the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Karen\", Berry interrupted, \"I'm really grateful for all the help you are offering, but I don't want to take advantage of you. I don't know what I can do, but I should at least tell you what you are getting into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No,\" Karen answered.  \"Anything you tell me is just another leak and a danger to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Maybe...\" Berry responded, \"But I think that not knowing would really eat at you, and I don't want to cause you pain when I can avoid it so easily. Think about it. If you really would like to know, and swore to keep your promise not to tell no matter what...I can show you everything.\"    </span></div></div>",

Letting Karen know was probably a terrible idea.  But what else could she do?  She couldn't just take all of Karen's help and do nothing in return, and she was surely right.  Karen would keep poking and trying to find out even as she tried to stop Berry from exposing herself. That seemed even more likely to lead to trouble.  \"OK, meet me at the SW corner of the parking lot after the last class.  But it's really important that you say nothing to anybody.  We just walked home and discussed ... my speech in two days. You promise? Really, really promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Karen was agreeable, in fact thrilled, to be entrusted with this secret, one that was both worse and better than she probably thought. To Berry's surprise, Karen left acting as if she owed Berry a favor.  That was distinctly shocking, but Berry was not going to be too upset by good news. There was too much other stuff to worry about. Gathering up the books she would have to study, she headed off to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The end of the school day found Berry frazzled, but there had no more disasters or near disasters. She could at least hope that she could get by. But for now she had to deal with Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Karen was waiting when Berry arrived at the appointed spot, a fact Berry suspected measured their relative eagerness. At least she had been in no rush. And Karen seemed to be almost dancing with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Come along.  We'll join the others\", Berry told the pumped up lass as she moved towards where she saw Iris and Ryan waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ooo...\" Karen enthused, \"Multiple meeting points.  I remember that from a movie in which...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Berry found herself surprisingly interested in Karen's description of the show.  It described spy activity in what Berry was sure was horribly inaccurate, but Karen did make it sound great. But now she was face to face with a worried Iris and Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"These are my friends Iris and Ryan. Guys, this is Karen, who will be coming home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Is that wise?\" an even more worried Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Probably not,\" Berry admitted, \"But I don't see an alternative. Karen exposed me in nothing flat, and now she wants to help.  She needs to know what she is getting into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"More and more people...\" Ryan muttered, and then shrugged, \"Well, we can't stay here. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Ryan led the girls away from the school, Karen was feeling upset, disappointed as much as anything. She had been thinking of scary men in dark coats, a terrified family, or even some faceless aliens. To find herself dealing with some other kids was not quite what she had expected. But in a block or so, Ryan would announce something that would change her life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This is good enough\", he proposed as he pulled out the box. \"Berry, you want Karen with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"She might as well get the whole experience.\" Iris answered. Turning to Karen, she continued, \"Relax, you'll enjoy it. I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Karen was not at all assured by this. In fact, it sounded like a reason to turn and run. But she could only think of all sorts of childish things this might be. She would never be able to live with herself if she ran and all this was that she... well, had to eat a bug or something.  And there was that secret of Berry's she wanted to know... So she didn't move as Ryan put this box to his lips and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Karen, 2 inches.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He then put the box on the ground telling Karen, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Just stand next to it, please. I don't think it would hurt if you stood on it, but I don't want to take the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now what was this all about?  They all seemed to be expecting something. Karen thought that she might as well follow orders, even if they were from a mere boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Like this?\" Karen asked as she put a foot on each side of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That might work very well.\" Ryan answered.  \"Now this takes a couple of minutes the first time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Karen still was unsure if she should be running for her life, or marching away from people who were trying to make a fool of her, but she couldn't see any reason to do either.

Then Karen noticed that all the objects she that could be seen are \"growing\" too, and she realizes she must be shrinking...But how?  And what should she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now don't worry\", Iris again insisted [Easy for her to say.  She wasn't the one it was happening to.] \"Both Berry and I have been shrunk and regrown too.  It's nothing you need to be scared of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Karen was hardly convinced. In fact, about all that kept her from running was confusion about which way. But now another problem was developing; that little box between her feet was \"growing\", and she was having problems keeping her balance as her legs were stretched further and further apart. Finally she had to raise a foot, and when it came down, it was inside the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, that should save us some time\", Ryan approved. Karen doubted she did, but now the box side between her legs was getting \"taller\", and Karen had to move her other leg to avoid the \"rising\" edge. She was not quite quick enough and misjudged the rate of \"growth\" - the next thing she knew, she was flat on her back in the box, which briefly, and uncomfortably, seemed about coffin sized.  To her relief, she continued to shrink until it seemed like she was inside a small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Berry, 2 inches\", seemed to boom from above her.  Looking up, she saw that a giant Berry was now in the position she had been a moment ago.  As she watched, Berry became smaller and closer until a \"normal\" sized Berry was once again standing next to her.  Then the lid slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Berry, what is this?  What is going on?\" Karen asked, in almost a combination of a shout and a whisper.  She held onto Berry with a death grip, as the only familiar thing in a world gone mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nothing really\", Berry tried to explain.  \"I guess I should have explained a little better in advance, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Being shrunk to the size of an ant is nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It is when you are going to be unshrunk once we get inside Ryan's house. Now just relax and I'll explain what I know, which isn't that much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It did not take long, and Karen was soon repeating the basics, more to get a grip on herself than to actually make sure she understood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...there were 5 of you, all dolls, in this box that Ryan bought.

I know I have always read a lot, and can almost remember a little about the books, but the details just don't seem to be there when I try to remember them. But yeah, I remember pretty much nothing. I have no idea about the important things, like family, friends, and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This is a lot to take in\", Karen sighed. \"It's quite a shock.\"  As she said that, she realized her main sentiment was not shock, but disappointment. This was not some big dramatic conspiracy: just five girls who wanted to live normal lives, or at least sort of. All very dull and disappointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Still, it was five girls that needed a lot of help, help that she could provide.  And there were secrets involved, even if they were secrets that nobody should need to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"OK, I'm still in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm glad to hear that\", Berry enthused. \"We can sure use all the help we can get.

I didn't promise not to tell anybody but Mom, and really, it's too long ago anyway... But you are still going to have to promise not to pass it on.\"<br>\r\n    When Berry gave the needed promise, Karen spilled.  \"I was just a little kid when my family took a trip to Germany, and one day during it, Dad was driving somewhere with me in the back seat.  At a stop sign, I heard a woman shout that phrase, and I got up and leaned out the window to see who it was.<br>\r\n    \"At the time, all I realized was that the lady must be really cold because she was missing about half her clothes.  She saw me and giggled.  Then she said something I didn't catch, but from her gesture I assume meant something like 'guess not'.  <br>\r\n    \"Dad had hardly driven away before I was asking him what ...that phrase... meant.  I\"ve always been pretty good at repeating what I hear, and I must have repeated it perfectly that time as dad just about had a heart attack.  When he recovered, he ordered me never to say that again.  And he also made me promise not to mention the lady or anything about her to Mom.  Then we stopped for an ice cream soda, which I was also not to mention to Mom. ...Those are promises I kept by the way, just as I will keep those to you.<br>\r\n    \"Now you might have reacted in several ways when you heard it, shock, embarrassment, confusion..., but the only reason you would have reacted as you did was if you had absolutely no idea what I had said.  You were completely busted.\"<br>\r\n    \"Yes, that is clear enough... Oh!  We're here!\" Berry announced as the lid was removed and Karen could see they were no longer on the street, but in what seemed like the largest room in the world.<br>\r\n   \"Berry!  How did we get here?  I didn't feel us move at all.\"<br>\r\n   Berry shrugged.  \"I don't know either, but we don't feel much or anything that goes on outside when we are inside.  It's just one of the things we don't understand and have to take advantage of.  <br>\r\n    \"Now come on.  Let's go meet the others.\" <br>\r\n    It turned out the girls need to be resized, but soon Karen found herself in front of a huge mansion.  Measuring by the colossal size of Ryan, it must actually be only a few feet tall, but she had seen apartment buildings that seemed smaller than this.  Almost intimidated, Karen entered behind Berry.<br>\r\n    \"Girls!  We have a visitor!\" Berry shouted.  For a moment, there was silence.  Then there was a whoop from the top of the stairs and Karen looked up to see a lass sliding down the banister, in a rather out of control manner yet.  Somehow she managed to dismount without disaster, a feat Karen was sure was more due to luck than skill.  \"Karen, this is Amy.\" Berry introduced the two, \"She can be a bit enthusiastic at times.\"<br>\r\n    \"Great to have you come by.\" Amy announced.  \"It can get dull being stuck in this house all day.\" With that, Amy turned back to the stairs \"Hey Scaredy-cat!  Come on down!  It's safe.  She won't bite!\"<br>\r\n    Karen looked up to the top of the stairs to see a younger girl peering cautiously around the corner.  \"That is Emelia.\"  Berry informed Karen, and then turned to Amy, \"I thought you promised not to call her that.\"<br>\r\n   \"Poo!\" Amy responded.  \"She's used to it, or ought to be.  And she does need me to protect her, just like I used to protect my ... !@#$, can't recall it.  Oh well...\" Amy turned back to the stairs \"Come on.  I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n    Somewhat hesitantly, the girl did come down to be introduced to Karen.  She gained confidence as she did, but Karen still judged her meek to an extreme.<br>\r\n    \"If you would excuse my interruption...\"  What was this?  Another one?</span></div></div>",

How had she managed to creep up like that?  Of course Amy was a serious distraction, but still...  <br>\r\n    And what was she doing in a formal gown at this time of day?  She did look good, really good actually, in it, but... well, the splotches on it were proof she should worn something more practical.<br>\r\n    \"I'm afraid we have another problem in the kitchen.\" the newcomer said in an almost musical voice to Berry.  \"If you and Emelia could help us please...\"<br>\r\n    Both Berry and Emelia rush away, with the newcomer following them, somehow managing to silently glide while the feet of the other girls banged on the floor, and somehow keeping up with them.<br>\r\n    \"I bet Christina did it again.\" remarked Amy.<br>\r\n    \"Christina?\" Karen hinted.<br>\r\n    \"She's the oldest of us, and a big know-it-all.\" Amy answers.  \"I got to admit she knows a lot, way more than the rest of us, but not near as much as she thinks she does.  She's been a right disaster in the kitchen.  Doesn't seem to understand a pot can be hot until she has burned herself.  And she has spilled it by then.  We'd keep her out, but she's just as bad everywhere else.  Seems to think the noisy broom will just go around the house if she just orders it to.\"<br>\r\n    \"Noisy broom?\" Karen wonders.  \"Do you mean the vacuum?\"<br>\r\n    Amy ponders for a moment, \"Yeah, I think that is what Berry calls it.  Works pretty good, but I don't know why Dara and Emelia want it used so often.  But Emelia just loves the thing for some reason.  Hardly willing to let go of it.  I can't understand it, but Christina claims she must have been a chambermaid? who had to work hard to keep floors clean back before the curtain.\"<br>\r\n    \"The curtain?\" Karen interrupts.<br>\r\n    \"It's what we usually call the past before Ryan saved us and we woke up in his bedroom.\"<br>\r\n    \"Yes, Berry was mentioning that.  You really have no idea what he saved you from.\"<br>\r\n    \"Hardly a clue.  I do have this feeling it was really dangerous, and I was much happier being alone with this strange boy rather than have to face it.\"<br>\r\n    \"You didn't know Ryan?\"<br>\r\n    \"Not even his name.\" Amy confirms.  \"As far as I knew, he could have been any stranger who rescued me some way... Maybe saved me from a pack of wolves or something. ... Hmm, probably not.  I do have this idea that I'll remember if I ever can say just how he rescued me, tho I can't say where I got the idea from.  But anyway, I am sure he rescued me.\"<br>\r\n    \"You were mentioning someone named Dara? Karen changed the subject.<br>\r\n    \"Sure.  She's the fair folk princess you saw.\"<br>\r\n    Confused, Karen asks, \"Didn't you say you didn't know your pasts?\"<br>\r\n    \"We can guess,\" Amy explains, \"and we really don't have that much to do around here.  Now I've never seen any of the fair folk myself, which is too bad even if some of the stories end badly for the human, but Dara isn't human, not really anyway...\"<br>\r\n    \"Not human?\"<br>\r\n    \"Nope.\" The cheerful Amy continues, \"You can tell by her ears if you get a look at them under all that hair, and her hair is that color naturally.<br>\r\n    \"But you can tell just from her being able to sit on her hair that she's from a really rich family,  And when she first saw me, she assumed I was going to be her servant, and that I wasn't trained for the job, which was right.  So she had plenty of dealing with lots of servants before the curtain.  I'm betting princess.<br>\r\n    \"Real nice girl, despite being a real klutz at the housework.  I don't think she ever did a speck of work in her life before she got here.  She's willing at least, if you explain just how to do something, but she's nearly as disaster-prone as Christina...<br>\r\n    \"You know...

An older and larger girl insisting \"It should have turned itself off when it got hot.\" as she glowered at a large pot was easily identified as the Christina she had been told about.<br>\r\n    \"Hey Chris!  We got a visitor for you to meet.\" Amy almost yelled.<br>\r\n    The older girl looked up and got to her feet.  Handing a rag to Amy, she ordered \"Here, get to work cleaning this up.  I'll show her around our home.\"<br>\r\n     \"No fair!\" Amy objected. \"You made the mess, you clean it up.  I do enough cleaning up as it is.\"  <br>\r\n     Christina was about mad enough to start screaming, and Amy's impertinent attitude was not helping, but fighting in visitors was not done, so she merely snapped \"You cause enough messes.\" before she turned to the new girl.  \"I'm sorry we are a bit busy at the moment.  Since she insists, Amy will show you our home while we straighten up.\"  With that, she returned to cleaning up.<br>\r\n    Amy escorted Karen out, saying \"That's Christina for you.  She's death on any sort of mess.  Wants everything in its place all the time.  Come on.  I'll show you my room first.\"<br>\r\n   Amy's room proved to be rather large, tho most of it was a strange collection of rod and poles stuck into walls, ceiling and floor.  \"What is that?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n    \"I don't really know.\" Amy admits.  \"All I know is that it's great fun to climb around on.  And that may be all it is.  Our rooms are really personalized.  Berry's got walls of books.  Dara's got some fantastic closets just full of noble clothing, and I got something to climb on and think I got the best of the deal.  I bet I really loved to climb trees back before the curtain.\"<br>\r\n    Looking around, Karen saw several pictures of animals.  Any noticed and added \"...And I must have really loved animals too.  I certainly do now.  Ginger, that's the little girl whose room we are in, is going to be getting a pet soon, and I am more excited about it that she is.\"<br>\r\n    \"Hmm... Do you suppose you would like to help out at an animal shelter?\" Karen asked.<br>\r\n    \"Animal shelter?  What's that?\"<br>\r\n    Karen's explanation both thrilled and baffled Amy.  That she might spend all sorts of time with animals, that was just great!  But these people must be insane.  However nice they were, animals are just animals.  You did all you could to keep your playmate alive and happy, but when it was time, you cooked and ate it.  The shelter seemed a complete waste.  Well, it sounded like a great way for her to get out of the house...<br>\r\n    Amy continued the tour of her room, mentioning her reactions to much that was new to her,  \"... may have never slept in a bed before.  I was a little baffled by it, and even looked under it to see if that was where I was supposed to sleep.  I'm still not fully convinced it is the proper place to sleep, but I like it...<br>\r\n    \"...now these faucets?... that's the word?  I am sure I had never seen anything of the sort.  Sure a surprise when I turned one and water started pouring out.  I just squealed with excitement and started turning and twisting everything I could find... That's what Christina was meaning when she talked about me making messes.  Took me a fair bit of time to find out how to turn stuff off too.  A bit too long sometimes.<br>\r\n    \"I suppose she has a point.  Now Dara and Emelia, they keep their hands to themselves for the most part and when they do have some problem, their first instinct is to get Berry, who usually knows what to do.  But Christina and I, our idea is to get right to it and fix whatever it is, which usually works, but when it doesn't... well, the result is often memorable.  And since I want to explore most everything, I've had my share of disasters.<br>\r\n    \"Christina is still the worst tho. She just insists she knows what to do, and so she won't stop making it worse.\"<br>\r\n    The two moved to other parts of the house as Amy continues to chatter... \"Christina has this idea we come from different times and I am from a thousand years ago.  Might be the case.  The fair folk can entertain you for a night, and in the morning a century has passed.  Don't know how she thinks she is from the future.  That seems impossible... Of course, a lot of our lives seem like that.  Anyway, I am the only one who can start a proper fire.  Even Emelia doesn't seem to know how.  She can keep one going and burning at a steady flame better than I can, but she was just hopeless at starting it.<br>\r\n    \"How did we find this out?  Oh, the two of us decided to do some cooking, and I led us into the kitchen.  Quite a surprise to find no fireplace there, but this door on one of the metal boxes produced a black space where cooking just had to take place and of course I just tried to do my best.  We had just about got ready to start the actual cooking when Christina sailed in and started yelling about the smoke and all, which of course set poor Scaredy Cat into crying up a storm and me into yelling back at Chris.  Fortunately the noise eventually attracted Berry, who gave us all a lesson on stoves.  It's still amazing that something can get itself hot like that.  You have got it easy...\"      </span></div></div>",

You see where the walls change color a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amy pointed at a wall, which did indeed seem to be rather two-toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe you can already figure what happened. Now we should have known better even then than let me and Christina do something without being watched, but there is a lot of work to do, even if it's pretty easy, and I think most of it doesn't need doing. So the two of us were left alone with the laundry and some quick instructions that turned out to miss a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now it was mostly Christina's fault. She's the one who has the idea that things come in one-use sizes. And things like those TV Dinners shows she has a point.  Still, she should have figured that a need for soap did not mean we needed a full box of soap.  Of course, I was pretty sure that was too much, and I didn't stop her.  Not that stopping her is easy to do when she thinks she is right, and she usually does. But I still let her have her way when I was pretty sure she was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Anyway, that washing machine just started pouring out bubbles something fierce.  And there the two of us were, not knowing what to do about it.  Christina was sure the <br>\r\nmachine would shut itself off, and I had no idea how to.  Berry insists she told us how, but neither of us recall a word about it.  Of course neither of us even considered just standing there. We got right to work trying to fix things, and in the process just made things worse. We had bubbles everywhere. We hadn't reached the ceiling by the time Berry happened to stumble onto the mess, but she had to wade to the machine almost blind. It was a real mess that took forever to clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And the next lesson on how to use the washing machine was a lot longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Passing through the living room, Karen noticed the large TV was off, something rather unusual in her home. Amy followed her gaze and commented, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yeah the bard in a box is a great favorite with us, but it has its problems. Christina calls it a 'worthless antique'. Of course she says that about nearly everything. But she gets really mad about it not changing channels the instant she wants it to. You would think that a touch of a button was a terrible burden, but that's Christina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now Emelia, Dara, and I would just sit and stare at it for ages, but there is so much we don't understand about the stories, and by the time we can get Berry, or maybe Christina, to explain, something else that needs explaining happens and we never get to really enjoy the show. I suppose we're learning more of the world outside, but as wonderful as it is, we see how it can be so much better, at least for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"There are some animal programs\", Karen commented, \"Don't you watch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"There are?\" Amy was eager to respond. \"When, what channel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't know.  You can check the TV guide.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amy just gave Karen a long, blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You don't have one?  That's weird. Well, Ryan should be able to get you one. It contains a listing of all the programs and when they are on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A book of just the title of stories told by these strange bards,\" Amy commented, \"And I probably never even saw a book before I got here.

He could let them stay in the Magic Dollhouse in Ginger's bedroom. But<br>\r\nthen there would still be a danger of discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Ryan thinks that since Iris is a member to the secret why doesn't she keep them<br>\r\nat her home. Since her mother died 3 years ago and her older triplet sister's were attending<br>\r\ncollege out of state, only her father was living in the house with her. Since he traveled a lot<br>\r\nfor his company she was practically living alone anyway. This way they could learn what<br>\r\nthey would need to know to function in today's world without to much concern about being<br>\r\ncaught. Iris could help Ryan move them into one of Iris's sisters bedrooms with the Magic<br>\r\nDollhouse as their new home for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan asks Iris and after discussing it for around a half hour Iris &amp; the girls agree that it is<br>\r\nprobably a good idea. Before Iris agrees to take in these new borders she asks Ryan for<br>\r\na favor from him &amp; he agrees. Also, Ginger wants to know just how often she will be able<br>\r\nto visit her 'new sisters' at Iris's house. A couple days later, after Iris's father has left home<br>\r\nfor another one of his business trips the 3 of them carry the Dollhouse over to Iris's home<br>\r\nand set the girls up. Since 6 full grown girls would eat a lot of food Ryan decides to keep<br>\r\nthem at the original height they had when he bought them at the shop. After all, they can<br>\r\nstill fully interact with Iris at their small size. Of course whenever he and Ginger visit them<br>\r\nRyan grows the 5 girls to their teen heights of 4 1/2 to nearly 6 foot tall which is exactly<br>\r\n10 times their individual doll heights.

Ryan didn't have to worry about bothering his classmate's parents, because they seemed to be out at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents work during the day, so I don't see them often\", Iris explained to Ryan, Amy, and Berry. \"It's mainly just me until nighttime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor girl\", said a sad Berry. \"You must get lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have my online friends that I chat with, and...well...real friends..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris seemed to trail off a bit from her sentence before finishing it. Come to think of it, Ryan never saw her hanging out with any other girls or boys in school. Iris was sweet, kind, and had a great body for her age, but she was fairly anti-social. She liked to study and be alone, or at least that's what Ryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, thanks for sharing with me your discovery. It made me happy to know that you cared\", a happy Iris said to Ryan as she climbed up his shirt and kissed him on his left face cheek. A kiss that, upon contact, temporarily stopped Ryan in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time they Ryan and Berry were up the stairs and not far from Iris' room. Her room was the furthest down the hall, a red door leading to the room. Upon entering Ryan, Amy, and Berry saw that the room was fairly plain. The walls were painted a pretty shade of blue-purple, and her bed was big and comfortable, with dark blue pillows and blankets on top of it, but aside from that there wasn't much to look at. There was a writing desk, an open window, a beanbag chair, and a television on one of the corners of the room. There was also a small closet where she kept several pairs of shirts, pants, skirts, and bras. Another drawer contained the rest of her clothes, mainly underwear, panties, and socks. On another side of the room stood her shoes, which were on a tiny platform. Next to them was a small bookcase containing various DVDs, manga, books, and comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything looks so cool!\" Iris said in surprise. \"My room looks absolutely gigantic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top of her clothes drawer, though, were a few interesting things. One was a plush teddy bear of Iris' that she had since she was a little girl. Another find involved a picture of Ryan and Iris from middle school. In the picture Iris was kissing Ryan on the right cheek of his face, Ryan himself holding a soccer ball of some sort. Apparently it was signed by the captain of the soccer team that Iris had a crush on back in 7th grade, which Ryan only got signed when he beat the guy in a soccer game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what a cute picture!\" Berry gushed, smiling at both Ryan and Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a really nice thing you did for me that day, Ryan\", Iris happily sighed. \"You were so great out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing\", Ryan replied, holding back the happiness he felt from the compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you and Ryan meet, Iris?\" Berry asked the tiny brunette, Amy nodding alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In 4th grade. Back then I was, believe it or not, tiny in both the chest and height area. All the boys made fun of me..except Ryan. We became fast friends, almost inseparable to the point that our teachers asked us if we were twins. Then we entered middle school together, during which I developed an incredibly growth spurt. Soon I went from the tiniest girl in the class to one of the tallest, with the biggest breasts to boot. I found it embarrassing, but even worse was that Ryan and I were no loner best of friends. He hung out with me less and less, and he never told me why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris paused for a bit as she started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when Ryan finally revealed to me you guys, I was really, really happy. Ryan, why did you stop being friendly to me? Why?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris..I can tell you why\", Ryan said to her as she placed her (and himself) on her bed. \"I was scared. You became such a beautiful woman that I found it awkward to talk to you. Then my hormones came in and I couldn't stop thinking about you, especially your..well...big breasts. I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of you, so I stopped being so close..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, that's stupid!\" Iris yelled at the boy, punching one of his legs. \"If you felt that way, just tell me! But to tell you the truth I was scared meeting you again as well in middle school. I, too, had a crush on you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I, too, was awkward around you. You were such a skinny shrimp in elementary school, it was weird to see you so grown up in middle school. You were tall, skinny, athletic, and handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, hearing you call me a 'beautiful woman' made me happy, Ryan. But don't be scared of my big breasts; they're not going to hurt you or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris then sat down on Ryan's lap and hugged him, her chest rubbing against his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, make me bigger! I want you to hug and kiss me, like we used to when we were little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Do it, Ryan!\" Amy encouraged the boy.</span></div></div>",

The first thing he decided on was Amy's hair, which was already fairly long, but Ryan thought it could even be longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's hair, grow to 9 feet\", he said into the black box as he watched in surprise as Amy's hair grew to nearly 3 times its original length, shocking even Amy in the process. However, she wasn't scared in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, I'm like Rapunzel\", Amy giggled as she picked up her hair on the ground and proceeded to sit on Ryan's bed, her hair sitting right beside her. Next up for Ryan was another personal favorite part of the female body to him: the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's chest, grow to 120 cm\", he smiled as he said it into the box, watching as Amy's original 80cm breasts began enlarging in size in her shirt. Amy moaned in frustration as her chest swelled to 90cm and then to 100cm, her shirt barely able to maintain the pressure of her growing chest. Unfortunately, much to Ryan's disappointment, her shirt grew with her before he could see any naked female flesh as Amy's chest stopped growing at 120 cm, her breasts now bigger than her head. However, since Amy did not wear a bra, Ryan was still able to see the beautiful chest of hers in all its round, bouncy glory as he watched Amy jumped a little on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's legs, grow to 10 feet\", he then said into the box, watching Amy's legs grow in size until they became longer and more beautiful than that of any model's. Like her shirt, Amy's pants were keeping up with the growth, again to Ryan's chagrin. The once 5 foot 3 girl was now beginning to worry a little as her legs pushed up on the side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's feet, grow to 3 feet\", Ryan then added, watching Amy's already cramped feet get bigger against the wall. At this point her legs could easily break down the door: that is, if Amy could move around the room. But her body was so uneven in size she couldn't move off of Ryan's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's head and butt, both grow to 4 feet\", he then said into the black box, giving Amy at last some sort of balance between her body. All that was left now was her head and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's head and stomach, grow to match the rest of her towering body\", Ryan then said into the black box as he watched Amy's transformation in size complete before his eyes. At then end she was now over 3 times her original height of 5 feet and 3 inches, and was having a hard time sitting on Ryan's bed, causing it to collapse under her own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, R-R-Ryan\", Amy sighed as she bowed her head in apology. He should be angry by all means right now: Ryan hated people touching or breaking his things. But Amy was so cute a giantess in his eyes that he couldn't stay mad at her. But he felt that Amy shouldn't stay that size and should shrink down to a smaller height. But what height was best in his eyes?</span></div></div>",

Berry... a foot?\" he said sheepishly, picking out any old height he thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next nearly caused the young man's eyes to pop right out of his head. Right before his eyes, the figurine steadily grew until she was roughly twice the height she was before. As if that wasn't a huge enough shock to his system, the doll suddenly came alive. Standing up and turning towards him, Berry shot him a very wide smile and said \"Hi! My name's Berry. Who're you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Jordan could do was stare dumbly at what just happened. \"What's wrong?\" Berry asked after an awkward silence, clearly having no idea that this was not something that happened every day. Finally, Jordan spoke. \"Who am I? Heh... I'm absolutely nuts, that's what I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's the strangest name for someone I've ever heard.\" Berry replied, completely missing the sarcasm. Thrown into further disbelief about the past few minutes, Jordan could think of nothing else to say except more wisecracks. \"Let's see here. I don't drink, so I'm not drunk. I don't smoke or do drugs, so I'm not high. And I totally bombed a test earlier today, so I'm not dreaming. I guess that just leaves... yep, insanity. I'm definitely insane. Whoppee!\" he cried sarcastically, waving his arms in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fairly confused by his display, Berry spoke \"Um, you're not crazy. I mean, I guess this is a surprise to you, but I've always been like this, so I guess I just didn't know what you were expecting. Sorry!\" \"So, in other words, you find it normal to move between lying lifeless and then suddenly coming to life when some random, arbitrary thing happens?\" Ryan asked. \"Yep! I guess so!\" Berry chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was official. This was really happening. Ryan still didn't have a good idea of what exactly was going on right now, but he figured he should just go along with it and be polite. \"Hi. I'm Ryan. Ryan Jordan.\" he replied, holding out his hand. Berry took one of his fingers and shook. \"Pleased to meet you!\" she responded.

Well, other than the obvious stuff about it, of course. Why, what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I spoke into it... that is, when I said you're name and a size... you suddenly woke up and grew to almost twice your size. You were only about 6 inches, a little taller than that, before I woke up. The manual said I could use this to change your size. I'm not quite sure if it really works, so... if you don't mind?\" \"Oh no!\" she replied. \"Go ahead, I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\" he thought. If someone could change his size at will, he'd be pretty freaked. Still, if she was up for it, he figured that he might as well try this thing out. \"Let's see.\" he said, bringing the box up to his mouth. \"Berry. 5 feet 7 inches.\" he intoned, entering in his own height into the machine. Sure enough, Berry suddenly began to swell in size until she was dead even with Jordan's height. \"Oh my\" she cried, surprised by the sudden change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get used to her new height, however, Ryan intoned once again. \"Berry. 1 inch.\" Just as suddenly, Berry dwindled down to the size of one of the many used up pencils Ryan kept in his backpack. \"Oh dear! This is kinda scary!\" she cried in a much smaller voice than she had used before. Not wanting to upset the innocent doll, Ryan spoke again. \"Berry. 6 1/3 inches.\" he spoke, taking the size from Berry's given height on the box. Once more, Berry grew back to her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! That was kinda scary. Well, now we know more about it, right Ryan? Ryan?\" she asked. But the boy wasn't paying attention. \"It works.\" he thought. \"It actually works.\" He couldn't believe it. Here, lying in his lap, was the key to fulfilling his wildest dreams and fantasies. What were once just exciting dreams could become the boy's reality! On the other hand, Berry didn't seem very happy with it. Maybe he should give her a break.  </span></div></div>",

Her owner's bed looked as big as a field, his pillows the size of giant hills, and even the box she came in looked like an apartment complex to her. Even her gasps felt squeaky and high-pitched, like she had just been placed in a room with helium. As the nervous girl looked at the colossus-like Ryan reaching out to her with his right hand, she was too scared to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is soooo cool\", Ryan squealed in delight as he once again placed the black box near his face and proceeded to talk into it once again, the tiny Berry being lightly pressed between his thumb and pinky finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berry, one-fiftieth an inch\", he said as he watched the girl become near microscopic, placing her gently in his right ear. By this point Berry was barely able to contain her fear, tears of worry running down her face. But perhaps now that she was close to his ear, she could tell him how uncomfortable this made her. So she yelled straight into Ryan's eardrum:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan heard the girl loud and clear, giving a frantic \"AAH!\" in surprise from the scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berry, is that you? Can you hear me?\" he asked inquisitively the tiny girl in his ear. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Ryan, but I really wish I were my normal height right about now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, then. If you help me with my homework, I'll restore you to your normal size. Or even better, I'll enlarge you to the size of a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! That would be great,\" an enthusiastic Berry said in reply. \"What subject do you help in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Math,\" Ryan sighed inexpressively. \"It's my worse subject. And if I don't get a C on the next test, I'll have to take it again in summer school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Well, don't you worry. I know exactly what to do\", Berry comforted the boy as he slowly took the very tiny Berry and placed her back on his right hand. With his free left hand he then said aloud: \"Berry, five foot five.\" Ryan watched in shock as the weight on his hand grew increasingly heavier, eventually plotting the growing Berry straight down on his bed butt first. The girl sighed in relief at being taller again and stood next to Ryan, who had already opened up his math book and got out some looseleaf paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berry, if you're not comfortable standing, I can shrink you and place you on my desk\", suggested Ryan to Berry, who retaliated with a shaking of her head left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.

Algebra, of course, is never an easy subject to learn, even for someone gifted with numbers, which Ryan certainly was not. Granted, it wasn't as though he was stupid: he was a fairly bright boy who maintained at least a B average in most of his classes. However, he was simply never any good with numbers, and having to do math problems always gave him confidence problems, something that further hindered his grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, confidence wasn't a problem with Berry around. Although she barely knew any more about mathematics than he did, her optimistic presence was a real comfort. Even when a particularly aggravating problem was encountered, she still had the utmost certainty that it could be solved. What's more, having an extra brain to help him think helped Ryan to notice and solve little mistakes. Eventually, after much hard work, Ryan closed the book and put away his homework. For once, he was confident that he had done a good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Berry\", he said, reclining on his bed. \"You were a real help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" the life sized figurine replied. Checking his watch, Ryan realized that it would soon be dinner time. It was pasta night, and he was eager to dig into his mom's great cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Berry, listen. I have to go down for dinner. Nobody in my family knows about you or the other figurines yet, so, even though you don't like shrinking, I need you to go back to doll size, go back into the box, and pretend you're a doll so no one suspects anything, OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Berry relented. After reducing her to 6 inches and returning her to the box, Ryan then asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You want me to sneak up something for you? My mom's a great cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. I actually don't really need food or sleep to survive, really. Isn't that strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ryan responded with a slight laugh. With that, he went down to the dining room, closing the door behind him.</span></div></div>",

I mean, she's real sweet nonetheless.\" Meanwhile, Berry was having thoughts of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's kinda cute, isn't he?

With both himself and Berry dumbfounded by the figurine's sudden awakening, he turned off the stereo and approached the newly awakened girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I... Hey, why did you stop it?\" the girl complained. \"That was awesome! What was that song? Who were those guys? Oh yeah who are you, by the way? Oh, hey Berry!

She had to do something, anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from out of her place (silently, so as not to alert Amy while she was reclining and humming the melody she had heard from earlier in the day), Berry got down from the box and stood on Ryan's bedside table.

Oh, sorry, I guess I'll watch my tongue next time!\" she added sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Christina was knocked off her feet by a forceful impact poking straight into her stomach. When she recovered from the shock, she found out that the force came from the tip of Ryan's finger, which was currently pinning down her entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really thick, aren't you?\" Ryan said, his voice deeper and more intimidating than before. \"You don't get it. I could shrink you into nothing with this thing. Right now I'm more than 100 times your height. You're in no position to mouth off, so you had better be nicer to me from now on...

I'M SORRY! Just please let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of flesh was suddenly lifted off of her. Looking up, she saw Ryan's leviathan face sneering at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We're on the same page. Now to show that you're REALLY sorry, I want you to bow down and worship me like the god I am! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated by his voice, Christina immediately got down on her knees and began to repeatedly bow to Ryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hail! Hail my god! I'm nothing compared to you!

Please have mercy on me!\" she cried out, putting aside her dignity in a desperate attempt to appease the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her cries filled Ryan with a strange new sensation. Standing before him, less than an inch tall, was someone who was completely at his mercy. He had the power to control her size in the palm of his hand, and she could do nothing to stop him. He liked it. He liked the new feeling of power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to completely dominate someone... it felt good, but it was also a little scary at the same time. Could he be turning into a monster? He didn't want that to happen... or did he? Being a monster might be kind of fun. </span></div></div>",

When I was 17, I fell in love with a much older man named Christopher. We were extremely happy together and got married in only a few months. Of course, my parents weren't thrilled by this, and I was forced out of my home and had to go live with my new husband at his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, though, I came back from the store and found him dead. He was lying in a pool of blood, and even the police couldn't identify what or how he died. A couple of months afterwards I had to move out of the apartment because I didn't make enough money at my part-time job as a waitress to support myself, so I went back home to my parents. They refused to let me come home, saying that it was my decision to leave the house and move out to live with a man almost twice my age. I was so upset by them telling me this I could barely control my body. I felt like dying right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that very night I tried just doing that. I went up to the highest building in this town and tried to jump off, but found myself saved at the very last minute by this strange old man. He kind of looked like the guy from that shop you bought me from, Ryan. After that my memory is foggy, but I believe I was experimented on and shrunk down to the size of a doll. I tried to escape, but then he did something to me...something that froze me in place and paralyzed my body. Before that he told me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Won't my customers be happy to see a nice girl like you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that, though, I also saw four other girls in that lab, who were also previously shrunk and placed in cages like lab rats. They told me that they, as well as myself, were to be part of a line of dolls, ones that would bring joy and happiness to those who bought us. One girl overheard that we'd be use as sex toys, another as small-sized strippers for horny men. However, it seemed out fate changed along the way, and you bought us all from that shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I still have bad memories of that place. Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina found herself tugging on Ryan's shirt, covering her crying face in his left sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, it's okay now\", Ryan comforted the girl, rubbing his right hand on her head. \"I'll protect you and those other girls from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know why he did this to me and those other girls! Was it because he knew I was going to die and he wanted to experiment on me before I could kill myself?! Is there more to me than I think? I really want to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina, her face blood red from crying, then stood up once more and looked at Ryan, a sad frown still cemented on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan...please help me. Help Amy, Berry, Dara, Emelia, and myself from this horrible fate. I want to be a normal girl again! I don't want to be a doll or a figurine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then stood up as well and proceeded up to Christina's face, startling the woman as he placed his lips on her own. She was nothing short of shocked by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" she fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that my acknowledgement of your request. I promise that I'll save you and the other girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", Christina replied, not nearly as upset anymore.</span></div></div>",

Her tone of voice made it clear that she was very upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shop, the old storekeeper turned around to face the door when he heard the telltale bells that signaled a customer arriving. He was happy at first to see that Ryan had returned (He had a few more things he was eager to sell the boy), but immediately became horrified when he saw that the young man was followed closely by one of the figurines from the shop window. She was several times the size she was when he had stuffed her in the box, and now she looked VERY angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello there, my boy, how are yo... OOOH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina strode up to the storekeeper and quickly blasted him with a vicious right hand. The impact knocked him backward into some store shelves behind him, causing several items to be knocked out of place.

We ought to take it and easy and just talk to him first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, Ryan, do you think we can reason with this piece of filth, huh? Do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina opened her mouth to protest further, then closed it, grunted, folded her arms and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then turned to the shopkeeper. \"Look, sir, Christina told me about everything you did to her and the other four figurines you sold me. I would appreciate it if you came clean about the 'dolls' you sold me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man struggled to get off the floor. Leaning against the counter to support himself, he stared at Ryan with a strange look in his eye.</span></div></div>",

One was to get a decent profit out of it, as no normal 15 year-oldd would stoop to such a level as to buy figurines of girls instead of look up real girls on the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd two...since I now have the money, I'll be taking these dolls back now and re-sell them again for more money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make much sense. I thought you made a decent amount of money?\" a dumbfounded Ryan wondered outloud. \"Your shop's been here ever since I was very little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes it has been profitable. But do you see all these other dolls and figures around you?\" Mr. Johnson asked the two as they glanced around the room, noticing just how many dolls there were. Some looked like they were from thee Victorian era, others from various European and Asian countries, and some were of dolls from the 1960s. But one thing many of them had in common was that they all looked like human girls. Very few of the dolls in the shop were of animals, and while figures only took up a small portion of the shop, many were sold at high prices due to their craftsmanship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, boy? I've been doing this kind of business for over 30 years!\" Mr. Johnson cackled. \"And every time someone comes in, gets a doll, and comes back to me, I just take the doll, wipe that person's memory clear, and I get to keep the dolls and the money! It's perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except I won't allow you to do it!\" Christina protested, grabbing hold of Ryan with her arms. \"If you want me, you'll have to take me out of Ryan's hands first! He saved me from a life in a box, and I'm not about to go back in so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you will\", Mr. Johnson grinned as he placed the black box on his lips. \"Christina, get rid of that boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! The box can do that kind of thing, too!?\" Ryan asked as he saw Chrstina twitching and fidgeting, as if she was being possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what's h-h-happening!?\" she asked herself as she saw herself grabbing hold of Ryan and preparing to inflict what looked like quite a bit of pain on him, her left first raised in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, what are you doing!? Don't do this!!\" Ryan pleaded to the woman, who was holding back tears as her fist elevated slightly higher still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Beat him up to a pulp! And once you're done, I'll wipe his memory clean, and you and the other girls can go safely back on the shelves until the next horny guy buys off of me. HAHAHA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, please don't do it!\" Ryan pleased one final time as Christina already began to beat Ryan up, punching and kicking him without any stop. \"I don't want to die!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the end Ryan chose Dara, as he liked the cute red dress she wore. He placed aside the other four girls on his computer desk and opened the girl up, gently placing her on the far left side of the desk, whereas the other girls were on the far right. However, Ryan noticed odd about the figurine: it was as if her hair was undone or messy. Ryan was confused by this: Most figurines' hair wasn't realy hair so much as plastic molded to look like hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing about the figure Ryan noticed was that this Dara was in a different position from that of the box, which featured the girl holding her hands next to her heart and her eyes closed, as if she was praying to someone. This Dara, however, had her arms down and on her shoulders, kind of like a penguin. Ryan proceeded to pick up the figurine and look at it from all sides, until he heard a slight scream, like that of a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..!?\" Ryan asked himself, looking at Dara's face. He then noticed that the girl was moving her mouth! Freaked out, Ryan accidentally dropped the girl, who then fell on his bed a foot or so below. Although Dara wasn't hurt, she did rub her butt from the impact she felt upon landing. Soon afer she looked up straight up at the 15 year old boy who bought her, which then proceeded to freak her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" the girl gasped, hiding under one of Ryan's pillows in fear. Ryan tried to talk to her, but he too was scared of the current predictament and couldn't bring himself to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she r-r-real?\" the boy wondered to himself, panicking more than just a little. He then remembered the black box from earlier, proceeding to pick it up and place it next to his mouth. After taking a few deep breaths, Ryan proceeded to speak into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, grow to 5 feet, 5 inches\", he said outloud, and before he knew it the once six inch tall figure was now a normal-sized teenage girl. Ryan watched as Dara's increasingly enlarging legs popped out of the pillow, followed soon by her arms, part of her head, and lastly her whole body peeping out. Although the girl's clothes grew with her, Dara was no less freaked out than before. In fact, she was more freaked out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what's going on?\" she asked Ryan, the first words she spoke to him. \"Who are you, and why am I here? And how did I get so tall just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Ryan Jordan\", he said to the girl in a calm, gentle voice, proceeding to sit next to her on his bed. \"And you're a figurine I just bought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figurine?\" the girl asked, confused. \"But I'm not a figurine..am I?\" The confused look on the girl's face caused Ryan to blush. She already looked pretty cute to him in her red dress that looked that of a princess, but her childish, confused look made it all the cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I am...the truth is, I don't remember who I am...\" Dara then looked at Ryan and inched ever closer to him, embracing his hands with hers. \"But since you bought me, Mr. Jordan, I am in your debt until you say otherwise.\" Dara then jumped off of Ryan's bed and bowed her head in his direction. \"It's very nice to meet you\", she told him, smiling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ryan was still blushing red at what Dara said, but at the same time he knew his mother would never allow such a thing in his house. But he really wanted her company, so he laid down a rule for her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Dara, but if you want to stay, you'll have to resume your size as a figurine\", he sadly sighed to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\", Dara replied, bowing her head to the boy. Ryan was quite surprised by her reaction: he expected her to pout or put up some kind of fight. \"Shrink away.\" Ryan then picked up the black box and spoke into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, shrink down to 3 inches\", he smiled to himself, watching the girl shrink in size to an even smaller size than she was before in the box. Ryan then placed the box she came in next to the girl, which to her was as large as a 10 foot tall wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you make me so small, Mr. Jordan?\" the girl politely asked, trying her best to hide back her worried state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think small things are cute\", Ryan smiled impishly, holding up the black box once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, shrink down to 1 inch\", he then said, and the already tall girl shrunk to on-third of her already tiny height. Now the box looked as big as a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, shrink down to one-tenth an inch\", Ryan continued, and Dara watched in fear as the box grew ever larger, now looking like the size of a hotel. He then got out a magnifying glass to see the tiny girl standing next to the box, looking very sad next to it. Poor Dara looked like she was about to burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait, please don't cry\", Ryan told the girl, but he was too late. The girl started crying very tiny tears, barely above an octave only dogs can hear. Ryan felt bad about what he just did, hormones or not, and decided to speak on the box one final time for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, return to normal\", he said into the black box, and the boy watched as the very tiny Dara returned to her \"normal\" height of 6 inches. She smiled in relief that she was no longer shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I did that\", Ryan said to the girl, reaching out his left hand in apology. \"Can you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I will\", she smiled in reply, bowing her head to Ryan. \"I know you wouldn't do anything to harm me, Mr. Jordan. I can tell from looking at you.\" Dara then noticed the other four boxes on the other side of the boy's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those other figurines?\" the inqusitive girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", he replied to the girl. \"I was thinking about opening another one, but I don't know..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do. I wish to see my other 'sisters'. We were in that shop for a long time, having to pretend we were figurines..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we just talked about this. The truth is I don't know WHO I am, but maybe one of the other figures might know?\"</span></div></div>",

Some are also comic books\", he explained to the little helper of his, patting her softly on the head. \"Thank you so much for helping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Lord Ryan!\" she chirped in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me 'Ryan', Dara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I couldn't! You saved my life! I owe you a great deal of debt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'd be willing to do anything for me, Dara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan thought about that. Being 15 and going through puberty, he had an acute fixation on girls right now (and Dara <i>was</i> a girl). So he took great thought into Dara's proclaiming that she would whatever he wanted.</span></div></div>",

My family and I lived in peace until an evil man came one day and cursed me. He shrunk me down to 6 inches tall and warned my parents that if we didn't give him 40,000 piece of gold, I would not only be stuck like this, but turned into a doll slowly over a time period of a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible, Dara! What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....I don't know! My parents paid him the money, but he didn't fix the curse! And the second they gave hm the money, my parents...they were killed! He froze them just like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDara started crying as she placed her head on Ryan's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, if they were frozen like you, they might still be alive in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so at first too, Lord Ryan, but I haven't seen them in 500 years of searching! I don't think I'll EVER find them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan lifted up Dara's red, crying face and looked at her eyes. He then placed his forehead on hers and said to her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dara, I will find your parents. I swear by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will!?\" Dara asked, her tears slowly stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lord Ryan!\" Dara said in-between sniffs, hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the other figurines would know some information too, Dara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!

He slowly opened up the top of the box when he saw her literally jump out of it and onto the bed below! Ryan was, needless to say, confused by the that something that he supposedly thought was inanimate moving before his very eyes. Emelia even turned direction (she jumped opposite facing Ryan) and turned around, smiling and waving at him with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\", the girl spoke in a high-pitched voice, bowing to the boy. \"My name's Emelia. Thank you for getting me out of that store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you're w-w-welcome\", Ryan nervously replied as Emelia inched ever closer to him. She wasn't the slightest afraid of him beside her noticeable size difference: in fact, she seemed extremely happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in that store for soooo long, I didn't know if I'd ever leave\", Emelia said to Ryan as she stretched her arms away from her head. \"But thanks to you, I have. To who do I owe this favor to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Ryan Jordan..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ryan! From now on I'll be in your care\", Emelia continued to smile as he placed her tiny hands on top of his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-E-Emelia, are you comfortable at your current height? I can make you bigger, if you want\" the blushing Ryan asked the girl as he picked up the black box from the plastic bag and put it to his lips. Emelia nodded in reply as Ryan tried to spurt out directions like the ones on the box said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emelia, g-g-grow t-t-to fi-fiftenn feet\", he shyly said into the box, and Emelia watched as she grew in short spurts of about 4 or 5 inches a second as she grew on his bed to 15 feet tall, noticing how much smaller the room was getting with every spurt she grew. She was fine with it at 5 feet, but once she grew to the 6 foot mark the girl began to worry, finally bumping her head on the ceiling at around 9 feet. Emelia proceeded to sit on the ground with her legs stretched at that point as she grew all the way to 15 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wow\", the scared Emelia said as looked at Ryan, who looked the size of toddler to her. \"Everything is so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emelia, do you want me to reverse this?\" the flustered Ryan told the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", the girl meekly replied. As cute as Ryan found her at her new height, he obeyed her wish and shrunk Emelia down to a more modest level of 5 feet, 2 inches. When the shrinking finally stopped, Emelia got on her legs and ran up to Ryan and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", she smiled as she wrapped in a tight embrace. \"But as happy as I am being with you right now, Ryan, could you let my friends out as well?\" Ryan smiled in reply and blushed a little in reply to her question. Emelia was already pretty cute at her new height..what would the other 4 girls look like? Too excited to think properly, Ryan quickly opened up the other boxes and placed the girls out on his bed. The four girls felt a little woozy at first from being left out, but their biggest surprise was of their newly grown friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emelia! How did you get so big!?\" Amy asked, looking in shock of her friend's newfound height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan did it\", she smiled. \"This boy here made me grow. He's the greatest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Berry smiled as she scared at Ryan. \"Could you make me grow too, Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to become bigger as well\", Christina added, putting her hands together and looking at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that as well\", Dara added as she bowed in Ryan's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ryan was still both confused and happy at the same time. He knew they were figurines and not real, but at the same time he truly wondered if they were real or not. He had so many questions to ask them, but before that he had to think of whether growing the others girls in his cramped bedroom was a good idea. And what if his mother came upstairs to check in on him and saw him with five girls? Or if they saw him talking to plastic models? What could happen to him?</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Amy looked at the box she came in and looked puzzled by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suppose we should tell him we're not actual figurines, but honest-to-goodness girls?\" Amy asked in a state of concentration to Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he figured it out when we started talking to him\", replied Christina. \"He saved us, after all: a night on the town is the LEAST we can do to repay him for his kindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever he asks\", Dara smiled as she waited on top of Ryan's bed for him to return.

Since Emelia was the first to talk to the boy, he decided to grow her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emelia, 5 feet and 11 inches\", he said into the black box. The girl was startled as she saw herself overtowering her friends' height in a manner of seconds, and in a manner of 30 or so seconds over Ryan himself. The 14 year old girl even compared herself to Ryan by standing back to back with him. Emelia looked a little worried by her new height, but Ryan then topped his hands over the taller girl's and simply told her: \"You look nice tall\". With that bit of comforting information, Emelia felt much better about her new height and hugged the boy back, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Amy, since she was the first figure Ryan wanted to get from the start. \"Amy, 6 feet and 2 inches\", he said into the black box. Similar to Emelia, Amy was frigthened by her new, taller height over Ryan. Unlike Emelia, though, Amy found it cute that she was taller than the boy who rescued her, and proceeded to hug him in an embrace as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird was Dara, since Ryan found her princess-like outfit to be very pretty. As pretty as she looked as a figure, though, he wondered how she would if she were as tall as a supermodel. \"Dara, 6 feet and 4 inches\", Ryan said into the black box as he watched Dara grow in quick spurts of growth before his eyes. Her long, flowing hair only continued to grow in both glow and length, and her dress shimmered in the moonlight as she continued to grow. Dara felt awkward being taller than her friends, but soon found herself used to it. Instead of hugging like Amy and Emelia did, Dara simply bowed to Ryan, then proceeding to kiss his left hand. The boy flushed red from her gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-B-Berry, 6 feet and 3 inches\", he then said into the box, still a little delighted by the kiss on the hand he recieved a few seconds ago. Like Dara, Berry's dress flowed and shimmered in the night wind as she grew in size, and even her glasses were keeping up with her growth. When she was Ryan's exact height she freaked out a bit: when she passed the six foot mark, she was scared. When Berry finally did reach her final height, she was relieved and proceeded to step back for one final growth: Christina's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saving the best for last, are we?\" she giggled as she stared at Ryan, curious as to what height he would make her grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, 6 feet and 6 inches\", he said into the box, the girl looking delighted as she found herself increasing in height. She loved the feeling of growth encircling her entire body, from her long, beautiful hair, right down to her long, already model-like legs. By the time she was done Christina towered over Ryan by well over a head, giggling at the sight of the boy, who looked like a grade schooler to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think just a minute ago you looked like a giant to all of us\", Christina laughed a little at the sight of Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, why did you make everyone so big?\" Emelia asked, her new height seeming very cute to Ryan. It augmented the cuteness of the girl several fold from when she was the size of a figurine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you five were kept away for so long, I figured the least I could do is let you feel what it's like to be taller than a human\", he explained point blank to the girls. Amy, Christina, and Emelia smiled and nodded in agreement over what Ryan just said, while Berry and Dara had a hard time adjusting to their new sizes and weren't so happy by their new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I wouldn't mind being a little bigger\", giggled Emelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither would I\", Amy added in, bringing her face close to Ryan as if she was about to kiss him, causing him to blush all the further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to be as tall as, say, a mini-giantess\", added Christina, not wavering to either a happy or worried side whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm with you, I don't care what you do, Ryan\", chimed Dara, feelling a little better about her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please leave me out of this\", Berry requested to Ryan as she stepped back several feet from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was pleased by what he was hearing. The sight of five beautiful, tall girls already was exciting him in more ways than one already: imagine if they were even taller? Ryan decided that no matter what he did, he would not grow Berry like she requested, but now wondered what to do with the four girls. He decided to sit on a nearby rock and think about it for a few moments. When he was done, he then decided to</span></div></div>",

But Emelia could tell rather quickly that she was surging with further growth, surpassing even the tall Christina in a manner of seconds.

By this point he had thrown away all traces of common sense and let his hormones do all the talking. The first to react to her new size was Emelia, who proceeded to lift up Ryan in her arms, place his face on her chest, and then proceeded to kiss Ryan on the lips. As she did so, he tried his hardest not to have her now giant tongue clash with his lips, which he managed to do...but only barely. But it was still the best kiss he had ever had. Her kiss was soon followed by Amy, Dara, and even Berry (who was reluctant about growing in the first place) kissing the boy on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so exciting\", squealed Emelia as she hugged Ryan in her big arms, who was then grabbed by Dara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a new woman today\", teased Amy as she winked at the boy, whose attention was then gathered by Berry, who simply hugged the boy with no comment. Then Christina grabbed hold of the boy and lifted him up above her head, like a parent playing airplane with their child. After Ryan was put down, he was then tugged on his shirt by Dara, who bowed before the boy and hugged him in a tight embrace before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what, Ryan?\" all five girls asked in unison with bright smiles on their faces. \"We'll do whatever you want to do.\"</span></div></div>",

Please give readers two individual options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, enjoy! Note that if a story is too short or is written awkwardly (i.e. one big paragraph versus 2 or 3 smaller ones), I will change anything if need be, so don't worry too much about spelling. If you don't approve, mail me and we'll talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate: (3/11/2009) 100 chapters at last! Once again I have David Argall, as well as everyone else for their contributions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow is some information on the characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ryan Jordan<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nHeight: 5 feet, 7 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Dirty brown, short<br>\r\nEye color: Green<br>\r\nInfo: A fairly skinny boy going through puberty, Ryan is usually a nice guy and fairly smart and athletic, but gets shy around girls his own age. He's also been getting into things he didn't have interest in before, such as collecting stamps and figurines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Amy<br>\r\nAge: 15 (according to the box)<br>\r\nHeight: 6 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Orange, twin braids that go down to her butt<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nDefault costume: blue t-shirt and a medium-length, light blue skirt<br>\r\nInfo: Sold as a \"girl-next-door\" figurine, Amy's strongest suits are, according to the packaging she comes in, a cheerful disposition and an affinity for animals. The slightly tomboyish girl warms up to Ryan quickly, but feels awkward by the height difference between them. Perhaps he can fix that problem for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Berry<br>\r\nAge: 16 (according to the box)<br>\r\nHeight: 6 1/3 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Brown, medium-length<br>\r\nEye color: Green<br>\r\nDefault costume: A light pink dress that goes down to her knees<br>\r\nInfo: Sold as a \"romantic\" figurine, Berry enjoys romantic stories and longs for a boyfriend herself. She's the nicest of the five girls, and also the shyest. She wears glasses, but they're not needed for her to see: she just likes wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Christina<br>\r\nAge: 19 (according to the box)<br>\r\nHeight: 7 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Black, long (down to her butt)<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nDefault costume: Long-sleeved red shirt, jeans<br>\r\nInfo: The \"big sister\" of the five, Christina is sold as an \"older sister\" figurine, and is the tallest and smartest of the five. However, she is prone to getting annoyed by the littlest of things: even a wrapper simply tossed aside on the ground causes her to get annoyed easily and snap, even at Ryan. She treats Ryan likes a little brother and has little to no romantic feelings for him whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Dara<br>\r\nAge: 17 (according to the box) <br>\r\nHeight: 6 1/2 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Light blue, long (down to her knees)<br>\r\nEye color: Hazel<br>\r\nDefault costume: see below<br>\r\nInfo: Sold as a \"princess\" figure, Dara dresses accordingly in a long, red, beautiful dress. She also wears high heels on her feet and gloves on her hands. Dara is very formal and is extremely polite around others, but has little self-confidence in herself. Ryan helps her deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Emelia<br>\r\nAge: 14 (according to the box)<br>\r\nHeight: 5 1/2 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Blonde, short<br>\r\nEye color: Brown<br>\r\nDefault costume: white t-shirt with a smiley face on it and jean shorts<br>\r\nInfo: Sold as a \"cheerful girl\" figurine, Emelia is the smallest of the five figurines and the most naive and innocent. She is very kind and doesn't like to see others sad or unhappy. She treats Ryan like a big brother and a protector, as Emelia is easily frightened by dogs, cats, and rats. She's also prone to clumsiness and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Iris<br>\r\nHeight: 5 feet, 4 inches<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nHair color / length: Brunette, short<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nInfo: A friend of Ryan's from junior high school, Iris is a cheerful and friendly individual. She also possesses the biggest chest among her entire class, which causes Ryan to stutter whenever he's around her. She's one of the very few people other than Ryan who knows about Amy and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ginger<br>\r\nAge: 8<br>\r\nHeight: 4 feet, 3 inches<br>\r\nHair color / length: Brown, long<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nInfo: Ryan's baby sister in most chapters of the story, Ginger likes dolls and warms up to Amy and the other figurines quickly. She owns a strange doll house that changes upon the person entering it. She's sweet, peppy, and cute. She has a little brother named Hal, who is 5.</td>",
