            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young man of 18 looked out of his open garage at the streets outside. His hair was brown, and slightly spiky. He wore a red jacket with no sleeves, and under it was a yellow shirt with a large black X on the front, and a pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellite sure has changed a lot in the past few months.\" he commented. Ever since Daedalus Bridge had been completed, things in this once junk pile of a city had really improved. Of course, improved doesn't mean that everything was perfect. He still was in one of the areas that were in development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis young man's name was Ken Yamato. He was a young man with a dream, and his dream was to one day become a great duelist. One of the greatest duelists ever. The name Ken \"the Blade\"(his self proclaimed nickname) would be said with admiration, respect, and all those things the best of the best were talked about with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then returned to his work. In the garage was several Duel Runners, though none of them were in any real working order. He was mostly stripping down most of them working parts to complete the one in the center. He wasn't anything special when it came to being a mechanic, but he at least knew enough to know what he was doing. Though he had been working tirelessly for a few months now, and he still wasn't complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping sweat from his brow, he wondered how much longer this would take. He always was a pretty impatient one. Decing to take a bit of a break, he walked back into his home he shareed with his grandfather to get a drink. As he was on his way back to the garage, he thought he heard a noise, and when he walked back out there, he saw two men about to lift up the Duel Runner he was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?\" he demanded, starting to chase them off. However, they didn't run. The larger of the two tried to punch him, but Ken ducked under the fist and hit the man in his stomach. He then quickly kicked the other guy away before he could ract. Growing up in the Satellite, Ken had learned to defend himself and fight, since if you couldn't, you probably wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is taking you two?\" another man asked as he walked into the garage. \"Huh?\" he said as saw his two henchmen lying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trying to steal my Duel Runner?\" Ken demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed. Here he was hoping to get away without much trouble, and here was this kid, getting in his way. Wondering what to do, a thought popped into his head. \"Tell you what. I want that Duel Runner, so lets make a deal.\" he said. \"I've got these parts. They're pretty new, so I'm sure they would help fix up that Duel Runner.\" he said, holding up a bag of parts that he had stolen earlier. \"If you beat me in a duel, I'll let you keep them. But if I win, you're Duel Runner will be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ken didn't need to agree to this deal. However, that didn't mean he wouldn't. He never passed up an opportunity to show off his skills. \"Winner take all, huh? You are on! Ken the Blade never turns down a challenge to duel\" he said, picking up the only working part of the Duel Runner, the Duel Disk. The Duel disk was a mix of blue and silver, and the area for the cards resembled a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel!\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Vick. And I'm gonna take the first move! Draw!\" he said as he drew. \"I'll summon Gene-Warped Warwolf in attack mode, and then I'll set two cards. Turn end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Now its my turn! Draw!\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then, what kind of deck does Ken run?</span></div></div>",

Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm gonna summon XX-Saber Boggart Knight in attack mode.\" Ken said and his monster appeared on the field. \"And when Baoggart Knight is normal summoned, he lets me special summon one level 4 or lower X-Saber monster from my hand. So I'll special summon X-Saber Pashuul!\" his second monster appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm tuning my level 4 Boggart Knight to my level 2 tuner, Pashuul!\" Ken said and Pashuul transformed into two green rings while Boggart Knight became 4 lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the clash of swords, a swift warrior arrives! A new blade is forged! Synchro summon! Slice through, XX-Saber Hyunlei!\" Ken called out, and a female warrior appeared on his field. \"Now, my Hyunlei's effect activates. When she is synchro summoned, she can destroy up to 3 spell or traps on my opponents field, so shes gonna take out those two you've got on the field right now!\" he said, and with great speed, Hyunlei rushed and cut through Vick's two face downs, Sakuretsu Armor and Magic Cylinder. \"And now shes gonna take out your Warwolf!\" he said, and Hyunlei sliced the beast in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen LP:4000<br>\r\nVick LP:3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll set one card face down and end my turn.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn. Draw!\" Vick said. \"Now, I'm gonna activate the spell card, Fissure! It destroys the monster with the lowet attack on my opponents field, and since Hyunlei is all you've got, thats her by default!\" A crack began to open in the ground, grow larger, and work its way towards Ken's monsters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my trap, Gottoms Emergency Call! When theres a face up X-Saber on the field, I can special summon up to two from my graveyard. So I'll summon back my Boggart Knight and Pashuul!\" Ken said, and his two previous monsters appeared. Pashuul was then engulfed in the crack and destroyed, and it closed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set my Fortress Warrior in defense mode. Turn end.\" Things weren't looking good for Vick. He was down life points and had only two cards left in his hand. However, he couuld still turn this arround, and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my turn now. Draw!\" Ken said as he picked up the top card of his deck. \"Now I'm gonna summon XX-Saber Emmersblade!\" he said and insect looking warrior appeared. \"Emersblade is gonna attack your monster!\" he said and his newest monster attacked Vick's defense monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortress Warriors effect allows it to survive one battle per turn.\" Vick stated as his monster remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then my Boggart Knight will destroy it!\" he said as his second monster attack and destroyed the monster. \"And now, Hyunlei attacks you directly!\" he said as his Synchro monster attack Vick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen LP:4000<br>\r\nVick LP:1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was grinning. He knew he had this duel won. He was still at full life points, and Vick was almost deffeated. However, Vck didn't seem worried at all. In fact, he looked like he was glad that he had taken so much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the effect of my Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness from my hand! When I take damage while I have no cards on my field, I can special summon him!\" Vick declared as a monster with 2700 attack appeared on his field. \"And because that damage was by a monsters attack,  I can summon one Emissary of Darkness token with attack and defense points equal to the damage I took!\" he added, and a monster with stats at 2300 appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, Ken set one card face down. I'll set a card, and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw.\" Vick said. \"I equip my Gorz with Axe of Despair, raising his attack by 1000! Now, Gorz will attack your Hyunlei, and my token will attack your Emmersblade!\" he said. Vicks two monsters did as commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen LP:1600<br>\r\nVick LP:1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Emersblade's effect activates! When its destroyed by battle, I can secial summon one level 4 or lower X-Saber from my deck to the field! XX-Saber Fulhelmknight in defense mode!\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. That won't help you. I'll nd my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ken looked at his hand, and decided to plan out his next move. He'd need to draw something good. \"My turn. Draw!\"</span></div></div>",

That day I left my two best friends, but not before promising to get them out of there.

You know his name don't you?<br>\r\nWell i won't bore you with a history lesson, any way. I got up, and did my best to tame my all together too messy dark brown, every one has always said that I look just like my father, who looked like his father. and it's true, i suposse save one thing, I have a shock of sky blue hair right in my bangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big sister!\" mark called as he came running in, \"guess what today is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I knew good and well what the day was, my birthday, but it was pretty fun to mess with mark,\"States day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? huh, well, hmm, Oh that's right! it's all saints day isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. \"Mark said laughing, \"It's your birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible I distincly remember having one last year.\" I replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday Sara.\" he said hugging me, \"I'm sorry i couldn't get you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged him back,\"It's all right mark,\" I replied, \"just so long as you're safe and happy,I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n'besides,' I thought,'today is the day that i get back what is rightfully mine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara ,Mark!\" Our uncle Jack called,\"it's time for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be right down uncle jack!\"<br>\r\nI sent mark down to help Uncle jack set the table, as they did i looked at an old photo of my mom, dad ,and my little brother and i. \"I'll get the company back dad.\" I said to the picture, \"you can count on that.\" I put on the necklace that I had gotten from my mom when I was eight years old, she told me that it had been my grandmothers, and that it had some special property to it. or at least it had. any way I looked at the list that i had made , I had compiled all of the false names, companys and industries that i had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Chi<br>\r\nAveriton card co.<br>\r\nReliatect inc.<br>\r\nAnthony Wheeler<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarko taylor<br>\r\nAmylee card co.<br>\r\nRebecca devlin<br>\r\nIngenious illusions.<br>\r\nEmma gardener<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKame Game shop (the only real one on the list)<br>\r\nAmamda bakura<br>\r\nIndigo design inc<br>\r\nBaily tallet<br>\r\nAbandon gaming co.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsidious tech industries.<br>\r\nSimplisttic design game company<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin namu<br>\r\nAlly muhad<br>\r\nColor of life inc.<br>\r\nKieth bandita<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral ncova<br>\r\nOregon Card players united.<br>\r\nRita Tyler<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilded Lilly tech inc<br>\r\nORiek tech comapny<br>\r\nOreck game shop<br>\r\nDartz Averaster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought it an amusing trick, though I had not bought the stock in that order, but by the time I finished the list I owned fifty four percent of the stock, and so far no one had made any plays for it. but I still thought about them, Yusie and Jack, when i heard that jack had come to new domino i had been thrilled, but when I saw that he was sponsord by goodwin. I couldn't believe how low my friend had fallen. I went down to breakfast, and found that my uncle jack had gotten me a gift, two gifts actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised your folks that i'd give these to you when you were old enough.\" uncle jack said as I opened the first gift, it was a dule disk, with an old deck, I looked at three cards on top and was shocked by what i saw...<br>\r\nthe blue eyes white dragons, everybody thought that these cards were lost to the ages. I opened the second package and found that it was my grandfathers trench caot that he was so famous for wearing when he dueled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if your gonna run a company, i may as well start you off right.\" my uncle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much uncle jack.\"i said hugging him, tears in my eyes.<br>\r\nAfter breakfast i set out to complete my master plan, and get goodwin the heck outta my company. I brought my grandfather's duel disk and deck with me for courage., my grandfather wouldn't be scared of rex goodwin, so I shouldn't have been either. I was almost at goodwins office when i ran into jack atlas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't expect to see you here.\" he said in genuine surprise, \"I thought that you were keeping your head down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not any more jack.\" I replied, \"truthfully i thought that you had forgotten me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked passed him,\"he's not in there you know.\" he said suddenly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then where is he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" he replied, \"I just know that he's geting ready for the duelist cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know when he'll get back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometime tonight.\"Jack said as I walked off, \"Oh, and you may want to know,Yusie is in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a laugh in his voice,he knew something,or had something planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back to the game shop, i was stopped by a chick with pink hair, it didn'take me long to realize that she wanted a fight. And it took me even less time to let her know that i had very little time for her, but we dueled none the less, and dueled right into a stalemate. that was when the sign appreared. it started like a slow burn on my right arm, and when I looked down i saw that it was a wing.<br>\r\nand I also saw that my mystery opponent had vanished.<br>\r\nI raced home somehow knowing hat if i was caught with this thing on my arm i'd be in some serious crap. <br>\r\nWhen i got home, i kept whet happened a secret and told my uncle jack that my plan had changed ever so slightly....<br>\r\nIf yusie was back in town it was doubtless that he'd get into trouble whether he meant to or not., and i thought i knew who would start trouble first.</span></div></div>",

And that was when it happened, the dragon came, a bright red dragon, what ever it was it set my mark to burning like fire. Almost as suddenly the sector security had arrived, and I knew now was the time to act, not just for my company but for my old friend. I donned my helmet and jumped on my runner, needing to get there before they hauled him away.<br>\r\n\"Let him go.\" I said in a voice of command that surprized the commander for a moment<br>\r\n\"What makes you think you can order me to do anything?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I own this arena, and the company that goes with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander looked like he didn't believe what he was hearing.<br>\r\n\"Impossible,\" he replied, \"Kiaba Corp is the property of Rex Goodwin.\"<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" I replied growing weary of this, \"I bought back that which was mine.\"<br>\r\n\"You... Who are you?\"<br>\r\nI removed my helmet, my brownish black and blond banged hair blowing slightly in the wind, \"I am Sarah Marie Kiaba, now let my duelist go, other wise I'll have to duel you. And I think we both know that you don't want that.\"<br>\r\n\"But th-that doesn't prove...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, sir...\"  a young corporal said uncertainly, \"M-Mr. Goodwin is-er- well...\" he handed the commander his cellphone.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.<br>\r\nSir! You can't be serious! You mean that this....<br>\r\nYes sir I understand sir, Yes sir, mr. atlas is here sir. Okay Sir, yes sir Ms Kiaba is still here. Yes sir right away sir.\"<br>\r\nHe handed me the phone.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" I said in a syrupy sweet voice that made Yusie grin and Jack almost vomit.<br>\r\n\"You got lucky this time and bested me in this round.\" He hissed<br>\r\n\"Please 'Director general.'\" I replied in a sarcastic voice, \"I've been on the winning side of this game for years, and we both know it.\"<br>\r\n\"And yet I'm still the one in charge of the city.\"<br>\r\n\"Regimes rise and fall everyday.\" I replied with an omious tone, \"Now it's late and I have a business to repurpose in the morning. If you could be a dear and be gone by tomorrow morning I'll be much obliged. Oh! and tell Mr. Ziczix that i would love to have him on my research team. G'bye!\"<br>\r\n\"Away with you security people I have no need of you and commander, tell Mr. Goodwin that if he makes a fuss, I can and will press charges against his duelist and have the rather scandleous vidoe televised.\"<br>\r\nThe commander grunted and walked off, and Jack had left with the security team as well.  So it was just me and my old friend.<br>\r\n\"Well, Yusie,\" I said, \"Shall we be off?\"<br>\r\nHe nodded, But why would you even take a risk for me?\"<br>\r\n\"'Cause I owed a stubborn Satalite friend a favor.\"<br>\r\nYusie smiled, \"Thanks Sarah.\" he said as we reved off.<br>\r\n'I just sorry it took so long.' I thought, as I waved off the exhaustion that was threatening to set in on me.</span></div></div>",
