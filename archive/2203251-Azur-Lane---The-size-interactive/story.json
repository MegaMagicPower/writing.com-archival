Although it initially came as a shock, naval fleets are not consisting of ships, but rather of girls, the size of ships! Luckily for you however, the girls have been relatively easy to work with, mostly thanks to your amazing charisma... because of this, most of them listen to you, but of course, not all of them would have the personality to listen to a tiny guy, who's barking commands at them. After your many years however, you have become a trusted friend to all of them, and some of the girls even developed a crush on their cute, little commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is; which nation have you been a commander of?</span></div></div>",

Shall we go?\" A giant silver-haired woman asked me as I was sitting on her shoulder, it being big enough to reliably hold me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel exhausted. Think we call it a day and return to office for now.\" I wrote last things to the report. Good having a giant secretary, no need to walk giant distances by myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, but where's my manners! You are probably really confused right now. My name is... Well, that one is not important, just call me \"Commander\". That's how everyone is calling me anyways... But I digress.<br>\r\nBack to the point. Most of you probably know that humanity has been in a constant war with Sirens for some time now. Alien invaders with unknown goals, who don't stop at anything to wipe us out. It's in history books now... Well, humanity is a tough nut to crack. Using salvaged enemy technology, we managed to create new weapon to counter this threat! Pretty nice, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe weren't prepared that this research would lead us to making a basically giant women with full armament to the boot. Neither did Sirens actually... We've been on offensive most of the time since then... Until some nations betrayed us of course, but that's a story for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls themselves are so terribly large, that even most buildings were absolutely tiny to them, and biggest girls were basically top-to-top to the biggest buildings. We had to build some incredibly large buildings to accommodate them. They had emotions like us, why should we treat them horribly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, we are still battling though. I'm a commander of one of the Azur Lane, our defense initiative. I'm also the only human on the base, thanks to bullins, the only normal sized maintenance ship girls. They did most of the hard work, while I was mostly focused on planning and mental work, and also combat preparations.<br>\r\nAnd that \"Giant silver-haired woman\" is Enterprise, my secretary, and most trusted girl in this entire fleet. I haven't been on base for too long, but the time I had was most well spent with her. She's literally the most capable ship here, and that she's absolutely gorgeous is a nice bonus. Not that it's the only thing I like in her, but that's important too! Yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, thinking to yourself again?\" She asked me while I was in my thoughts, which slightly startled me.<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah yeah, just was thinking if we haven't forgotten about anything.\" Dammit, I keep getting flustered when I talk to her...<br>\r\n\"You work too hard sometimes, commander. Try not to overstretch yourself.\" She turned the doorknob to a rather giant door, fitting for her. Well, back to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffice was indeed rather giant, but that was the only way to fit Enterprise, and well, any other girl inside with me. I still had a normal sized room here, of course, but I mostly was with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant form swiftly moved across the room, before falling on the couch, with a satisfied sigh. I admired her for a second, before raising my voice.<br>\r\n\"Well, finally time to relax?\" I asked with a smile, as she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a nice silent moment...</span></div></div>",

And yet here I am, commanding an entire fleet of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not as bad as you might think, they think and act pretty much as any normal girl. They also just so happen to all be tall enough that even the shortest ones are still the size a small building. And that\u2019s not getting into the fact there are so many of them, especially Fletcher and her numerous sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stampede of Fletcher sisters was always a sight that was both cute and terrifying. Cute because they were always asking me for some resolution to a childish problem and Fletcher\u2019s flustered attempts to get her sisters to calm down, and terrifying because I almost always nearly crushed by stampede of destroyers rushing to my desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whenever thinks got a bit hard to work with, Cleveland is usually close by to help me. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact she was a giant, we probably would\u2019ve cut the knot a long time ago. It wasn\u2019t a secret that we were close, and we occasionally took a few liberties on sorties when no one would notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr even when we were alone in the office. Nothing too dangerous, Cleveland wouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself if she caused me any major injuries. The first time she nearly squashed me was when I realized she truly was a gentle girl. A tall one that you could hear for miles away and would always be energetic, but still gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she was a very efficient secretary. Often filling out entire binders worth of paperwork in minutes. And when we both were done, occasionally flashing me a small glimpse of her toned stomach or tied panties. We both want to do something, but her size makes things so hard to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today started a bit differently, Cleveland arrived to my office in the middle of the day. And her outfit was also different from her normal blue jacket and skirt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the book. That's what I've always believed was the best thing to do. But never in my life would I have imagined just how difficult that task would become, back when I accepted the rank of naval commander for the most elite fleets of the Sakura Empire. Sure, the job comes with many perks, and I initially thought the job would've been an easy one when I heard that I would even get my own secretary... But upon first arriving at the naval fleet's dorm, I was in for a surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, the navy has an enormous secret... quite literally. The most powerful of ships aren't just powerful because of their firepower, nor do they maneuver so well because of some advanced steering system. No, the reason why these ships seem to be so unbeatable, is because of their nature. They aren't created like other ships, in fact, they aren't even made of iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust imagine how big the shock was, when I found out. All of a sudden I felt so small when I found myself surrounded by enormous girls. From the very first day, my life changed forever. A casual stroll through the hallway became so much more intense, simply by these girls trying to rush to wherever they needed to go. In the cafeteria I needed to be extremely cautious of my surroundings, in case a girl came and slammed down a bowl or plate right on top of me, or in case I'd get sucked up along with a stray noodle, that just happened to rush past me as the girls ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until she took care of me. From the very first day, Atago seemed to take a liking to me. She seemed to take care of my small form, and instead of letting me walk everywhere, she would carry me along to wherever I needed to go. She even instructed the navy to create a complex tunnel complex, exclusively for the commander to use; From here on out, I could easily move from point a to point b, without having to fear for my life. Needless to say that, because of her great care, I chose Atago to be my secretary ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur relationship only evolved from there, and Atago only became more flirty with each passing day. From day one, Atago had insisted that I started calling her 'big sis', and her care only became more motherly as time went by. She had made sure that my office would be in her own, and my desk was to be placed on her own. It definitely took some getting used to, being in that situation... From working on my own, I now constantly had this big, motherly beauty behind me, and I could swear that I could feel her golden brown eyes staring at me all the time. Every time I turned around, Atago would quickly move her gaze, or act as if she had been busy with something else for all this time. Her interactions with me became increasingly more flirty, and she would frequently say things that could be taken completely out of context, only to see my reaction. The result; Atago would, almost always, tease me for my beet red head, and my mumbling to get back to work. Her constant giggling, along with that wide smile of hers were so cute... Over time, I couldn't help but feel myself get attracted to her. But because of my work, I couldn't get myself to act on those emotions... until one day, Atago herself took the initiative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long day of work, I noticed that Atago was staring at me intently. Unlike any other day, her gaze wouldn't move when I faced her. I stared up at her questioningly, but before I could ask anything, Atago moved her face down towards me. As her golden brown eyes filled the sky, her breath washed over me like a hot, moist wind. Her sudden change in behavior got me startled, and I opened my mouth to ask her what was wrong... but before I could say anything, Atago's whispered voice washed over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't control myself anymore...\" Atago said, before her hands moved in on me from both sides. With a loud shriek, I tumbled over my own desk, and could only stare with fear striking my heart how her hands moved in on me. This was so different from any other time... Normally, Atago would make sure I was prepared to be picked up... but this time, she moved all on her own. To my relief however, Atago was very careful with me, and her hands gently cupped themselves around me. She then slowly lifted me off the table, and brought my tiny form up to her face. With my eyes wide open, I opened my mouth once more, and this time, my voice actually came out, be it while stumbling over my own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Atago? W...what's wrong?\" I asked, but Atago didn't reply. Instead, the giant girl's face came even closer, while her cheeks clearly started to light up. At this point, I had gotten so close, that the light of day started to get drowned out by Atago's head. With her hands cupped around me, and her face so close to my own, I could barely even make out what was above me, but I knew exactly where I was; Atago's full, soft lips were just mere centimeters aware from me... If I reached out my hand, I would've easily reached them. That's when Atago's warm breathe washed over me once more as she once again whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...commander... won't you become mine? You don't have to worry about a thing... I'll satisfy all your needs...\" Atago softly whispered, before her lips closed the remainder of the way. All of a sudden, I could feel Atago's lips wrap themselves around my whole body, and it was an experience unlike any other. They were extremely careful with me, as their soft flesh wrapped itself around me. I could feel the slight moist of them covering my body, while an extremely light sucking force pulled me deeper between them. This was, by far, the most intense kiss that I had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Atago lowered her hands once more, my face was as red as a lobster. In all my time around all of these giant girls, this had become somewhat of a fantasy of mine... but I just couldn't let that get in the way of my work. Although it pained me so much to have to say it... I refused Atago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't end there. Atago was clearly hurt by my refusal, but she said that she understood. That wasn't enough for her however, and from that day forth, the giant shipgirl did whatever it took to win me over. She started trying to find out about my deepest fantasies, but didn't stop fulfilling her duties... However from that moment on, I could count on it that even if I were alone, Atago would be right around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to today, and things haven't changed every since that day. Just like always, Atago seemed to be her flirty self, that tried to get you excited in just about any way she could think of. However today, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the moment that I walked into my office, I realized that something was different. I had only just walked through the small door that was fitted for me inside of the colossal door\u2019s framework, when my eyes rested upon Atago. Normally, she was a very quiet worker and didn\u2019t move around all that much, but with my tiny form still on the ground, and with a perfect view of Atago\u2019s legs underneath her desk, I noticed that her feet were a lot more restless then they normally were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my low perspective, I couldn\u2019t help but freeze in place, and watch how right in front of me, Atago\u2019s stocked left foot slowly dipped in and out of her high heel. Through the dark, yet transparent material of Atago\u2019s stocking, I could see just the faintest of glimmers from her well taken care of toenails every time they moved out of the confines of her high heel, and into the light of day, only for them to return right back into their confines, and out of sight. The mere sight of it caused my head to turn red slightly, when I noticed that Atago\u2019s golden brown eyes were staring down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, staring at big sis so early, commander?\u201d Atago said with a giggle, before she winked at me. Knowing fully well that she had been staring at me ever since I walked in, my red only turned redder. I knew that I had been caught. \u201cM\u2026mind your own business\u2026\u201d I shyly replied, as I walked further into the room, and to the ladder that had been fitted for me onto Atago\u2019s desk. It was a climb I had to make daily to get to my own desk, but it was worth it. Aside from feeling safer than on the ground, Atago\u2019s presence had always comforted me, knowing that someone I fully trusted was always right behind me, ready to take on any threat. Upon reaching the top, I casually crossed over Atago\u2019s desk, and headed to my own. During my crossing, I could still feel Atago\u2019s gaze upon me, while her eyes followed my every move. My head only turned redder, thanks to which I readjusted my hat, and kept my face hidden underneath. Quietly, I sat down behind my desk, and logged into my private computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, working was getting increasingly more difficult as I could feel Atago\u2019s gaze burning into my back the entire time. The sheer feeling caused my blush to never disappear, and it only got more intense from the sounds that were coming from behind me. I could constantly hear the fabric of Atago\u2019s stocking rubbing against the leather of her high heel, with an occasional \u201cclack\u201d as her heel got readjusted by Atago\u2019s playful foot. Every so often, she would rummage and move around behind me, only for her elbow to plant itself back onto the desk which caused a slight tremble from the wood underneath me. Although I tried my best to focus on my work, in these conditions it was nearly impossible; not only did I have this colossal beauty right behind me, I could feel her getting closer with each passing moment. However, things only became worse when Atago\u2019s voice suddenly came from behind once more. \u201cSo, about your browsing history\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words shook me to the core. Immediately I understood why Atago had been acting so differently all morning, and what she was trying to do. The thought of it terrified me, and almost immediately, I turned around, only for my fears to become much more of a reality then I ever wished for. At the edge of Atago\u2019s desk, the enormous ship girl had the opening of her stocking stretched out with one of her gloved hands, while her entire upper body was leaning over the desk. Atago\u2019s other hand was dangerously close, and it seemed like she had been waiting for me to turn around, as it instantly latched out towards me, and grabbed me by the ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud shriek, I was pulled off my chair and went sliding at a dazzling pace towards the edge of the desk. The opening of Atago\u2019s stocking came rushing towards me, and finally, I was pulled over the edge of the desk. Atago\u2019s hand came to a halt right above the open stocking, and due to being dangled by my foot, I stared right down into the nylon, dark confines. \u201cA\u2026Atago, what are you-?\u201d Before I could even finish my sentence, Atago let go of me, and I plummeted right into the see-through, nylon confines of her stocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was a long fall, my landing was soft when I dropped to the bottom of Atago\u2019s stocking. Initially landing in the heel, the nylon fabric cushioned my fall, before I tumbled right into the reinforced toe section of the piece of footwear. Only now I managed to really take in my surroundings and come realize my situation. It was a surreal sensation to be down here. All around me, I was surrounded by nylon, which both limited my view of the outside world, but also made it perfectly visible at the same time. I was hovering underneath Atago\u2019s desk, just barely at her ankles. At the same time, the warmth of Atago\u2019s body was well preserved in here and had made my surroundings quite warm\u2026 but it also trapped the smell incredibly well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I could feel myself swinging slightly, as Atago moved her chair, and with it, revealed her upper body that was previously hidden by the desk. Through the dark haze that was Atago\u2019s stocking, I could see that she was grinning down at me and a slight blush was visible on her cheeks. I opened my mouth to call out to her, but she was ahead of me. Atago spoke to me, but the tone of her voice was different. Instead of her normal, teasing tone, her tone revealed a sense of arousal. \u201cDon\u2019t worry commander, I\u2019m going to satisfy your needs\u2026 All. Of. Them\u2026~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wished that I could say anything back to Atago, but at this point, I was simply frozen with fear. Following her words, Atago lowered her stocking down onto the ground, causing my tiny form to land right in between her enormous high heels. At the same time, I could see Atago\u2019s enormous foot lift up into the air, before moving over to the opening of her stocking and angling itself down, ready to push itself inside. In my state of utter shock, I followed Atago\u2019s every move\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t until Atago pushed her foot in, that the realization kicked in that I had to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shipgirl\u2019s foot started to approach me, a scream of fear escaped my lips and my tiny form finally came to life. With my nylon prison still on the ground, the only impulse I had was to run as far away from Atago\u2019s foot as possible, but it wasn\u2019t long before the elastic fabric cocoon stopped me. All of a sudden, the very fabric on which I was standing was pulled back and angled itself upward, causing my tiny form to tumble. I landed facing Atago, and the realization set in that Atago had simply pulled the stocking further up her leg, which in turn caused it to dangle into the air once more. At this point, Atago was busy snapping my nylon confinement further up her leg, while her eyes were staring down at me from far above. Right in front of me, the behemoth that was Atago\u2019s foot wiggled it\u2019s five toes at me, while far above, Atago playfully winked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, I felt panic and fear welling up from deep within. I rolled onto my belly once more, only to see the ground disappear into the distance the further my prison got pulled up. Desperately, my hands dug themselves into the nylon mesh and with all my might, I attempted to pull apart the elastic fabric prison that I found myself in. With every attempt, the nylon mesh sprung right back into it\u2019s original form, and it didn\u2019t take long before I could feel Atago\u2019s toes prodding my back. My mind raced, and I desperately squirmed with all my might as Atago\u2019s toes overtook me. I screamed and yelled, I desperately tried to swat them away from me, but my confines were getting tighter as Atago finished putting on her stocking. Her upper body moved down, and she started to readjust the nylon mesh around her toes, causing the reinforced toe section to constantly snap itself against her enormous toes, before she pulled the nylon mesh perfectly snug around her foot. As a result, her stocking now formed itself around her toes and sole perfectly\u2026 pushing my tiny form firmly against her sole. For me however, the trap I found myself in rendered me completely motionless. Even if I attempted to move, the slightest bit of movement caused my limbs to be snapped right back against Atago\u2019s sole. The only thing I could do, was wait and see what Atago had planned for me\u2026 and pray to god that it wouldn\u2019t get more intense than this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what does Atago do, now that she has me right where she wants me?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to my first interactive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been a long time fan of the mobile game Azur lane, and since  I've not seen anything like this before, I figured that I would give this idea a try. Like some others, I've always fantasized that the girls in the mobile game Azur Lane are, like their names and weaponry imply, literally the size of boats. I wanted to bring this idea to a giantess interactive, and hope you like the idea as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Introduction:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a naval commander, you have the authority over a naval fleet in Azur lane. Unlike our world however, naval fleets consist of girls, the size of boats. Although this realization initially came as a shock to you, you have had this job for years now, and with time, the girls have gotten a liking to you, some even to the degree of falling in love with their adorable, little commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this interactive, you are a commander for one of the nations. Naval bases have all been built to scale to house the girls, meaning that you, as the commander, live in a large world. However, due to your post, the naval bases have been fitted with hallways, stairs, elevators and tiny doors, so you can move around uninterrupted from one ship's dorm room to another. Your workstation is a tiny desk on top of your secretary ship's desk, and of all of the ships, she is the closest to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Story flow rules: </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Once chosen a nation, you are liked by every ship in that nation.<br>\r\n2. Your secretary ship is the ship closest to you.<br>\r\n3. While in dorms, you can only encounter ships from that nation.<br>\r\n4. While out on missions, you will always be with your secretary ship.<br>\r\n5. Swapping nations is possible while you are out on missions.<br>\r\n6. Swapping nations is possible during 'political events', such as dances.<br>\r\n7. Another nation can take you hostage, or take you as a guest upon switching.<br>\r\n8. Upon changing nations, the ships do not know you, and may act crueler then your home nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Writing rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No futa or giants. Only ship girls!<br>\r\n2. Keep the personality of girls in consideration, try to be true to the personality of the girls in the game.<br>\r\n3. Do not sexualize young ships. This means <i>no sexual acts</i>! Accidental crushes / vore is fine however.<br>\r\n4. No excessive / graphic gore.<br>\r\n5. Vore is always deadly, unless the consumer spits you up.<br>\r\n6. Getting stepped on is always deadly, unless the girl is simply 'torturing' you.<br>\r\n7. In-shoe / stocking / sock is survivable, thanks to the softening of insoles / fabric.<br>\r\n8. You (as the commander) are quite durable after your many years with the girls.<br>\r\n9. Any chapters are to be written from a first person perspective.<br>\r\n10. 300 words per chapter minimum per addition.<br>\r\n11. Any giantess fetish is allowed, as long as they don't overstep the above boundaries.<br>\r\n12. If you wish to write a particular path as an addition to your chapter, write \"(reserved)\" as one of the pathing options, and name it after you are done writing it.</td>",
